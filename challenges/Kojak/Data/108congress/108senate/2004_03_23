Mr. President, last night there was an exchange between the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky and myself, pleasant as it always \nis between the two of us, regarding the overtime vote that we believe \nis essential to moving forward on this legislation that will be before \nthe Senate at 11 o'clock today. My friend, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, said we had voted on this once before.\n  I wanted to make sure what the facts were. There is no question that \nI was right. We did vote on it once before. We voted on it in the \nSenate and it passed by a nice margin. It was voted on in the House and \npassed by a nice margin. It was on the Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Magically, when it came back after the conference, it was stricken, \neven though it had passed both Houses of the legislature by a large \nmargin.\n  The point is, having had a vote on the overtime bill should not take \naway the fact that it was stripped in conference with Democrats not \nparticipating in the conference. We believe that overtime is important.\n  On my trip home last week, I visited fire stations and police \nstations. The first thing they talk about is: What is happening to our \novertime? People in America are concerned by the hundreds of thousands, \nif not millions. That is why we demand a vote on overtime.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, very briefly, my good friend from \nNevada and I discussed this last night and I listened carefully to what \nhe just said. I want to make one adjustment as we get the facts before \nour colleagues.\n  On the amendment to prohibit the Labor Department from going forward \nwith the 541 regulations, that was approved in the Senate. We voted on \nit earlier. It was not approved in the House. That is why it was a \nmatter in conference.\n  As my good friend from Nevada pointed out, it was subsequently not \nagreed to in the conference. There was an additional vote in the House \non a motion to instruct conferees, which came out the way my friend \nfrom Nevada suggests; but on the vote that counted, the House of \nRepresentatives did not approve the effort to block the Department of \nLabor from going forward with the overtime regulation.\n  As my friend from Nevada conceded, we have voted on this once and I \nam rather confident, given the persistence of Members on that side of \nthe aisle, at some point we will probably vote on it again. But this \nunderlying bill is a bill that is widely supported on both sides of the \naisle. Sanctions have already been imposed on March 1 on American\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\nbusinesses. I would like to see, and I know the majority leader would \nlike to see, and the vast majority of the Senate would like to see this \nbill approved so we can move on with other matters that will come \nbefore the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2948-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to talk this morning about a \ndisturbing pattern of conduct by the people around President Bush. They \nseem to be willing to do anything for political purposes, regardless of \nthe facts and of what is right.\n  I don't have the time this morning to talk in detail about all the \nincidents that come to mind. Larry Lindsay, for instance, seems to have \nbeen fired as the President's Economic Adviser because he spoke \nhonestly about the costs of the Iraq war. General Shinseki seems to \nhave become a target when he spoke honestly about the number of troops \nthat would be needed in Iraq.\n  There are many others, who are less well known, who have also faced \nconsequences for speaking out. U.S. Park Police Chief Teresa Chambers \nwas suspended from her job when she disclosed budget problems that our \nNation's parks are less safe, and Professor Elizabeth Blackburn was \nreplaced on the Council on Bioethics because of her scientific views on \nstem-cell research.\n  Each of these examples deserves examination, but they are not my \nfocus today. Instead, I want to talk briefly about four other incidents \nthat are deeply troubling.\n  When former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill stepped forward to \ncriticize the Bush administration's Iraq policy, he was immediately \nridiculed by the people around the President and his credibility was \nattacked. Even worse, the administration launched a government \ninvestigation to see if Secretary O'Neill improperly disclosed \nclassified documents. He was, of course, exonerated, but the message \nwas clear: If you speak freely, there will be consequences.\n  Ambassador Joseph Wilson also learned that lesson. Ambassador Wilson, \nwho by all accounts served bravely under President Bush in the early \n1990s, felt a responsibility to speak out on President Bush's false \nState of the Union statement on Niger and uranium. When he did, the \npeople around the President quickly retaliated. Within weeks of \ndebunking the President's claim, Ambassador Wilson's wife was the \ntarget of a despicable act.\n  Her identity as a deep-cover CIA agent was revealed to Bob Novak, a \nsyndicated columnist, and was printed in newspapers around the country. \nThat was the first time in our history, I believe, that the identity \nand safety of a CIA agent was disclosed for purely political purposes. \nIt was an unconscionable and intolerable act.\n  Around the same time Bush administration officials were endangering \nAmbassador Wilson's wife, they appear to have been threatening another \nFederal employee for trying to do his job. In recent weeks Richard \nFoster, an actuary for the Department of Health and Human Services, has \nrevealed that he was told he would be fired if he told Congress and the \nAmerican people the real costs of last year's Medicare bill.\n  Mr. Foster, in an e-mail he wrote on June 26 of last year, said the \nwhole episode had been ``pretty nightmarish.'' He wrote: ``I'm no \nlonger in grave danger of being fired, but there remains a \nstrong likelihood that I will have to resign in protest of the \nwithholding of important technical information from key policymakers \nfor political purposes.''\n\n  Think about those words. He would lose his job if he did his job. If \nhe provided the information the Congress and the American people \ndeserved and were entitled to, he would lose his job. When did this \nbecome the standard for our government? When did we become a government \nof intimidation?\n  And now, in today's newspapers, we see the latest example of how the \npeople around the President react when faced with facts they want to \navoid.\n  The White House's former lead counterterrorism adviser, Richard \nClarke, is under fierce attack for questioning the White House's record \non combating terrorism. Mr. Clarke has served in four White Houses, \nbeginning with Ronald Reagan's administration, and earned an impeccable \nrecord for his work.\n  Now the White House seeks to destroy his reputation. The people \naround the President aren't answering his allegations; instead, they \nare trying to use the same tactics they used with Paul O'Neill. They \nare trying to ridicule Mr. Clarke and destroy his credibility, and \ncreate any diversion possible to focus attention away from his serious \nallegations.\n  The purpose of government isn't to make the President look good. It \nisn't to produce propaganda or misleading information. It is, instead, \nto do its best for the American people and to be accountable to the \nAmerican people.\n  The people around the President don't seem to believe that. They have \ncrossed a line--perhaps several lines--that no government ought to \ncross.\n  We shouldn't fire or demean people for telling the truth. We \nshouldn't reveal the names of law enforcement officials for political \ngain. And we shouldn't try to destroy people who are out to make our \ncountry safer.\n  I think the people around the President have crossed into dangerous \nterritory. We are seeing abuses of power that cannot be tolerated.\n  The President needs to put a stop to it, right now. We need to get to \nthe truth, and the President needs to help us do that.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2948-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2948-S2952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to offer a unanimous consent \nrequest having to do with the CARE Act. I noted that a week ago the \nSenator from South Dakota, the Democratic leader, sent a letter \nsuggesting we should move forward on this legislation. I wanted to take \nhim up on his suggestion. I believe, as he says in his letter, it is \nimportant for us to take a piece of legislation that passed with over \n90 votes, has passed the House of Representatives, and give it the \nopportunity to be negotiated between the House and the Senate so we can \nget it to the President's desk in a timely fashion.\n  I want to put in the Record about a dozen articles, letters, and \npress releases from a variety of groups--everything from the United \nJewish Communities, to the Catholic Health Association, to the Farm \nBureau, to the National Conference of State Legislatures, all of which \nare asking to either put this legislation on the bill we have before us \nor, more preferably, get this bill to conference where we can work out \nthe differences.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this information be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    United Jewish Communities,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n           Charitable Giving and Social Services Block Grants\n\n\n   2004 Priority: Enact charitable giving tax incentives and restore \n              funding for the Social Services Block Grant\n\n        For decades, many Jewish organizations have partnered with \n     government to provide a wide range of social services for \n     people in need. In 2004, UJC has made it a priority to \n     support restoration of funding for Social Services Block \n     Grants and tax incentives for charitable giving as a way to \n     ensure and expand critical nonprofit services.\n        In 2003, both the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     overwhelmingly passed legislation that would create new \n     charitable giving tax incentives--specifically, IRA \n     charitable rollovers and tax deductions for non-itemizers. \n     Current tax law requires that\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\n     IRAs be fully taxed before they can be transferred to a \n     charity, substantially reducing both the amounts transferred \n     and the size of the contributor's tax deduction. The proposed \n     IRA rollover provision--in what is generally referred to as \n     the CARE legislation--would permit tax-free donation of IRAs \n     to charities. The non-itemizer provision would allow \n     individuals who do not itemize deductions on their tax \n     returns to receive a deduction for charitable gifts.\n        The Senate-passed CARE bill would also restore funding to \n     the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG); the House bill did \n     not include the SSBG funding increase. The SSBG provides \n     Federal grants to the States on a formula basis, which are \n     then allocated to local agencies. SSBG programming is \n     delivered through countless agencies that provide adult day \n     care, kosher Meals on Wheels and other nutrition programs, \n     employment training for the homeless, immigrants and \n     refugees, and counseling. SSBG is currently funded at $1.7 \n     billion--a cut of more than $1.1 billion since 1995. The \n     budget cuts have forced social services providers, including \n     Federation agencies, to discontinue services and reduce \n     benefits for families in need. The current shortfalls in \n     State budgets will make SSBG funding even more crucial over \n     the next few years.\n        The CARE legislation's new incentives for charitable \n     giving, as well as restoration of SSBG to its 1995 level of \n     $2.8 billion are vital to meeting the needs of the most \n     vulnerable members of our communities. UJC is working hard to \n     ensure passage of a CARE bill that would enable Federations \n     and other charitable non-profits to access new sources of \n     planned giving and restore vital SSBG funding.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 11, 2004.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We urge you to support an amendment by \n     Senators Santorum and Lieberman to attach the Charity Aid, \n     Recovery and Empowerment Act of 2003 (CARE Act) to S. 1637, \n     the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) Act. While we have \n     not taken a position on S. 1637, we see this as an \n     opportunity to pass the CARE Act.\n       The CARE Act, which the Senate has already approved by an \n     overwhelming 95-5 vote, will provide crucial assistance to \n     charities and the people they serve by restoring $1.3 billion \n     in funding to the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) program; \n     allowing non-itemizers to claim charitable deductions on \n     their taxes to spur additional private giving; creating a \n     Compassion Capital Fund to provide technical assistance and \n     capacity building for faith-based and community groups; and \n     authorizing $33 million to establish group maternity homes \n     for young mothers.\n       Restoring SSBG funding is especially crucial given the \n     state of the economy and the severe fiscal crises facing the \n     states. States use SSBG funding to assist community groups \n     and religious agencies that serve working families, abused \n     and abandoned children, persons with disabilities, and the \n     frail elderly.\n       We support these provisions in the CARE Act because they \n     are among the very few active legislative initiatives that \n     will help low-income families and the most vulnerable members \n     of our society. If enacted, they will strengthen the \n     partnership between government and religious and other \n     community groups to meet the basic human needs of all in our \n     country, a partnership that is demanded by the moral scandal \n     of so much poverty in the richest nation on earth.\n       We urge you to vote ``yes'' on the amendment to add the \n     CARE Act to S. 1637.\n           Sincerely,\n     Theodore Cardinal McCarrick,\n       Archbishop of Washington, Chairman, Domestic Policy \n     Committee, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n     Thomas A.

Roy Blunt,\n     Majority Whip, House of Representatives, Capitol Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Rick Santorum,\n     Chairman, Republican Conference, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Blunt and Senator Santorum: The \n     Alliance for Individual Development Account (IDA) Tax \n     Credits--a consortium of philanthropic organizations, \n     businesses, industry associations, and organizations of \n     elected officials created to champion tax credit legislation \n     for IDAs--is strongly committed to enacting needed tax \n     incentives to help working, low-income families save, build \n     assets and move into the financial mainstream. The Alliance \n     has been a consistent supporter of the Savings for Working \n     Families Act, which is Title V of S. 476, the CARE Act of \n     2003, as it will provide tax credits to create 300,000 IDAs \n     across the country. We also strongly support upcoming efforts \n     to finally begin conference deliberations of S. 476, and H.R. \n     7, the Charitable Giving Act of 2003, and encourage these \n     conference discussions to include the IDA provisions of S. \n     476 as part of any final agreement regarding S. 476 and H.R. \n     7.\n       IDAs are endorsed by President Bush and have received \n     considerable bipartisan support in the House led by \n     Representatives Joe Pitts and Charles Stenholm and in the \n     Senate by Senators Rick Santorum and Joe Lieberman, as these \n     policymakers recognize the importance of rewarding work, \n     savings, and self-reliance by low-income families and \n     individuals. Passage of Title V of S. 476 presents an \n     opportunity to enact sound asset-building tax policy for a \n     segment of our society that traditionally does not benefit \n     from existing wealth building, tax-based incentives.\n       IDAs are targeted, matched savings accounts held by \n     financial institutions and credit unions, which help low- and \n     moderate-income families and individuals buy their first \n     home, start a small business, or expand post-secondary \n     education.

This \n     amendment, offered by Senators Santorum and Lieberman, would \n     add the language of S. 476 (the CARE Act) which passed the \n     Senate 95-5 on April 9, 2003 into the underlying bill. The \n     CARE Act will enhance the role of faith-based and community \n     based organizations in the delivery of social services and \n     provide much needed technical guidance and assistance to \n     states without compromising the states' role in the \n     implementation of social services to people in need. The CARE \n     Act reflects a thoughtful and harmonized approach to the \n     inclusion of faith-based organizations in providing services \n     at the state level.\n       It is laudable that the CARE Act increases funding for the \n     Social Services Block Grant (SSBG). The SSBG is an essential \n     source of funds for community and home-based services to the \n     most vulnerable segments of our society including the \n     disabled, elderly and children. We cannot expand the role of \n     faith-based and community programs without increasing the \n     funds available for these programs. We support the Individual \n     Development Account provisions, as such accounts are an \n     important tool to promote self-sufficiency that will \n     complement state efforts to reform welfare. We are especially \n     pleased to see that the CARE Act provides funding to states \n     for seed money and for technical assistance to the states to \n     support administering the provisions of the bill. NCSL \n     greatly appreciates Senators' Santorum and\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\n     Lieberman commitment to this legislation and their \n     willingness to work with NCSL to resolve our outstanding \n     issues.\n       We support the CARE Act and urge you to vote for Amendment \n     2670 during floor considerations of the JOBS Act. For further \n     information about NCSL's position, please contact Sheri \n     Steisel, Federal Affairs Counsel and Director, Human Services \n     Committee or Tamra Spielvogel, Policy Associate, State-\n     Federal Relations in NCSL's Washington, DC Office at 202/624-\n     5400.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Martin R.

Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I'm writing to you today because \n     times are desperate for the food banks in South Dakota. We \n     need your help in the passage of important legislation \n     pending before the Senate. In tens of thousands of local food \n     pantries, soup kitchens and emergency shelters the lines of \n     needy Americans requesting short-term food assistance are \n     increasing. These increasing lines of needy families include \n     the faces of the working poor, the recently unemployed and \n     children. As these lines grow, I continue to hear from our \n     member food banks what sounds like a broken record: ``there's \n     more requests for food, and it's hard to keep pace.''\n       Last year, you joined 94 other Senators in the common call \n     that we need the CARE Act now more than ever. Now, America's \n     emergency food providers are asking you to continue your \n     strong commitment to America's hungry by supporting an \n     amendment to the JOBS Act, S. 1637, which would allow the \n     provisions of the Senate-passed Charity, Aid, Recovery and \n     Empowerment Act of 2003 (the CARE Act, S. 476/H.R. 7) to move \n     forward.\n       As you know, the CARE Act includes a strong food donation \n     tax incentive provision that we estimate will create more \n     than 878 million new meals over the next 10 years, much of \n     that food coming from farmers, ranchers, and small \n     businesses. The need for this tax law change is urgent. \n     Today, the USDA estimates that nearly 96 billion pounds of \n     food in the United States is wasted, dumped, plowed over or \n     destroyed. If even one percent of that food was donated, \n     rather than dumped, we would be able to feed hundreds of \n     thousands more needy Americans. Simply put, we have a strong \n     moral obligation to stop the waste, and get this food on the \n     tables of the people who desperately need it.\n       Passage of Senate Amendment 2670 is critical for the \n     emergency food providers in DC and the America's Second \n     Harvest nationwide network of food banks and food rescue \n     organizations working so hard to encourage food donations \n     within the food industry. The provisions in the Santorum-\n     Lieberman amendment are very important to companies trying to \n     decide how to dispose of their surplus food.\n       We're hoping we can continue to count on you to make sure \n     this amendment is adopted and the CARE Act becomes law. Thank \n     you for consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Robert Forney,\n\n                                                President and CEO,\n     America's Second Harvest.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\nStatement by Bob Stallman, President, American Farm Bureau Federation, \n                         Regarding the CARE Act\n\n       Washington, D.C., March 11, 2004.--``Congress can provide \n     important hunger-relief assistance by enacting the CARE Act \n     of 2003. The legislation has been adopted by both chambers, \n     endorsed by President Bush, and is awaiting conference.\n       If enacted, the law would create incentives to allow all \n     farmers and ranchers to deduct the costs and value of food \n     donated to hunger-relief charities, regardless of how their \n     farming business is organized. This will enable us to get \n     more food to hungry people who can't afford to feed their \n     families. The CARE Act would increase the amount of food \n     provided to needy people by an estimated 878 million new \n     meals over the next 10 years.\n       Passage of the CARE Act could not come at a better time. \n     The American Farm Bureau Federation and America's Second \n     Harvest just completed a successful year of activity with a \n     program called ``Harvest for All.'' Throughout the year, \n     farmers across the nation donated food, funds and people \n     power with the goal of creating a hunger-free America. Both \n     organizations, in partnership with Syngenta, are working \n     together to ensure that every American can enjoy the bounty \n     produced on American farms and ranches. Those efforts will be \n     greatly enhanced by enactment of the CARE Act.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               March of Dimes,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 2004.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Democratic Leader Daschle: On behalf of more than 3 \n     million volunteers and 1400 staff members of the March of \n     Dimes, I am writing to urge you to vote for Senate Amendment \n     2670 to S. 1637, the Foreign Sales Corporation/\n     Extraterritorial Income (FSC/ETI) bill. This amendment \n     provides much needed tax incentives to encourage charitable \n     giving.\n       As you know, many of America's charities are facing \n     heightened financial challenges due to the soft economy and \n     increasing reliance on services offered through community \n     based programs. Tax incentives to encourage increased \n     charitable giving are needed now more than ever. The March of \n     Dimes strongly supports the following two provisions that we \n     believe will stimulate additional charitable donations and \n     create greater equity in the tax code:\n       Creation of a charitable tax deduction for individuals and \n     couples who do not itemize on their tax returns; and\n       An IRA Charitable Rollover provision that would allow \n     donors who are at least 59\\1/2\\ to rollover amounts from a \n     traditional or Roth IRA to create a life income gift and \n     donors who are at least 70\\1/2\\ to be eligible to rollover \n     amounts as direct gifts.\n       If enacted, these provisions would benefit the March of \n     Dimes and other charities that rely on small donations, by \n     creating incentives for current donors and encouraging others \n     to become donors. The donations stimulated by these changes \n     in the tax code would provide increased resources for \n     expanding the Foundation's investment in cutting-edge \n     research, widening the distribution of education materials \n     aimed at preventing birth defects and infant mortality, and \n     increasing support of community-based programs to improve \n     birth outcomes.\n       March of Dimes volunteers and staff in every state as well \n     as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico stand ready to \n     work with you to secure enactment of this important \n     amendment. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                       Marina L. Weiss, Ph.D.,\n\n                              Senior Vice President, Public Policy\n     and Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      America's Blood Centers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2004.\n     Senator Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We are writing to ask that you allow \n     the Charity, Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment Act of 2003 (CARE \n     Act--S. 476) and the Charitable Giving Act of 2003 (H.R. 7) \n     to go to a conference committee. Members of America's Blood \n     Centers, such as United Blood Services of South Dakota and \n     Siouxland Community Blood Bank, which together support the \n     blood needs of all South Dakota patients, strongly endorse \n     this legislation and specifically support a provision \n     contained in both bills that corrects an inequality by \n     extending to not-for-profit independent community blood \n     centers certain exemptions from the Federal excise tax.\n       In spite of their importance in maintaining America's \n     volunteer donor blood supply, community-based blood centers \n     do not enjoy the same status as the Red Cross blood centers \n     under the Federal tax code. Even though the Red Cross is \n     exempt from paying Federal excise taxes for its blood-related \n     activities and functions, America's independent, community-\n     based, not-for-profit blood centers are not. These taxes \n     directly impact the ability of blood centers to provide \n     mobile blood collections, conduct telerecruiting of donors, \n     and engage in other similar activities. The tax exemption \n     will significantly help our centers and other community-based \n     blood centers by allowing us to allocate more of our funding \n     to what we do best--collecting blood for the millions of \n     Americans who rely upon us.\n       The differences between the House and Senate versions of \n     the charitable giving bills are small. Now is the time to \n     take the steps needed to turn this legislation into law. \n     America's Blood Centers strongly urge you to support a \n     successful conference and quick passage of this legislation \n     to level the playing field among blood collection \n     organizations and demonstrate your strong support for the \n     importance of independent, community-based, not-for-profit \n     blood centers. Please contact ABC's CEO Jim MacPherson \n     (jmacpherson@americasblood.org); 202-654-2902 if you have any \n     questions. We appreciate your attention to this concern and \n     thank you in advance for your responsiveness.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Louis Katz, M.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is a bill that has been a \nbipartisan bill. The Senator from South Dakota has mentioned on \nnumerous occasions, and again in this letter, that the concern is--and \nin the newspaper article--that things have been put in conference that \nwere not either the scope of the conference or slipped in without the \nminority's knowledge of what was going to happen.\n  I just ask the Senator from South Dakota and all those who are \nobjecting to this bill going to conference to look at the history of \nthis legislation.\n  The history of this legislation has been bipartisan. Senator Joe \nLieberman and I have worked to put this bill together. It has \npriorities on the Democratic side. It has priorities\n\n[[Page S2951]]\n\non the Republican side. We have worked to take out everything that \ncould be controversial.\n  At a press conference we had the other day, Senator Lieberman said \nthis bill is simply all good. There is not anything bad or \ncontroversial. There is not any kind of strong opposition to this bill \non either side of the aisle. If there was strong opposition on either \nside of the aisle, it would not be in this bill. We have a bill that \nprovides money to those who are serving those in need in our society. \nWe have a bill on which the track record through the Finance Committee \nand through the Senate floor has shown we have worked together.\n  Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus have worked together in committee \nto pass a bill unanimously out of that committee, on a bipartisan \nbasis. When it came to the floor, there were concerns. We were able to \ntake care of those concerns and pass a bill. I believe it was 95 to 5.\n  As we were going through the passage, we had some concerns as to some \nthings the House might be interested in putting in this bill, some \nfaith-based provisions some Members on the Democratic side had concerns \nabout. We received a letter from the House saying they had no intention \nof doing that. In a sense, we were able to preconference some of the \nconcerns to make sure we were trying to pass something good and helpful \nto those agencies and individuals wanting to help people in need in our \nsociety. At a time when many in this Chamber are clamoring about those \nwho are falling through the cracks, this is an opportunity for us to \nget literally billions of dollars, some of it Government money but most \nof it contributed by individuals, to groups which get favorable tax \ntreatment for doing so.\n  We set up individual development accounts, which has been a high \npriority of Senator Lieberman, Senator Feinstein, myself, and others on \nboth sides of the aisle. We have a laundry list of very positive things \nthis legislation does, and we have a history of bipartisan cooperation.\n  With some of the other legislation that may have been brought \nforward, I understand why the Senator from South Dakota may say, well, \nI do not want to take the chance, let's say, of the FSC bill, for \nexample, or something going to conference; we do not know what is going \nto go on there and there may have been controversies around it.\n  There has been no controversy around this bill. Other bills have \npassed and gone to conference we did not have great controversy about, \nwe had a broad consensus about, and they were allowed to be worked out. \nFor some reason, this was the first one grabbed and it has been held on \nto now for quite some time.\n  One final thing. Senator Frist, the leader, and I have given a \ncommitment the Democrats will be fully involved in this conference; \nthere will be no backdoor meetings because, candidly, Senator Lieberman \nand I have worked hand in glove on this. We continue to work hand in \nglove, as have Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley.\n  We will continue to work with our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle because we believe it is so important to get done. I believe \nbasically the four corners of the bill are fairly well established. It \nis now working on how we do it.\n\n  Another thing that shows bipartisan cooperation is we have actually \nbeen working on a bipartisan basis on offsets. I know the Democratic \nleader has been rather insistent about having the tax provisions \noffset. We have been working, again in a bipartisan manner, on the \nFinance Committee. I know Senator Lieberman and myself have been trying \nto find offsets to get this bill in a position to get strong bipartisan \nsupport. I would make the point there may be instances in which the \nDemocratic leader can justifiably say there has not been a cooperative \nventure in getting a bill through the Senate and we are hesitant about \ntaking a bill to conference because of that. That has not been the case \non this bill.\n  The Senator has the commitment from the leader and myself that it \nwill not be the case in conference, and I am hopeful that word and the \ntrack record of this bill will have some influence over the Democratic \nleader's decision to allow this bill to move forward in the process so \nwe can get a good negotiation going with the House of Representatives \nto get this done.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 7\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 7, the charitable giving bill. I further ask \nunanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken, that \nthe Snowe amendment and the Grassley-Baucus amendment which are at the \ndesk be agreed to en bloc; that the substitute amendment which is the \ntext of S. 476, the Senate-passed version of the charitable giving \nbill, as amended by the Snowe and Grassley-Baucus amendments, be agreed \nto; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; further, that the Senate \ninsist upon its amendments and request a conference with the House; and \nlastly, that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees with a ratio \nof 3 to 2, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \nrespond to the Senator from Pennsylvania by saying there are two \nissues. One is process and the other is substance. I think there is \nample opportunity for us to agree on substance. The distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania and I have talked on a few occasions in \nrecent weeks about this matter and it comes down to two questions: the \nsocial services block grant and the importance we place on fully \nfunding it, and the need for offsets to the tax provisions in this \nlegislation.\n  We agree there should be tax provisions. We agree there should be an \nSSBG provision. What we have not agreed to is how we resolve ways in \nwhich to fully fund them and to offset the costs involved with the tax \nprovisions of the bill. That is a substantive question.\n  Then there is a procedural question. The Senator from Pennsylvania \ncontinues to insist the only way to resolve the procedural issue is by \nforcing this bill to conference. As I have said to him on several \noccasions, we are very reluctant without the concurrence of the House \nleadership that there will be the kind of bipartisan participation we \nneed to resolve these issues in a fair way. He has given his assurance, \nbut he has also indicated to me privately he cannot commit for the \nHouse, and I understand that. I would not expect him to.\n\n  We have done a lot of work between the House and the Senate in the \nlast two Congresses in the way I have proposed we resolve these issues. \nWe send the bill over to the House. The House deals with the \namendments. We preconference or we negotiate the amendment and either \nthrough conference or a final ratification of the bill the legislation \nis sent to the President.\n  We have actually resolved our differences with the House without a \nconference on 51 occasions during the 107th Congress, and already this \nyear we have resolved our differences with the House on 19 occasions on \na whole array of bills: the veterans benefits bill, the Healthy Forest \nAct last year, the Syrian Accountability Act, the military tax bill. \nAll of these issues have been preconferenced and resolved in a way that \nhas allowed us to work through our differences, with the assurance we \nwould have the kind of involvement and participation I expect and all \nof our colleagues expect with regard to the conferencing or the working \nout of the differences between the two versions. I ask unanimous \nconsent that we simply remove references to the conference in the \nrequest made by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania so we can \ndo what we have done on 19 occasions so far in this Congress: Send the \nbill to the House, let us resolve our differences through negotiation, \nand send the bill to the President, as we all want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania so modify \nhis request?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No, Mr. President, I do not. I ask that my unanimous \nconsent be acted upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. With the objection raised by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, I, too, would have to object.\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am very disappointed we cannot get \nagreement. As the Senator from South Dakota said, there are two major \nissues. They are not particularly complex issues, but they are ones in \nwhich I think it is important for us to be in a position to be able to \ndrive to a resolution. There has been no talk about extraneous matters \nbeing brought in. This is simply the four corners of this bill trying \nto be worked out. The way we have done it historically in this Congress \nand previous Congresses is to sit down with both bodies in a conference \nand work it out. I am very disappointed we do not have the opportunity \nto get that done for this very important bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I want to make sure the record is clear. We have not \nactually resolved our differences in the House on a majority of \noccasions through conference. We have actually done the opposite. We \nhave done what I have suggested we do with this bill. On 51 occasions \nin the 107th Congress and on 19 occasions so far in the 108th Congress, \nwe have not gone to conference. We have resolved these matters by \nsending the bill to the House and worked on legislation either in \npreconference or through negotiation. I am fully prepared to do that \nagain in this case and look forward to working not only with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania but others who want to see this legislation \npassed as I do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2952-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The minority used no time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is what the clock reads.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has used 30 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the time Senator \nDaschle used was under leader's time. We have some speakers on our \nside. We know you have speakers on your side. I think it is pretty \nclear, based on the conversation on the floor last evening and today \nbetween Senator McConnell and this Senator, that not much is going to \nhappen on the bill today.\n  I ask if the Senator from Alaska wishes to have morning business in \naddition to what is now left? We would be happy to agree to that. We \nhave three Senators on our side who wish to speak in morning business.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the floor management check \nwith the leader, to see if there is any objection to restoring the \nconcept there be 1 hour equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. I am confident that if there is some problem at a \nsubsequent time we will be happy to take that time away, because I am \nconfident it would not be. So I ask there be--let's make it 11:15, an \nextra 2 minutes, and the time be equally divided?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I support that and ask unanimous consent that be the \ncase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would just yield for one other unanimous \nconsent request, on our side we have three speakers. We have Senators \nSchumer, Dorgan, and Carper on our side--I am sorry, Senators Schumer, \nWyden, Dorgan--and Senator Carper also wishes to speak. I ask the time \nbe equally divided among those four Senators on our side, in the order \nI have just announced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding the first half of \nthis 1-hour period is under the control of the majority; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2952-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2952-S2954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Energy Committee has introduced a \nrevised energy bill. Swift passage of this bill is vital. We should not \nunderestimate the widespread and important consequences that this \ncomprehensive energy legislation will have for the future of our \nNation.\n  American citizens and businesses rely on our ability to stabilize \nenergy prices and provide them with the energy resources they need. \nNow, in the post-9/11 world, our energy development and production has \ntaken on an additional level of importance. Our national security is \ndependent upon our ability to decrease our reliance on foreign energy \nsources, particularly from unstable or unfriendly regimes.\n  The comprehensive energy policy embodied by this new bill is also \ncritical for ensuring our economic growth. High energy prices impact \nour economy in many ways, and our ability to stabilize energy prices \nwill have far-reaching consequences for our overall economic health and \ngrowth.\n  The United States is recovering from a recession, but this recovery \nis threatened by sustained high energy prices which will increase real \ninterest rates, the rate of inflation, and reduce gross domestic \nproduct growth.\n  This first chart shows that situation. I call it to the attention of \nthe Senate. As crude oil prices go up, there are changes in our gross \ndomestic product. We have seen these effects firsthand already. High \nenergy prices, which rose 4.7 percent in January and another 1.7 \npercent in February, greatly contributed to an increase in consumer \nprices. The Department of Labor recently announced that those prices \njumped .3 percent in February and another .5 percent in March. \nConsumers are paying more for food, goods, and energy bills. High \nenergy prices are essentially acting as a consumer tax, leaving \nAmericans with less disposable income for travel, home buying, \nrestaurants, retail establishments, and daily living.\n  Record high gasoline prices only intensify this problem. Gasoline \nprices rose 8.1 percent in January and an additional 2.5 percent in \nMarch. Last week the average price at the gas pump reached $1.72 per \ngallon, with California leading at an average of $2.10 at the pump. \nThese prices are an additional constraint on the consumer spending \npower. For every 1 cent increase at the pump, we see $1 billion lost in \nconsumer spending capability.\n  The rise in fuel prices also greatly impacts our aviation and \ntrucking industry. Our airline industry has lost over $25 billion in \nthe last 3 years. Sustained high jet fuel costs of $1 per gallon, which \nis double that of 1998-1999, continues to hamper the health of our \ncritical transportation industry. High energy prices also prevent job \ncreation for the transportation sector. The Air Transport Association \nestimates for every $1 increase in the price of fuel, they could fund \n5,300 airline jobs. The increase in these prices is staggering.\n  Every homeowner in America feels the pressure of high energy prices. \nHome heating costs for the 2002-2003 season were up 12 percent for \nnatural gas, 7 percent for propane, and 2 percent for electricity. This \nwinter alone, natural gas prices were 60 percent higher than last \nyear--60 percent higher than last year. Estimates show that consumers \nmay pay more than $200 billion this year in energy costs. This is an \nenormous and unnecessary burden on our economy.\n  Overall, it is estimated that since 2000 consumers paid $111 billion \nmore than they did in the previous 3 years for natural gas alone. This \nincrease cost industrial consumers $57 billion, commercial customers \n$21 billion, and residential consumers $33 billion.\n  This second chart shows that situation. We have had job losses \nthroughout the country because of this change in energy prices. Look at \nthat: In California alone, 250,000 jobs. It has had an amazing impact. \nHigh energy prices have had a devastating impact on American jobs. \nSince 2000, when the energy crisis began, we have lost 2.9 million jobs \nrelated to the cost of energy. Sustained high energy prices have the \npotential to lower our gross domestic product, which could cost the \nU.S. an\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\nadditional 770,000 to 2.7 million jobs. The jobs issue is an energy \nissue. If we want to deal with the jobs issue, we must pass the energy \nbill.\n  The industrial energy consumers of America have stated that high \nenergy prices, most in natural gas, contributed to the loss of almost \n2.8 million manufacturing jobs. Chart No. 3 deals with this problem. \nSince 1982, jobs in the oil and gas industry have declined by one-half, \nfrom over 700,000 jobs to roughly 330,000 jobs.\n  As chart No. 4 shows, the chemical industry lost jobs. As gas prices \ngo up, the number of chemical industry jobs goes down. The price of \nenergy is directly related to the loss of jobs in this country.\n  Since 2000, our chemical industry has lost 85,000 jobs. This industry \nemploys more than 1 million Americans, and 5 million Americans have \njobs that depend upon the chemical industry. More of these jobs are \nthreatened as major chemical companies across the United States are \nclosing their factories and moving to countries which provide cheaper \nnatural gas.\n  This jeopardizes millions of well-paying American jobs that will not \nbe replaced unless we have energy. Moving these industries offshore not \nonly contributes to job losses but it increases our burgeoning trade \ndeficit. Our chemical industry once was a major exporter, generating a \n$16 to $18 billion trade surplus. Last year the chemical industry \ngenerated a trade deficit of $9.6 billion, contributing to an overall \nU.S. trade deficit of over $530 billion. That deficit, too, is related \nto energy availability and the cost of energy.\n  High energy prices are threatening our fertilizer industry. Up to 90 \npercent of the cost of producing fertilizer is directly linked to the \ncost of natural gas. Between 2001 and 2003, eight U.S. nitrogen \nfertilizer manufacturers permanently closed. That is one-fifth--20 \npercent--of all the United States fertilizer production. Additionally, \nour ammonia factories are operating at 60 to 65 percent capacity. Why? \nBecause of the cost of natural gas.\n  The impact of high energy prices is acutely felt by the agriculture \ncommunity. The energy costs account for 6 percent of farm production \ncosts. Farmers spent between $1 and $2 billion more this year to plant \ncrops. In 2003, farmers paid $350 per ton for fertilizers, more than \ntwice what they paid just 1 year previously. That is a 100-percent or \nmore increase in the cost of fertilizer in 1 year.\n  The good news is a worsening crisis is avoidable. The United States \nhas the natural resources to increase our energy supply. But \ninconsistent Government policies discourage exploration, development, \nand the use of our own natural resources--our own energy resources.\n  Over 95 percent of undiscovered oil and 40 percent of undiscovered \nnatural gas is located on Federal land. These public resources can \nsecure our energy needs. Today the Government encourages use of natural \ngas but discourages exploration and development of domestic natural \ngas. As a result, most major energy companies, including some which \noperate in my own State of Alaska, are abandoning the United States and \ninvesting in and developing energy resources in other countries.\n  A recent article shows while the 4 major oil and gas companies \nrealized $21 billion in cashflow from their U.S. oil and gas \nactivities, they only reinvested $9.15 billion back into the United \nStates. Less than half of the money they paid was invested here to \nincrease the supply of gas.\n  This lack of reinvestment makes us dependent on foreign sources of \nenergy from unstable or unfriendly regimes. More and more we are \ndependent on foreign sources.\n  This industry generates jobs and revenues in other countries at our \nown expense. These new jobs should be American jobs and that energy \nroyalty income should be coming into our Government. The receipts \ngenerated by that economic activity would help reduce the deficit, \nprovide new jobs, fund the war on terror, and support many of the \ndomestic programs we cannot fully fund.\n  Despite the obvious benefits of domestic energy exploration and \ndevelopment, today we rely on foreign imports for over 60 percent of \nour oil supply. Imagine that. It was about 33 percent at the time of \nthe embargo on oil in the 1970s. Now it is over 60 percent. We are 60 \npercent reliant on foreign oil, and more people oppose the development \nof the oil resources on the North Slope of my State. Currently, we also \nrely on 16 percent for foreign sources for our natural gas supply. \nEnergy imports make up the largest portion of our foreign trade \ndeficit.\n\n  This is chart No. 5. It shows the natural gas consumption outlook. In \nthe last 10 years, demand for natural gas has increased by 19 percent, \nand that number is projected to grow by 50 percent in the next 25 \nyears. Absent a new supply of natural gas, we will likely see a gap of \n15 billion cubic feet per day or 6 trillion cubic feet per year in the \nnext 10 years.\n  This chart shows the difference between our consumption and the \nprojection into the future. We are growing more reliant on foreign \nsources for our natural gas. We are already 60 percent reliant for oil. \nThis chart shows that as the years go by we are going to be more \nreliant on foreign sources for natural gas. It will be expensive \nnatural gas. It has to be gasified, transported in cryogenic tankers, \nand then regasified when it gets here. Our own natural gas is pumped \nout of the ground and shipped in a pipeline. The costs associated with \nforeign reliance are going to be staggering. That means more American \njobs lost.\n  The Natural Petroleum Council found that to bridge this gap, $1.2 \ntrillion dollars must be invested in new exploration and production in \nthe United States by 2025. Unless we pass an energy bill to bring \ncertainty to American energy policy, that investment will not take \nplace. I repeat: Unless this bill is passed, there will be no new \ninvestment in the production and development of oil and gas resources \nin the United States.\n  The high impact of energy prices can be seen at all levels of our \neconomy. High energy prices have produced job losses, trade deficits, \nand constraints on consumer spending and economic growth. But the most \ndisturbing aspect of this problem is the fact that Congress has been \ndebating comprehensive legislation since 2001. I don't think we have \npassed a real energy bill in 12 years. We are squabbling here in \nCongress while high energy prices burn our economy and destroy American \njobs.\n  In April of 2002, the Senate passed H.R. 4, the Energy Policy Act of \n2002, by a vote of 88-11. Then the bill died in conference.\n  In July of 2003, after months of intensive debate, the Senate passed \nH.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2003. However, in November of that \nyear the Senate rejected cloture by a vote of 57-40, 3 votes short of \nhaving an energy bill.\n  We were elected as public officials to improve the lives of American \npeople, to enact laws and to formulate policies designed to ensure the \nstrength and economic viability of our Nation. By failing to enact a \ncomprehensive energy policy for our Nation, we have failed the American \npeople. American businesses and citizens are struggling out of \nrecession and meaningful and sustainable economic recovery. Job \ncreation will only come with stable energy prices, and they will come \nonly if we pass an energy bill and send it to the President.\n  A comprehensive energy policy is necessary to secure domestic energy \nsecurity and to support American jobs. Given the negative impact of \nhigh energy prices on our Nation, we should act quickly to address this \nsituation.\n  As I said, the Energy Committee has introduced a revised energy bill \nwhich encompasses a comprehensive and balanced natural energy policy. \nThis bill will increase domestic energy supplies, encourage energy \nconservation, stabilize energy prices, bring certainty to American \nenergy policy for our businesses and consumers, and ensure our energy \nsecurity. It contains provisions designed to increase oil and gas \nexploration and development, while at the same time promoting energy \nconservation and alternative and renewable energy resources. This bill \nis a jobs bill. It will create more than 800,000 new jobs. Many of \nthose jobs will be the result of a major component of this energy bill, \nwhich is authorization for the building of the Alaska natural gas \npipeline.\n\n  Our gas pipeline will create over 400,000 jobs in and of itself, \nincluding 7,000 construction jobs, thousands of manufacturing jobs \nnecessary to create\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\nequipment, and thousands of infrastructure jobs. It will meet \napproximately 10 percent of our country's natural gas needs. Over 4 \nbillion cubic feet per day will come from Alaska to decrease our \ndependence on foreign gas and imports of liquefied natural gas. It will \ngenerate over $40 billion in revenue for the American Government, \ninstead of sending that money overseas.\n  Chart 7 shows the 800,000 energy bill jobs. The renewable fuel \nstandard provision of this new bill will create in and of itself \n214,000 new jobs. It is estimated this provision will increase farm \nrevenue by $51 billion over the next 10 years. This reduces the overall \nfarm payments currently expended by the Federal Government by $5.9 \nbillion.\n  In a time when the Federal budget deficit is increasing, it is \nincredibly important we find some cashflow to offset this spending.\n  I am still convinced unless Congress acts to ensure greater domestic \nproduction of our oil resources, our energy security is jeopardized.\n  Given the importance of Congress enacting a comprehensive energy \npolicy this year, I urge the Senate to move swiftly to pass this Energy \nbill. I can think of not one thing the Senate can do to assist the \nAmerican people more, that will restore American jobs, than acting \nquickly on the Energy bill that has just been reintroduced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Alaska. \nHaving worked for several years on this Energy bill, it seems to me \nthere is nothing more timely than to move forward. This is a policy. We \nthink it is for tomorrow, but it is looking forward. It is a balanced \npolicy that has alternative fuels. It has clean air. It has \nconservation and efficiency, as well as domestic production. We need to \ndo this. I hope we move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2954-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2954-S2955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, a year ago we started the Iraqi freedom \nactivity. I will talk a little bit about what has been accomplished \nthis past year, to recognize all those who have done so much to have a \nsuccessful operation there. We are moving toward completion--hopefully \nnot too long in the future, but we have accomplished a great deal. We \nrecognize and thank those who have given so much to continue to fight \nfor freedom, in this case in Iraq and, of course, around the world.\n  I am sorry this has become so much of a political issue. The fact is, \nwe are talking about finishing a task we started. It is not something \nthat ought to be constantly talked about as a political issue in a \nPresidential election. Certainly we ought to be talking about some of \nthe successes that have occurred there.\n  I had the opportunity to visit Iraq and Afghanistan. I was impressed \nwith the things that have been done and are being done by our troops \nthere, by other Americans there seeking to work for a secular \ngovernment and freedom in that part of the world. I hope we can be more \npositive about it than we have been, particularly in the media.\n  I was especially interested to read an editorial in the newspaper \n``Wingspan'' from Laramie County Community College in Cheyenne, WY. It \nwas partially about a young man named Nathan Span, and written by \nAshley Colgan, the co-editor of this college paper. Marine Corporal \nNathan Span, at the age of 22, is a two-time war veteran and has only \ngood things to say about the risks he has taken. He was in Operation \nEnduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and returned home in \nDecember of 2003. It was interesting what Ashley had to say.\n\n       On this one-year anniversary, I remind people that although \n     the war may be somewhat political, it is not so to the men \n     and women who fought and still fight in Iraq. Americans \n     should remember that at one point we fought for our freedom \n     from oppression, and we also had to seek help. All I ask for \n     Americans to remember is what soldiers in Iraq represent: \n     Freedom.\n\n  Ashley goes on to say:\n\n       I understand the fear, pain, and confusion but why get \n     angry at what I feel is America's attempt to make the world a \n     better place. Many Americans feel misled and lied to by the \n     administration, but let's keep in mind the greater good for \n     which the soldiers are fighting. Soldiers in Iraq feel they \n     are setting an example of what America will not tolerate from \n     a malicious dictator.\n\n  Corporal Span is a young man who just returned from spending part \nof his life in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the editorial, Span says, ``For \nthose who have fought for it, freedom has a taste that the protected \nwill never know.''\n\n  I will talk a little bit about where we are. Certainly, most \nrecognize this action in Iraq was necessary for a number of reasons. \nSaddam Hussein's regime harbored and supported terrorists and was \nconsistently an aggravating factor in the Middle East. He had attacked \nhis neighbors and launched wars of aggression. Saddam had a history of \npossessing and using chemical and biological weapons, in violation of \nthe terms of the cease-fire agreement in 1991 of the Gulf War, and \nnumerous United Nations resolutions.\n  The best intelligence available at the time showed Saddam Hussein to \nbe a growing threat to the United States. I am pleased the President \nacted swiftly and decisively before the threat became imminent. The \nmission in Iraq is critical to winning the global war on terrorism. The \nwar on terrorism remains an aggressive effort to bring not only the \nperpetrators of September 11 to justice but also those who supported, \naided terrorism. This has been policy from day one in Iraq and clearly \nfits this definition.\n  The conclusion that Saddam Hussein was hiding chemical and biological \nweapons while conspiring to rebuild the nuclear program was also \nreached in the Clinton administration, the United Nations, and a number \nof other western governments, including several that actively opposed \nthe war. In fact, regime change in Iraq has been a U.S. policy since \n1998. It is clear that some of the prewar intelligence on which \ndecisions may have been made were not complete, perhaps were flawed, \nbut the fact remains the President acted in good faith based on the \nbest intelligence available at the time.\n  But cynical political efforts, of course, have portrayed the \nPresident as deliberately misleading the public and remaining \ndishonest. Rather than playing the election year politics with this \nissue, we need to focus on correcting the existing programs, focus on \nthe future and where we are going, and how to complete the task to \nensure that our leaders have accurate and reliable information on which \nto implement policy in the future.\n  I hope the mission of the September 11 Commission that we hear so \nmuch about, the talk about it, what should have been done and was not \ndone--what we ought to do is keep this from happening in the future. \nThat is really the issue. This idea of seeking to assess blame in the \npast is immaterial. The point is, What can we do differently to avoid \nsomething of this kind happening in the future? We all know what is \ngoing on with respect to those issues.\n  Where are we today? Two weeks ago, the Iraqi Governing Council \nunanimously signed an interim constitution toward a secular government, \nan amazing change in that part of the world. It guarantees freedom of \nreligion and expression, the right to assemble, to organize political \nparties, the right to vote, the right to a fair and speedy and open \ntrial. It prohibits discrimination on gender, nationality, religion, \nand arbitrary arrests and detention.\n  Of course, what the terrorist enemy fears most is a free and \ndemocratic Iraq. Freedom, liberty, and democracy are threats to all \nthat oppose it. They will not see this happen without a fight.\n  Our challenge is to stay there until we have completed our goals. The \nsituation remains dangerous and volatile. The cost of freedom is high. \nThanks to the selfless devotion and hard work of our men and women in \nuniform, we continue to make definite and visible progress toward a \ngoal of returning a free and stable country to the Iraqi people.\n  Iraqis are much better off today than they were under Saddam Hussein. \nThe Middle East is more stable and the United States is safer with \nSaddam out of power. Operation Iraqi Freedom is the right action. We \nare winning the war in Iraq and the war on terrorism.\n  I thank those who have participated, those service men and women who \nhave given so much for this kind of freedom to be achieved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The cost of freedom is high. \nThanks to the selfless devotion and hard work of our men and women in \nuniform, we continue to make definite and visible progress toward a \ngoal of returning a free and stable country to the Iraqi people.\n  Iraqis are much better off today than they were under Saddam Hussein. \nThe Middle East is more stable and the United States is safer with \nSaddam out of power. Operation Iraqi Freedom is the right action. We \nare winning the war in Iraq and the war on terrorism.\n  I thank those who have participated, those service men and women who \nhave given so much for this kind of freedom to be achieved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to talk a little bit about \nthe 9/11 Commission which, of course, is right now beginning to \ninterview some of the most high-level people in our Government. The \nCommission has an important and, I would say, sacred mission, and that \nmission is to find out what happened and why so many people were killed \nin the tragedy of 9/11. Of course, many of those people were from my \ncity and State--the vast majority. Some of those people I knew: someone \nI played basketball with in high school, someone who was a businessman \nwho befriended me on the way up, someone who was a brave firefighter \nfrom the Marine Park neighborhood from where I come. And the families \nmirror--of course with greater intensity--the determination of the \nAmerican people to get to the bottom of this.\n  The unfortunate situation is the 9/11 Commission--which is bipartisan \nand has an important mission that transcends any politics, any one \nadministration, any one Secretary of Defense or Secretary of State or \nPresident--is being thwarted as it tries to do its work. They have \nnot been given documents. They have been delayed. Even to this day, \nCondoleezza Rice has said she will not testify to the Commission in \npublic, even though she was in probably the most sensitive staff \nposition there could be in regard to figuring out the signals before 9/\n11 and what should be done as a result of 9/11.\n\n  I think this is regretful. I think this shows, unfortunately, a \npattern in this administration of not wanting facts, of sort of making \nup your mind first and then trying to get the facts to fit that.\n  It is no secret I have been sympathetic to the President on the war \nin Iraq. I disagree with certain things he did, but I voted for the \nwar. I voted for the $87 billion. I think we have to fight terrorism. \nAnd I do think it is easy to second-guess. I also believe we could get \nso hamstrung and do nothing that the terrorists would gain more than \nthey have.\n  Having said that, if there is one thing we thrive on, if there is a \nthing that is a hallmark not only of winning a successful war on \nterrorism but of defending the very democracy the terrorists hate and \nfight, it is that all information come out so we can make an accurate \nassessment.\n  I have to tell you, as you look at it, it seems this administration \ndoes not want all the facts to come out and, in fact, oftentimes \nthwarts facts coming out; and then, when they hear facts they do not \nlike that come out not because of administration auspices, they start \nkneecapping the bringer of bad news.\n  This has not just happened in one instance; this has happened in \ninstance after instance after instance. Today there is a whole machine \ndiscrediting Richard Clarke--certainly disagree with his arguments, \ncertainly disagree with his interpretations of what happened in the \nWhite House.\n  There are two sides to every argument. But to say Mr. Clarke--who, \nuntil 2000, according to the newspapers, was a registered Republican, \nwhom I know well, whose sole mission was to defend us against \nterrorism--to call him names and say he is motivated by partisan \npolitics and he has one friend in the John Kerry campaign, that does a \ndisservice to America; to do the same thing to Mr. Foster, who had \nnumbers on how much the prescription drug bill would cost; to do the \nsame thing to Ambassador Wilson; to do the same thing to Chief of Staff \nGeneral Shinseki, this is a pattern that does not do the President, the \nWhite House, or the administration proud. In fact, it has an \nantidemocratic tinge to it that should make all of us worry, that \nshould make all of us troubled by what has happened.\n  Probably the last analogy to 9/11 was Pearl Harbor. And what did this \ncountry do? What did Franklin D. Roosevelt and the leaders of this \ncountry do? They said: We need to find the facts as to why we were so \nunprepared. Might those facts have damaged people in office? Surely. \nBut, nonetheless, pursue the facts we did, and a comprehensive report \non why America slept was issued.\n  This 9/11 Commission is in that tradition. Yet this 9/11 Commission \nhas been thwarted every step of the way. Governor Kean is a Republican, \ngreatly respected, not a partisan man. The vice chairman is Lee \nHamilton, whom I served with in the House--the same way, a Democrat, \nbut not regarded as partisan. In fact, sometimes the \nDemocratic leadership in the House would tear their hair out at Lee \nHamilton's bipartisan nature.\n\n  Yet there is almost a fear of facts coming out. What does this say to \nthe American people? Do we believe our country is right? I do. Do we \nbelieve, unlike other countries, that we search for the truth, even \nthough that truth sometimes creates bad currents, dissension, whatever, \nbut that truth is the hallmark of our democracy? I do. I think the vast \nmajority of Americans do. I think if you ask President Bush, he would \nsay he does.\n  But yet, over and over again, with the 9/11 Commission, with Richard \nClarke, with Mr. Foster, with Ambassador Wilson, there has been not \nonly an aversion to facts coming out but a kind of ``McCarthyism'' in \nsort of calling names at the person who had a different interpretation \ninstead of debating whether their interpretation was right or wrong.\n  This is bad for our democracy. This does not bring credit to this \nPresident or the Presidency. This has to stop. I hope today, as the 9/\n11 Commission begins to interview a series of very important \nwitnesses--two Presidents, two Vice Presidents, many of their leaders--\nmaybe we can turn over a new leaf; that maybe, instead of stonewalling \nand name-calling and hiding from the truth, this administration will \nsay, look, when you are President you have the powers of the \nincumbency, but it is also a tough country to govern and sometimes you \nhave to take one for the truth, you have to take one because the facts \ndo not quite square how you thought they did, and explain that to the \nAmerican people.\n  I see my colleague from Oregon in the Chamber, and I know he is going \nto speak on the same subject.\n  But, again, this 9/11 Commission is extremely important. As Santayana \nsaid: Those of us who don't learn the lessons of history are condemned \nto repeat them. As a New Yorker, I believe that particularly in regard \nto 9/11. If we cannot get a full, unvarnished, nonpartisan reading of \nthe facts--an analysis of why we were caught so unprepared on that \nawful day, 9/11--it will hurt us in fighting this war on terrorism, \nwhich I believe will be with us for a generation.\n  If we start off in a way that we are afraid of the facts, if we start \noff seeming to believe only one side is right and the motivation of \nanyone who disagrees is suspect, I fear we will not win the war on \nterror because we will not learn what has happened and we will not be \nable to correct the mistakes that have been made by many different \npeople of both political parties in the past.\n  My final plea to our President at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is, don't \nhide the facts. Don't be afraid of the facts. Don't try to undermine \nthose who will present the facts. Our country will be better and \nstronger for it if you can stick to those rules.\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York for \ntaking this time. I want to spend a few minutes trying to put in \ncontext the debate about Mr. Clarke's new book. It seems to me that \nfirst and foremost this debate is about more than ``he said/she said.'' \nInvariably that is what these discussions become fairly quickly. I want \nto review a couple of instances that have caused me to be particularly \nconcerned about the way the Clarke book has been handled.\n  When former Ambassador Wilson was concerned that the administration \nhad no evidence that the Iraqis had attempted to buy yellow cake from \nNigeria, there was a very significant effort to try to discredit him. \nWhen former Treasury Secretary O'Neill, a close friend of the Vice \nPresident, in effect talked about the administration going after Saddam \nHussein, everybody in the administration said he was all wet as well. \nNow we see the same tactic employed against Mr. Clarke, who served both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations, beginning with the Reagan \nadministration.\n  Having worked closely with Mr. Clarke on a number of issues relating \nto cyber terrorism, Mr. Clarke has been very critical of actions taken \nby executive branch officials of both political parties.\n  My sense is that, when you look at what people such as former Post \nreporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein have said over the years, you \ndon't go with a story unless you have two independent sources to \nconfirm it. What you have this morning is Mr. Clarke in effect \nconfirming Secretary O'Neill's account of the administration's focus on \nSaddam Hussein.\n  That is particularly important. These are two people with a long \nhistory of working in Washington, DC. Both of them have been fiercely \nindependent. Both are known for calling the issues on the basis of how \nthey see them. In effect, you have Mr. Clarke now confirming Secretary \nO'Neill's account with respect to the focus on Saddam Hussein.\n  There is an old saying that all roads lead to Rome. It seems the \nadministration so often clearly believes that no matter what the \nevidence was at any particular time, essentially everything led to \nSaddam Hussein.\n  It is clear that Saddam Hussein, throughout his leadership in Iraq, \nconsistently looked for opportunities to inflict pain and trauma on the \npeople of that country. It is beyond question that this was an evil \nindividual. But at the same time, it is critically important that we be \nin a position to follow the facts.\n  I sit on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have always tried to \nwork in a bipartisan way. I see the Presiding Officer of the Senate, \nMr. Smith. He and I together have tried to set an example of \nbipartisanship. That is the way we need to proceed in this critical \narea. When you have the Clarke book backing up what former Secretary \nO'Neill said, that ought to set off alarm bells. That ought to set off \nalarm bells with respect to exactly how information is filtered now in \nthe executive branch.\n  I am hopeful we will see this independent inquiry get to the bottom \nof the situation and find out exactly what transpired after this \ncritical situation with the attack on our country. It is important that \nour Nation get the facts. It is important that they are found in a \ndispassionate fashion. Now with this new book by Mr. Clarke making it \nclear that he shares the judgment of Secretary O'Neill, it ought to \nrenew a concern in the Congress and a concern on a bipartisan basis \nthat this country has a right to know, this country has a right to the \nfacts. Certainly the question of responsibility for 9/11 is an issue \nthe American people should be able to see in a dispassionate fashion, \nwhat really happened and how it happened. If anything, the events of \nthe last week reaffirm in my mind how important it is that the American \npeople get the real story.\n\n  I yield my time. I note the Senator from North Dakota is on the floor \nas well. He and I have worked together on many issues. Certainly on the \nforeign policy arena, we share the view that these issues have to be \nworked on in a bipartisan way. I will continue to focus on the evidence \nand focus on that evidence no matter where it leads.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me follow on the comments of my \ncolleagues from New York and Oregon. The issue of 9/11 is very \nimportant. I have spoken a couple of times about it previously, only \nbecause we created a commission to take a look at what happened with \nrespect to 9/11, events leading up to it and following, to try to \nunderstand what happened, how did it happen, and what lessons can we \nlearn.\n  I have been very distraught that the 9/11 Commission has actually had \nto issue subpoenas. This Commission that we, with the President, have \nimpaneled to find the answers of what happened and what we can learn \nhas had to issue subpoenas to our government to get information. I \ndon't understand that. Why on earth should this Commission have had to \nuse any subpoena power at any time?\n  Why would not the administration have said to all of the agencies \nunder their control, anything this Commission wants, anything they ask \nfor--they are doing the country's work--provide complete information? \nInstead, they have met with roadblocks. I do not understand that.\n  I learned this morning that National Security Adviser Condoleezza \nRice is willing to testify but not in public and in limited \ncircumstances. The fact is, on Sunday she was a guest on all five \nnetwork morning shows. She has plenty of time to do that, but somehow \nthere is not enough time to appear publicly before the 9/11 Commission \nto give testimony. I do not understand that. I believe and hope that \nall Republicans and Democrats, this President and this Congress, just \nwant the unvarnished facts, what happened and what can we learn from \nit.\n  I know in recent days there have been discussions about a number of \nbooks that have been written. I was on the floor also and spoke about \nformer Treasury Secretary O'Neill's book. The Secretary described \ncircumstances where almost instantly, in meetings in the White House, \nthe question posed by the President and the Vice President and Mr. \nWolfowitz and others was, What about Iraq? Let's get the evidence on \nIraq. Suggesting that there was only one issue, and that was to use 9/\n11 to get Iraq.\n  My colleague from Oregon said it well. The leader of Iraq was a \nmurderer. We are unearthing football-field-sized graves in Iraq.\n  This man was a butcher, no question about that. But there are bad \npeople around the world who are in place now and there are no plans in \nthis Chamber or at the White House to go after them.\n  The pretext of dealing with Iraq was that they had weapons of mass \ndestruction, we were told. The CIA and others provided secret briefings \nto us, and Condoleezza Rice, George Tenet, and many others provided the \nevidence. Secretary Rumsfeld said, ``We know where those weapons of \nmass destruction are, where they exist.''\n  The Secretary of State went to the United Nations and laid it out \nwith pictures and slides and said, ``Here is the evidence.'' It turns \nout that evidence wasn't accurate. So Mr. O'Neill writes a bit about \nthat. Now Mr. Clarke writes a book about it. He is not a Democrat; he \nis a Republican. There is now an industry in the last 24 hours to try \nto destroy his credibility. I don't know Mr. Clarke. I don't believe I \nhave ever met him. All I know is that legitimate questions are being \nraised about these issues, about intelligence, about Iraq, and about \nthe commission that has been impaneled to look into 9/11.\n  It all has the same kind of origin; that is, let's not ask questions, \nlet's not disclose this or that, let's keep it all secret, if we can. \nPart of this shroud of secrecy that Mr. Krugman writes about, in fact, \nI believe in this morning's New York Times, also relates to something \nwe learned last week that is of incredible importance. We learned last \nweek that this issue of the Medicare bill being discussed on the floor \nof the Senate--adding prescription drugs to Medicare--that the \nestimates of the cost of that proposal that were given to Congress were \nwrong and, in fact, the administration had estimates that would have \nhad a substantial impact, perhaps, on the debate on that legislation. \nThey had those estimates, but the\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\nperson who had them, the chief actuary--again, no Democrat, just a \ncareer public servant who, by all accounts, is a wonderful public \nservant--had the estimates and was told: If you provide the real \nestimates to Congress, you will be fired.\n  If anything demands an investigation, it is that. It demands an \nimmediate investigation. If you cannot rely on information coming from \nthe executive branch about programs we are considering on the floor of \nthe Senate because someone threatened to fire someone if they tell the \ntruth to the Congress, there is something radically wrong. So it \ndoesn't matter whether it is Mr. Clarke who writes a book and describes \nwhat he found in the White House. He also worked, as you know, for the \nClinton administration. He worked for the first George Bush Presidency. \nHe has worked for George W. Bush for the last couple of years. He \nwrites a book and raises serious questions about the information that \nwas used to decide to focus on Iraq rather than on al-Qaida. I think \nmany of us now, at least in the rearview mirror, look at that and say \nmoving from Afghanistan to Iraq and not continuing to focus on the \ndestruction of al-Qaida may have been a serious mistake.\n  How did that happen? Why did that happen? These are legitimate public \npolicy questions. I suppose there is politics in some of it. I think \nthe well-being and future of this country depends on our getting this \nright. We talk about the quality of intelligence and the questions \nabout that, and whether intelligence information was misrepresented.\n\n  Look, the next potential terrorist attack against this country will \nbe thwarted--if it is thwarted, and we certainly hope it is--by good \nintelligence. We must rely on our intelligence system. Is there \nsomething wrong with that system? If there is, it must be fixed now. It \nis not sufficient just to say, somebody wrote a book, so let's trash \nthis person time and time again. That is not what we ought to do. We \nought to get to the bottom of what is happening here, what caused all \nthese things to happen, what can we learn about it and what can we do \nto protect our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remaining time I might have to the Senator \nfrom Delaware, Mr. Carper. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just under 7 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2957-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2957-S2958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENERGY INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my colleague for yielding. Before he leaves the \nfloor, I want to take a moment and thank him for his leadership on \nanother issue. As we have sought to become more energy independent, \nSenator Dorgan has led the charge, saying maybe part of that would be \nto practice better conservation. He focused, among other things, on the \nefficiency of air-conditioners. It may sound like a small thing, but in \nthe scheme of things, it is a big step. I thank him for his leadership \non that.\n  I bought gasoline in my hometown of Wilmington, and I think it cost \n$1.77 per gallon, a little higher than it has been in recent months. I \nread a news account the other day that said we might be looking at \nprices as high as $3 per gallon in some parts of America before the end \nof the summer. We are also hearing a fair amount of concern about the \nprice of not just gasoline but of natural gas. Natural gas is what we \nuse to provide a feedstock for many of our chemical companies. A lot of \nagribusinesses use it for fertilizers. Natural gas is also the fuel of \nchoice for many of the new electric-generating powerplants that are \nbeing built across this country.\n  I want us to go back in time about 4 years to the last year of the \nClinton administration. In 2000, the Clinton administration suggested, \nthrough regulation, that we call on the makers of air-conditioners in \nthis country to create and begin selling more energy-efficient air-\nconditioners in 2006. Something was adopted called the SEER 13, \nseasonal energy efficiency rating. The idea behind the regulation was \nthat, by 2006, air-conditioners would have to be 30 percent more energy \nefficient than those currently available. We adopted a standard that \nwas implemented and then withdrawn by the Bush administration in the \nfollowing year or two, and it was replaced by a less rigorous standard.\n  There has been a court battle over the last year or so, and the \noutcome is that the court battle has sustained the more rigorous \nstandards, the SEER 13 standard, which says that manufacturers in this \ncountry, by 2006, should be producing air-conditioners that are 30 \npercent more efficient than those available in 2000. That may or may \nnot sound like a very big deal, 30 percent more energy efficient, but I \nask my colleagues to think about this. When was the last time we had a \nblackout during March or April or May or, frankly, in October, \nNovember, December? I don't recall one. My guess is that you don't, \neither. We have them, for the most part, in the summer. We have \nblackouts, for the most part, when temperatures get hot and people turn \non their air-conditioners.\n  If we begin buying more energy-efficient air-conditioners in 2006, we \nwill do a couple of things: One, reduce the likelihood of blackouts and \nthe kind of calamity they create for our economy; two, we reduce the \nneed to build new electric powerplants. Some 48 fewer electric \npowerplants will have to be built because of the higher standard. In \naddition to that, we will reduce, with a higher efficiency standard for \nair-conditioners, the emissions of carbon dioxide from our electric-\ngenerating plants by 2.5 million tons by 2020.\n  In addition, if we are building more power-generating plants that \nwill use natural gas, it will have a positive effect on the price of \nnatural gas and, I think, a positive effect on the manufacturing \nindustry in this country.\n  The second district court has ruled that the Clinton standard--the \nSEER 13 standard--should prevail. Last week, the association that \nrepresents the air-conditioning manufacturers joined, saying they \nthought they could build and begin selling, by 2006, air-conditioners \nthat met the more rigorous standard.\n  I hold a letter signed by 53 colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, \nthat was sent last week to the President.\n  It is a letter that simply says: Mr. President, we do a lot of good \nfor our country. We can help ourselves on the manufacturing side. We \ncan help ourselves by building fewer electric-power-generating plants. \nWe can reduce the price of natural gas to some extent. We can reduce \nthe emissions that are coming out of our electric-power-generating \nplants by millions of tons of CO2 each year. We can do that, Mr. \nPresident, if the administration does not appeal the decision of the \nsecond district court.\n  If the Association of American Air-Conditioning Manufacturers can say \nwe have the ability to live up to this more rigorous standard, more \nthan half the Senate can say: Mr. President, we believe we, too, have \nthe ability to live by this more rigorous standard.\n  I am tempted to say let's let sleeping dogs lie. But rather than say \nthat, let's let the more rigorous standard stand. Whether or not we \npass an energy bill this year or not--we need an energy policy \ndesperately--I will say one thing: One good component of energy policy \nin this Nation is conservation. One good way to conserve a whole lot of \nelectricity, particularly starting in 2006, is making sure that when we \nturn on the air-conditioners in our homes, offices, and buildings, they \nare meeting the more tough and rigorous standard. That would be a good \nthing for America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter signed by 53 of \nour colleagues be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Mr. President: A recent federal court decision regarding \n     energy efficient air conditioners is a significant victory \n     for consumers, for the environment, and for our nation's \n     energy future. We respectfully request that you do not appeal \n     the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \n     District (Natural Resources Defense Council et al v. Abraham, \n     Docket 01-4102) affirmed that central air conditioners sold \n     beginning in 2006 must be at least 30 percent more energy \n     efficient than those available today.\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\n       Air conditioners are a necessary modern convenience but are \n     also major users of electricity. On hot days, cooling homes \n     and businesses is the largest category of electricity demand. \n     Requiring air conditioners to be as energy efficient as \n     possible will begin to reduce the stress on the electricity \n     generation and transmission network and decrease the \n     likelihood of blackouts that many regions of the country \n     experience during warm weather conditions.\n       Air conditioners that meet the Seasonal Energy Efficiency \n     Rating 13 standard will provide benefits for consumers, the \n     environment, and the nation. The SEER 13 standard will \n     alleviate the need for additional electricity production and \n     transmission resulting in as many as 48 fewer power plants \n     required by 2020. This standard will also result in less \n     harmful air pollution being emitted into the atmosphere. \n     Moreover, by 2020 power plant emissions of carbon dioxide \n     will be 2.5 million tons lower as a result, and emissions of \n     mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides will also be \n     held down resulting in cleaner air and healthier citizens.\n       Finally, the higher standard can be expected to save \n     businesses and residential consumers $1 billion per year in \n     lower electricity bills. Lower electricity bills will recover \n     the slightly higher purchase cost for the more efficient air \n     conditioners in less than 18 months.\n       As the Congress continues to debate the future of our \n     nation's energy policy, this court decision is one that \n     should be embraced and encouraged, not appealed.\n           Respectfully,\n         Tom Carper, Susan Collins, Byron L.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, let me take a few moments to review where \nwe are on this legislation.\n  First, I don't want to sound melodramatic but this is an important \nbill. This bill would help to create and keep good manufacturing jobs \nwhere they should be; that is, in America.\n  We need to move this bill. The Senate conducted 3 days of debate on \nthe bill, one of them a Monday without rollcall votes, and this is our \nfourth day on the bill. In that time, we might say, the Senate has \nconsidered and adopted a good number of amendments. Let me just list \nthem.\n  We have adopted, first, the managers' amendment on leasing shelters; \nthe managers' amendment making modifications to the revenue provisions; \nthe committee substitute. We have also adopted the Bingaman amendment \nto expand the research credit; the Hatch-Murray amendment to extend the \nresearch and development credit. We have further adopted the McConnell \namendment to protect American workers; the McCain amendment on defense; \nthe Dodd amendment to protect American workers; the Bayh amendment to \nextend expiring provisions; the Bunning amendment to extend the net \noperating loss carryover provision; and the Bunning-Stabenow amendment \nto accelerate the phase-in of the manufacturing deduction.\n  That is quite a bit. A lot of legislation adopted, amendments passed \nalready. Now, under the previous order, Senator Harkin has offered his \namendment on the Department of Labor's overtime regulations and that is \nthe pending first-degree amendment.\n  Regrettably, in my view, the assistant majority leader offered a \nmotion to recommit the bill and filed cloture on that motion to \nrecommit. This morning the majority filled that amendment tree by \noffering a couple of secondary amendments.\n  There may come a time, after full and fair debate and amendment on \nthe bill, when I would support a motion to cut off debate. But under \nthe current circumstances, I will oppose that cloture motion. This is a \nbill about jobs, about quality jobs here in America. Senator Harkin's \namendment is also about the quality of jobs in America. This is not \nsome amendment out of left field. The Senator from Iowa is not trying \nto change the subject, for example, to gun control or Medicare or \nreproductive choice, but rather he is staying on the subject. He is \ntalking about jobs.\n  His amendment, although relevant, may not be strictly germane within \nthe meaning of that term in Senate procedure. The effect of this \ncloture motion, if adopted, would be to block a vote on the Harkin \namendment. I will not be a party to that effort. On a major bill such \nas this one, Senators deserve a full and fair opportunity to offer and \nget votes on amendments. We should allow that process to continue.\n  Even though this cloture motion has brought the Senate to something \nof an impasse, I remain hopeful. I am hopeful because I believe after \nthe Senate recognizes that the votes are not there to block the Harkin \namendment, the Senate can then reach an agreement limiting amendments \nto the bill to a reasonable number. I believe we can then work through \nthis bill and bring it to completion by the end of the week. It is \nimportant that we do so. We need to respond to the European Union's \nsanctions, sanctions that impose a harmful tax on dozens of American \nproducts. Most importantly, we need to do what\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\nwe can to help to create and keep jobs in America.\n  I urge a prompt vote on the Harkin amendment, that we reach an \nagreement limiting amendments to a reasonable number, and then move on \nto complete this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last night the majority leader set up a \nprocess for moving this bill to a cloture vote. This is not our \npreferred route for moving what is clearly a bipartisan bill voted out \nof committee 19 to 2. The two dissenting votes happened to be \nRepublicans, not Democrats. This is clearly a bipartisan bill. A \nbipartisan bill should not require a cloture vote to get passed.\n  I remain hopeful we will be able to work out an agreement on moving \nthe bill forward without the need for this extraordinary parliamentary \nprocess, but if cloture is the only way to move this bill, then I hope \neverybody will support cloture. We need to support cloture in the same \nbipartisan manner we used to build this bill. It is urgent that we move \nthis bill immediately.\n  This bill reduces the income tax on goods manufactured in the United \nStates and sold overseas so we can create jobs in America. We give a \npriority on taxation to goods made in America.\n  Everybody in this body is concerned about outsourcing. If we want to \ndo something about keeping jobs in America and adding to the number of \njobs in America, this bill will do it. It is going to make our costs of \noperation less and consequently competitive with world competition. \nThat is why we call it the JOBS bill.\n  The reason we are in a bad position right now is because under the \ninternational agreements we have on trade, the World Trade Organization \nhas ruled that our pretax policy is an illegal export subsidy, and \nconsequently the World Trade Organization has authorized Europe to do \nup to $4 billion a year in sanctions against U.S. exports.\n  It isn't just the case of our tax system causing us to not be \ncompetitive. On top of that, we now have $4 billion of sanctions to \nfurther weigh down our ability to compete in the export market. These \nsanctions began on March 1. These sanctions started at 5 percent, which \nis just like a 5-percent sales tax on the stuff we are going to sell. \nThe rule of Economics 101 is if you tax something at a higher rate, you \nget less of it. But not only is it 5 percent now, it is going to be 5 \npercent for each month we do not conform our tax laws to our trade \nagreements.\n  Remember, we have trade agreements because the U.S. Congress enacted \nthose trade agreements. It has been done by a majority of the \nrepresentatives of the American people. One percent a month can take us \nall the way up to a maximum of 17 percent over the course of a year. By \nNovember, we are going to have a 12-percent tax on our exports. This is \na very serious threat for all States because the sanctions hit a wide \nrange of products--agricultural, timber, and manufacturing products \nthat we sell overseas.\n  We need to get this issue behind us very soon or we will never get \nthis bill passed and we will continue to have this mounting level of \ntaxation on our products being exported to a point where we are even \nmore uncompetitive, to a point where workers may be laid off; whereas \njust the opposite can happen if we pass this legislation. We are going \nto be able to make our manufacturing more competitive and across the \nboard with a wider range--not just for big corporations in America but \nfor individuals that export, for sole proprietorships that are in \nmanufacturing; you name it. People are going to get the benefit of a \nlower rate of taxation if they manufacture in America--not if they have \na company in America and they manufacture overseas but just American \njobs, American products made in America, or if a company wants to come \nover here and invest in America and build a plant and hire American \nworkers, they will get the benefit of it as well.\n  We had 3 or 4 days on this bill 2 weeks ago. We started on it again \nyesterday. I think it is very important that we move ahead on this \nlegislation. But the opening debate and the procedural shenanigans \nconfirm my worst fears because there are some on the other side who \nwant to use this legislation to move things that are unrelated to \nmaking our industry competitive and unrelated to the motivations behind \nthis bipartisan bill.\n  Senator Baucus and I agreed on an order of amendments that would \nimprove the bill and broaden important relevant issues. That agreement \nwas undermined by the process coming from the other side of the aisle.\n\n  It means Members there presumably do not know the importance of this \nlegislation, do not want to debate the substance of the bill but debate \neverything else. In a sense, this bipartisan bill is being turned into \na political football. That is inexcusable because we have worked hard \nthroughout this process to make sure everyone's concerns, both \nRepublican and Democrat, were incorporated into this bill. You do not \nplay political games with a bipartisan bill that affects the jobs of \nmanufacturing workers across this land.\n  I take a moment to talk about how bipartisan this bill is. It is \nbipartisan and was built that way from the ground up. It is the \nconstruction that began when my friend and colleague, Senator Baucus, \nwas chairman of the Finance Committee. Senator Baucus held hearings on \nthis issue in July 2002 to address the FSC/ETI controversy going on \nwithin the World Trade Organization. The title of the hearing was ``The \nRole of the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act in the International \nCompetitiveness of U.S. Commerce.'' Talk about a chairman taking his \nresponsibilities seriously, Senator Baucus did.\n  Even then we were concerned about the outsourcing of jobs. We were \nconcerned about American manufacturing being able to compete with the \nglobal environment we are in. We heard at that time vital testimony \nfrom a cross-section of industries that would be adversely affected by \nthe repeal of this extraterritorial income act.\n  We also heard from U.S. companies that were clamoring for \ninternational tax reform more broadly than FSC/ETI because our tax \nrules were hurting their competitiveness in the foreign markets. If you \nwant to create jobs in America, and we have a tax system that makes us \nuncompetitive, would you not expect the Congress of the United States \nto respond, and respond in a bipartisan way to that problem for our \nmanufacturers? Or if you did not, why would you harangue about \noutsourcing? You need to do something about it.\n  These companies that testified in the summer of 2002 told us their \nforeign competitors were running circles around them because of our \nantiquated international taxing rules. During this hearing, we had our \ncolleagues, Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Senator Hatch of Utah, \nexpress concerns about how our international tax laws were impairing \nthe competitiveness of U.S. companies. After some discussion on forming \na blue-ribbon commission to study this problem, we all decided that \ndecisive action was more important than the usual commission approach \nthat usually ends up with a lot of public relations and high talk but \nno action.\n  During that hearing, then-Chairman Baucus formed an international tax \nworking group that was joined by Senator Graham, Senator Hatch, and \nthis Senator, and was open to any other Finance Committee Senator \ninterested in this issue. The bipartisan Finance Committee working \ngroup formed the basis for the bill we are debating this very minute. \nWe directed our staff to engage in an exhaustive analysis of many \ninternational reform proposals that have been offered. Our efforts were \nintended to glean the very best ideas from as many sources as possible.\n  Senator Baucus and I also formed a bipartisan, bicameral working \ngroup with the chairman and ranking member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee of the other body in an effort to find some common ground on \ndealing with this repeal of FSC/ETI. Obviously, that did not go so well \nbecause the other body has come out with legislation somewhat different \nthan ours. Consequently, they are finding it very difficult to get the \nvotes to pass it in the other body. That is another reason, if we move \nquickly, maybe we can impress upon the House of Representatives that \nthis body can function, this body works; we have a good product and \nmaybe that will encourage bipartisanship in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  Through this working group we continued our efforts in cooperation \nwith\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\nSenator Hatch, Senator Bob Graham, and other members of the Finance \nCommittee who wanted to do what was fair and what was right in \ncomplying with this World Trade Organization ruling. We continued our \nbipartisan efforts when I became chairman in 2003. In July last year, \nwe held two hearings on the FSC/ETI and international reform issues. \nOne hearing focused on: ``An Examination of the United States Tax \nPolicy and Its Effect on Domestic and International Competitiveness of \nUnited States-Based Operations,'' building upon the very successful \nhearing that chairman Baucus had in 2002.\n  Our second hearing was entitled ``United States Tax Policy and Its \nEffects on International Competitiveness of United States-Owned Foreign \nOperations,'' as opposed to United States-based operations in the first \nhearing. These two hearings concluded our final bipartisan effort in \nreviewing all of the policy options that led to the creation of the \nbill that is before the Senate right now.\n  Let me again emphasize there is not one provision in this JOBS bill \nthat was not agreed to by both Republicans and Democrats. We have acted \nin good faith. We have acted in the best of faith to produce a bill \nthat takes American manufacturing jobs and ensures that our companies \nremain the global competitors we want them to be. We did this in a \nfully bipartisan manner, which is what the American people expect on \nsuch an important issue as manufacturing jobs in our Nation's economic \nhealth.\n  These efforts that have been expended to bring this bill to this \npoint are apparently not enough for some. They still view this whole \nprocess as political punt, pass, and kick competition. I now realize \nthere are some who do not want this bill to pass, and maybe not having \nit passed will serve their political end. They want economic downturns \nthat continued sanctions will produce to continue economic doldrum.\n  Several weeks ago, an article in the Washington Post quoted a \nDemocratic tax aide as saying: ``There is not a lot of incentive for us \nto figure out this problem.'' The Democratic aide went on to say that \nallowing the extraterritorial income controversy to fester would yield \nincreased sanctions that somehow would benefit the Democrats in \nNovember. That is an appalling statement because we hear the concern \nthat is legitimately expressed about outsourcing.\n  We have a bill before the Senate that can do something about \noutsourcing. We have a situation before the Senate that if we do not \npass this bill, not only will we not have some tax advantage we thought \nwe once had, but we will have the sanctions on top of that to weight \ndown American industry so more people are laid off.\n  How can Members one day give a speech about outsourcing and the next \nday slow down a bill that does something about outsourcing? Outsourcing \nonly comes as a matter of competition. There is not any American \nbusinessperson sitting around anyplace that decides, I want Mary's job \nto go to India. I want Pete's job to go to China. I want Ralph's job to \ngo to Russia.\n\n  There is not any American businessman who speaks in terms of: I don't \nwant this American to have a job, because they would not have hired \nthem in the first place.\n  This outsourcing happens because they look at what their competition \nis paying to produce a product. In the economics of business, when you \nare a businessperson, wherever in the world, if you do not make a \nprofit, you are not going to be in business. So a businessperson seeing \nthat he is not competitive, that is where you lead to outsourcing.\n  Now these American manufacturers come and testify before our \ncommittee. They tell us what makes them noncompetitive. One is the cost \nof capital in America being high. We have an opportunity to reduce the \ncost of capital and, at the same time, encourage manufacturing in \nAmerica. That is what this bill does.\n  So everyone on both sides of the aisle who talks about outsourcing--I \ndo myself--needs to band together if we are serious about doing \nsomething about outsourcing and get behind this effort to get the bill \npassed because manufacturers tell us this bill will help. And, for \nsure, they know these sanctions that are on American manufacturing now \nare an additional burden they cannot withstand.\n  America's farmers and manufacturing workers must not pay the price \nfor the sort of stonewalling we are seeing. Efforts to delay this \nbipartisan bill with unrelated measures is a bad excuse. Why would they \nraise political issues that are unrelated to this bill in an attempt to \nundermine the JOBS Act?\n  Delay will allow sanctions to continue and drive down our economy. \nThat will allow sanctions to increase to 12 percent by the November \nelections. Maybe that is too tempting for some people who are worried \nabout the election instead of the next generation to pass up.\n  I am hopeful we will see the best politics ends up being good policy. \nThat is what we have with this bill. We help domestic manufacturers. We \nhelp U.S. companies compete overseas. Putting politics ahead of good \npolicy is exactly the wrong approach. In effect, this political game \ndoes not help those who face the sanctions. It does not help domestic \nmanufacturers and workers in those industries.\n  A vote against this bill is a vote to continue European Union \nsanctions, already at 5 percent--6 percent in April, 7 percent in May, \n8 percent in June, 9 percent in July, 10 percent in August, 11 percent \nin September, 12 percent in November.\n  We are here to represent the interests of the United States. On this \nbill, we are here to represent the interests of jobs in America. We are \nhere to represent the symbol ``Made in America.''\n  If we do not pass this bill, whether people realize it, they are \nrepresenting the interests of the European Union, because it is the \nEuropean Union which is going to benefit with European jobs.\n  We have 5.6 percent unemployment in America, which is probably less \nunemployment than most of my life in politics as an index of how the \neconomy is going. But still, it is bad to have 5.6 percent \nunemployment. What is worse than the 5.6 percent unemployment is the \npeople who are complaining about the 5.6 percent unemployment and not \npassing this bill that is going to make employment in America better.\n\n  Oh, maybe they are looking over to Germany. Their unemployment rate \nwent up last month to 10.7 percent. By not passing this bill, we might \nhelp some German workers get a job, some of the German unemployed get a \njob. Well, I do not think we ought to put the interests of the European \nUnion first.\n  The only way to honor our trade obligations and to make American \nbusiness competitive and to create jobs in America is to pass this bill \nand repeal the extraterritorial income provisions of our law. It is \nvery simple. It is so simple that is why this is a bipartisan bill. As \nI said before, I hope the leadership of this body can cooperate, both \nRepublican and Democrat, to focus on this legislation, to focus on the \ntask at hand, and particularly on the other side where all the \namendments are coming from, to know the importance of passing this \nbill, not stalling this bill, and moving forward.\n  Repealing FSC/ETI raises about $55 billion over 10 years, and 89 \npercent of that money comes from manufacturing. It gives us an \nopportunity to use that $55 billion to emphasize American \nmanufacturing, the creation of jobs in America, and to use that $55 \nbillion as an incentive to American manufacturers to manufacture here \nand not to manufacture overseas.\n  We need to send that money back to the manufacturing sector because \nif we do not, then besides these sanctions, we have a $50 billion tax \nincrease on American manufacturing.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says we have lost 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs since July of 2000. Is this manufacturing decline \nsomething the Bush administration did? No. It started in July of 2000. \nA $50 billion tax increase will not stimulate manufacturing jobs.\n  Again, simple principles of economics 101: If you tax something more, \nyou get less of it.\n  The JOBS bill uses all of the money from the FSC/ETI repeal to give a \n3 percentage point tax cut on all income derived from manufacturing in \nthe United States. Let me emphasize: just in the United States. It is \nnot for manufacturing by American companies overseas.\n  The relief applies not only to big manufacturers but sole \nproprietors,\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\npartnerships, farmers, individuals, family businesses, multinational \ncorporations if they are manufacturing in America, and also plain big \nor small foreign companies that set up manufacturing plants in the \nUnited States.\n  We also include international tax reforms, mostly in the foreign tax \narea, and most of which benefit manufacturing.\n  Our bill also includes the Homeland Reinvestment Act, which has broad \nsupport in both bodies of the Congress.\n  The Finance bill is revenue neutral. That is another thing we have to \ndo: have it carefully crafted in order to get bipartisan support for \nthis legislation and not add to the deficit; there are both Republicans \nand Democrats who do not want to pass a tax bill that loses revenue. So \nwe have the ability, by extending Customs user fees--and, more \nimportantly, by shutting down illicit tax shelters, corporate tax \nshelters, and closing abusive corporate tax loopholes--to raise money \nto do even more than we have described to be able to do some reform of \nthe international taxing regime generally beyond just FSC/ETI.\n  As with all bills, there is never complete agreement on this \napproach. That is even considering the fact it was voted out of \ncommittee in a bipartisan way 19 to 2. Remember, all Democrats voted \nfor this bill to come out of committee.\n  Our bill contains a haircut on the rate reduction some of us would \nlike to remove and others would like to retain. Some Members prefer a \nreduction in the top corporate rate across the board in place of the \ninternational reforms and the manufacturer's rate cut in this bill. I \nunderstand the desire for this simpler approach cutting taxes, but a \ntop level rate cut would only go to the biggest corporations of \nAmerica. Local family-held S corporations and partnerships, which \npresently get some extraterritorial income benefits, get nothing from \nthis. If we redirect FSC/ETI money to an across-the-board corporate \ncut, then the manufacturing sector will be the revenue offset. In other \nwords, we are going to be shifting from tax advantages from \nmanufacturing to services where we have some problem, but I think we \ngenerally agree not as much of a problem as we have in manufacturing.\n  The international tax reforms largely fix problems our domestic \ncompanies face with the complexities of the foreign tax credit. These \nreforms are necessary if we are to level the playing field for U.S. \ncompanies that compete with our trading partners. The Finance Committee \nbipartisan bill has been improved with an amendment to extend the \nresearch and development tax credit through the end of 2005. That is a \ndomestic tax benefit that incentives research and development, makes \nour businesses competitive and prepared for the next generation of \ntechnology. This, however, translates also into good, high-paying jobs \nfor workers in America and not overseas.\n  In addition to the previously agreed upon R amendment, there are \nseveral additional provisions to improve this bill. We have the \namendment by Senators Bunning and Stabenow, a bipartisan amendment to \naccelerate the manufacturing deduction. This amendment ensures the tax \nrelief and related economic benefits of the bill are provided more \nquickly to those hurt by the repeal of FSC/ETI. This is now part of the \nbill.\n  Second, there is an amendment I offered with Senator Baucus to extend \nfor 2 years tax provisions that have expired. Some expired in 2003, \nsome this year. This includes items such as the work opportunity tax \ncredit and the welfare-to-work tax credit which have been merged and \nsimplified into a single credit as proposed by Senator Santorum and \nothers in the bill S. 1180. This is now a part of the legislation.\n  A third provision on net operating losses is also included. This \nprovision allows companies that operated at losses during the difficult \neconomic conditions of last year to offset those losses against their \nincome of the previous 5 years. So this provision is going to \naccelerate tax relief to companies that need it to continue operations \nand to continue their recovery from the recent economic difficulties. \nThis provision is now in the bill.\n  The JOBS bill before us also contains many other items that are \nwidely supported by the Members. We have enhanced the amount of \ntransition relief for U.S. manufacturing companies that will be harmed \nby the FSC/ETI repeal. We have enhanced depreciation provisions, \nbrownfield revitalization, mortgage revenue bonds. We allow deductions \nfrom private mortgage insurance for people struggling to afford a home.\n\n  The bill includes tax benefits for reservist employees that provides \na tax credit to employers for wages paid to reservists who have been \ncalled up to active duty. We have extended and enhanced the Liberty \nZone Bonds for the rebuilding of New York City, particularly requested \nby its two Senators. We have increased industrial development bond \nlevels to spur economic development. We have included the Civil Rights \nTax Fairness Act. We have provided for rail infrastructure and \nbroadband.\n  All of these benefits are being held hostage because some Members are \npushing politically motivated votes on an issue that is not even in \nthis bill. Let's get on with the business at hand and finish it. Let's \nput good economic policy first in the Senate.\n  We do have the issue of cloture which comes up periodically when we \nhave to get to the completion of legislation. I, for one, was hoping \nthis cloture would not be filed. That is the way Senator Baucus and I \nhoped it would happen. I have to deal with the fact it is filed. My \ncolleague Senator Baucus has to deal with that fact as well. This needs \nto be dealt with on a little higher plain than from bill to bill.\n  I propose to the leadership of the Republican and Democratic caucuses \nthat somehow, if we are going to get between now and adjournment this \nfall, without a lot of waste of time on the part of the Senate and the \n100 Members equally affected, that we get a list of the so-called \namendments I referred to as politically motivated. I think the other \nside sees they have certain issues that ought to get before the \nAmerican people, ought to be discussed. Republicans have some of those \nissues as well that Democrats would just as soon we not bring up. I \ndon't know why there can't be some agreement unrelated to a specific \nbill before the Senate that certain of these issues are going to be \nbrought up, and we will find someplace to handle one on this bill, one \non another bill, a third one on another bill, so they don't get dumped \nat one time all on one piece of legislation. Then we know ahead of time \nwhat the situation is; there will be a plan for the functioning of the \nSenate.\n  I should not speak for Senator Baucus but I believe I can. He comes \nfrom a philosophy that this place ought to work, that it ought to make \nproduct. We ought to do our job. And I am sure that even though he \nmight have a different view than I do on this issue of cloture, he \nwishes it were not that way. I wish it were not that way. He wishes \nthere was a plan before us to move every important piece of legislation \nin an expeditious way because that is what we are sent here to do. We \nall ought to want to make this place work because when it does not \nwork, it makes all of us look bad. It puts the good of the American \npeople secondary to politics, whether it is Republican politics or \nDemocratic.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The parliamentary inquiry I would like to make is where \nare we right now on the bill? Are we on the motion to recommit, at this \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to recommit is pending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand also that a cloture motion has been filed on \nthe motion to recommit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Since there is a motion to recommit that is pending, is \nit not in order for an amendment to be made to that motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendments have already been made to the \nmotion to recommit.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Do I understand that both a first-degree and second-\ndegree amendment have been made already?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So, therefore, no amendments, then, are allowed, under \nthe rules of the Senate, to be made to the motion to recommit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S2962]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further inquiry, Mr. President: Yesterday this Senator \noffered an amendment dealing with overtime. Is that amendment still \npending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is still pending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is it further correct to say that if cloture is invoked, \nthis amendment would fall, that it would not be allowed under the rules \nof the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the motion to recommit is adopted, the \nHarkin amendment would be vitiated.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand that. But then this Senator would be allowed \nto offer my overtime amendment on the new bill that will be before us \nat that point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further inquiry, Mr. President: If, however, cloture is \ninvoked on the motion to recommit, is it not true that this Senator's \namendment then would fall and not be allowed, under the rules of \ncloture, or am I wrong? Maybe my amendment would be allowed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on whether, if cloture is \ninvoked----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If cloture is invoked, then the amendment \nwould be nongermane.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand that. I want to make it very clear for those \nwho may be watching in their offices and not present on the floor. If \ncloture tomorrow, when it ripens, is invoked, we will not be allowed to \nvote on an overtime amendment; is that correct? Because it will be \ndeemed to be nongermane under the rules of cloture, is that correct?\n  I repeat my question. I want to make it clear to those who are \nwatching in their offices and may not be on the floor right now. Under \nthe rules of germaneness, under the rules of the Senate, because of the \nparliamentary tactics just taken by the majority, having a motion to \nrecommit and then sort of filling the tree, as we call it around here \nin parliamentary parlance, having the first-degree amendment and the \nsecond-degree amendment and then filing cloture--that was filed, I \nguess, yesterday--that through all of this parliamentary maneuvering, \nif in fact the Senate votes for cloture, on Wednesday, on tomorrow, \nthen Senators will be denied a right to vote on my overtime amendment; \nis that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The difficulty in answering the question is \nbased on the motion that is pending, which is the motion to recommit as \nopposed to the cloture vote, and the cloture vote depends upon whether \nthe motion to recommit passes or not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will ask one more time because I want to get this \nstraight. There is pending a cloture motion. That cloture motion will \nbe voted on tomorrow; is that not correct? It will ripen tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. It will ripen.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If in fact there is a vote tomorrow on cloture and \ncloture is invoked--that is, a majority of the Senate votes yes on \ncloture--then this Senator's amendment on overtime will not be allowed \nunder the rules of the Senate pertaining to germaneness; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will not be allowed on the motion to \nrecommit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will my amendment be allowed on the bill that is then \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be pending before the Senate \nwith a new substitute that is amendable.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Then under the rules of Senate, if cloture is invoked, \nthis Senator's amendment would not be allowed, I understand, because it \nwill be nongermane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The new substitute will be fully open to \namendment. The Senator can then offer his amendment to the substitute.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the chairman of \nthe committee, for his remarks. I am quite hopeful, frankly, that we \ncan reach an agreement fairly quickly so that we can move on this bill. \nAt the present moment, we are at an impasse with the cloture motion \nfiled, and the amendment tree is filled up.\n  I expect it is the wish of the majority to eventually avoid a vote on \nthe amendment offered by Senator Harkin. I believe Senator Harkin \ndeserves a vote. I believe the vast majority of Senators on both sides \nof the aisle would like to move quickly on this legislation--reach \nagreement on a number of amendments that would be in order so we can \nmove quickly.\n  Based on my conversations with Senators and with the leadership, I \nhave every expectation that we can reach that agreement quite soon--\nhopefully, this afternoon. This is the Senate. Every Senator deserves \nan opportunity to offer his or her amendments. We also have to reach \nagreements. We have to pass legislation. It requires compromise. I do \nbelieve we will reach that agreement which, necessarily, will be the \nresult of compromise, fairly quickly.\n  I urge Senators to push their interests, as they should, but push \nthem in a way where we can get an agreement to pass this legislation. I \nhope we will do that this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand that under a previous order \nthe Senate is going to recess at 12:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are in a situation where it looks as \nthough the majority on the other side simply does not want to vote on \nmy overtime amendment. They are going to do everything they can to try \nto prevent it.\n  Again, there is talk about delay and who is delaying this bill. Look, \nI offered my amendment the other day and we could have had a vote by \nnow. I was willing to enter into a time agreement. They would not do \nit. I offered the amendment under a unanimous consent agreement reached \nwith the other side to bring it up. Now, the parliamentary games being \nplayed are not on this side; they are on the other side. One really has \nto ask, Does the other side really want to get this bill through?\n  Again, I have no doubt that the chairman, my friend and colleague \nfrom Iowa, wants to get it through. He is chairman. Having been in that \nposition before on another committee, I know you want to get your bill \nthrough. I have no doubt that the Senator from Iowa would like to get \nthe bill through. It looks as though the leadership on that side--\neither the leadership or the administration; I don't know who is \ncalling the shots--is simply saying they don't want to have a vote on \novertime.\n  It is really unfortunate that they have now filed cloture on this \nbill. My friend and colleague from Iowa, and others on the other side, \nhave referred to this as a jobs bill. They keep talking about it is a \njobs bill. Well, all I can say in response to that is I believe the \nranking member of our committee, Senator Baucus from Montana, would \nlike to get the bill through, we would like to get completion of this \nbill and get it through, but that does not mean we should not be \nallowed to offer some reasonable number of amendments to try to improve \nit as we see fit. They may win, they may lose, but at least we ought to \nbe allowed the right to offer and debate some amendments within \nreasonable timeframes.\n  One of the most important job-related amendments is the amendment on \novertime. How could we possibly tell the American people with a \nstraight face that we are passing a ``jobs bill'' on the Senate floor \nbut we are not addressing the issue of overtime pay and the \nadministration's proposed regulations that would have the effect of \ntaking overtime pay protection away from millions of American workers?\n  This is an issue that goes right to the heart, the gut, of our \nAmerican workforce: The right to be paid time and a half when one works \nover 40 hours a week. It has been in the law since 1938. Yet, as I said \nyesterday and I will continue to point out, last year the \nadministration came out with a proposed set\n\n[[Page S2963]]\n\nof regulations to change the underlying overtime law. They did it \nwithout having one public hearing. Imagine that, changing something so \nfundamental to the American work ethic as the right to overtime pay \nwithout having a public hearing.\n  They put out the proposed regulations and the American public \nresponded with thousands--I have heard maybe 60,000 to 70,000 comments. \nThen last summer, after a number of us had gotten wind of what they \nwere trying to do and we started reading the proposed regulations, we \noffered an amendment on the Senate floor that would have basically \ndenied that part of the overtime regulation that would take away this \novertime right.\n  That amendment I offered last summer passed the Senate. It was \nbipartisan. I have heard a lot of references to the fact that this bill \nis a bipartisan bill. Well, the amendment I am offering is a bipartisan \namendment because it was voted on last summer by both Republicans and \nDemocrats and passed in the Senate, 54 to 46. Around here, that is \npretty bipartisan.\n  Basically, what that amendment said is, no, we are not going to agree \nwith the administration's proposed changes on overtime rules. If the \nadministration wants to make fundamental changes in overtime rules, \nthey ought to do it in the time-honored manner: work with Congress, \nhave public hearings around the country, and then let Congress and the \nadministration get together to revise, if revision is needed, overtime \nlaws. But that is not the way the administration did it.\n  Again, if I hear correctly people on the other side say we are \nslowing down or stopping this bill, I am sorry; it does not ring true. \nThis bill could have been brought up last fall, and it was not. We just \nspent a whole week in the Senate debating a gun bill that failed with \nover 90 votes against it. What was that all about? Why did we spend \nover a week doing that when we could have been doing this bill, if this \nbill is so important?\n  One has to raise some questions about what is going on because when \none reads some of the publications around here--this was in \nCongressional Quarterly Today about this bill. According to the \nCongressional Quarterly, the chairman of the House committee, \nCongressman Thomas:\n\n       . . . told the Tax Executive Institute, a group of \n     corporate tax officials, on Monday that lobbyists seeking \n     specific changes in international tax rules had effectively \n     stymied his bill, according to the Associated Press.\n\n  So it is not us who are stymying this bill. Again, there are some \ncorporate lobbyists downtown who are. Again, from CQ Today:\n\n       Meanwhile, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas, R-\n     California, told a group of business tax officials on Monday \n     that the current House version of the bill (H.R. 2896) was \n     probably doomed.\n\n  So it is not us who are slowing this bill down, not at all. This \nSenator would like to see this bill get through. I think there are some \ngood things in this bill. That does not mean we should not be allowed \nto offer our amendments and have an up-or-down vote on those \namendments.\n  A jobs bill? Well, fine, call it a jobs bill, but do not tell me this \nis a jobs bill and then say we cannot have a vote on our overtime \namendment. That is about jobs. We know it is about jobs because we \nknow, common sense dictates, if an employer can work a person longer \nthan 40 hours a week and not have to pay overtime, why, it would be \nmuch better to work the person longer, pay them less, and then not hire \nany new workers.\n  At a time when we have 9 million Americans out of work, we have a \njobless recovery in this country, why would we now be wanting to give \nemployers another incentive not to hire new workers?\n  We had an agreement to consider my amendment. It was the fourth \namendment in the series we agreed to prior to last week's recess, but \nno sooner was I able to offer my amendment last evening than the \nmajority leadership decided to move to recommit the whole bill and to \nfile cloture on that motion.\n  I am not sure how that meets our previous agreement to take up my \namendment, but that is where we are now. A motion to recommit the bill \nis pending. I would like to talk about overtime. I would like to have \nan amendment about overtime and have a vote on it. As my parliamentary \ninquiries earlier this morning showed, we can go through this whole \ncharade, motion to recommit, file a cloture, we can vote on that, and \nwe can still come back with this amendment.\n  I suppose then they will file cloture on the bill. That is why it was \nwrong on the majority side to file cloture on this motion to recommit \nand why I hope we will oppose that cloture motion and deny cloture \nuntil we can get a right to offer our amendments and have a vote on our \namendments.\n  We are not asking for unlimited debate. I would agree with the \nmanager of the bill right now to a time limit on my amendment with an \nup-or-down vote. So it is not about us stalling this bill. Forget about \nthat. Get that out of your head. That is not what is happening. What is \nhappening is the majority side simply does not want to vote on \novertime. Why? Because I think they are afraid, and the vote will be \neven stronger this time than it was last summer because more and more \nAmerican workers, more and more people have found out what this \nadministration downtown is trying to do to their overtime pay.\n  I will be on the floor waiting for every opportunity to offer this \namendment and to get a vote on it. If the other side believes that \nsomehow by going through this charade and slowing this bill down and \nsomehow blaming us for it when we are not doing this is somehow going \nto get rid of this overtime amendment, well, I am sorry to disappoint \nthem. We are going to continue to debate and have a vote on this \novertime amendment. It is that crucial, that important, to the American \nworker that this Senate express itself once again and say no to the \nadministration, that we are not going to let them trample on the rights \nof American workers and take away their right to overtime pay if they \nwork over 40 hours a week.\n  I see my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2963-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, \nwishes to speak for 15 minutes. I ask following that, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for securing \nthe time. I may not need all of that time. I want to take a few minutes \nto express my deep concerns about the pending amendment. I am in favor \nof the pending amendment. My concern is that an effort will be made to \nsomehow avoid having to vote on this critical issue, the issue of \novertime pay.\n  First, let me commend Senator Harkin of Iowa for being so tenacious \nand patient about this amendment. He has offered this proposal in the \npast. We carried the amendment, as I recall, in the Chamber, only to \nwatch the matter be dispensed with and dropped in conference.\n  He has tried to bring up this matter before. In fact, prior to the \nrecess period, Senator Harkin was on the floor of this Chamber for a \nnumber of hours, trying to get a vote. I think he agreed\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\nto a simple 20 minutes or 25 minutes of debate on whether we would be \nable to prohibit the administration from implementing a new regulation \nthat would take overtime away from millions of working Americans.\n  I have no doubt about the outcome of the vote if we can actually get \na vote. I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of our colleagues, if \ngiven the chance to express themselves on the proposed regulation by \nthe administration, would support the Harkin amendment. We have done \nthat already. I think that is where Members are, both Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  But a determined minority here will not allow us to have this vote. \nWe will not get the chance to express whether we believe that hard-\nworking Americans who work beyond their 40 hours ought to get paid for \nthe overtime work they do.\n  I was stunned to learn not only is the administration proposing the \nregulation that would prohibit overtime pay for people, but actually, \nwithin administration documents, they instruct employers on how to \ncraft their working relationships with their employees to avoid paying \novertime pay, moving people into whole new classifications they had \nnever held.\n  I am baffled that the administration has unveiled such an antiworker, \nantifamily proposed regulation. It is simply one more bad economic \npolicy decision that I think is indefensible, and I think we would like \na chance, both Democrats and Republicans, to express ourselves on this \nproposal.\n  I am determined, along with the Senator from Iowa and many others, to \nstay here and do whatever we have to do to get an up-or-down vote on \nwhether we ought to ban people from collecting overtime pay when they \nwork those hours.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield to my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join the Senator in cosponsoring the \nHarkin amendment.\n  Is the Senator familiar with the fact that the Republican leadership \nhas now done a parliamentary maneuver so there is absolutely no \nopportunity for this institution to act on the Harkin amendment dealing \nwith overtime; that they have taken the rules of the Senate and are so \nunwilling to address the amendment of the Senator from Iowa that they \nhave effectively foreclosed any opportunity for the Senate of the \nUnited States to act this afternoon, late afternoon, this evening, or \nat any time until after the cloture motion?\n  Can the Senator from Connecticut possibly tell us why the Republican \nleadership would want to deny the people's representatives in the \nSenate the opportunity to express their view on an issue that affects \napproximately 8 million workers in this country?\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. The Senator from Massachusetts has \nbeen a Member of this Chamber for a number of years, and I have been \nhere for almost a quarter of a century. I say to my colleague from \nMassachusetts, I was born at night but not last night.\n  You can use the rules of this institution for various purposes. It \nseems clear to this Member that the reason the Republican leadership--a \ndetermined minority within the majority--is engaging in these \nparliamentary sorts of gymnastics is because they know the outcome. I \nsuspect a strong majority of us would speak with a resounding voice in \nsaying no, you shouldn't implement a rule that would prohibit hard-\nworking Americans from collecting overtime pay. This is particularly \ntroublesome at a time when so many are out of work and where two \nincomes in a family may be necessary to keep up with the mortgage \npayments, or to pay college tuition, or make car payments. We cannot \ndeprive 8 million Americans who today have the right to collect \novertime. The only reason the Republican leadership is prohibiting a \nvote is because they know the outcome--the amendment would pass.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Senator remembers, we had a vote \non this measure on September 10, 2003. To substantiate what the Senator \nhas pointed out, they voted 54 to 45 in the Senate to retain overtime, \nand in the House of Representatives it was 221 to 203. This was a \nmatter of 7 or 8 months ago when we had this body speak in a bipartisan \nway and the House of Representatives speak in a bipartisan way. Still \nwe find the Republicans are denying the Senate an opportunity to \nexpress its will.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me that this is sending a message to \nevery working family in this country that we have Republican opposition \nto the increase in the minimum wage, Republican opposition to extending \nthe unemployment compensation, and Republican opposition to halting the \nproposal that will eliminate overtime for some 8 million Americans; \nthat one can conclude this administration is not on the side of working \nfamilies?\n  Mr. DODD. Again, I thank my colleague for his question. I don't know \nhow you can draw any other conclusion than my colleague from \nMassachusetts has.\n  As I recall--again, my colleague has a wonderful sense of history, \nand I think my memory is not bad but correct me if I am wrong--during \nthe Reagan administration, during the Bush administration, the \nPresident's father, extended unemployment benefits in those years when \npeople were out of work. I think during both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, they said we ought to extend those unemployment \nbenefits and raise the minimum wage. But in this administration's case, \nthe answer is a resounding no. Not only do they not allow us to vote on \nthose matters and extend those benefits as every administration has \nover time, but, of course, they are going a step further and proposing \nregulations.\n  Let me be clear so people understand. If you are among one of 250 \ncurrent white-collar occupations, if you are a nurse, a firefighter, a \npolice officer, emergency medical training personnel, health \ntechnician, clerical worker, surveyor, chef, if you are in those \ncategories and many more, even though your work obligations don't \nchange at all, it gives your employer the right to reclassify you as no \nlonger someone who qualifies for overtime pay. Even though your work \ndoesn't change, you will be deprived of overtime pay, no matter how \nmany hours you work. I don't understand.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator not agree with me that for the first \ntime in the history of the overtime laws this administration has stated \nif individuals in the military--I am reading from their proposed \nregulation of March 31, 2003. They talk about training in the Armed \nForces, stating if you are a member of the National Guard and are \ncalled up to go over to Iraq, you take a training program in order to \ntry to provide greater protection and defense for the men and women in \nyour unit, you come back here to the United States, you go back to your \nworkplace, and you think you are entitled to overtime, under their \nproposal, make no mistake about it, you are excluded.\n  I draw the attention of the Senator to the comments of the very \ndistinguished head of a veterans organization. The Senator has \nmentioned the categories of those who will be made ineligible for an \nincrease in overtime. This is a letter to Secretary Chao from Thomas \nCorey, national president of the Vietnam Veterans of America, dated \nFebruary 17, 2004:\n\n       [We] would like to make you aware that the proposed \n     modification of the rules would give employers the ability to \n     prohibit veterans from receiving overtime pay based on the \n     training they received in the military. This legitimizes the \n     already extensive problem of ``vetism'' or the discrimination \n     against veterans.\n\n  There it is. That is what their proposal is all about. I don't blame \nthe other side for not wanting to have a vote on it.\n  Has the Senator ever heard of such a time when we have American \nservicemen spread all over the world being called on--and the National \nGuard and Reserve--to get some training, and they come back and go back \nto work, and there comes the boss who says, Well, you have some \ntraining in the military, and you are out?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I had heard some reports about this. I had \nnever seen this letter before, but I find it incredible. Like many of \nmy colleagues, I have attended various meetings with the families of \nguardsmen and reservists who have deployed to Afghanistan\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\nand Iraq over the last number of months. I have also been at armories \nin my State as the men and women have come back from their service \nthere. I have even visited with our troops in Iraq for a few days in \nDecember. I cannot believe that these men and women, many of whom have \nspent a year boots-on-the-ground overseas would be treated in this way. \nThese men and women have already had to put their jobs and families on \nhold as they go over for a year--maybe getting back for a week or so. \nIt is hard enough to do that, hard enough to be away, hard enough to go \nthrough the perils of serving in a war zone as these young men and \nwomen are doing. But I find it stunning to also be told because of the \ntraining they may receive in order to help us rebuild Iraq and defend \ntheir fellow men and women in the uniform, that the training they got \nnow deprives them of getting as much as 25 percent of their income. I \nam told that as much as 25 percent of the earning power of an average \nworker in this country comes from overtime pay. People coming back who \njust served their country, who put their life on the line, and been \naway for a year, are now being told if they got job training over \nthere, they will no longer be eligible for overtime pay. That is \nincredible.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I draw the attention of the Senator to the comments from \nthe National Association of Manufacturers.\n\n       The NAM applauds the department for including this \n     alternative means of establishing that an employee has the \n     knowledge required for the exception [from the overtime \n     protections] to apply . . . For example, many people who come \n     out of the mili-\n     tary . . .\n\n  There it is again, the National Association of Manufacturers praising \nthat part of the Bush proposal.\n  We are talking about those who are serving in the Armed Forces now, \nand we know 40 percent of the combat arms in Iraq are National Guard \nreserve units. We find out that those individuals who get that extra \ntraining, which is essential in order to help protect the lives of \ntheir fellow servicemen, are told when they come back home, too bad, \nyou are not going to get your overtime pay.\n  I ask the Senator if this has been his experience. I have a chart, as \nwell, regarding workers without overtime protections being more than \ntwice as likely to work longer hours.\n  The point I have heard the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator \nfrom Illinois make is, if you do not have the protections, some think \nyou will have to work a little bit longer, but it will not make much \ndifference.\n  This chart from the Labor Department shows what happens in the two \ncases: where workers are paid time and a half for overtime and where \nthey are not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The time of the Senator from \nConnecticut has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I had requested to be recognized following the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nunder the previous order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is on my time.\n  This chart shows if you do not have overtime protections, you are \ntwice as likely to work more than 40 hours a week and three times as \nlikely to work more than 50 hours a week.\n  Without overtime protections, hold onto your seat, employers will \nmake you work twice as hard after hours.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that the Bush Administration is not \nonly denying fair compensation on a proposal that has been in effect \nsince the 1930s, but the message ought to go out to workers across this \ncountry they are going to work a great deal longer, a great deal harder \nbecause without the overtime protection, that is the record. They will \nbe exploited in the workplace.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for the question. I see our friend \nfrom Illinois, as well, so I will not take much time.\n  I am glad the Senator pointed this out. It reinforces the argument I \nmentioned a moment ago that according to Labor Department studies, this \nelimination of overtime pay for 250 job classifications will reduce the \nearning power of the average working family by 25 percent. What the \nSenator from Massachusetts is saying is not only will you have less \npay, but you will have to work longer hours, as well.\n  I am glad the Senator referenced the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n1938. We went through World War II, we went through Korea, Vietnam, \nthrough economic downturns, and no administration ever suggested the \nkind of changes in overtime pay this Bush administration is advocating \ntoday.\n  I urge, as my colleague from Massachusetts has, give us a chance to \nvote. Give this body a chance to express its will on whether we think \nduring these times of economic hardship people ought to be able to get \novertime pay.\n\n  If you are a nurse, clerical worker, firefighter, a reporter, a \nparalegal, dental hygienist, graphic artist, the list goes on, those \nare the job classifications in which you will be denied overtime pay. \nYour work remains the same, you do not get the extra pay, you work \nlonger hours.\n  Let's vote on the Harkin amendment. Let's have an up-or-down vote to \ndetermine whether this body believes overtime pay ought to still be the \npractice in this country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask a final two questions of my friend from \nConnecticut.\n  When we are talking about police officers and nurses and \nfirefighters, they are the categories we rely on for homeland security. \nThey are the backbone of homeland security. Here we are in the Senate \neffectively saying to those workers, we are going to take away your \novertime pay. The Republicans are saying that because they will not let \nus get a vote on it.\n  We have a lot of problems in this country, but I don't believe one of \nthe problems is that we are paying our firefighters, our nurses, and \nour police officers who are on the front line of homeland security--I \ndon't think the principal problem we have is we are paying them too \nmuch.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is the leader in this body with regard \nto children and children's issues. I have a chart that looks at the \nnumber of children hungry in this country. We are seeing an expansion \nof hunger in this country. We do not talk about it a great deal in this \nbody, but it is a direct result of the fact working families are having \na hard time making ends meet. They have not gotten an increase in the \nminimum wage, unemployment compensation has been denied, they are \nfacing the threat of loss of overtime. We have 13 million hungry \nchildren. I ask the Senator, we have the other problem with 8 million \nunemployed, 8 million workers who will lose overtime, the low minimum \nwage for 7 million, 3 million more Americans are living in poverty \nbecause of the economic policies of the last 3 years, and 90,000 \nworkers a week are losing their unemployment benefits. Regarding the \nimpact of all these economic policies on children, I am wondering if \nthe Senator would address this issue briefly. It is important when we \nare talking about these issues, we are not just talking about technical \nquestions of overtime; we are talking about real people with real lives \nand people who are facing some very challenging times.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts. He has in a sense answered the question himself with \nthese numbers. It is hard to believe, given the times, the hardship, \n90,000 people a week are exhausting their unemployment insurance \nbenefits.\n  We know of the pressures that exist on families already. We know how \nhard it is today economically. It is not an uncommon story to hear, \nwhether you are in the home State of the Presiding Officer in Ohio, or \nMassachusetts, Illinois or Connecticut, to have families where two, \nthree, and four jobs are held in order to make ends meet and how \ncritically important it is to have that income coming in.\n  When we read about jobs being outsourced across the country, being \nshipped off to India and China, and the administration is saying that \nthat is a good thing for the economy, when 2.6 million manufacturing \njobs have been lost, many of which have left the country, we have to be \nconcerned about the future of America's families. These are all \npressure points on these families who are living on the margins. We are \nnot talking about families who are necessarily in poverty but families \nwho are struggling to provide for their basic needs, trying to prepare \nfor children\n\n[[Page S2966]]\n\ngoing on to college, seeing to it they get a good education, keeping \nthem properly clothed, and in good health.\n  Forty-four million Americans do not have health care. The \noverwhelming majority of that 44 million are working people with two \nincomes. That is the average. Over 80 percent of the 44 million people \nwithout health care are working families. Now you take up to 25 percent \nof their income away and make them work longer hours. How is that \nbalancing work and family?\n  This body took 7 years to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act with \nthe help of my good friend from Massachusetts. We tried to make it \npossible for people to balance their needs, but now, this \nadministration is depriving these families and their children from \nreceiving basic necessities.\n  I am glad my colleague from Massachusetts has raised the issue beyond \njust the numbers and statistics we cite.\n  These are real people and real lives out there struggling to make \nends meet. And now the Republican leadership is depriving this body a \nchance to vote on this amendment which would prohibit the \nadministration from moving forward with their overtime proposal. I am \nglad my colleague made the point about the firefighters, about the EMT \nservices, about the police officers. These are the first responders on \nhomeland security. This administration is not only turning their back \non veterans and people in uniform who are going to be shoved into the \nclass of not getting overtime pay, but even our first responders now \nare going to be asked to pay a price as well.\n  Let's vote on the Harkin amendment. Let's have an up-and-down vote to \ndetermine whether or not this body believes overtime pay ought to still \nbe the law of the land and not relegated to a handful of people.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his efforts. I am glad to \njoin with him as a cosponsor of the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I underline once again what the Senator \nfrom Connecticut has been saying about the average wage in 2001. The \naverage wage of the jobs we lost in 2001 was $44,570, according to the \nBureau of Labor Statistics. The average wage of the jobs we are gaining \ntoday is $35,000, down 21 percent. This is outside of the overtime. \nThese are the new jobs. This is the average wage today of the new jobs \nbeing created, $35,000; $44,000 of the jobs we lost in 2001.\n  This is what is happening, and we are saying to these workers: Well, \nthat is not bad enough. We are going to deny you overtime pay. We have \nbeen denying you an increase in the minimum wage for 7 years. We are \ngoing to deny you unemployment compensation--90,000 people a week. \nThese are the facts. The average wage of jobs lost was $44,570 to but \nonly $35,410 for the jobs gained.\n  As this chart shows you, American workers are working longer and \nharder than workers in any other industrial nation in the world. Look \nat this line right over here. The United States is right at the top. \nAmericans are working longer, they are working harder, and they are \nfalling further and further and further and further behind. And what is \nthe answer of this administration? Cut overtime. We can do better. What \nis the answer of the Republican leadership? Deny us a chance to do \nsomething about it. That is what we are faced with.\n  Well, it seems to me that hopefully Americans will have their answer \nsometime soon. If we are not able to on this bill, I know the Senators \nfrom Connecticut and Illinois share my view. I know the Senator from \nIowa does. This is just the beginning. This is the opening shot. I tell \nour Republican friends, this issue is coming at you again and again and \nagain. Make no mistake about it. You don't like to vote on it? Too bad. \nThese families are suffering out there, and we are going to keep \nbringing this up, again and again and again and again, until you do \nvote on it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. I think what we hear in this discussion should be \ndescribed in simple terms to those following this debate. We are \nasking, on the floor of the Senate, for an up-or-down vote for Members \nto be counted on the question of whether the Bush administration will, \nfor the first time in the history of the law, restrict overtime pay to \nAmerican workers.\n  Since the law was created in 1938 establishing overtime, each \nsuccessive administration that has changed the law--Democrat \nand Republican--has expanded the class of workers eligible for \novertime.\n\n  But this time, this administration, which has witnessed almost 3 \nmillion jobs eliminated in America, has now suggested that we should \nreduce and eliminate overtime for 8 million American workers.\n  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, it is part of a pattern. The \nBush administration is not sensitive to the real needs of working \nfamilies. They have resisted the efforts of the Senator from \nMassachusetts to increase the minimum wage for 7 years. Think about how \nmany people are working one, two, and three jobs to try to put enough \nmoney together to keep their families in a good home, to pay their \nbasic bills. Yet they resist increases in the minimum wage.\n  Then, when you ask them about these jobs going overseas, the Bush \nadministration's economic adviser says the outsourcing of jobs to India \nand China is a good thing. Where does he live? Where does he get his \nadvice? This man is trapped in a textbook. He should get out on Main \nStreet and talk to real families. The outsourcing of jobs overseas is \nnot a good thing. It is costing us jobs in America.\n  When the Senators from Massachusetts and Connecticut stand up and \nsay, well, for goodness' sake, at least take pity on unemployed \nAmericans, help them keep their families together, pay for their health \ninsurance now that they have lost their jobs, consistently, on the \nfloor of the Senate, the other party--the Republican Party--votes \nagainst the extension of unemployment benefits.\n  In my State we have thousands of people unemployed who have no \nbenefits coming in. How do you keep it together under those \ncircumstances?\n  And the last point--an important one we are discussing--is the idea \nthat we would eliminate overtime pay for 8 million workers. I think the \nSenator has made such a positive and important point. Who are these \nworkers? They are firefighters; they are policemen; they are nurses.\n  I do not know about the State of Massachusetts. In the State of \nIllinois, we have a serious shortage of nurses. Hospitals come to me \nand say: Can you help us bring nurses in from the Philippines and \noverseas? We don't have enough nurses. And this administration says we \nare going to eliminate overtime pay for nurses? What will that do to \nus? Fewer and fewer health care professionals in hospitals cannot make \nAmerica healthier or safer, and that is what they are proposing.\n  But today I believe the Senator from Massachusetts has brought to us \nthe icing on the cake. Now we have this administration saying, when it \ncomes to overtime, if you happen to be a soldier in the military or an \nactivated guardsman or reservist, and you serve your country, and are \ntrained in service, pick up skills, when you come home, because of this \nBush administration proposal, you will be disqualified from overtime \npay.\n  It is almost incredible to say those words: That men and women leave \ntheir families with the 233rd unit of the Illinois National Guard, \nmilitary police, and are gone for a year over in Iraq--who are coming \nhome in a few weeks, thank God; their families have waited patiently--\nbut if they made the mistake of picking up a new skill while they were \nactivated, they could be disqualified from overtime pay when they \nreturn to their job. That is exactly what the Bush administration is \nproposing.\n  We hear so many speeches about how Members of the Senate are going to \nstand up for fighting soldiers, stand up for the vets. I ask the \nSenator from Massachusetts, when it comes to the Bush proposal to \neliminate overtime for those vets who have been trained in the \nmilitary, how can this possibly be a demonstration of our support and \nadmiration for the men and women in uniform?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, it is beyond comprehension, I say to the Senator,\n\n[[Page S2967]]\n\nthat in this proposal the administration has yielded to the \nrecommendation of the National Association of Manufacturers, that those \nwho get special skills in the military would not qualify for overtime. \nAnd I read that particular provision in the proposed regulation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the paragraph in the Record, dated \nMarch 31, of the proposed rules that talk about training in the Armed \nForces.\n\n                [From the Federal Register Mar. 31, 2003]\n\n        (d) The phrase ``customarily acquired by a prolonged \n     course of specialized intellectual instruction'' generally \n     restricts the exemption to professions where specialized \n     academic training is a standard prerequisite for entrance \n     into the profession. The best prima facie evidence that an \n     employee meets this requirement is possession of the \n     appropriate academic degree. However, the word \n     ``customarily'' means that the exemption is also available to \n     employees in such professions who have substantially the same \n     knowledge level as the degreed employees, but who attained \n     such knowledge through a combination of work experience, \n     training in the armed forces, attending a technical school, \n     attending a community college or other intellectual \n     instruction.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is right in there. And it was requested by the \nNational Association of Manufacturers. They made a comment about how \nhappy they are it is in there. It is one of the most offensive \nproposals this administration has made.\n  I want to just make a final comment and respond to what the Senator \nhas mentioned with regard to the nurses because this is so important, \nas I know the Senator is concerned about the issue of the quality of \nhealth care.\n  This is from Cathy Stoddart of Mingo Junction, OH, a nurse at the \nAllegheny Regional Hospital in Pittsburgh:\n\n       . . . President Bush and the Republican members of the \n     House and Senate are trying to take away the one thing that \n     discouraged hospital administrators from forcing nurses to \n     work overtime. If you think nurses are running away now, just \n     wait until their employers start telling them they have to \n     work a 20 hour shift and aren't getting overtime pay for a \n     single minute of it!\n\n  This proposal affects the quality of health care. We talked about the \nstandard of living for working families and the challenges they are \nfacing over a lack of an increase in the minimum wage, over the lack of \nunemployment compensation, and now there is the overtime proposal. This \nis going to have a dramatic impact and adverse effect on the quality of \nhealth care in this country. And for what? And that is because of the \nurging of the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of \nCommerce urging the administration to find a way to cut back on \novertime for 8 million workers in this country.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois for raising not only what this \nissue is going to mean for working families, but what the impact is \ngoing to be on, in this case, health care and other vital services.\n  We have talked about veterans. In that regard, I bring to the \nattention of the Senator Randy Fleming, who writes:\n  I am also proud to say that I am a military veteran. I have worked \nfor Boeing for 23 years. The training I received in the Air Force \nqualified me for a good civilian job. The second thing is overtime pay. \nWith the overtime, I have paid for my kid's college education. The \nchanges this administration is trying to make in the overtime \nregulations would break the government's bargain with the men and women \nin the military, close down the opportunities that working vets and \ntheir families thought they could count on.\n  When I signed up back in 1973, the Air Force and I made a deal that I \nthought was fair. They got a chunk of my time and I got training to \nhelp me build the rest of my life. There was no part of the deal that \nsaid I would have to give up my right to overtime pay. You have heard \nof the marriage penalty. I think what these new rules do is create a \nmilitary penalty. If you get your training in the military, no matter \nwhat your white-collar profession is, your employer can make you work \nas many hours as they want and not pay an extra dime. If that is not a \nbait and switch, I don't know what is.\n  I have no doubt employers will take advantage of this new opportunity \nto cut our overtime pay. They will say if they can't take out our \novertime pay, they will have to eliminate the jobs. It won't be just \nthe bad employers because these rules will make it very hard for \ncompanies to do the right thing. The veterans and other working people \nwill be stuck with less time, less money, and a broken deal.\n  There it is, in real life, Randy Fleming, a veteran who looks down \nthe road in the eyes of his children, hard working, played by the \nrules, served our country, acquired some skills, and he is looking to \nthe future.\n  This is a lousy proposal. It doesn't deserve to be favorably \nconsidered. But our Republican friends are refusing us, denying us the \nopportunity to get a vote on it. I know the Senator from Iowa would be \nwilling to agree to an hour of debate, a half hour of debate, 15 \nminutes of debate--we know what the issues are--to get a vote. The idea \nto use the rules of the Senate to deny the Senate the ability to \nexpress its will on this issue is an enormous insult to working \nfamilies all across the country and one they will not forget easily.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his continued \nstrong support of our working families, especially on the issues of the \nminimum wage and overtime. I was listening to the Senator talk about \nthe issue dealing with training in the armed services. I ask the \nSenator, is it not true that since 1938, when we have gone through \nWorld War II, the Korean War, the cold war, the Vietnam War, Gulf War, \neverything else, during that time our young men and women who served in \nthe military who got training and then later got out were still \neligible for overtime pay regardless of the kind of training they got?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. I welcome his \nhistorical memory on this issue. We have been involved in conflicts--\nVietnam, Korean War, World War II--with Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, and at no time during those conflicts did we ever say \nthe skills that were developed in the military were going to \neffectively preclude you from receiving overtime. This is the first \ntime with this administration. The Senator is correct.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator further, would this not then set up the \noddest kind of circumstance with a veteran and a nonveteran? Let's say \ntwo young people just got out of high school. They see these ads on \ntelevision that say join the Army, be all you can be, get all this \ntraining to help you out. One friend decides to go in the Army. The \nother doesn't. It is a volunteer force. The person who goes in the Army \ngets training as an aerospace mechanic on engines or something like \nthat, and comes out. The other person has not gone in the military, has \ndifferent jobs, gets some kind of on-the-job training. Could this not \nset up a circumstance where if both of them were working for the same \ncompany, the person who entered the military and got that training, \nbecause of the way it is written in the rules, could be classified \nexempt from overtime, and the person who didn't go in the military \nwould still get the overtime for the same exact job? Wouldn't this be \nthe kind of situation that could arise?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The overtime rule is unfair. As the Senator knows, \nparticularly today, when so much of the combat arms are National \nGuard--probably 40 percent of the combat arms in Iraq today are \nNational Guard and Reserve--these are people getting these skills, \ngoing back home, and getting the jobs. They are not staying in there 5, \n7, 10 years. They are receiving these skills now, and these skills are \nnecessary in terms of protecting the members of their squad or unit, to \nensure that the military mission is going to be advanced.\n  I would be interested in the Senator's reaction. I mentioned Randy \nFleming, who is a military veteran and served in the Air Force from \n1973 to 1979, got training in the military, and used overtime to pay \nfor the tuition of his children. He says: When I went in the service, I \nwent in the service to get that training. No one told me that after I \nserved 6 years in the Air Force and got my training, that in the \ntwilight period of my life, because I received that training 20 years \nago, I am going to be denied the overtime pay I had planned to put \naside to educate my daughter. No one told me, he said in his letter. \nYou talk about a marriage penalty. Here it is, a penalty against us. \nWhere\n\n[[Page S2968]]\n\nis the fairness? Where is the justice? Isn't the word of the United \nStates good on this?\n  I commend the Senator for bringing up this historical background \nbecause we have never done that to the veterans.\n  I mentioned earlier the letter to Secretary Chao from Thomas Corey: \nWe would like to make you aware that the modification of the rules \nwould give the employers the ability to prohibit veterans from \nreceiving overtime pay based on the training they received. This \nlegitimizes the already extensive problem of vetism, discrimination \nagainst veterans.\n  This is it. I put the section in the Record of the proposal. I think \nthere are many reasons to be against this proposal, but the signal it \nsends to the families of our servicemen couldn't be more unfortunate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening with interest to my \ncolleagues from Massachusetts and Iowa talk about the overtime issue. I \nwas thinking about this in the context of jobs.\n  One of the great debates we have is an economy that apparently is \ngrowing but producing really no new jobs. We are about 2.5 million jobs \ndown from 3 years ago. Last month's jobs numbers were pretty anemic--I \nthink 12,000 jobs, almost all of them government jobs.\n  I was thinking about the announcement 2 weeks ago that scheduled to \ncreate this manufacturing jobs czar that had been promised last fall. \nThe administration is going to create a jobs czar because they are \nconcerned about jobs, so they announced a ceremony that was going to be \nheld to introduce their jobs czar. And then just before it happens, it \nis called off because the jobs czar is in China visiting his \nmanufacturing plant he has moved from Nebraska to China. Everybody in \nthe Administration was embarrassed about that. They are going to have a \njobs czar that actually moved some of his American jobs to China. He \nwas over there visiting his employees when the President was prepared \nto announce a new jobs czar for U.S. jobs.\n  It seems to me that the 40-hour workweek has always been about \ncreating jobs, because if you can work employees 50 hours, 60 hours, 70 \nhours, and there is no consequence to it, then you don't have to create \nnew jobs.\n  You just work your current employees overtime, on and on. But for 60 \nor 70 years in this country we have decided if you are required to work \nmore than 40 hours a week, you have a right to be paid overtime. That \nis incentive to create jobs for the amount of work that is available or \nnecessary for that amount over 40 hours. So at a time when we are \nlosing jobs, and when jobs are the issue, I ask my colleague from Iowa, \nisn't it the case this overtime proposal actually retards the creation \nof new jobs, and to keep the 40-hour workweek and to get rid of this \ngoofy proposal from the Department of Labor would actually be job \ncreating?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senator has put his finger on it. This \nproposal by the administration to take away the rights of up to 8 \nmillion Americans on overtime is what I call a job-killing proposal. \nThe Senator is absolutely right. It is common sense.\n  Look, if you have people working and you can work them over 40 hours \nand not pay them time and a half, but regular pay, why would you hire \nanybody else? You would just work them longer. In fact, I say to the \nSenator--and he may well be aware of this--when they put out the \nproposed rules, they put out certain examples on how employers could \nget around paying overtime. One of the proposals--I will read it into \nthe Record later; I have done it previously--was to say, look, what you \ndo is simply reclassify your workers; you then pay them a little bit \nless, but work them longer so your out-of-pocket expenses are the same, \nbut you work them over 40 hours a week. What a deal.\n  This is like the IRS telling people how to cheat on their taxes and \ngiving them information on how to get around the IRS Code. At a time \nwhen we need jobs in this country, this is another disincentive to \ncreating jobs. Not only do they want to outsource jobs to other \ncountries, I say to my friend; they now want to tell the American \nworker to work longer every week and don't expect to get paid any more \nfor it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As I walked over to the Chamber a few moments ago, it \noccurred to me there is almost never someone walking around this \nbuilding, or standing out in front of the building who is advocating on \nbehalf of working families, saying my job is to be here to make sure \nthe voice of working families is heard in the Halls of Congress. There \nare a lot of people with shiny shoes, suspenders, and Cohiba cigars \nhere and they are paid well to look after the big interests of this \ncountry, and they do a great job, God bless them. But the fact is \nworking families don't have so much influence, regrettably, in \nWashington, DC. They don't have people here looking after their \ninterests.\n  I am talking about those families in this country who know about \nsecond jobs. Why? Because they work second jobs. They know about second \nshifts. Why? Because they have the second-shift job. They know about \nsecondhand, they know about second mortgages, and about second \neverything. Now they are worried about job security and about whether \nthey will keep their jobs, about whether their jobs will be exported to \nChina because they cannot compete with 33-cent labor. Now they have to \nworry about a proposal that says, for 70 years we have had a 40-hour \nworkweek, and we are thinking of changing that so the big employers \nhave the opportunity to work you 50 hours a week or 60 hours a week if \nwe choose.\n  We go to bed at night in this country feeling good and safe. Why? \nBecause the men and women from our police forces are driving up and \ndown the streets to keep us safe. We go to bed not worrying about fires \nbecause we have firefighters out there who are awake all night. Many of \nthem work extra hours and are paid overtime for it. That is an \nimportant part of their family's income.\n  Now we are told by the Department of Labor we would like to change \nall that after almost 70 years; we don't think employers ought to pay \novertime. My colleague had it right. In fact, the sole job of some \nconsulting companies it is to say to corporations, we are going to find \na way with these rules to allow you not to have to pay overtime to your \nemployees. I don't understand it.\n\n  I watched this morning when my colleague from Iowa was on the floor. \nI don't understand why we are not voting on this amendment. We voted on \nit before. The Senate already expressed itself. We said we support this \namendment. I don't have the foggiest idea what those who are now \nscheduling this place think they are accomplishing. This isn't going \naway. This is going to be voted on. Perhaps not 5 minutes from now, \nmaybe not 5 hours from now, but the Senate will vote. When the Senate \nvotes on this, the Senate is going to say the Department of Labor \nshould not be allowed to promulgate those rules. Why? Because the \nSenate, by and large, has a sense of fairness about this. The only way \nthe leadership can stop this is to prevent a vote.\n  That is why we are here today, trying to force a vote. But those who \nhave their foot in the door are doing it for one reason. They would \nlose a vote if they had it. They are going to have it and lose it. It \nwill probably be tomorrow or next week, but this vote will happen and \nthey are going to lose it. Why? Because there is a basic sense of \nfairness, in my judgment.\n  Finally, I come back to the proposition I started with. This kind of \nrule at this point is a way of saying we don't need more jobs in this \ncountry. Eliminating overtime for 6 or 8 million people is a way of \nsaying we don't care about creating jobs. If you cannot work people \novertime, over 40 hours, without paying time and a half--if you cannot \ndo that, you have to create jobs to do the extra work. That is the way \nthe system works. That is what has allowed the economy to grow. That is \nwhat produces new jobs.\n  Those who now support this proposition--the administration, \nDepartment of Labor, the majority party in Congress--that these \novertime rules ought to be changed after 60-some years and prevent \novertime payments to 6 million or 8 million people, they are the ones \nwho are saying, apparently, we don't need new jobs in this\n\n[[Page S2969]]\n\ncountry. They don't stand for creating new jobs. I cannot think of a \nworse position to take at this point than, in the face of diminishing \njobs and jobs moving overseas and outsourcing and those issues, for \nsomebody to come to this floor and say, by the way, let's cut down even \nmore on jobs by forcing people to work longer without paying them \novertime. This makes no sense to me at all.\n  Again, my colleague is doing a service to the Senate by standing here \nand saying we are going to vote on this.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield. Again, I thank the Senator \nfrom North Dakota for not forgetting his populace roots of North \nDakota. When the Senator speaks on the floor, as he just has, he speaks \nwith clarity, common sense, and the wisdom of the common man and woman. \nThat is why I have always admired the Senator from North Dakota.\n  What he has just said strikes right at the heart of what the common \nman and woman in this country feel--that their rights to at least \novertime pay, if they are working over 40 hours, are being taken away \nwithout their having anything to say about it.\n  As the Senator pointed out very clearly, we are not being allowed our \nright to represent the common man and woman--his constituents in North \nDakota, my constituents in Iowa, or anywhere else in this country--in \ngetting a vote on the Senate floor as to whether we will permit the \nadministration to take away those overtime rights.\n  I say to the Senator this is something that should not be allowed to \nhappen on the Senate floor. I thank the Senator for his stalwart \nsupport for our working men and women and for insisting we have a vote \non this Senate floor. The Senator is absolutely right that we are \nhaving all kinds of games being played, all kinds of little \nparliamentary tricks, so we will not vote on this.\n  There is one other thing I want to ask the Senator from North Dakota, \nwho also has a keen insight and judgment on issues dealing with \nfairness and taxation and jobs going overseas.\n  This morning, the senior Senator from Iowa, who is the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, went on to talk about how if we do not pass this \nbill there are going to be tariffs because the WTO said we are in \nviolation, and so therefore we have to change the law or we are going \nto have to start paying tariffs.\n  I am reading from what basically he said this morning: The sanctions \nbegan on March 1, 5 percent. The Senator from Iowa said: It is like a \n5-percent sales tax on everything we are going to sell overseas or \nstuff we are going to sell overseas. He said by March it would be 5 \npercent; 6 percent in April; 7 percent in May; 8 percent in June; 9 \npercent in July; 10 percent in August; 11 percent in September; 12 \npercent by November.\n  So will the Senator from North Dakota help me clear up my thinking on \nthis? I hear now that the Republicans, since they do not want to vote \non the overtime amendment, may actually pull the bill, kill this bill, \nwhich means then we will have to pay tariffs to Europe, we will have to \npay a penalty, that may amount, according to the Senator from Iowa, up \nto $4 billion a year. Am I correct, I ask the Senator from North \nDakota, that they would rather pay tariffs to Europe than overtime to \nour workers?\n  That is what they are saying. If they pull this bill, we will have to \npay these tariffs; we will be paying money to Europe but we will not be \npaying overtime. Does the Senator from North Dakota see it that way, \nthat somehow because they do not want to vote on overtime they will pay \ntariffs to Europe but not overtime to our people? I ask the Senator \nfrom North Dakota what kind of fairness is there to our working people \nin that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is an interesting construct of the debate, and I \nthink a reasonably accurate one. This underlying bill, while it has \nsome flaws, would pass the Senate, in my judgment, and will pass the \nSenate. Those who are the architects of the bill and bring it to the \nfloor want to bring it in a circumstance where they say, oh, by the \nway, this is our idea and you cannot add any of your ideas to it.\n  What the Senator from Iowa is doing is using the only alternative \navailable to him to try to stop something that diminishes and destroys \njobs in this country and destroys the opportunity to create more jobs.\n  The Senator from Iowa is perfectly within his rights to offer this \namendment. The Senate already expressed itself on this amendment. \nRepublicans and Democrats have said: We believe we ought to stop the \nDepartment of Labor from issuing these rules on overtime. It is not a \nradical position. The Senate has already taken this position. It had \nthe vote.\n  I conclude by trying to put this in some perspective. I find it \ninteresting that there are people in our political system who like \norganized labor as long as it is overseas. I will describe a story of \nsomething that happened. My colleague was perhaps there at the time. \nThere was a joint session of Congress held in Washington, DC. As joint \nsessions are in almost all cases, it was a majestic situation. The \nHouse and Senate come together in the House Chamber. It is normally \nwhen the President gives a State of the Union Address, but sometimes a \nforeign leader is invited to speak to a joint session of Congress.\n  On this day, at the backdoor of the House of Representatives, a man \nwas introduced to a joint session as Lech Walesa from Poland. I will \nnever forget the day because this man, probably 5'8\" tall, kind of \nchubby cheeks, red cheeks and a handlebar mustache, walked to the front \nof the room of the House and the applause began. It went on and on and \non and on.\n  Then this man, no politician, no diplomat, no scholar, no \nintellectual, no military hero, told his story. I will never forget the \nspeech he gave that day. The story briefly was this: He was a worker in \na shipyard in Gdansk, Poland. He had been fired from his job as an \nelectrician because he was leading a strike to organize workers. He was \nfired by the Communist government. On a Saturday morning, he was back \nin the shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, leading a strike of workers in that \nshipyard once again against the Communist government. He told us that \nthe Communist secret police grabbed him and beat him severely. They \ntook him to the edge of the shipyard and they hoisted him up \nunceremoniously over the barbed wire fence and threw him on the other \nside of the fence in this shipyard in Gdansk, Poland.\n\n  He told us that he lay there face down bleeding. Remember, this is an \nunemployed electrician who was leading a strike for a free labor \nmovement against a Communist government. He lay there on that Saturday \nmorning, bleeding face down in the dirt, wondering what to do next. The \nhistory books, of course, tell us what he did next. He pulled himself \nback up, climbed right back over the fence into that shipyard, and then \n10 years later he was introduced in the House of Representatives to a \njoint session of the Congress as the President of the country of \nPoland.\n  This is what he said to us: We did not have any guns. The Communist \ngovernment had all the guns. We did not have any bullets. The Communist \ngovernment had all the bullets. We were only armed with an idea, and \nthat is workers ought to be free to choose their own destiny. He said: \nMy friends, ideas are more powerful than guns.\n  This man was no intellectual, no politician or diplomat, he was an \nunemployed electrician. And 10 years later he walked into this building \nas the President of his country, saying that workers have rights.\n  Our country embraced him. Our country embraced the effort and the \nsacrifice by Lech Walesa and so many others in the country of Poland in \nsupport of workers rights, in support of labor unions, in support of \nthe very things we are talking about today.\n  It is interesting that it was Lech Walesa and Poland that lit the \nfuse that created a free Eastern Europe. In country after country, he \nlit the fuse that started it all and changed the world--the power of \none and the power of an idea.\n  My colleague from Iowa is talking about the power of an idea, and \nthis is not a new idea; it is a timeless truth. Yes, there are some \ntimeless truths, and that is working people have a right to expect to \nbe treated fairly. This country is not just about people at the top; \nthis is about people at the top and the bottom and everything in \nbetween.\n  In my part of the country, we understood a century and a half ago, as \nthe\n\n[[Page S2970]]\n\nwagon trains moved across the landscape in North Dakota heading west, \nthat one does not move a wagon train ahead by leaving some wagons \nbehind. We understood that long ago. The same is true with respect to \npolicies in this country, especially economic policies.\n  The things that represented the root and the core of belief for Lech \nWalesa of Poland was represented on the streets of America 75 to 100 \nyears ago about the rights of workers.\n  Business has rights, workers have rights, investors have rights. I \nunderstand all of that. Now we are talking about the right of people \nwho for 60 years have understood the rules, and the rules are that if \none's employer wants to work a person more than 40 hours a week, they \nhave a right to expect to be paid overtime.\n  All of a sudden, for millions of families, law enforcement folks, \nfirefighters and others, this administration wants to say: We are \nchanging that rule; we believe employers have a right to tell you to \nwork 50 or 60 hours and they do not need to pay you overtime.\n  As I said before, that is a quick way to say we do not need to create \nnew jobs. We will just overwork existing workers. It is not fair. There \nis a basic sense of fairness in this Congress. That is why when this is \nvoted on, as it was before, it will pass.\n  The basic contention of Senator Harkin is that this is, at its root, \nunfair. It changes the rules of the game.\n  You can talk a lot about this country of ours. I suppose in political \ncampaigns there is way too much negative talk about our country. But \nthere is a lot right about our country, and much of what has been right \nabout our country has been manifested by people who have gone to the \nstreets and gone to the ballot boxes and effected positive change that \nhas improved the lives of working people and raised an entire middle \nclass in this country which did not previously exist.\n  This is a big issue and an important issue. It is probably not as big \nor important to anybody in this Senate who doesn't get paid overtime. \nBut there are millions of families who rely on overtime, who work hard \nevery day to get the extra hours and get the overtime pay because that \nis the way they send their kids to school and buy their schoolbooks and \nsend their kids to college or buy the spring clothing--to those \nfamilies, it is important. I come back again to say those are the \nfamilies who know about second: Second choice, second mortgage, second \nshift, second job, and too often, in my judgment, they get shortchanged \nhere in Congress.\n  But they will not, I repeat not, be shortchanged if the Senator from \nIowa and I and others who demand a vote on this provision get a vote \nbecause we will win that vote. We won it before in the Senate. We will \nwin it again. When we win that vote, we will stop the Department of \nLabor from doing this, and we will, in my judgment, have advanced two \nthings: No. 1, the respect for the rights of American workers; and, No. \n2, we will have forced the creation of additional jobs in this country, \nsomething that is desperately needed at a time when we see far too many \njobs going overseas.\n  I don't know what the time situation is of the Senator from Iowa, but \nI want to make one more comment. I talk about jobs overseas because it \nis the core of this issue about jobs that brings me to the floor to \ntalk about overtime. I have spoken a good number of times about this \nissue and I am going to talk one more time for a minute.\n  The symbol of outsourcing of jobs is for me Huffy bicycles. We all \nknow about Huffy bicycles. They are 20 percent of the American \nmarketplace. Buy a good Huffy bicycle, buy it at Sears, Kmart, buy it \nat Wal-Mart. It used to be made in Ohio by American workers. I am sure \nthey were proud of their jobs. I don't know any of them. Eleven dollars \nan hour they were paid to make Huffy bicycles.\n  Between the handlebar and the fender they put a little decal on Huffy \nbicycles and the decal was the American flag. But Huffy bicycles are \nnot made there anymore. They are made in China. The decal isn't an \nAmerican flag anymore. They changed the decal. In fact, I was told it \nwas the last job the workers in Ohio had to do, was replace on existing \ninventory the American flag decal with a decal of the globe. Huffy \nbicycles are made in China by people making 33 cents an hour, working 7 \ndays a week, 12 to 14 hours a day. The workers in Ohio can't compete \nwith 33 cents an hour. That is the struggle of American workers these \ndays. It is a big struggle. We have big questions to answer. We have \ntrade policies we must try to set right. We have to deal with all these \nissues. We have to find some way to stand up for the interests of \nAmerican jobs and American workers.\n  This overtime issue is just one piece of that, just one piece. But to \nsome families it is everything. It is the way they send their kids to \nschool; it is the way they help pay their mortgage; it is the way they \nhelp provide the income to raise their families. So this is a big deal \nto many families in this country.\n  For the 6 to 8 million families, workers who are affected by this, I \nthink they owe a great debt of gratitude to my friend, Senator Harkin \nfrom Iowa. I will stand with him as will many of my colleagues to say \nhe has a right to get this vote. When we get this vote we are going to \nwin. We are going to do it not because we want to have a political \nargument with anybody; we are going to do it because this is very \nimportant to millions of Americans families who, all too often, are \nleft behind in public policy here in this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from North \nDakota for the eloquence of his statement and I thank Senator Dorgan \nfor his unwavering support through all the years I have been privileged \nto know him and be his friend, his unwavering support for the common \nman and woman in this country, for working families, for our farmers \nand ranchers out in the West and the Midwest.\n  Senator Dorgan is always eloquent in his remarks. As you listen to \nSenator Dorgan speak, you can hear the voice of that average man and \nthat average woman out there who are not big time lobbyists down here \non K Street; as Senator Dorgan said, they don't have the shiny shoes \nand suspenders and whatever else. They are out there working every day, \nfeeding and clothing their families. They have a decent life. They give \ntheir kids a good education. They do what they can to make sure their \nkids have a little bit better life than they have had. It is called the \nAmerican dream. And no one has been a stronger supporter of ensuring \nthat American dream for our working families than the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n  I thank him for all that support through all the years and for \ncarrying on the fight for overtime and making sure our workers are paid \nthe overtime that is due them when they work over 40 hours a week.\n  Earlier today I pointed out the chairman of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, Congressman Thomas from California, according to the \nCongressional Quarterly, told a business group yesterday he thinks this \nforeign tax bill we have before us is doomed. Those were his words. He \npointed the finger at the business community, according to today's \nissue of the national journal Congress Daily. Mr. Thomas, in other \nwords, was blaming K Street lobbyists for this bill's likely demise in \nthe House.\n  It seems to me what we have is a bill that is already being slow-\nwalked by some of the majority leadership in the Senate because the \nleaders on the other side don't want to vote on overtime. I hope we \ndon't hear anything from the other side saying somehow we are to blame \nfor slowing down this bill. We had a unanimous consent agreement. My \namendment was in line to be offered. I offered the amendment in good \nfaith. I was even asking if we could have a time agreement. Imagine \nthat. I offered the amendment. I offered a time agreement. I couldn't \neven be given a time agreement by the other side.\n  Then the Republican side goes ahead and files this motion to recommit \nwith an amendment on it and then they filed cloture and all this \ngobbledygook parliamentary stuff. What it means is we will not vote \ntoday. We will have a cloture vote tomorrow. They will not get cloture. \nThen I hear rumors the leadership on the Republican side will then pull \nthe bill and somehow blame Democrats, blame Democrats, us, our side, \nfor not getting this bill through.\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\n  I will tell you, talk about chutzpah. That is like the person who \nwent before the judge for having killed his parents and then threw \nhimself on the mercy of the court because he was an orphan.\n  The other side is responsible for killing this bill. Have no doubt. \nMake no bones about it. They are responsible because they don't want to \nvote on overtime. They don't want to vote. They get kind of wobbly in \nthe knees. Their ankles get weak. They break out in a cold sweat when \nthey think they might have to vote on whether to uphold the \nadministration's proposed rules that will take overtime pay away from \nhard-working American families. They have to vote against the \nadministration.\n  Sometimes we are called upon to represent our constituents. As hard \nas that may be to believe by some, sometimes we are called upon to \nrepresent our constituents, not the administration but to represent our \npeople.\n  The administration may want to take away overtime pay. That may be \ntheir position. But at least we ought to have the right to vote on \nwhether we ought to uphold that decision.\n  I know it may come as a shock to many Americans, but sometimes we are \nnot allowed to vote in the Senate. We are not allowed to vote on an \namendment. I have my amendment pending. They won't let us vote on it \nbecause they filed this cloture motion, this parliamentary device.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota said, I don't care how many times we \nhave to be here. We will be back, we will be back, we will be back to \nvote on whether we are going to take overtime pay away from American \nworkers.\n  If we don't vote on it tomorrow, we will vote on it some other time, \nor my friends on the other side will continue to pull bill after bill \nafter bill because they don't want to vote on it. Maybe they think they \ncan just go ahead and issue the final regulations. Then it will be sort \nof a fait accompli. Evidently, we will not do anything.\n  I am sorry, Mr. President. If that is the case, we will be back with \nan amendment to say they will not go into effect until we have had open \nand public hearings on these regulations.\n  We will have a vote on it. My friends on the other side of the aisle \nare just putting off the inevitable. Maybe for one reason or another \nthey don't want this bill to go through anyway. That is kind of an odd \nposition, as I said to the Senator from North Dakota. As the chairman \nof the committee said this morning, under the international agreements \nwe have on trade, the World Trade Organization rules that our pretax \npolicy is an illegal export subsidy, and consequently the WTO has \nauthorized Europe to go up to $4 billion a year against certain U.S. \nexports. The sanctions began on March 1. They started at 5 percent. \nThen they go up 1 percent a month, all the way up to 17 percent over \nthe course of a year. I don't want to pay those tariffs. I don't want \nto pay those penalties.\n  I would like to get this bill through. The other side, though, simply \nbecause they do not want a vote on overtime, is saying they are going \nto go ahead and pay these tariffs. It seems to me what they are saying \nis they would rather pay tariffs to Europe than overtime to workers. \nThat is exactly what is happening. Pay the tariffs to Europe but don't \npay overtime to our workers.\n  A lot has been said about the American worker and working families. I \nwonder how many people know that right now American workers work longer \nper year than anyone else in the industrialized world. This chart shows \nit. For the years 2002 and 2003, American workers are working in the \nUnited States almost 2,000 hours a year--more than Australia, Japan, \nSpain, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, or Germany. Not only \nare we working longer hours per year, we are now being told if we work \novertime we will not get paid for it.\n  Do you know what is going to happen if these rules go into effect? \nThis bar will go way up because then employers will work their \nemployees longer because they don't have to pay them overtime. We \nalready work longer.\n  What is the history of this bill? This kind of gets to the crux again \nof what is happening here with the proposed rules on overtime. I said \nlast summer when I offered this amendment and it was adopted by the \nSenate, the biggest impact of taking away overtime pay protection would \nbe on women. People wondered why I said that. Why would women be \nimpacted most? For two reasons: One, because the annual hours worked by \nmiddle-income wives with children in 1979 were 895 hours a year. By the \nyear 2000, that had gone to 1,308 hours a year. Women with children are \nworking more--not quite double but almost--than what they were a mere \n21 years ago.\n\n  Most of these jobs are in certain types of clerical positions in \nwhich women have been engaged. Some of them are in positions which are \ngoing to be reclassified under the proposed rules as ``professions.'' \nThese are the kinds of jobs that are mostly held by working women, and \nmostly by working mothers. The biggest impact will be on working women. \nThe initial wave of impact will be on working women.\n  I have a statement from Susan Moore of Chicago. She said:\n\n       I am currently entitled to time and a half under Federal \n     law. I know for a fact that is the reason I am not required \n     to work long hours like the project managers who are not \n     entitled to overtime pay. My supervisor has to think hard \n     about whether to assign overtime to me because he has to pay \n     for my time. That means more time for my family and that time \n     is important to me. If the law changes and I lose my right to \n     overtime pay, I will be faced with the impossible choice of \n     losing time with my family or losing my job.\n\n  This is a statement from Sheila Perez of Bremerton, WA. She said:\n\n       I began my career as a supply clerk earning $3.10 an hour \n     in 1976. I entered an upward mobility program and received \n     training to become an engineer technician with a career \n     ladder that gave me a yearly boost in income. It seemed, \n     though, that even with a decent raise every year, I really \n     relied on overtime income to help make ends meet.\n       I am a working single parent. There are many more single \n     parents today with the same problem. How does one pay for the \n     car that broke down or the braces for the children's teeth? \n     Overtime income has been the lifesaver to many of us.\n       When I as a working mother leave my 8-hour day job and go \n     home, my second shift begins. There is dinner to cook, dishes \n     to wash, laundry and all the other housework that must be \n     done which adds another 3 to 4 hours to your workday. When \n     one has to put in extra hours at work, it takes away from the \n     time needed to take care of our personal needs.\n\n  Listen to Sheila Perez who is from Bremerton, WA, a single parent. \nShe says:\n\n       It only seems fair that one should be compensated for that \n     extra effort of working overtime. Overtime is a sacrifice of \n     one's time, energy, physical and mental well-being. \n     Compensation should be commensurate in the form of premium \n     pay as it is a premium of one's personal time, energy and \n     expertise that is being used.\n\n  If I might interpret what Sheila Perez is saying, she says: I am a \nsingle parent. I work hard. I rely on overtime. When I get home from \nwork, I have another job taking care of my kids, doing all of my \nlaundry. My time with my kids at home on the weekends is my premium \ntime. If I am being asked to give up my premium time to work on the \njob, I ought to be given premium pay.\n  I can't say it any better than Sheila Perez. Again, it is another \nexample why this is going to hit working women the hardest.\n  I am just notified that CongressDaily, as of 3 p.m., which was only \nabout 40 minutes ago, had this statement. CongressDaily comes out \nduring the day, and at 3 p.m. said:\n\n       A senior GOP leadership aide reiterated today that GOP \n     leaders will refuse a floor vote on the amendment from \n     Senator Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, to strike a labor provision \n     involving overtime pay for white-collar workers.\n\n  I don't know if that is true. It is being reported in CongressDaily \nat 3 p.m. that they will refuse a floor vote on my amendment; refuse \nit. Why is it they get so wobbly in the knees, with weak ankles, and \nbreak out in a cold sweat? Maybe they are just afraid of George Bush. \nMaybe they are afraid of the administration downtown.\n\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, don't be afraid \nof them; be afraid of the people you represent. They are the ones who \npay your salary. They are the ones who vote to send you here. They are \nthe ones whose overtime is being assaulted, not the President and the \npeople down at the White House.\n  Last summer in August, Peter Hart Research Associates, a well-known \nnational pollster, did a poll. This was the question: There is now a \nproposal to change the Federal law that determines which employees have \nthe legal\n\n[[Page S2972]]\n\nright to overtime pay. This proposal would eliminate the right to \novertime pay for 7 million employees who now have that right. Do you \nfavor or oppose this proposal? In favor, 14 percent; oppose,74 percent.\n  That is not even close. I can understand why the other side would not \nwant to vote on this. Maybe they feel dutybound, politically bound, \nparty bound to support their President. Therefore, they would not want \nto vote because they know 74 percent of the American people are opposed \nto this proposal to take away their overtime pay, the right to overtime \npay.\n  This is an issue that strikes, as so many before me have said, at the \nheart of fairness and equity to American workers. What could be more \nfair than if you have to work over 40 hours a week, you have to be paid \ntime-and-a-half overtime? That is the Fair Labor Standards Act, 1938.\n  What is a little known fact is that a debate raged in this country \nfor a long period of time--I would say almost 40 years from the end of \nthe 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, at least until \n1938--on restricting the number of hours that an American worker had to \nwork without getting some kind of extra pay. Remember, in those days we \neven had child labor; we got rid of that. The American workers were \nworking 50, 60, 70 hours a week with no protection by labor unions, no \nrights whatever. Finally, slowly but surely, organized labor grew, more \nand more rights were attained by our workers, and then the debate \nensued about how many hours a week should a worker work without being \npaid overtime.\n  A little known fact: In 1937, this Senate, in this very Chamber in \nwhich we find ourselves today, right here in this Chamber, the Senate, \nin 1937, voted to establish a 30-hour workweek. Imagine, right here in \nthe Senate where we are standing, the Senate, in 1937, voted for a 30-\nhour workweek. The debate ensued, and finally, by 1938 they \ncompromised. The compromise was a 40-hour week with time-and-a-half \novertime. Think about that: the Senate, in 1937, actually voted to \nestablish a 30-hour workweek. Today, we cannot even get a vote in the \nSenate on whether we will pay people overtime to work over 40 hours a \nweek. We cannot get a vote on it.\n  That says something about the difference of the Senate in 1937 from \nthe Senate in 2004. I wonder how many votes the Senate would get today \nif someone offered a vote to establish a 30-hour workweek. Do you think \nit would get 10 votes? In 1937 they got a majority of the votes, right \nhere in the Senate. Yet now they are working longer and longer hours \nevery year. More and more people are being made to work over 40 hours a \nweek and not being paid for it.\n\n  The reason I hear so much is we need to reclassify workers. The \nreclassification they are talking about basically would hit women the \nhardest, would reclassify them as being professional and therefore \nexempt from overtime. Again, they have done this without having one \npublic hearing. I think they thought they could get by with it; just \nissue these rules and that would be the end of it. The American people \nhave spoken loudly and strongly, saying they are not going to sit down \nand let their rights to overtime pay be taken away.\n  Congress Daily, today at 3 p.m. says, quoting a senior GOP leadership \naide, GOP leaders will refuse a floor vote on my amendment.\n  As I said a week or so ago--and I see my colleague from California--\nand I am not in the habit of quoting the present Governor of \nCalifornia, the movie actor, but I will quote him in saying ``I'll be \nback.'' We'll be back. This is not going to go away. If the other side \nthinks by doing these parliamentary tricks that somehow we will give \nup, they are wrong.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. We will not give up because we are fighting for the \nrights of American workers to have justice and fairness in their \nworking conditions. As Sheila Perez said, from Bremerton, WA, if she is \nforced to give up her premium time, her time with her family, she ought \nto get premium pay.\n  We will continue to fight for this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was hoping my friend would stay. I would like to ask a \nseries of questions and give him some information. Does the Senator \nhave the time to stay?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Why don't I yield the floor so the Senator can be \nrecognized.\n  Before I do, let me thank my colleague from California, Senator \nBoxer, for her longtime unyielding support for our working families. No \none has fought harder, more consistently, and with such eloquence than \nthe Senator from California. I know the people of California recognize \nin Senator Boxer they have a fighter who will not give up and who will \nnot back down in fighting for their families' rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend, Senator Harkin, for his \nwonderful words. It means so much to me coming from him, someone who \nhas been in this Senate for so many years, a voice of the working \npeople. By the way, that is most of the people in this country who have \nto work for a living. In many families, as we know, two people are \nworking, and in many families they work overtime to be able to pay the \nbills and college tuition and health care, and on and on. This issue is \ncrucial.\n  I also thank Senator Baucus for being so strong in his support of \nallowing a vote on this amendment.\n  It is very important because, as my friend said today at lunch--I had \nthe honor of listening to Senator Harkin speak as he made the point--\nhow can you do a jobs bill and not look at the issue of overtime, which \nif the administration has its way will be taken away from probably 8 \nmillion people? As my friend, Senator Harkin, relayed the history, it \nis a stunning situation that we find ourselves refighting the issue of \novertime in the 21st century.\n  I wish to share with my colleague something that is very interesting, \na bit of correspondence that has gone back and forth. When I saw \nSecretary Chao--by the way, I find her to be a very nice person. I like \nher. We have a very nice personal relationship. This is not personal. I \nasked her about the regulation. I said: My people at home are very \nafraid of this regulation because they think they will be denied \novertime.\n  She said: Oh, it's hardly going to affect anybody.\n  I said: All right. Instead of asking you about every category, let me \ntell you that my police men and women, my firefighters, and my \nparamedics--my first responders--are very concerned about losing their \novertime.\n  She said: Senator Boxer, not a chance. This is not even going to \nhappen.\n  So I wrote her a letter, and I said: Secretary Chao, you know I \noppose this. I am very worried about it. Can you please explain to me \nwhy I should not be worried? So she writes back a letter. I wrote her \non February 9, and on February 26 I was very pleased that she answered \nthe letter, and she explains why, in her opinion, firefighters and \nfirst responders and policemen will not be impacted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nmy letter to Secretary Chao and her response.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Hart Senate Office Building,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2004.\n     Secretary Elaine L. Chao,\n     U.S. Department of Labor,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Chao: As you know, I object to the \n     Department's proposed regulations on ``white collar'' \n     overtime exemptions to the Fair Labor Standards Act. The \n     proposed changes threaten overtime pay protections for \n     millions of Americans. I oppose any proposal that threatens \n     overtime pay for vast numbers of hardworking Americans.\n       I have heard from a variety of professionals with concerns \n     about this rule. I am particularly concerned that the \n     International Union of Police Associations (IUPA) estimates \n     that 50% of police officers would lose overtime protection \n     under the current DOL proposal. And, according to the \n     American Nurses Association, ``this proposed rule could \n     virtually eliminate every registered nurse in an \n     `administrative position' from overtime pay.'' According to \n     the Economic Policy Institute, 234,000 licensed practical \n     nurses would lose their overtime protection under your \n     proposal.\n       I know that you disagree with that conclusion. You \n     testified before the Senate in January that the Department's \n     overtime reform\n\n[[Page S2973]]\n\n     proposal ``will not eliminate protections for police \n     officers, firefighters, paramedics, and other first \n     responders.'' You went on to add other professions that would \n     not be affected including nurses.\n       First responders themselves disagree with your claim. I \n     write to ask you to explicitly exclude these categories of \n     workers from your final rule. That would provide the \n     certainty our first responders need to ease their fears of \n     losing overtime pay. They stand ready to respond to another \n     crisis resulting from everything from the spread of a deadly \n     virus to a terrorist attack. As they stand prepared to \n     protect us, the least we can do is protect the overtime pay \n     they deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barbara Boxer\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Secretary of Labor\n\n                                     Washington, DC, Feb 26, 2004.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: Thank you for your letter dated \n     February 9, 2004, regarding the Department of Labor's \n     proposal to update Part 541 of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     regulations, known as the ``white collar exemptions.'' You \n     expressed particular concern about the impact of the proposed \n     regulations on police officers, fire fighters, paramedics, \n     and nurses. I appreciate the opportunity to respond.\n       As I testified on January 20, in a hearing before the \n     Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, we take strong \n     issue with the claim that these reforms--even as proposed--\n     would take away overtime pay from rank and file public safety \n     employees.\n       First, police officers, fire fighters, paramedics, and \n     other first responders are not white collar employees. They \n     do not perform office or non-manual work. By definition, they \n     are not covered by Part 541.\n       Second, a large number of such employees--such as those \n     represented by the International Union of Police \n     Associations--are covered by collective bargaining \n     agreements, which are not affected by the current or proposed \n     regulations. We also believe it is unrealistic for unions to \n     claim that overtime pay granted under a current collective \n     bargaining agreement is likely to be revoked during a new \n     negotiation. That would imply that the union could not obtain \n     any wage or benefit for members outside of what is required \n     by law. For example, that is clearly not the case for \n     registered nurses represented by a union.\n       Third, many public safety employees, as well as nurses, are \n     paid on an hourly basis. Hourly workers are not affected by \n     Part 541 under either the current or proposed rules.\n       Moreover, those public safety employees who are paid on a \n     salary basis and may be earning less than $22,100 a year will \n     immediately gain overtime protection under our proposed rule. \n     They would be among the estimated 1.3 million low-salaried \n     workers who would gain overtime protection who do not have it \n     today. The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), the nation's \n     largest police union, and the International Association of \n     Fire Fighters (IAFF) have stated that they do not oppose the \n     Department's rule. They believe many of their members would \n     benefit by it.\n       Registered nurses (RNs) can already be classified as exempt \n     professionals under current law, based on their education and \n     duties. The proposed regulation makes no change in this \n     regard for registered nurses. The fact is, however, that many \n     RNs are paid on an hourly basis, or are covered by a \n     collective bargaining agreement, and therefore would be \n     entitled to overtime pay under current law. You may be \n     interested to know that the Department of Labor recently \n     collected over $200,000 in back wages for RNs in New Jersey \n     who had been wrongly denied overtime pay.\n       We disagree with the Economic Policy Institute's estimate \n     that 234,000 licensed practical nurses (LPNs) would lose \n     their right to overtime pay. LPNs, with all due respect for \n     their skills and service, would not meet the test for exempt \n     professional under either current law or the proposed \n     regulation.\n       The final regulations are still in development. I can \n     assure you, however, that it is not our intention to deny \n     overtime pay to police officers, fire fighters, paramedics, \n     or LPNs, or to change the current rules with respect to RNs. \n     You and many others have recommended that we make this intent \n     explicit; and, of course, we will take this and all the other \n     comments and opinions that have been put forward into careful \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Elaine L. Chao.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, it did not end there, I say to my friend from Iowa. \nI got a visit from police officers in my office here in Washington, and \nwhat is on their agenda, the first thing? Overtime. I said: Well, look, \nI am going to do everything I can to protect you. I raised this issue \nwith Secretary Chao. She answered my letter. She says you have nothing \nto worry about. Will you please go over her answers, and can you please \ncomment back to me as to what you think of her opinion on whether you \nwill lose overtime?\n  So I have blown up for you to see, I say to Senator Harkin and \nSenator Baucus, something you might be interested in. These quotes go \nside by side.\n  Secretary Chao says in her letter to me:\n\n       First, police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and other \n     first responders are not white collar employees. They do not \n     perform office or non-manual work.\n\n  So, therefore, she is essentially saying they will not fit into this \nrevision of the rules because they are not white-collar employees. This \nis what she says about police officers.\n  This is what my police officers write back:\n\n       Many police officers do not drive black and white patrol \n     vehicles and perform only enforcement/patrol duties. Police \n     officers also serve in investigative and other capacities. As \n     such they do not wear uniforms and a great deal of their work \n     is performed in an office.\n\n  So here she is saying they are not white-collar employees and they \nsay many times their work is in the office.\n\n       In cold case units--\n\n  You know what a cold case is: an old case. They call it a cold case. \nThey just put it aside--\n\n       The vast preponderance of their duties entail reviewing \n     files and records in the office.\n       With the increased use of technology many officers are \n     spending more and more of their time performing office, non-\n     manual type work to facilitate the detection and basis for \n     apprehension of criminal suspects.\n       Without an explicit non-exempt status--\n\n  This is the key point--\n\n       Local agencies interpreting the regulation may well \n     determine that those employees are white collar and perform \n     office work--and then exclude them from overtime coverage. If \n     this were to occur, many of the most talented officers would \n     choose not to be promoted (to the detriment of the \n     Department) due to monetary concerns.\n\n  So with all due respect to Secretary Chao, who is, as I say, a \nfriend, her comment that they are not white-collar employees is not at \nall clear. So that is one difference.\n  Now let's go on to the other differences. This is why my police \nofficers are absolutely in favor of what Senator Harkin wants to do, \nwhich is to reverse the move of the administration.\n  Secretary Chao's letter says:\n\n       Second, a large number of such employees--such as those \n     represented by the International Union of Police \n     Associations--are covered by collective bargaining \n     agreements, which are not affected by the current or proposed \n     regulations. We also believe it is unrealistic for unions to \n     claim that overtime pay granted under a current collective \n     bargaining agreement is likely to be revoked during a new \nnegotiation.\n\n  So that is her second point. First, they say they never do white-\ncollar work. Wrong. Now she says their collective bargaining agreements \ncould never be overturned.\n  Let's see what the California police officers say:\n\n       The clout of independent police associations varies widely. \n     Some would be able to protect their contract-required \n     overtime, others would not. Many overtime provisions in \n     collective bargaining agreements refer to the regulations or \n     statutory requirements. Those overtime provisions would end \n     with statutory or regulatory changes and would not even \n     extend to the next negotiations.\n       To assume that it is ``unrealistic'' that contract \n     provisions once granted would not be revoked is simply \n     ignorant.\n\n  Those are strong statements.\n\n       Contract provisions are frequently revoked during the \n     collective bargaining process. The regulatory or statutory \n     requirements currently in place have held at bay any attack \n     of the overtime agreement.\n       Regulatory and statutory requirements have been a major \n     contributing factor in the successful recovery of moneys owed \n     and withheld by employers in violation of respective \n     collective bargaining agreements.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague for pointing this out. I think this \ndoes clarify it. Because who better to respond than the people being \naffected, the police officers?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from California that this, right here, \nis very instructive:\n\n       We also believe it is unrealistic for unions to claim that \n     overtime pay granted under a current collective bargaining \n     agreement is likely to be revoked during a new negotiation.\n\n  I ask the Senator, am I correct that what she is actually saying is, \nhowever, now overtime pay will be a negotiable item?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. See, now it is nonnegotiable.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly the point.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Am I right on that?\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right. They say right here:\n\n       If it was such a foregone conclusion that represented \n     employees could negotiate and maintain overtime protections \n     absent statutory and regulatory requirements, the law and \n     regulations would never have been made applicable to any \n     workers under a collective bargaining agreement.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from California. This really does \npoint out what is very important.\n  Again, I ask the Senator if I am correct in my interpretation, \nbecause I want to make sure I am clear on this, that right now, for \nthese certain classes that are not being reclassified as it exists, if \nyou work over 40 hours a week, you have a contract negotiation that is \nnot even negotiable because you are covered by overtime law.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right. You have the statutory protection, which \nthey are now going to take away from these workers. They are taking it \naway and saying: Well, you can fix it with your collective bargaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. See, that is it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And she says, you have it anyway in your collective \nbargaining, which is not always the case. I think what the police \nofficers have done, in dissecting this, is to be the truth tellers \nhere.\n  There is one more chart. Secretary Chao says in her letter:\n\n       Third, many public safety employees, as well as nurses, are \n     paid on an hourly basis. Hourly workers are not affected by \n     Part 541 under either the current or proposed rules.\n\n  This is what the California police officers say:\n\n       Employers have made determinations on who is exempt based \n     on the totality of the regulatory requirements. Some will \n     view any modification as a basis to reconsider exempt status. \n     Collective bargaining agreements generally do not state that \n     employees are ``hourly'' employees. Employers would challenge \n     that assertion.\n\n  So that is another point.\n  Then Secretary Chao says:\n\n       Moreover, those public safety employees who are paid on a \n     salary basis and may be earning less than $22,100 a year will \n     immediately gain overtime protection under our proposed rule.\n\n  They say:\n\n       Fine. But this does not apply to and will not affect any \n     California public safety officers.\n\n  Thank God we pay them more than $22,100 to protect our lives and our \nchildren's lives. So that is a useless deal in this category of \nworkers.\n  Lastly, she writes:\n\n       I can assure you, however, that it is not our intention to \n     deny overtime pay to police officers, fire fighters, \n     paramedics, or LPNs, or to change the current rules with \n     respect to RNs.\n\n  Here is what the police officers say:\n\n       We in police work subscribe to a common rule: Say what you \n     mean, mean what you say and memorialize it in print. If the \n     intent is not to deny overtime, then put it in writing.\n\n  By the way, that was in my first letter I sent to Secretary Chao. I \nsaid: You keep saying they are not affected. Why don't you change your \nrule and simply exempt first responders, and then at least my police \nand firefighters and nurses and paramedics will not be so upset.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator has done something of great value to all of \nus by bringing this out. A lot of the time we hear these things, but \nthis puts it in focus.\n  The Secretary says:\n\n       Hourly workers not affected by part 541 under either the \n     current or proposed rules.\n\n  But is there anything in the proposed rules that would prevent an \nemployer from saying: OK, you were an hourly worker. We have now \nreclassified you. You are now a professional. Don't you feel good? You \nare now a professional. And guess what. You don't get overtime.\n  There is nothing to stop them from doing that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Even more to the point, collective bargaining agreements \ngenerally do not state that employees are hourly. So it is very easy \nfor an employer to say: Show me in your contract where it says you are \nhourly, even if you formally are. So people are going to be stuck, and \nthey are not going to get their overtime pay.\n  At the end of the day we have to get back to this bottom line. The \nSecretary says:\n\n       I can assure you, however, it is not our intention to deny \n     overtime pay to police officers, fire fighters, paramedics. . \n     ..\n\n  I say to my friend, put it in writing. I think that is pretty \nobvious. They will not put it in writing.\n  I am so happy that my friend brought this up. When I first approached \nSecretary Chao, we had a very friendly conversation. It was right out \nhere.\n  I said to her: My people are up in arms. Talk to me. What are you \ndoing?\n  Well, it is hardly going to affect anybody, she said.\n  I said: Well, if it is going to affect hardly anybody, why bother? \nThat doesn't make any sense.\n  Then I said: My policemen, my firemen, my first responders are really \nover the top on this.\n  And she said: They are not affected.\n  That is why I wrote to her and said put it in writing. She said: It \nis not necessary, they are exempt because they are not white collar, \nand all the rest.\n  Here we find out from the police officers themselves how silly the \nDepartment of Labor position is because of the fact that many of our \ncriminal cases are solved now on computers in the office, doing \ninvestigatory work.\n  I don't know exactly what is going on except an effort to undermine \nworking conditions and pay for millions of people.\n  I want to read one more letter and then I will leave the floor. This \nis from SGT Mark Nichols, President of the Santa Ana Police Officers \nAssociation in Orange County:\n\n       Public safety in California is facing a major crisis as we \n     try to get back on our feet fiscally. To eliminate the \n     Federal non-exempt provision at this time when dollars are \n     scarce would be akin to placing a huge bull's eye on the \n     already beleaguered morale of our members. We are currently \n     stretched further than is prudent. To give our employers the \n     opportunity possibly of stretching us even further to save an \n     extra buck or two could be devastating to a profession \n     already facing recruitment and retention problems.\n       We are a profession that works 24 hours a day, seven days a \n     week, 365 days a year. I personally left a salaried position \n     to join police work. Being compensated for extra work at the \n     overtime rate was a big factor in my decision. We are \n     continually required to extend our workday or return to work \n     from off duty time. This is a difficult enough job, with its \n     disruptions and hardships placed on our members and our \n     families. To even allow for the possibility that police \n     officers could lose their non-exempt status and overtime \n     provisions is irresponsible.\n\n  I thank my friend. I know he has to go to other Senate business. I \nwill ask for a quorum call in a moment. But I will yield to him for one \nmore comment. I just say thank you on behalf of my police officers, my \nnurses, my first responders. I can't thank you enough.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator, basically, is thanking the wrong person. The \nSenator should look in the mirror if she wants to thank someone. The \npeople of California are privileged to have a fighter like Barbara \nBoxer representing them in the Senate. I mean that. Not only is the \nSenator a personal friend of mine but someone I admire so much because \nshe never backs down. When Senator Boxer speaks, you hear clearly the \nvoices of the common man and woman, the person who doesn't have a voice \nhere, individuals who will never set foot on the Senate floor, who \nnever will be privileged to speak in this hallowed Chamber. The Senator \nfrom California speaks for them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. He made my day. I am so privileged \nthat he would say such words to me. On this issue, we will not back \ndown. We will stand together with many of our colleagues. \nInterestingly, a majority of the Senate already voted with the Senator. \nAll we are asking is give us a vote on behalf of the policemen, the \npolicewomen, the first responders, the firefighters, the nurses, the \nparamedics. Let us make sure we do not take away their overtime pay \nbecause to do so would be an enormous hardship on them and on their \nfamilies at a time when we should be elevating them in status and \nsaying to them, thank you, not only in pictures that we love to show \nwith our arms around them--and we all do that--but in deeds. We really \nmean what we say, and we say you will not lose your overtime pay.\n  I hope we can get a vote on this important amendment and move on to \nthe rest of the bill which is quite important.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2975]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week, I was in Nevada and I visited a \nnumber of police stations and fire stations. Let me direct our \nattention to the Henderson Police Department that I met with. The \nchief, the deputy chief, and a number of police officers were there. It \nwas time for a shift change. A number of hard-working police officers \nwere there. I expected them to talk about homeland security and their \nobligations as first responders. They wanted to talk about that, of \ncourse, about the unfunded mandate passed on to police departments in \nNevada and all over the country. Henderson, NV, is the second largest \ncity in Nevada. By most standards, it is not really large--about \n250,000 people. It is a suburb of Las Vegas, where I went to high \nschool.\n  They didn't want to talk about homeland security and first responders \ninitially; they wanted to know what is happening to their overtime. \nThat is what is on the minds of firefighters and police officers all \nover America. As has been established on the Senate floor in the last 2 \ndays during the pendency of the Harkin amendment and efforts to deprive \nus of a vote on that, people in our country are very concerned about \nwhat this administration is doing regarding overtime. This affects \nabout 8 million working men and women in this country. Specifically, it \nis directed to police officers, who I talked about; firefighters, who I \nhave talked about; and nurses.\n  A group of young people visited me today in my office upstairs. They \nwere here representing a group of young Jewish leaders from Las Vegas. \nI asked them what they were going to do and what they were doing. One \nyoung lady said she was a student studying to be a nurse. She had less \nthan 2 years to go to complete her degree. I didn't say anything, but \nwhat I wanted to say is, Do you know what has happened with this \nadministration? They are trying to take away your overtime. They are \ntrying to make it so that if you are working in a hospital and there is \nwork that needs to be done, you can do it, but you won't get paid for \nit. I didn't say that to her, but that is what I felt like saying.\n  Being a chef now is very in vogue. When I was younger, to have \nsomebody say they were going to go to school to be a cook, you didn't \nhear much about that. Now there are a lot of young men and women who go \nto school to learn to be a chef. That is the thing to do; it is one of \nthe things to do. They work very hard. People don't realize how hard \nthey work. As their jobs require, especially when big things are going \non in the restaurants and they get a convention or some kind of a \nwedding or anniversary, they are required, because they have a lot of \nwork to do, to work more than 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. Under the \nproposal we have from the President, they won't be able to get their \novertime. Anyone making more than $22,000 a year is, in effect, \nprevented from getting overtime.\n  Clerical workers: Why would you want to take the ability of somebody \nrequired by virtue of their work to put in extra time and not be paid \nfor it?\n  Mr. President, the Fair Labor Standards Act, more than 50 years ago, \nsaid if a person works more than 8 hours a day, more than 40 hours a \nweek, except under contractor situations, and some other exemptions--\nfew in number--they are to be paid extra, time and a half, and for \nworking holidays, double time, meaning they work 1 day and get paid as \nif they worked 2.\n  Physical therapists, reporters--that is a strange way to punish \nreporters, but I guess you can do it that way. If you are in the middle \nof something big, you can just say ``stop'' because you are not going \nto get paid.\n  Paralegals, dental hygienists, graphic artists, bookkeepers, lab \ntechnicians, and social workers--these are the people included in the 8 \nmillion Americans who would lose overtime protection under the proposal \nof President Bush. That is a shame. It is too bad and it is not fair.\n  When these police officers and firefighters ask me about overtime--\nwhen you go to these kinds of meetings, you don't want to be partisan. \nThat takes away the purpose of your being there. What was I to say? I \ncould only respond that our President has suggested--I should not say \nsuggested--he has directed this. There is now, of course, a rule in \neffect, which is working its way through the process, to take away the \nability of people who make more than $21,000 a year to make overtime \npay. I told them that.\n  They are worried about their overtime pay. Families depend on \novertime. It is not just the firefighters I saw in Reno or the police \nofficers I met at Henderson whom I spoke about. It is families all over \nthe country who depend on overtime.\n  As I have indicated, it is not only the firefighters, not only the \npolice officers, nurses, flight attendants, preschool teachers, cooks, \nsecretaries, fast-food shift managers, but 8 million others will lose \ntheir right to overtime pay under the new rules the administration \nwants to adopt.\n  We hear speeches on this floor, we hear speeches at high school \ngraduations, we hear lectures given to us from the time we are kids \nuntil the time we pass on that this country is built upon hard work, \nthat hard work has enabled generations of Americans to own a home, buy \na car, do things to make a stronger community and give their children a \ngood education. They say if one works hard in America, that is all it \ntakes.\n  Americans have been willing to work hard and reach their goals. We \nare working longer now than we ever have before. Almost one-third of \nthe labor force in our country regularly works longer than a 40-hour \nweek. Twenty percent, 2 out of every 10 workers in America, work up to \n50 hours a week. The Fair Labor Standards Act recognized employers \nwould take advantage of employees if they were not required to pay \novertime. That is why the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed.\n  The principle of overtime pay for those who work more than 40 hours a \nweek was part of that act. It was the main purpose of that act. This \nlegislation recognized hard work rewarded those who worked the hardest. \nFamilies who work hard depend on overtime pay. In fact, families that \nwork overtime earn 25 percent of their pay in overtime. The \nadministration's proposal would cut their pay by 25 percent.\n  It would also mean fewer jobs. Why? Of course it would be fewer jobs, \nbecause why would an employer bother hiring somebody else when they can \njust have whoever is working--a nurse, a clerical worker, a reporter, a \ngraphic artist, a social worker--why hire another one? Just make them \nwork more hours. They may not have to work a full shift, just have them \nwork 2 or 3 hours a day. That way they will not have to hire a new \nperson.\n  Of course, it would mean fewer jobs because companies would simply \nforce their employees to work longer hours instead of hiring new \nworkers. In the current economic condition, when millions of Americans \nare out of work during this administration, the last 3 years, there \nhave been almost 3 million jobs lost. It does not make sense to do \nsomething that will stifle the creation of new jobs when in the private \nsector we have already lost almost 3 million jobs. Even for the workers \nwho would still qualify for overtime, this is a bad rule, because some \nby contract would allow people to be paid overtime. Why? Because big \ncompanies would force overtime-exempt workers to put in longer hours \nand cut the hours of those qualified for overtime.\n  This rule is bad for so many reasons. It punishes working families by \ncutting their pay. It prevents the creation of new jobs and dishonors \nhard work, which is one of the things I have talked about, one of those \nthings that has made this country great. Well, these are \nstrong, convincing arguments, not because I made them, but because they \nare common sense. That is what has been said on this floor during the \nlast 2 days.\n\n  Last night, I asked, why are my colleagues going to try to invoke \ncloture? I heard they were going to file a petition for cloture. I \nasked that question when we were doing our closing, when the \ndistinguished majority whip said he was sending a petition to the desk \nto invoke cloture. I asked, why would he do that?\n  I cannot understand why he would do that. I asked why, because the \nHouse overwhelmingly said they wanted to have this overtime rule \nrescinded, and\n\n[[Page S2976]]\n\nin the Senate we voted to rescind this rule.\n  My distinguished friend, the senior Senator from Kentucky, said we \nvoted on it once. Why do we need to vote on it again?\n  Let me show my colleagues what we are talking about. The majorities \nin the Senate and in the House voted against the Bush overtime proposal \non September 10 of last year. Yes, we had a vote on it once before. My \ndistinguished friend is right, September, October, November, December, \nJanuary, February, March--yes, we had one. I counted it on my fingers. \nIt was more than 6 months ago when we had a vote in the Senate, 54 to \n45. It did not go party-line votes, but it was close. There were some \ncourageous Republicans who voted against the party line, one of whom is \nsitting in the chair. They voted against this issue, and it passed.\n  Not long after that, less than a month after that, the House, by a \nparty-line vote said, no, we do not want to rescind it, they knew they \nwere wrong because of what I have said today, that it punishes working \nfamilies, it prevents the creation of new jobs, it dishonors hard work, \nand they recognized that. So by a vote of 221 to 203, the House voted \nto have the instruction go to the conferees to take what happened in \nthe Senate and rescind what the President had done.\n  In the middle of the night, the Republican majorities in the House \nand Senate, without a single Democrat being present, took the Harkin-\nKennedy amendment--that is this amendment right here, passed by a vote \nof 54 to 45--out of the omnibus bill. It comes to the floor and it is \nnot in the bill. Surprise, surprise. Even though it passed, they took \nit out.\n  Yes, my friend from Kentucky is right; we had a vote on it over 6 \nmonths ago, and by some phantom-like work in the middle of the night, \ncontrary to what I think are rules of fairness, and just brute power, \nthey stripped this from the bill.\n  By recorded votes, the House and the Senate said they wanted this \nrule changed, but in spite of our constitutional framework, in spite of \nthe rules we have in the Senate and House and the rules that work to \nkeep the two bodies working together, they were abrogated and we came \nup with this strange situation.\n  No, the conferees did not follow these heavy votes. When this bill \nwas rolled into the omnibus, the conference committee struck it. I \nrepeat, the conference committee, which excluded Democrats, ignored the \nvotes of Congress and in doing so ignored the voice of the American \npeople.\n  I respect the opinions and views of every Member of the Senate, \nwhether or not I agree with those views, because I know every Senator \nwas elected by the citizens of their State. Every Member's opinion \ncarries weight with me because I believe every person in America has a \nright to be heard. In order for the people to be heard, the votes of \nthose who represent them must count for something in Congress. \nUnfortunately, the conference committee that stripped Senator Harkin's \novertime amendment out of the Omnibus appropriations bill said our \nvotes do not count; the voice of the people does not count; the voice \nof the people does not matter. Meeting behind closed doors, the \ncommittee disregarded the will of Congress and ignored the voice of the \nAmerican people. So we have to have another vote on this.\n  We have had those on the other side of the aisle say this is an \nimportant bill. Why are we doing this?\n  Senator Harkin has said he would take a time agreement. What does \nthis mean? We have unlimited debate in the Senate. I think Senator \nHarkin would take 15 minutes, give the majority 15 minutes, and then \nvote, an up-or-down vote on whether we want to have a rule in the \nUnited States that police officers, nurses, cooks, clerical workers, \nfirefighters, physical therapists, reporters, paralegals, dental \nhygienists, graphic artists, bookkeepers, lab technicians, and social \nworkers and on and on--8 million people are not going to be able to get \novertime. I want a vote here. We want a vote. We are entitled to a \nvote. The only vote we had, the voice of the people, was stricken in \nthe middle of the night. If this is an important bill, can't we afford \n15 minutes to vote on this amendment?\n  The reason they don't want a vote on this amendment is because they \nknow this amendment of Senator Harkin will pass and the Secretary of \nLabor will have to issue new directions.\n  The purpose of the underlying amendment is to protect the jobs of \nAmerican workers. It is a measure that protects the overtime pay of 8 \nmillion people, 8 million people who have families. Remember, 20 \npercent of these people work up to 50 hours a week; 25 percent of them \ndepend on this overtime pay to make car payments, house payments, \nfurniture payments, to send their kids to school. The voices of the \nAmerican people are clear, just as the voices of the police officers \nand firefighters I met in Nevada last week were clear. They want us to \nprotect the overtime pay their families depend on. We have a duty as \nlegislators, national legislators, to stand and speak for the people we \nrepresent.\n  This bill, which is an important tax bill, the majority is willing to \ntake down. The majority is willing to take down this important tax bill \nthat we support on our side. They are willing to take it down, to have \nit go into limbo as so many other things do, like the gun legislation, \nlike other bills. We can't seem to have closure on much of anything \naround here because the majority is unwilling to take tough votes. If \nit is something they disagree with, procedurally they just block us \nfrom voting on it.\n  This matter, that is, overtime pay for 8 million people, is going to \nbe something we are going to vote on. The responsibility for this bill \nbeing taken down is not at the hands of the Democrats. It is at the \nhands of the majority party, the Republican Party, which refuses to \nhave a vote on repealing a decision made by the President of the United \nStates that takes away overtime pay for people who make more than \n$22,000 a year, as I have listed on this chart. It is wrong.\n  I told people twice yesterday that seeking to do away with this \namendment by a parliamentary maneuver is not going to accomplish \nanything. We are wasting time. I can just see it now. The majority \nleader is going to come here and say we don't have time to do these \nimportant pieces of legislation; we are so busy.\n  We are busy wasting time. That is what we are doing. We wasted \nyesterday. We wasted all day today. We are having a cloture vote \ntomorrow. Cloture will be defeated. But to even show the complicity of \nwhat is happening here by my friends on the other side of the aisle, \nthey were unwilling--they didn't have the nerve to file cloture on the \nunderlying bill. Why? Because it would show directly what they were \ndoing with the Harkin amendment. So they have developed this very \ninteresting procedure where they have a motion here to recommit. The \nonly reason they are doing it this way is so they do not have a direct \nattack on the FSC/ETI bill, the underlying bill here, and the Harkin \namendment. They are going around that and saying we have this motion to \nrecommit. If cloture is invoked, the bill comes back in its regular \nform.\n\n  Say whatever you want to say in however many ways you want to say it, \nthis is an attempt to stop Senator Harkin from having a vote on this \novertime issue. It is wrong. No matter how many times people say we are \ngoing to be able to vote on it some other time, the record is replete \nwith our cooperating in the first few months of this legislative \nsession.\n  We have said to Senator Harkin on many occasions, Let us go ahead and \ndo this legislation. Let us work on this legislation. You can offer it \non the next piece of legislation. And then the next piece of \nlegislation.\n  We are at the end of the rope. The American people will no longer let \nus avoid this issue. This is an issue that must be addressed and we are \ngoing to address the issue because it is the right thing to do. Eight \nmillion Americans are depending on us, and $22,000--it is as if \nsomebody who makes $22,000 a year and then gets overtime pay is \ncommitting some type of crime. Is that ruining our country? As I \nestablished here statistically, no, it is not. It is good for our \ncountry. Overtime pay creates more jobs. It rewards hard work. It \nallows people to maintain their standard of living--which isn't very \nhigh. Remember the starting point is $22,000 a year.\n  I hope in the days and weeks to come and the few months we have left \nin this\n\n[[Page S2977]]\n\nlegislative session, where we have 13 appropriations bills to pass and \nmany other items, people remember the wasted time this week. All we \nwant is a simple vote on overtime. Fifteen minutes of debate and vote. \nThey will not let us do that because they know it would show the \nPresident of the United States is wrong, wrong in trying to take away \novertime pay from people who make $22,000 a year or more. It is wrong.\n  They will not let us vote on this. We are going to continue coming \nback as often as we have the opportunity. They will not be able to \nescape this. I feel really bad about this bill, which is important to \nour country. The majority is willing to take down a bill that is \nimportant to the competitive nature of our country. They are willing to \ntake this bill down because they don't want a vote on overtime pay \nbecause it makes the President look bad. I should tell them the \nPresident looks bad anyway on this issue. They are not going to take \naway the damage done here. Why not let us vote and get rid of that \nridiculous rule he has issued and get back to allowing people to be \nrewarded for working hard and creating new jobs? It is an issue we \nneed, to make sure people are honored for hard work, rewarded for hard \nwork, not punished.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the Harkin \namendment. I wasn't here for the earlier conversation, but I was \nadvised about some of the arguments that have been made. It concerns me \nbecause people are concerned about the proposed rules that have been \npromulgated by the Department of Labor. I think it is incumbent upon us \nto clarify the situation so American workers are not frightened of \nthese proposed rules because of the mischaracterization by certain \npeople.\n  The amendment here would stop the rules from going into effect. I \nfear there are things being said about these rules that are very \ninaccurate, misleading, and therefore are frightening people into \nthinking somehow the rules would prevent them from receiving overtime \npay, when the reality is more people would be ensured they could \nqualify for overtime pay than is the case today.\n  I want to speak for a few moments to try to allay the fears of people \nso they are not concerned about these proposals and they embrace them, \nbecause the possibility of overtime extends to a larger universe of \npeople than it does today. I will talk about this for a moment. The \namendment would prohibit the Department of Labor from pursuing this \nproposed rule, which clarifies something called the white-collar \nexemption from the FLSA overtime rules, or the Fair Labor Standards Act \nrules.\n  What it has to do with is the requirement that non-white-collar \nworkers are entitled to overtime under certain circumstances. The \nquestion is, how do we define the non-white-collar workers as opposed \nto the white-collar workers to understand who is entitled to receive \ncompensation for the overtime and who is not. The proposed changes \nwould actually guarantee payments to 1.3 million low-wage workers who \nwere not entitled to overtime before. I think this is the key point. It \ndoes not take away people; it adds to the number of people who would \nqualify for overtime.\n\n  This is one of the ways in which that occurs: It would raise the \nminimum salary level at which workers are ensured overtime pay from \n$155 to $425 a week, $22,100 annually. So it raises the level at which \nthis kicks in, which would be the largest increase since the law was \nenacted in 1938. So we are making the availability to a much larger \ngroup of people, people at a higher salary level, than has ever been \nthe case.\n  It will actually ensure that the lowest 20 percent of all salaried \nworkers get pay of time and a half for overtime work. Now, that is a \nsubstantial increase in the number of American workers who will be \nensured overtime pay. This is so important because I have heard from \nworkers who have personally spoken to me and they are very frightened \nabout this. They believe that somehow or another these proposed rules \nare going to make it more difficult for them to get overtime pay. The \nreality is that a lot more people are going to be ensured that they \nwill receive overtime pay. First, as I said, because we are raising the \nlevel of people who would be covered. That is the largest reason why we \ncan make that claim.\n  Another thing that this proposed rule does is to clarify the \ndefinitions of who is actually covered and who is not covered. In \nrecent years, there have been a large number of class action lawsuits \nthat have been brought over this definition of white-collar status; \ntherefore, the question of whether they are exempt from overtime \nrequirements. This has actually surpassed the Equal Employment \nOpportunity class action lawsuits in number, and there are a lot of \nthose. The trial lawyers end up making millions of dollars off of this \nconfusion in the current system over the definition. This law would \neliminate all of that cost and all of the wasted energy in litigation \nand paying a lot of trial lawyers by clarifying who is covered and who \nis not covered.\n  Now let's talk a little bit about that definition because, once \nagain, people are asking whether they are going to be covered anymore; \nthey will be exempt from this guarantee of overtime pay with the new \ndefinitions. I want to make it very clear that in most of the \nsituations I have heard described that just is not true.\n  Employees who earn more than $65,000 annually would be exempted from \nthe overtime pay requirements if their job involves executive, \nadministrative, or professional duties. Now, again, we are talking \nabout time-and-a-half pay. When one is making over $65,000 a year and \nthey are in an executive position, the theory is that they can \nnegotiate their own salary, that they are not in the situation in which \nthey would be getting time and a half for the time they put in, and \nthat is the reason for this particular exemption.\n  Those who earn between $22,100 and $65,000 will remain eligible for \novertime pay if they meet what is called the short test. That \ndetermines whether they are exempted white-collar workers. That test \nbasically includes definitions such as whether one supervises two or \nmore employees, whether they have the authority to hire and fire or \nthey need an advanced degree or some kind of specialized training. One \nwould have to clearly be in one of those categories in order not to be \nguaranteed the protection of this time and a half for overtime. That is \nbetween $22,100 and $65,000.\n\n  There is a study out that I think also has some faulty data in it \nwhich have skewed the effect of the proposed rule that has been used by \nthe opponents of the proposed regulation and by the supporters of the \namendment that would prevent the regulation from going into effect. The \nclaim is that 8 million workers would become exempt from overtime pay \nrequirements based on this so-called EPI study. One of the reasons that \nthe number is so large is because the study counts part-time workers \nwho do not work 40 hours a week and therefore do not receive overtime \npay.\n  Well, we have to extract all of those workers in order to have a \nrelevant cohort because one has to work 40 hours a week in order to \nqualify for overtime pay.\n  The study also includes individuals who are not affected by the rule. \nAgain, I do not see how one can have a valid study that allegedly shows \nhow many people would no longer qualify if a lot of people are included \nin the study who do not qualify in the first instance. So it is very \nunclear what the actual number of people would be who would not qualify \nfor the overtime pay.\n  Clearly, this study is fatally flawed in those two significant \nrespects and therefore it should not be used to scare people into \nsuggesting they would no longer be covered.\n  I will give some other examples of different professions in which \nthere have been questions raised, and I think it is important we allay \nthe fears of these people. Cooks are concerned, people who cook in \nrestaurants, for example. Well, all cooks are not exempted from the \novertime pay in the proposal.\n\n[[Page S2978]]\n\nOnly chefs who have college degrees in the culinary arts will be deemed \nwhite-collar workers and therefore exempt from this requirement. So \nwhen one hears the conversation about all of the cooks who are no \nlonger going to be entitled to time and a half because that is--I mean, \nwhen a person is working in a restaurant, for example, there is a lot \nof time and a half involved in that and here we are not talking about \nmost of the people. The people who would be exempted are only those who \nhave a college degree in culinary arts, which does not represent most \nof the people who are actually doing the cooking.\n  One of the arguments is as to the process, and there has been a \nsuggestion that this rule was just passed in the middle of the night \nand somehow people are not aware of it. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. Prior to the drafting of the rule, the Department of Labor \nheld over 40 meetings of stakeholders, people who had an interest in \nthe proposed rule, 50 different interest groups, including, by the way, \n16 labor unions. Some of the labor unions have raised questions, I \nthink some will support it, but the bottom line is they were included \nin the consultations.\n  I am advised that the Department of Labor invited 80 groups to \nparticipate in these stakeholder meetings. So I do not think anybody \ncan claim this was done in the middle of the night.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter which was provided to me--it \nwas sent to the majority leader and minority leader from the Grand \nLodge Fraternal Order of Police--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      Grand Lodge,\n\n\n                        Fraternal Order of Police',\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 2004.\n     Hon. William H. Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader and Senator Daschle: I am writing \n     on behalf of the membership of the Fraternal Order of Police \n     to advise you of our concerns regarding an amendment which is \n     expected to be offered tomorrow on the floor of the Senate \n     concerning the proposed regulations governing the exemptions \n     from overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), \n     and to renew our opposition to any such effort which would \n     have the effect of delaying or hindering the Department of \n     Labor's (DOL) ability to issue a final rule.\n       On 31 March, DOL published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     in the Federal Register to revise and update the exemptions \n     from overtime under the FLSA for executive, administrative \n     and professional employees. The F.O.P. was the first union to \n     weigh in on behalf of America's law enforcement community \n     regarding the proposed change and recommended the exclusion \n     of public safety personnel from the Part 541 or ``white \n     collar'' exemptions from overtime--including those employees \n     who are classified as exempt under the existing regulations. \n     We argued that the exclusion of these employees was necessary \n     due to the increased burdens placed on public safety officers \n     following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.\n       Since the beginning, it has been clear from our dialogue \n     with Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao and Department \n     officials that it was never their intention to cut overtime \n     for public safety employees. Thus, we decided that the \n     interests of our members could best be served by working \n     cooperatively with the Department. Based on our dialogue with \n     DOL, we are confident that when the final regulations are \n     issued, that overtime pay will be available to even more \n     police officers, firefighters and EMTs than is possible under \n     the current regulations.\n       The F.O.P. believes that amendments such as the one which \n     may be offered on Tuesday do not take into consideration the \n     police officers, firefighters and EMTs who are currently \n     exempt, who must work longer hours when the terrorist threat \n     level goes up, and who are ineligible to receive overtime \n     compensation. Nor do we think it is the best possible result \n     that Congress should reaffirm that the existing executive, \n     administrative, and professional exemptions are acceptable \n     for our nation's first responders. Instead, our efforts \n     with the Department of Labor and others have been geared \n     towards ensuring that overtime compensation is available \n     to all those public safety employees whose continued \n     performance of overtime work is vital to the security of \n     our nation.\n       These regulations offer an important opportunity to correct \n     the application of the overtime provisions of the FLSA to \n     public safety officers. We are therefore concerned that the \n     adoption of any amendment with respect to the Department's \n     revisions to the Part 541 regulations will undermine our \n     efforts to successfully protect overtime compensation for \n     more than 1 million public safety officers, and hinder DOL's \n     ability to issue a final rule. During the public comment \n     period on the proposal, the Department received nearly 80,000 \n     comments from individuals across the nation. The purpose was \n     to solicit feedback and suggested changes to the original \n     proposal before issuing final regulations. None can say with \n     any degree of certainty what changes DOL has made to their \n     proposed rule and what its final scope will be. In essence, \n     all of the concerns which have been expressed to this point \n     are based solely on the pre-public comment draft proposal, \n     and on conjecture over what is feared will or will not be \n     part of the final regulation. That is why the F.O.P. believes \n     that the regulatory process should be allowed to move forward \n     unimpeded, and that Congress should reserve acting on this \n     issue until after the regulations have been promulgated as a \n     final rule.\n       On behalf of the more than 311,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, we respectfully request your assistance in \n     opposing the adoption of any amendment which would delay the \n     issuance of a final rule. I cannot express to you the \n     critical importance of this issue to our membership. Thank \n     you in advance, and please do not hesitate to contact me, or \n     Executive Director Jim Pasco, through our Washington office \n     if we can be of any assistance whatsoever.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. KYL. The author of the letter in the first paragraph--I will not \ncite the entire letter but the national president of the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, whose name is Chuck Canterbury, wrote this:\n\n       I am writing on behalf of the membership of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police to advise you of our concerns regarding an \n     amendment which is expected to be offered tomorrow on the \n     floor of the Senate concerning the proposed regulations \n     governing the exemptions from overtime pay under the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act, and to renew our opposition to any such \n     effort which would have the effect of delaying or hindering \n     the Department of Labor's ability to issue a final rule.\n\n  The reason I quote that letter is to make the point that this is the \nFOP, a very large and important union in our Nation today, which would \nlike to see this rule issued. It is an illustration of one of the \ngroups that has been involved in the process that understands what the \nDepartment of Labor is doing and appreciates the positive effect of the \nrule that has been proposed.\n\n  I also want to make it clear that this is only a proposed regulation. \nAfter the rule is promulgated by the Department, obviously there would \nbe a final implementation of the rule. At the earliest, that would come \nout next year sometime, and clearly the Senate would have the ability \nat that time to address any complaints about the final rule. The \nagency, I am advised, has received over 80,000 comments with respect to \nits proposed rule and is currently working its way through those \ncomments. So this is not something that is going to be happening \ntomorrow. Once they get through all of those comments, they will \npromulgate the final rule, again perhaps coming out sometime next year. \nThe Senate, in any event, would have plenty of time to work on it.\n  That is essentially what I wanted to say, to make the point that \nthose who have been scared or frightened by some of the comments about \nthis proposed rule should stop and get more information about the rule. \nThey should listen to some of the debate we are trying to bring to the \nfloor and contact the Department of Labor if they have a question, or \ncontact our offices so we can clarify what this proposed rule really \ndoes. We can make it clear it is not being put into effect to take a \nbunch of people out of the market for time-and-a-half guarantee of \novertime, but in point of fact it would actually guarantee that more \npeople would have the ability to get overtime, and because of the \nclarification of definitions, it would remove the potential for even \nmore litigation that simply raises confusion about whether people are \ncovered.\n  We can make it clear we are talking about people who make a lot of \nmoney, who have a lot of control over the negotiation of their \nsalaries, who have supervision over other employees, and so on. Those \nare the people who are being exempt. It is not the people who are just \nregular workers, who don't supervise a lot of people, who don't hire \nand fire people, and so on. Those folks may or may not wear white \ncollars to work, but the bottom line is they are not exempt from the \nrequirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act to provide them time \nand a half for overtime for the hours they actually work. It is \nimportant to get that message out to folks; that it is not something \nabout\n\n[[Page S2979]]\n\nwhich they should be concerned. Rather, the intention behind the rule \nis to clarify and expand the number of people eligible for it.\n  I hope folks who have concerns about that will be in touch with us so \nwe can allay those concerns. Perhaps the amendment I am talking about \nwill come up for a vote, perhaps it will not. If it does, I hope it is \ndefeated because we need to move forward with the regulations the \nDepartment is working on right now and see them promulgated. Once that \noccurs, you will see labor unions and workers all over the country \nlooking at the final product and saying, yes, that is fair. That is \nprotective of me. It clarifies the situation, and we can support it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Arizona is someone \nfor whom I have the highest regard. He is articulate. He always makes a \ngood presentation. I am glad he is a neighbor of the great State of \nNevada.\n  But I have to say the one question he didn't answer is, Why don't we \njust vote on this? Why don't we just have a vote on this overtime \nissue? We have agreed to have Senator Harkin spend 15 or 20 minutes \nsummarizing his arguments, the majority can take whatever time they \nbelieve appropriate, and then we can vote on this issue and move on to \nthis most important underlying bill.\n  My friend from Arizona, who is the first person who has come to try \nto defend the overtime proposal of the President, says the study is \nfaulty, that it is really not 8 million people, and some are part-time.\n  Let's say it is faulty, which I don't think it is, but let's say it \nis only 6 million people.\n  I would also say, of course, more people would qualify for overtime \npay because whatever they are doing is allowing people who now are not \nentitled to overtime pay, people who really don't make much money--we \nwould allow them to have overtime pay under the proposed rule.\n  Let them do it. Let them have overtime. No one is trying to stop them \nfrom having overtime. What we criticize is why would we want to make \none group of workers disadvantaged to try to advantage another group of \nworkers? Let's let them all be entitled to overtime, time and a half. \nThat seems to be the fair thing to do. I see nothing wrong with giving \npeople who are not making much money now the ability to get overtime. \nWe support that. But why disadvantage others?\n  Of course, we are told it is in the definition of ``white collar.'' \nCan you imagine the litigation and problems it is going to cause in the \nworkforce--who is a chef, who is a cook, who is a physical therapist?\n  This is an issue that is important to millions and millions of \nworking men and women in this country. We believe the rule is not right \nfor the American people. We believe people should be rewarded for hard \nwork. We believe we should create more jobs, not take away jobs. This \nproposal will not reward hard work, and it will take away people's \nhonest efforts to be rewarded for hard work.\n  We are willing to vote, as had been done last September when we voted \nin this body by a large margin to rescind the rule. The House of \nRepresentatives, by more than 220 Members, said they wanted to do what \nthe Senate did, the same thing. We voted on it twice. It was taken out \nin the middle of the night in a secret conference, with no Democrats \npresent. Why can't we vote on it again? We believe that is what we \nshould do. Let's vote on whether the President and his people are right \nor wrong.\n  We are willing to debate this issue in public, not secretly. We are \nwilling to state our position and simply go forward as the Senate and \nthe House have already spoken and get rid of this rule, which is \nunfair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to continue to discuss the white-\ncollar exemptions on the overtime legislation and the amendment we are \ndealing with. I want to express how frustrating it is to see a very \ncarefully constructed proposal by the Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao, \nbeing mischaracterized, therefore placing fear in the American people \nthrough the misrepresentation of the nature of these regulations.\n  First of all, Secretary Chao is one of the finest public servants I \nknow. From the time she gets to work in the morning until the time she \ngets home late at night, she is committed to making this a better \ncountry, a good country to live and work in. She wants to do something \nabout these regulations that have not been changed since 1954 in any \nsignificant way. They need to be updated. Her proposed rule changes \nhave received 70,000 comments. The Department of Labor is considering \nthose, and they ought to be able to update these regulations. There is \nno doubt about it. It is time to do that.\n  The impact has been completely misrepresented. We need to talk about \nit. I think the reason, frankly, is that we are in a political season. \nPeople want to make this a political issue. If they can go around and \nsay, Mean old President Bush wants to deny you your overtime and you \ncan't get overtime anymore, and they can stir this up and make these \ncomplaints, then they think some people might believe it. But it is not \nright. What is being said is not right. It is not fair.\n  The Department of Labor has proposed changes to the regulations \ngoverning the overtime exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act, \nalso known as the white-collar exemption.\n  The regulations defining which workers are entitled to overtime were \nwritten in 1954 and have not been updated to reflect the ongoing \nchanges in the workplace. Today's workers are operating under the rules \nthat are 50 years old.\n  These rules include job descriptions like ``gang leader,'' \n``ratesetter,'' and ``Linotype operator.'' Therefore, it is easy to \nunderstand why many businesses have trouble identifying which workers \nqualify for overtime and which are exempt under current law.\n  The proposed rule increases the minimum salary requirements for \novertime from as low as $155 a week to $425 a week.\n  Let me talk about that. Let us get this straight.\n  A worker making as little as $155 a week today could be denied \novertime if they are classified in a supervisor capacity. Under the \nrules of the Secretary of Labor, if you made $425 a week or less, you \nare automatically entitled to overtime no matter what job title some \nbusiness might give you. That is going to help a lot of people, I \nsubmit. According to the Department of Labor, this change would result \nin 1.3 million Americans who earn less than $22,100 per year being \nguaranteed overtime compensation. That is not so now. A worker can be \nclassified as some sort of supervisor making $18,000 or $20,000 a year \nand not get overtime.\n  Under the current regulations, a person earning $14,300 annually who \nworks behind the counter at a restaurant, for example, and is called a \nmanager could be denied overtime compensation. The new regulations \nwould guarantee overtime pay to this person and others making less than \n$22,100. They would be guaranteed it. That is a lot of people. It means \na lot to those people.\n  Additionally, the Department of Labor projects 10.7 million workers \nwho currently qualify for overtime will have all of those protections \nstrengthened, including nurses, chefs, secretaries, unionized workers, \nand first responders.\n  Following discussions with the Department of Labor, the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, a major organization representing thousands of police \nofficers who we deal with from the Judiciary Committee on a regular \nbasis and who is actively engaged in defending the interests of their \nmembers, released a statement recognizing the fact that police officers \nwill still receive overtime compensation under these new regulations. \nThe President of the National\n\n[[Page S2980]]\n\nFraternal Order of Police, Chuck Canterbury, said:\n\n       Thanks to the leadership of Secretary Chao, we have no \n     doubt that overtime pay will continue to be available to \n     those officers currently receiving it and, if the new rules \n     are approved, even more of our Nation's police officers, \n     firefighters, and EMTs will be eligible for overtime. This \n     development was possible because this is an Administration \n     that listens to the concerns of the FOP, and because of their \n     commitment to our Nation's first responders.\n\n  I think that is a strong statement. And for months now we have been \nhearing how these regulations are going to hurt policemen, firemen, and \nemergency medical technicians.\n  That is not true. It is false. In fact, it is going to guarantee a \nlot of people overtime who are not receiving it today.\n  According to the Human Resource Policy Association, the proposed \nchanges would impact about 12.6 million workers--it sounds like a lot--\n12.6 million workers out of 134 million workers. About 10 percent of \nworkers would be affected. Of that 12.6 million affected, 12 million \nwould now qualify for overtime or have their current overtime \nprotections strengthened--not reduced, strengthened--12 million out of \n12.6 million who are affected will have their protections strengthened. \nThe other 644,000 workers--highly educated individuals earning an \naverage of $50,000 per year--might be subject to reclassification under \nthese regulations. That is what it is focusing on. The proposed rules \nwould clarify the regulations affecting millions of workers.\n  By updating these rules, the Department of Labor would ease the \nburden on employees and employers who find it difficult to navigate the \noften confusing and outdated regulations governing proper compensation, \nincluding overtime pay. Additionally, the Department will be better \nable to enforce the law once clarifications are made.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is a lawyer, a former attorney general \nand justice of the Texas Supreme Court, and knows litigation. As a \nlawyer in private practice not too many years ago--maybe not long \nbefore I came to the Senate in the mid 1990s--I represented a friend I \ngrew up with who is a bulldozer operator, a heavy equipment operator. \nHe is a good guy. He had a dispute with his employer. He thought maybe \nhe was entitled to overtime pay because he ran heavy equipment. The \ncompany said, No, you are a contractor. I said, Friend, I think you are \nright. We filed a lawsuit, and we had to go to court. We eventually \nsettled before trial, and we got him overtime. I think he was legally \nentitled to overtime under current Federal regulations. Whether he \nshould have been, I do not know. But it makes it clear that these rules \nand regulations are confusing. He had to pay me a lawyer's fee to \nrepresent him. I do not know how much it cost the court or how much it \ncost the company to pay their lawyer to defend the lawsuit. But this \nkind of thing happens too much.\n  I represented one more overtime case. She was a clerical person at an \nentity, and she thought she was being unfairly treated. I looked at her \ncase and it was not a lot of money. I talked to her and I thought she \nwas right. We filed a lawsuit. They agreed eventually to pay her \novertime after some haggling and discussion back and forth.\n\n  Do you know where she worked? Do you know who her employer was? It \nwas a union local. They agreed to pay and they admitted she was not \nproperly paid overtime. If we make it clearer so that it is \nindisputable what overtime is and what it is not, we will see less \nconfusion.\n  Lawsuits over violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act are \nincreasing each year. According to the HR Policy Association, in 2001 \nthe number of Fair Labor Standards Act class action lawsuits actually \nexceeded the number of Equal Employment Opportunity class action \nlawsuits.\n  In Carpenter v. R.M. Shoemaker Company, the court ruled that a \nproject superintendent making around $90,000 annually was not an exempt \nemployee and was thus entitled to overtime even though the employee \nsupervised three large construction projects for a construction \nmanagement company.\n  These laws are complex. If I were a plaintiff and I were representing \nsomeone, I would try to figure out a way to get my client in there and \nget them overtime, too. But I don't think that is what Congress had in \nmind when it created a statute where a guy making $90,000 a year that \nsupervises three large construction projects can receive overtime \ncompensation. That sounds like a supervisor to me. I bet the company \ndid not lose the lawsuit for any other reason than there was probably a \nviolation of the complex Federal law written in 1954, 50 years ago.\n  In Hashop v. Rockwell Space Operations, the court decided that \n``network communications systems instructors'' who had advanced degrees \nin physics, mathematics, and engineering, and trained personnel were \nnot exempt because they used technical manuals and made decisions in \ngroups. These things are pretty complicated.\n  Under the current rule we have employees earning $90,000 a year or \npossessing advanced degrees qualifying for overtime. This is not the \nlow-wage worker we keep hearing about in our debate. Fundamentally that \nis what Secretary Chao's regulations are focused on, these high-wage \nemployees who are supervisors and are slipping in and claiming overtime \nwhen that was not the intention of Congress.\n  Many employers worry about incurring large unexpected litigation \ncosts due to their inability to properly interpret these confusing \nrules. Even lawyers and Department of Labor investigators can have \ndifficulty deciphering the line between exempt and nonexempt employees. \nBy clarifying the line--who is a salaried employee and who is not--we \ncan reduce the number of lawsuits brought under this section, and we \ncan make sure more people get paid overtime properly from the very \nbeginning. If you make less than $22,100 a year, you get overtime. That \nis a bright line. That is what we ought to have more of, more bright \nlines in this Congress so there is a lot less confusion. If you make \nless than that, you get overtime. That will pick up a tremendous number \nof people today who have been classified as some sort of manager or \nsupervisor but have made much less than $22,100 and, as a result of \nthese changes, they are going to gain benefits. I believe far more will \nbenefit than will lose under these proposed regulations. By clarifying \nthat, we can reduce lawsuits.\n  In 1938, when the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed, the Congress \ninstructed the Secretary of Labor to make changes to the white-collar \nexemption rules. That was part of the congressional instruction, to \nmake changes in the white-collar exemption rules. It was understood, I \nassume, at that time that they had not worked everything out fully and \nmore work needed to be done on these regulations.\n\n  The Department of Labor has now issued these proposed regulations. \nThey issued them in March of last year. Everyone has seen them. They \nhave been published. They have received in response to these proposed \nregulations over 70,000 comments during the 90-day comment period. \nSecretary Chao is doing her job. She is seeking to update and modernize \nthese regulations to make them fit the contemporary needs of America \ntoday. We do not have gang leaders being paid wages today. I don't \nthink that job description any longer exists. There is a lot of need \nfor improvement and change. Secretary Chao is on the right track. They \nwill continue to refine these regulations if there is a problem.\n  There is no plot here to try to undermine the right of working \nAmericans to receive overtime. That is a completely bogus and political \nargument we are in at this time. Frankly, politics is intervening too \nmuch in our debate of late. I guess that is the nature of American \ngovernment. We will have to put up with it. I am getting a bellyful of \nit and think we need to set the record straight whenever possible.\n  I am looking at another group that has been asserted would lose \nbenefits under this, the Non-Commissioned Officers Association of the \nUnited States of America. They wrote a letter to Bill Frist, the \nmajority leader in the Senate. They said:\n\n       It is a blinding glimpse of the obvious that neither the \n     current rules nor the revised proposal will negatively impact \n     those who serve or have served in the [United States] \n     uniformed services. In fact, this association's direct \n     discussions with DOL leads us to the conclusion that the \n     proposed rule relative to\n\n[[Page S2981]]\n\n     the revised ceiling for annual income (increased from $8,060 \n     to $13,000) will greatly expand the pool of eligible workers \n     for overtime compensation.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         NCOA,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, January 29, 2004.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: The Non Commissioned Officers expresses \n     its grave concern that America's military personnel and \n     veterans are being used as an ``emotional'' ploy to delay the \n     Department of Labor implementation of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act relative ``white collar'' exemptions. Claims \n     that military members involved in the War on Terrorism and \n     this Nation's veterans will have their employment status \n     elevated to ``exempt'' based on military training and \n     experience and lose opportunity for overtime compensation are \n     patently incorrect. The Association regrets that some would \n     wrongfully use such false allegations concerning impact to \n     America's service members to garner emotional and legislative \n     support to delay the final rules for implementation of FLSA.\n       It is a blinding glimpse of the obvious that neither the \n     current nor the revised proposal will negatively impact those \n     who serve or have served in the Uniformed Services. In fact, \n     this association's direct discussions with DOL leads us to \n     the conclusion that the proposed rule relative the revised \n     ceiling for annual income (increased from $8,060 to $13,000) \n     will greatly expand the eligibility pool for worker overtime \n     compensation.\n       It is outrageous that unsubstantiated claims are reaching \n     America's Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen currently in \n     harm's way that their future return to civilian jobs will \n     result in a reclassification of their employment status. It \n     is clear from our discussions with the Department of Labor \n     that the proposed rule makes no changes from the current \n     regulation and case law regarding military training and \n     eligibility for overtime payments.\n       NCOA will continue to monitor the rights of all service \n     members and pursue DOL intervention if the intent of any \n     program or interpretation of the published rules would \n     negatively impact those who have served in the Uniformed \n     Service of this Nation. NCOA will remain vigilant to ensure \n     their employment rights.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Gene Overstreet,\n                                                    President/CEO.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We need to let this process work, allow the Secretary \nof Labor to evaluate these comments and continue her process of \nestablishing fair and modernized overtime regulations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Senate for the \npassage yesterday by unanimous consent an amendment to extend for 2 \nyears the Work Opportunity and Welfare to Work tax credits, and to make \ncertain improvements to these programs that will make them even more \neffective in helping Americans transition from welfare to work. These \ncredits clearly belong in a bill whose name is JOBS; I can think of few \nprograms that have created jobs and provided basic workplace skills to \na segment of the population that is badly in need of these resources \nwith the efficiency and low cost of WOTC and W-t-W. I can also think of \nfew jobs programs that have as positive an impact as these have on \nscarce state welfare resources. I am also pleased that Senator Bayh \njoined me as a cosponsor of this bipartisan amendment. I would also \nlike to thank Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus for their support of \nthis important initiative as part of a larger package of extenders.\n  WOTC and W-t-W are also key elements of welfare reform. Employers in \nthe retail, health care, hotel, financial services, and food industries \nhave incorporated this program into their hiring practices and through \nthese programs, more than 2,700,000 previously dependent persons have \nfound work.\n  A recent report issued by the New York State Department of Labor \nbears this out in economic terms. Comparing the cost of WOTC credits \ntaken by New York State employers during the period 1996-2003--for a \ntotal of $192.59 million--with savings achieved through closed welfare \ncases and reductions in vocational rehabilitation programs and jail \nspending--for a total of $199,89 million--the State of New York \nconcluded that WOTC provided net benefits to the taxpayers even without \ntaking into account the additional economic benefits resulting from the \naddition of new wages to the GDP or reductions in other social spending \nsuch as Medicaid.\n  In that regard, the New York State analysis concluded that the \nroughly $90 million in wages paid to WOTC workers since 1996 generated \nroughly $225 million in increased economic activity. Perhaps even more \nimportantly, the study found that roughly 58 percent of the TANF \nrecipients who entered private sector employment with the assistance of \nWOTC stayed off welfare.\n  I mention the New York State study because it is the first of its \nkind; however, I am certain that similar conclusions would be reached \nin the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any of the other 48 States and \nthe District of Columbia. These programs work and do so at a net \nsavings to taxpayers. In fact, over a 7-year period there were more \nthan 111,000 certifications for both WOTC and W-t-W in Pennsylvania \nalone enabling many to leave welfare and find private sector work. The \nlegislation is supported by hundreds of employers throughout \nPennsylvania and around the country.\n  WOTC and W-t-W have received high praise as well from the Federal \nGovernment. A 2001 GAO study concluded that employers have \nsignificantly changed their hiring practices because of WOTC by \nproviding job mentors, longer training periods, and significant \nrecruiting outreach efforts.\n  Mr. President, WOTC and W-t-W are not traditional government jobs \nprograms. Instead they are precisely the type of program that we should \nchampion in a time when we need to be fiscally responsible. These are \nefficient and low cost public-private partnerships that have as their \ngoal to provide a means by which individuals can transition from \nwelfare to a lifetime of work and dignity.\n  Under present law, WOTC provides a 40-percent tax credit on the first \n$6,000 of wages for those working at least 200 hours, or a partial \ncredit of 25 percent for those working 120-399 hours. W-t-W provides a \n35-percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages for those working \n400 hours in the first year. In the second year, the W-t-W credit is 50 \npercent of the first $10,000 of wages earned. WOTC and W-t-W are key \nelements of welfare reform. A growing number of employers use these \nprograms in the retail, health care, hotel, financial services, food, \nand other industries. These programs have helped over 2,200,000 \npreviously dependent persons to find jobs.\n  Eligibility for WOTC is currently limited to: (1) Recipients of \nTemporary Assistance to Needy Families in 9 of the 18 months ending on \nthe hiring date; (2) individuals receiving Supplemental Security \nIncome, SSI, benefits; (3) disabled individuals with vocational \nrehabilitation referrals; (4) veterans on food stamps; (5) individuals \naged 18-24 in households receiving food stamp benefits; (6) qualified \nsummer youth employees; (7) low-income ex-felons; and (8) individuals \nages 18-24 living in empowerment zones or renewal communities. \nEligibility for W-t-W is limited to individuals receiving welfare \nbenefits for 18 consecutive months ending on the hiring date. More than \n80 percent of WOTC and W-t-W hires were previously dependent on public \nassistance programs. These credits are both a hiring incentive, \noffsetting some of the higher costs of recruiting, hiring, and \nretaining public assistant recipients and other low-skilled \nindividuals, and a retention incentive, providing a higher reward for \nthose who stay longer on the job.\n  Despite the considerable success of WOTC and W-t-W, many vulnerable \nindividuals still need a boost in finding employment. This is \nparticularly true during periods of high unemployment. There are \nseveral legislative changes that would strengthen these programs, \nexpand employment opportunities for needy individuals, and make the \nprograms more attractive to employers. These changes are reflected in \nlegislation which I introduced along with Senator Baucus, S. 1180, and \nthese changes are as follows:\n  The administration's budget proposes to simplify these important \nemployment incentives by combining them into one credit and making the \nrules for computing the combined credits simpler. The credits would be \ncombined by creating a new welfare-to-work target group under WOTC. The \nminimum employment periods and credit rates for the first year of \nemployment under the present work opportunity tax credit would apply to \nW-t-W employees.\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\nThe maximum amount of eligible wages would continue to be $10,000 for \nW-t-W employees and $6,000 for other target groups--$3,000 for summer \nyouth. In addition, the second year 50-percent credit under W-t-W would \ncontinue to be available for W-t-W employees under the modified WOTC.\n\n  Under current law, only those ex-felons whose annual family income is \n70 percent or less than the Bureau of Labor Statistics lower living \nstandard during the 6 months preceding the hiring date are eligible for \nWOTC. The administration's budget also proposes to eliminate the family \nincome attribution rule.\n  Current WOTC eligibility rules heavily favor the hiring of women \nbecause single mothers are much more likely to be on welfare or food \nstamps. Women constitute about 80 percent of those hired under the WOTC \nprogram, but men from welfare households face the same or even greater \nbarriers to finding work. Increasing the age ceiling in the ``food \nstamp category'' would greatly improve the job prospects for many \nabsentee fathers and other ``at risk'' males. This change would be \ncompletely consistent with program objectives because many food stamp \nhouseholds include adults who are not working, and more than 90 percent \nof those on food stamps live below the poverty line.\n  I am very pleased that President Bush proposed a 2-year extension for \nthese programs in his budget, as well as some useful modifications and \nimprovements. The administration along with all of us in Congress are \neager to continue our efforts to create jobs in America. The amendment \nwould provide for a 1-year extension of current law to facilitate a \ntransition period and then in the second year implement these important \nchanges.\n  I would prefer a permanent extension which would provide these \nimportant programs with greater stability, thereby encouraging more \nemployers to participate, make investment in expanding outreach to \nidentify potential workers from the targeted groups, and avoid the \nwasteful disruption of termination and renewal. A permanent extension \nwould also encourage the state job services to invest the resources \nneeded to make the certification process more efficient and employer-\nfriendly. Yet the cost is a significant consideration in the current \nbudget environment even though this is an excellent use of tax \nincentives which ultimately saves government resources while expanding \nopportunity for Americans.\n  Finally, I commend the Senate for acting on this amendment and \nencourage support for cloture tomorrow and quick completion of this \nimportant underlying jobs bill. WOTC and W-t-W expired at the end of \nlast year, and even though the extension we propose is retroactive, \nthese programs will not be fully effective until they become law. The \nindividuals who enter the workforce under these programs, and our \nStates, that benefit greatly from the reduction in welfare that these \nprograms generate, deserve quick action by the Senate on this bill. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to rise in support of \nthe amendment offered by Senators Grassley and Bayh that would extend \ncertain tax provisions to prevent their expiration.\n  The Grassley-Bayh amendment contains a number of useful provisions, \nbut one in particular that I commend to my colleagues would extend for \ntwo more years the $250 deduction provided to teachers who purchase \nsupplies for their classrooms out of their own pockets. Senator Warner \nand I were the principal authors of this law.\n  This is a modest, but appropriate, step toward recognizing the \ninvaluable services that teachers provide each and every day to our \nchildren and to our communities. So often teachers in Maine, and \nthroughout the country, spend their own money to improve the classroom \nexperiences of their students. While many of us are familiar with the \nNational Education Association's estimate that teachers spend, on \naverage, $400 a year on classroom supplies, a more recent survey \ndemonstrates that they are spending even more than that. According to a \nreport released last year by Quality Education Data, the average \nteacher spends more than $520 a year out of pocket on school supplies.\n  I have visited more than 100 schools in Maine, and everywhere I go, I \nfind teachers who are spending their own money to improve the \neducational experiences of their students by supplementing classroom \nsupplies.\n  The teacher tax relief we passed overwhelmingly in the last Congress \nwas a step in the right direction. As Tyler Nutter, a middle school \nmath and reading teacher from North Berwick, ME, told me, ``It's a nice \nrecognition of the contributions that many teachers have made.'' I \ncommend the authors of this amendment for including the extension of \nthe Collins-Warner Teacher Tax Credit on this important piece of \nlegislation, and I invite all of my colleagues to join us in \nrecognizing our teachers for a job well done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Is our situation such that we are on the JOBS bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have a very important vote tomorrow. That vote is \ncloture to stop an effort to bring nongermane issues into and stall \nthis bill.\n  I spoke this morning, spending a great deal of time explaining how \nthe JOBS bill is a fully bipartisan bill built from the ground up in a \nbipartisan manner. We cannot get anything through the Senate that is \nnot bipartisan. We can get a lot of things through the House of \nRepresentatives that are partisan but not through the Senate.\n  Now we are facing an attempt to defeat this bipartisan measure by \ninjecting politically charged amendments into the JOBS bill regarding \nan issue that is not even dealt with in this bill. Somebody wants to \nwrite a law.\n  Why does the other side insist on amending this important bill for a \nmatter that is not even the subject of this legislation? We need to \nfocus on what is in this bill and what will be killed if we do not get \ncloture approval tomorrow.\n  We know the only way this bill can pass is by a ``yes'' vote tomorrow \non stopping debate and moving to finality. But will the Democrats say \nno to cloture? Will they go on record opposing the provisions that are \nin this bill--very important provisions for creating jobs in America, \npreserving jobs in manufacturing, answers to concerns that the people \nof this body have expressed about outsourcing, about not enough \nmanufacturing jobs being created?\n  If you look at this bill, you will find, then, that there is very \nimportant provisions for creating jobs that the other side is preparing \nto kill, so, in a sense, their vote tomorrow will be a vote contrary to \nwhat they have been complaining about for a long period of time about \nthis recovery not providing enough jobs, and particularly about jobs \ngoing overseas.\n  This bill will prevent that. I do not understand why people would not \nvote to move a bill along that is going to solve a lot of the problems \nabout our not creating enough jobs in manufacturing. If this bill does \nnot move along, actually the situation is going to get worse, and we \nare going to lose jobs that we presently have in manufacturing.\n  So why would they be prepared to kill this bill? This bill will end \n$4 billion a year of tariffs put on U.S. exports by Europe. Those \ntariffs are already being imposed against U.S. exports of grain, \ntimber, paper, and manufactured goods. We can end those tariffs now at \n5 percent, growing 1 percent a month into the future. We can end them \nwith this bill. But will the Democrats say no?\n  A vote against the JOBS bill is a vote in favor of that 5-percent \ntariff going up 1 percent a month into the future. And that goes up \nvery fast, making our business, our American manufacturing \nuncompetitive.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says we have lost 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs since the manufacturing downturn started 6 months \nbefore President Bush became President. This bill provides $75 billion \nof tax relief to our manufacturing sector to promote rehiring in U.S.-\nbased manufacturing. But will the Democrats say no?\n  The Democrats claim they are worried about the scope of the proposed \novertime regulations. The regulations are not even final yet. But how \ncan you worry about overtime if you do not have a job in the first \nplace? Shouldn't\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\nwe first worry about creating manufacturing jobs and take care of \novertime on another bill instead of slowing this one up? Or will the \nDemocrats say no?\n  The money from the FSC/ETI repeal gives a 3-percentage point tax rate \ncut on all income derived from manufacturing in the United States. It \nis not for manufacturing done offshore. We start this tax relief \nimmediately.\n  This manufacturing rate cut relief applies to sole proprietors, \npartnerships, farmers, individuals, family businesses, multinational \ncorporations, even foreign companies that set up manufacturing plants \nin the United States to manufacture here with American workers. This \nshould keep the Government out of their pockets while they try to \nrecover from the economic downturn. That is what this bill is all \nabout: helping these manufacturing companies recover from the economic \ndownturn. Now, will the Democrats say no to the opportunity to help \nAmerican manufacturing?\n  This bill includes international tax reforms, most of which benefit \nAmerican manufacturing, to keep it competitive in the global \nmarketplace.\n\n  This bill also includes the Homeland Reinvestment Act, which has \nbroad support in both the House and the Senate. It has both Republican \nand Democrat sponsors. But will the Democrats say no?\n  This bill extends the research and development tax credit through the \nend of 2005, something very necessary to keep our industry ahead of the \ncurve, building for the next product, building for the next service, \nparticularly in the technical areas. This is a domestic tax benefit \nthat incentivizes research and development, translating into good, \nhigh-paying jobs for workers here in America, not across the ocean. But \nwill the Democrats say no tomorrow on the cloture vote?\n  In addition, there are several additional provisions that are \nimportant to this bill. Senators Bunning and Stabenow sought to \naccelerate the manufacturing deduction. This ensures that the tax \nrelief and related economic benefits of the bill are provided more \nquickly to those hurt by the repeal of FSC/ETI.\n  The bill extends, for 2 years, tax provisions that expired in 2003, \nlast year. Some of them already expired. Some of them are expiring this \nyear. They need to be included because those incentives are very \nimportant to the prosperity of companies that rely upon these tax \nincentives. This would include items such as the work opportunity tax \ncredit, helping young people, helping low-income people to get jobs, to \nget job training. It helps to move people from welfare to work because \nwe have tax credits that do that.\n  Why would any Democrat vote against the extension of the welfare-to-\nwork tax credits, moving people out of welfare, where they are assured \na life of poverty, into the mainstream of America, the world of work \nwhere you have a chance to move up the economic ladder? Over here, in \nwelfare, you never have a chance to move up. We have tax credits to \nhelp. Will the Democrats say no to these tax credits to help low-income \npeople get into the world of work, to move above, to improve \nthemselves, to get out of poverty?\n  There is a provision also in this bill on net operating losses that \nwill accelerate tax relief to companies that need it to continue \noperations and recover from recent difficulties. The reason for doing \nthat is they have some tax credits. They do not have income to write it \noff against. This gives them some benefit helping them to enhance their \nrecovery.\n  We have enhanced depreciation provisions to help the ailing airline \nindustry, the manufacture of airplanes--Boeing, in my State where \navionics are made for airplanes, Rockwell Collins--because you cannot, \nunder existing depreciation laws, get something into completion by this \ndeadline because it takes so long to build an airplane. This will \nextend provisions that were meant to help industry a year ago if they \ngot long timelines to get something finished.\n  There are new homestead provisions. This provides special assistance \nfor businesses in counties that are losing population. This is rural \neconomic development, providing incentives for newly constructed rural \ninvestment buildings, for starting or expanding a rural business in a \nrural high-outmigration county. Will the Democrats say no to that rural \neconomic development?\n  This bill includes brownfields revitalization. The bill waives taxes \nfor tax-exempt investors who invest in the cleanup and remediation of \nqualified brownfields sites. Will the Democrats say no to helping clean \nup the environment? Would that vote comport with the rhetoric you hear \non the environment from the other side of the aisle?\n  Mortgage revenue bonds: This proposal would repeal the current rule \nthat mortgage revenue bond payments received after the bond has been \noutstanding for 10 years must be used to pay off the bond, rather than \nissue new mortgages.\n  There are 70 Senate cosponsors to this bill. Would the Democrats \njustify voting no on cloture to kill a provision that 70 of their \ncolleagues support?\n  We allow deductions for private mortgage insurance for people \nstruggling to afford a home. Anyone planning to vote no on this one? \nWould they vote no on allowing the cost of mortgage insurance to be \nwritten off as one writes off interest on a mortgage? That is helping a \nlot of young people to get a home that they would not otherwise be able \nto afford. I know home ownership is the highest it has been in the \nhistory of our country. Maybe they are saying: We have enough Americans \nowning homes. Why help some other people this way? It is in this bill. \nIf they vote no tomorrow, they are voting against helping those \nhomeowners with their mortgage insurance costs.\n  This bill includes a tax credit to employers for wages paid to \nreservists who have been called to active duty. Would Democrats say no \nto the guardsmen and reservists who are defending our country, helping \nus win this war, by voting no tomorrow?\n  We have extended and enhanced the Liberty Zone bonds for rebuilding \nNew York City. The two Senators from New York have talked to me about \nthem. Are they going to vote no tomorrow and say no to the Liberty Zone \nbonds helping New York City at a time when Ground Zero begs for help? \nWill they tie up funding for the Liberty Zone in order to prove a \npolitical point for a Labor Department overtime regulation that has not \nyet been finalized? If it had been finalized, there is an opportunity \nfor an expedited procedure for congressional veto of those very same \nregulations they don't want. This is not the last train out of the \nstation. There are other opportunities to fight these battles and \nprobably in a more appropriate way than a nongermane amendment on \nlegislation that ought to pass, that is going to preserve and create \njobs in manufacturing. Where are the priorities of the other side of \nthe aisle?\n  We also have in this bill increased industrial development bond \nlevels to spur economic development. We have bonds for rebuilding \nschool infrastructure. We have included tribal bonds which apply the \nsame rules to Native American tribes issuing tax exempt bonds to \nfinance facilities on a Native American reservation that apply to tax \nexempt bonds that we allow State and local governments to use. Are \nSenators of the other party going to vote against the Native American \nIndian provisions of this bill?\n  We have a tribal new markets tax credit. This amendment would add $50 \nmillion annually in the new markets tax credit dedicated to community \ndevelopment entities serving Native American reservations, if there is \na poverty rate of over 40 percent. Are they going to say no to helping \nthose needy Americans?\n  We have included a Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act so when people have \nbeen harmed in violation of their civil rights, they can go to court \nand get justice. Do you know what happens when they get justice? We \nhave some people paying income tax on what they pay their lawyers so \nwhen it is all said and done, a big settlement, sometimes the people \nwho have been harmed get nothing because of the unfair taxation of that \naward. Are the Democrats going to say no to those people who have had \ntheir civil rights violated? They can't get justice in court. That \ndoesn't sound like the other party, does it?\n  Is it worth killing off these important priorities over a regulatory \nissue that has already been voted on by the Senate? How many times do \nwe have to express our view on something?\n\n[[Page S2984]]\n\n  We also have in this bill a special dividends allocation rule that \nbenefits agricultural cooperatives. We have other farm provisions that \nhelp cattlemen receive tax free treatment if they replace livestock \nwith other farm property where there has been drought, flood, or other \nweather-related conditions within 2 years from the date the livestock \nhas been sold. Last year we heard a lot from the other side of the \naisle about not helping the farmers who have been hurt by drought. Here \nis an opportunity to help some people through tax problems they have as \na result of something beyond the control of the family farmer. Are they \nnot going to give those farmers an opportunity to have help?\n  We have a provision that allows payment under the National Health \nService Corps loan repayment program to be exempt from tax. Every \nSenator here has rural America in their State. We are always saying \nthere is not adequate health delivery services in some parts of our \ncountry in rural America. We set up the National Health Service Corps \nto provide services there. They still have a hard time getting adequate \nservice, but we have provisions in here for additional incentives for \npeople to serve rural America. I hear from my colleagues that we have \nto do something about health care in rural America. We have an \nopportunity tomorrow in this legislation to do something about it. Will \nthe Democrats vote no tomorrow?\n  We have a proposal to allow the itemized deduction for unreimbursed \nvehicle use for rural letter carriers. Why does that come before us? \nBecause every time you drive a quarter of a mile and you stop at a \nrural mailbox to leave mail, and then go on to the next farmer's box to \nleave mail, that vehicle has higher costs than if it was going down the \nroad 60 miles an hour and never stopping. The Tax Code ought to reflect \na little bit different business deduction for that automobile as \nopposed to a business vehicle that doesn't stop at every mailbox.\n  We have provisions in this bill to enhance broadband expensing \nprovisions. We always hear from the other side that the quality of life \nin rural America can never be equal to that of cities if they don't \nhave the same IT access. This gives that IT access. I hear Members of \nthe other side of the aisle talk to me about broadband tax credits. We \nhave an opportunity to do that now. Are they going to say no to what \nthey have been asking me to do for the last 2 or 3 years?\n  We provide real infrastructure tax credits, the so-called short-line \ncredits. This bill provides $500 million over 3 years in Federal tax \ncredits to States for intercity passenger rail capital projects. \nEligible intercity passenger rail projects include planning, track \nrehabilitation, upgrade, development and relocation, security and \nsafety projects, passenger equipment acquisition, station improvement, \nintermodal facilities development, and environmental review and impact \nmitigation.\n  States may transfer credits directly to short-line and regional \nrailroads. They are going to say no to that?\n  Finally--here is something for the New York Senators--the proposal \nmakes $100 million in tax credits available to New York to be used on \nrail infrastructure projects in the New York Liberty Zone.\n  Will the Democrats say no? Will they vote against cloture tomorrow \nand thereby kill these measures? Will they do this over a proposed \nregulation which, as Senator Kyl and Senator Sessions just explained, \nis being misrepresented and used as a political scare tactic?\n  All of these benefits are being held hostage because the other side \nis pushing a politically motivated vote on an issue that is not even in \nthis bill.\n  The leadership on the other side doesn't really want to debate the \nsubstance of this bill. Sometimes I get that feeling. They would prefer \nto turn this bipartisan bill into a political football.\n  This is inexcusable because we have worked very hard throughout this \nprocess to make sure everyone's concerns, both Republican and Democrat, \nwere incorporated into this bill. I related all of those. There is no \nreason this bill should not get almost unanimous support. In fact, it \nwas voted out of committee 19 to 2. Now we have opposition from the \nother side. I don't understand.\n  Anyone who votes against cloture tomorrow is effectively voting \nagainst all of the items I just listed. This should not happen on a \nbill that is meant to create jobs in America, with an emphasis upon \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Several weeks ago, there was an article in the Washington Post \nquoting a Democratic tax aide--unidentified--saying, ``There's not a \nlot of incentives for us to figure out this problem.''\n  The Democratic aide went on to say that allowing the extraterritorial \nincome controversy to fester would yield increased sanctions--increased \ntariffs--on American products going to Europe, which would benefit the \nDemocrats in November.\n  That is a very appalling statement. I don't think that staff of \neither party are paid to think in terms of politics. They ought to be \npaid to think in terms of policy and, in the end, if they think about \npolicy, they have good politics.\n  Efforts to delay this bipartisan bill with unrelated measures is a \npoor excuse. So let's get on with the business at hand and finish this \nbill. Vote on cloture tomorrow, approve cloture, have finality on the \nbill, and when we do all that, we are going to put a jobs creation bill \nahead of partisan politics, put these important benefits I just listed \nahead of some concern that we have about an administrative regulation \nthat hasn't even been issued yet. Let's stop playing politics and put \nthe Senate back to work and move the JOBS bill forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                        Trip to the Middle East\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to talk about a trip I took \nlast week to the Middle East. I was privileged to travel with a group \nof colleagues to Israel, the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Syria, \nIraq, Kuwait, and Qatar. I will discuss it in two parts.\n  One part is what we saw happening in Iraq and the apprehension, the \nconcerns we all had with the confusion, the chaos that exists there, \nthe continued loss of life among our troops, and the inability to cope \nwith a relatively new form or a new mode of warfare where remote bombs \nare set off by people who are some distance away from the place of the \nexplosion, seeing a target they particularly want to get to, and the \nprospect that will continue to be an ever-increasing part of the \nmechanism of war. It is so tough to fight against that kind of \nweaponry, that kind of a remote attack.\n  The people are courageous. They are dedicated. I had a chance to meet \nwith some of our troops. I particularly met with a group from New \nJersey. I got the same impression from all with whom I met. These are \npeople who really want to do the right thing. They are not mercenaries. \nThey are there because of the obligation they feel toward resurrecting \nor helping the revitalizing of Iraq and turning over to them their own \nresponsibilities for governing.\n  Our people are young. Frankly, even though I served in World War II \nand was myself young--I was 18 when I enlisted--our military personnel \ntoday look different. They seem to be more educated. They seem to be \nmore thoughtful. Their bravery is unquestioned. They are out there \ndoing their duty even though there are risks all over the place which \nwe saw in abundance.\n  We left Iraq about an hour before the explosion took place at the \nhotel. We were not at the hotel, but we were nearby. We were in the air \nwhen the bomb went off. It was simply, if I can say that, a replay of \nwhat happens every day there, whether it is Iraqis being killed or \nAmericans being killed or coalition troops being killed. The death and \nthe violence is ever present.\n  I believe we are on a path to try to make it right, but what we have \nto recognize is that we are not free to leave, even though there is a \nproposal that goes into place on July 1 for a governing council made up \nof Iraqis that will purportedly take over. I say ``purportedly'' not \nbecause I am disdainful of the effort--I am not at all--but for the \nlack of readiness for governing.\n  They need 73,000 policemen, for instance, and they have in the low \ntwenties in uniform now. It is very hard to control the chaos, the \nturbulence, and the confrontations that\n\n[[Page S2985]]\n\noccur with such a small police force. It is going to take a long time, \nmaybe a couple of years, to get the police force to the size they need. \nThey also need an army.\n  What is the conclusion? The conclusion is we cannot leave there, and \nwe have to face up to it. There are 130,000 troops coming in to replace \nexisting personnel on the ground who have been there long enough to be \nrotated. Nobody believes we are going to be able to pack our bags on \nJuly 2 and start to go home. We are going to be there a long time, and \nI hope we will have the courage to face up to the funding necessary and \nput it in the budget and say what it is we are doing there.\n\n  We are adding to the total indebtedness of the country, but yet we \nhide it. We appropriated $166 billion thus far, and it looks as if we \nare going to have a supplemental request for $50 billion to $75 billion \nin the not too distant future, and it is on the side.\n  We have to support our people. You have no idea how disappointing it \nis when I talk to young people who are serving. I said: If you can be \ntotally candid with me, tell me what your complaint is. Is it the \naccommodations? Is it where you live? Is it how you live? Is it the \nfood you get? No, no, no.\n  One young man, a captain, said to me: Mr. Senator, I will tell you \nwhat bothers me. I see some of our coalition friends, people who are \nhelping us in this quest of ours, who have the latest in bulletproof \nvests. The ones we have are not as good and they do not protect us as \nwell as they should.\n  We have seen that in the papers, but here when you come face to face, \nyou see the faces of people who are wearing those vests, who are trying \nto protect themselves while they do their duty, I can tell you this: \nFive Senators--all of us--were wearing the latest in flak gear. It was \na sad commentary on where things are to hear them say they do not have \nit.\n  They point to their weapons. I think they were M-16s. I carried a \nCarbine when I was in the Army, so that is not a familiar weapon to me. \nThey said the coalition people had better, newer rifles, lighter, more \nefficient. Why should that happen? They needed trucks and armored \nvehicles, and they did not have them. Why should that happen? When we \nlook in the paper, just yesterday, and see the problem is in the \ntransportation of the materials to Iraq, that the manufacture of these \nproducts has taken place but we can't get the materials there, it is \nvery disappointing. I hope we will be able to do something to \naccelerate the pace of providing the protective gear and the equipment \nthey need.\n  Today I want to discuss another part of the trip. The volatile \nsituation in Israel--the Middle East altogether--was difficult to \nwitness. We went to Israel and the other places I mentioned--the \nPalestinian territories, et cetera.\n  The other visit was taking place with the Prime Minister of Israel \nand a few people from his staff. Suddenly activity took place and \npeople were running out and coming back with notes. The Prime Minister \nof Israel reported to us: We have just had a suicide bombing in Ashdod, \nwhich is a port community in Israel, and 10 people were killed and many \nmore wounded.\n  I watched this man, who I have known over the years, deflate and age \nin years in just a few minutes, whipped by the knowledge that more of \nhis citizens, innocent civilians, had been killed.\n  I volunteered the notion that he may want to adjourn the meeting and \ntake care of the business he had to take care of, the duties he had to \ndeal with. He said, no, as Prime Minister of the Jewish state, \nunfortunately, we learn to live with adversity and we must carry on, so \nwe will carry on the meeting.\n  It was a painful thing to witness. It happens so frequently. We are \nin a state of shock when we hear it and see it, and I know the pain \nthat must go through their community because it affects so many people. \nIt is the dead, the injured, their friends, their families, their \nfellow workers, and those with whom they serve in the military. The \npain is an excruciating whirlpool, it touches so many people. When we \nlook at that, we say, what is it that permits this kind of slaughter of \ninnocent people to take place?\n  Now we hear the shrieking about the assassination, we will call it \nthat directly, of Sheikh Yassin, the man who invented Hamas and all the \nhorrible deeds they carried out. This is after the third suicide \nbombing attack in Israel in the year 2004. The death toll now stands at \n941 Israelis killed by terrorism since the start of the intifada in \nSeptember of 2000.\n  Israel is a tiny country with a small population of 6.3 million \npeople. To put the terrorist toll in perspective, if the United States \nwere to suffer such a wave of terror attacks, over 50,000 Americans \nwould be dead, almost the same number we lost over 10 years in Vietnam, \n58,000. In Britain, it would have translated into approximately 9,000 \nfatalities. Imagine the impact that has in this single day when 10 \npeople are killed from that attack. It is the equivalent of 500 people. \nIf we had a killing in 1 day of 500 people by terrorists, we would be, \nas we were in Vietnam, in national mourning. These relative numbers \nunderscore the impact of terrorism on the Israelis.\n  Israel has seen 130 attempted suicide bombings since September 2000. \nIn the latest incident, 10 Israelis lost their lives, leaving behind \ndozens of children, grandchildren, spouses, parents and, as I said, \nfriends and workers and those with whom they served in the military.\n  As I looked at the pictures in the papers of the 10 victims, most of \nwhom were under 40, with families to support, I asked myself: What \ncould it take for 2 young Palestinian kids, 17 years old, to be capable \nof perpetrating such atrocities against innocents?\n  One of the main reasons that takes place, in my view, is the \nPalestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat has not only failed to \nrein in the terrorists but he is actively supporting a culture that \nincites young people to commit such acts. Arafat's Al Aqsa Martyrs \nBrigade claimed responsibility for the attack, along with Hamas. They \ntake pleasure in this. Large crowds of Palestinians in the West Bank \ncelebrated the attacks by honking their car horns, firing guns into the \nair and distributing candy to passersby for the killing of innocent \npeople. The Palestinian Authority did nothing to stop these \ncelebrations.\n\n  By the way, I have never heard of a celebration taking place, with \nall the violence that has been visited upon Israel, when they killed \nsome Palestinians, never. As a matter of fact, there are times when \nsoldiers in the Israeli army have refused to serve, saying their \nconscience disturbed them such they did not want to serve in those \nterritories.\n  There have been many times when Israeli civilians or soldiers have \nbeen punished for attacks on Palestinians within their community. That \nis the difference in the cultures. One culture celebrates death and \ndestruction, and the other mourns the victims on both sides of the \nboundary.\n  The reality is Yasser Arafat has instituted a deliberate policy of \npreaching and encouraging hate. Books they have in the school system \nteach them to hate the Israelis, to hate the Jews. For example, on \nMarch 13, 2004, Palestinian Authority-controlled television carried a \nspeech by a sheikh in Gaza in which he said the Jews are the sons of \napes and pigs and the extremists and terrorists who deserve death while \nwe deserve life since we have a just cause.\n  I was on a TV program one day with a representative of the Arab \norganization here, and I said this violence has to stop; you have to \ncome to some peaceful arrangement, some detente. He said: Not as long \nas the occupation continues.\n  He was an American of Palestinian heritage. So I said, well, would \nyou say Native Americans living in America, people who had their \ncountry wrested from them in the late 1600s, early 1700s, would have \nthe justification to strap bombs on their backs and go into the Federal \nReserve Bank or the Supreme Court or places such as that and blow them \nup and say this is an occupation?\n  The Presiding Officer is a man of learning and experience, and I \nwould ask: How many times have borders moved as a result of combat, as \na result of war? It has happened many times. Those adjustments remain \nin many instances.\n  When we look at the reason for this killing, instead of saying stop \nit, once and for all, Arafat should speak out and say, stop the \nkilling. We should\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\nnot lend him a hand of help, not a nickel's worth of assistance or \nanything else until he gives up that post and turns it over to people.\n  We met with the finance minister from the Palestinian Authority. He \nwas a reasonable individual, wanting to make peace, wanting to stop the \nviolence. The Palestinians cry as much as the Israelis cry when they \nlose a son or a daughter. The false belief they are going to some kind \nof martyrdom does not relieve them of the sadness of the loss of a \nfamily member.\n  We learned something else. There was an emergency meeting in Yasser \nArafat's compound in Ramallah following the suicide bombing at the \nAshdod port. Arafat refused his cabinet's call to use Palestinian \nsecurity forces against terror organizations.\n  Palestinian cabinet ministers, such as the interior minister and the \ncommander of the national security forces, pleaded with him to act \nagainst Hamas and Fatah's military wing, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. \nHe refused to intervene. He is an accomplice in these killings no \nmatter how they try to deny it. He provides no useful service to his \n``leadership in the Palestinian community.'' He incites them to \nviolence.\n  We went to Syria, and all President Assad wanted to talk about was \nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There are borders, 600-mile borders. \nHe couldn't stop the people from crossing the border. We know who is \ncrossing the border. He didn't know. He said there were people in \ninnocent travel, business, recreation, family, et cetera. Meanwhile, \nterrorists are flooding into Iraq, many of them coming across the \nSyrian border.\n\n  That is what happens there. It is the corrupt leadership that has \npeople believing the way out is to kill themselves and to kill Israelis \nand other innocent people. We don't know what the reach is. To the \ntrain bombing in Spain or other acts of violence in other parts of the \nworld? But this notion that violence is an acceptable form of behavior \nis outrageous, and Arafat is allowing Palestinian society to be \nundermined and destroyed by a reign of terror. He has chosen to allow \nterrorism to flourish. Because of Arafat's lack of action, not only are \nIsraeli children being orphaned and Israeli society terrorized, but \nalso the Palestinian people's dream of living in a secure, free, and \nvibrant state is being destroyed.\n  I still believe all roads and roadmaps lead to a two-state solution. \nWhen I was in the region last week, I urged the Israeli leadership to \ntry to meet and resume direct contacts with Palestinian officials in \norder to try to make progress toward a settlement. I told Prime \nMinister Sharon that his plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip was a \ngood start. Such a withdrawal, however, must be done in coordination \nwith Palestinian and international officials to ensure there is a \nviable infrastructure to govern the people and to prevent Hamas and the \nIslamic Jihad from overrunning the Gaza Strip.\n  I also encouraged the Israeli Prime Minister to work with the \ninternational community to resume progress on the roadmap and to begin \nlooking at how to withdraw remote Jewish settlements from the West Bank \nas well as from the Gaza Strip. Yet any real progress on the roadmap \ndepends on the speedy emergence of new Palestinian leaders who realize \nthat a healthy Palestinian state cannot be built on a foundation of \nterror and violence. On this point, there should be no concessions, no \nflexibility, no turning a blind eye.\n  Today we see pictures of angry mobs in the Arab world protesting the \ndeath of Sheik Yassin, the head of Hamas. The Israeli military's \nstrategy of targeted assassinations is questionable and controversial. \nBut I have to ask my colleagues, if someone is standing in your kid's \nschoolyard with a gun in his hand, what would you do? Would you meet \nwith him and confer about what he ought to do or would you take \nadvantage of the opportunity of the moment and abolish the threat? Do \nyou eliminate the threat immediately or abide by the Marquis of \nQueensbury rules when dealing with terrorists? These are difficult \nquestions, but given the lack of real leadership on the Palestinian \nside, the Israelis are trying to find the best way to protect their \npopulation from terror.\n  Peace in the Middle East begins with the removal of Arafat from \npower. It is a step the Palestinians must take if they want to move \ntheir nation forward. Peace will not be obtained through terror but \nonly through peaceful negotiation. It is something Yasser Arafat \nclearly does not understand, but we have to help him understand. We \ncan't give him any other help of any kind. As a matter of fact, \nwhatever sanctions we can put on him and his corrupt government, we \nought to do it.\n\n  It is very painful to witness, I understand, for those who are \nengaged in the innocent pursuit of life, to suddenly come face to face \nwith someone who has been encouraged to give up his life. What kind of \nfalse notion is this, that somehow or other you get rewarded for losing \na son or daughter and get a financial reward? I think what we ought to \ndo is try to trace those financial rewards to the countries that offer \nthem. Maybe friends like Saudi Arabia ought to step up and do their \nshare to not permit this to happen, to not permit these militant groups \nto exist in their society.\n  I can tell you one thing. After our visit there, I am more convinced \nthan ever that we must protect Israel no matter what we have to do to \nsee that she survives. It is not because we just love those people. It \nis because we love the American people. It is because we want to \nprotect America's interests. It is because we don't want to have \nAmerican troops in the middle of that mad world, with corrupt \ngovernments who siphon off the wealth of their countries while their \npeople in those communities starve and have no opportunity for \nthemselves.\n  That is the interest I see we have in a strong Israel. It is not just \nthe informational exchange. That is important. But it is the fact of \nIsrael sitting there as a reminder to those corrupt countries, and it \nis an extension of democracy. It is not an extension of the United \nStates. It is not the 51st State. It is an extension of democracy, and \nit shows what people can do when they can take a malaria-ridden nation \nand change it into a thriving agricultural and scientific nation. That \nis the example that has to be set and that is the one that has to be \nunderstood and we ought not to equivocate and say there is violence on \nboth sides. That is the wrong message. You can't say that because that \nonly encourages terrorism. It says violence on one side begets violence \non the other side.\n  I said it before. I have never heard an Israeli, and I know many, nor \nhave I ever seen the country, celebrate the death of children on the \nother side of the boundary. I have never seen them celebrate when men, \nwomen, and children who are innocent are killed--never.\n  But in the Palestinian community they celebrate by shooting off guns \nand handing out candy to kids and parading, happy that they have taken \nsomeone out of the family, a child, a sister or brother, mother, \nfather--outrageous. Outrageous.\n  We have to stand steadfast in our support of Israel. We have to \ninsist that Arafat step aside and provide them the right leadership, \nand there is leadership there but they don't have a chance to operate \nbecause he robs them of that opportunity.\n  It was a wonderful opportunity we had to see what was taking place \nthere and be able to report back and shape our thinking based on the \nneed.\n  Support our troops. Commend them for what it is that they do in \naccordance with the tenets of democracy and ultimately decency. We can \nargue whether we should be there or we should not be there, but we are \nthere and we have to support those people as fully as we can, everyone \nwho wears a uniform. We have to be proud of them. They do their duty \nsplendidly.\n  With those thoughts, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the bill, S. 1125, which provides for relief on the serious \nproblem facing America involving asbestos.\n  I have had a number of inquiries on the status of the bill. I \nrecently received a comprehensive memorandum by former Chief Judge \nEdward R. Becker for the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. I \nthought it would be useful to comment as to the status of this bill at \nthe present time.\n  Asbestos litigation has caused some 67 bankruptcies in America, and \nthe injuries from asbestos have left workers without compensation and \nsuffering from mesothelioma, asbestosis, and other very serious \nailments. In July, the Judiciary Committee passed out S. 1125. I voted \nfor it. It was a vote pretty much along party lines. We passed it out \nof committee so we could take the next step looking toward floor \naction.\n  But the bill required a great deal of evaluation, analysis, and \nsignificant changes. I contacted senior Circuit Judge Edward R. Becker, \nwho had been chief judge of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \nuntil May 5 of last year. Since he had been involved in major asbestos \nlitigation, I thought he would have special insights into this issue \nand this problem. He is one of America's leading Federal jurists, if \nnot the leading Federal jurist. He received the Devitt award last year \nas the author of many scholarly opinions. He was a district judge from \n1970 to 1982. He has been on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \nfrom 1982 until the present time.\n  I think bringing in a Federal jurist to help on a legislative matter \nis unprecedented. During the month of August, when the Senate was in \nrecess, 2 full days were spent in Judge Becker's chambers in \nPhiladelphia, where I attended, and we had representatives from the \nmanufacturers of asbestos; insurance companies, which insured asbestos \nmanufacturers; reinsurers, who reinsured the insurers; representatives \nof the AFL-CIO, representing the injured parties; and trial lawyers, \nalso representing the injured parties.\n  Since those two meetings in August, there have been a series of \nadditional meetings in Washington in my office, where Judge Becker has \nattended. One meeting involved Majority Leader Bill Frist. Another \nmeeting involved representatives of the Department of Labor. In total, \nthere have been some 15 meetings. We are scheduled to have our 16th one \non Thursday of this week.\n  The bill--the product of very inventive thinking by the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Hatch--has created a fund, funded initially at \n$104 billion. It has subsequently been increased. The thrust was to \ncreate a schedule of payments very much like workers' compensation, \nwhere there would not have to be proof of causality, proof of \nliability; but once the damages were established coming from asbestos, \nthe payments would follow this schedule.\n  The situation has been compounded, as I say, by the bankruptcy \nproceedings and the reorganization of some 67 companies. The law has \nbeen that workers, or others exposed to asbestos, could be compensated \nfor the full range of their potential injuries even if they had not yet \nsustained those injuries--a result which I submit does not make good \nsense in a context where many people who have serious injuries, \nmesothelioma, asbestosis, and others who are not being compensated at \nall. This seeks to correct those inequities.\n  We have wrestled with a great many of the problems, and we have \nsolved a great many issues. Enormous progress has been made on others. \nWe have had the cooperation of many Senators. Senator Hatch has had \nrepresentatives at the meeting. Senator Leahy, the ranking Democrat, \nhas had representatives there. The majority leader, Senator Frist, and \nthe Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, have had representatives there. \nSenators Dodd, Carper, Feinstein and Nelson have also participated with \nrepresentatives present. Judge Becker prepared a very comprehensive \nmemorandum, dated March 16, outlining the evaluation of the current \nstatus of ongoing efforts to achieve a consensus among the \nmanufacturers and insurers, the trial lawyers, and the AFL-CIO.\n  It is my view that this is the kind of bill that cannot be enacted \nunless there is a consensus. Unless there is agreement among all of the \nstakeholders or parties, I think we will not be able to enact this \nimportant legislation. If this legislation were to be enacted, it would \nbe an enormous stimulus to the economy and would take these many \ncompanies that are in bankruptcy proceedings out of those proceedings \nso that they become again productive.\n  Many of those companies are in my home State of Pennsylvania and many \nacross the country.\n  That is a very brief summary as to where we stand. We will be back at \nwork on Thursday. We are determined to solve these problems. I am \noptimistic they can be solved. The majority leader has stated his \nintention to bring this matter to the floor for a vote some time next \nmonth. I think we are very close to knowing whether we can resolve \nthese issues, and we will continue to try to do that.\n  I repeat, I am optimistic we can resolve the issues. The stakes are \nvery high. We have many injured workers who are relying upon some \nanswer to their just compensation. The companies are looking for an \nanswer, and the economy needs to be stimulated and also looks for an \nanswer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the memorandum from Senior Chief Judge \nEdward R. Becker, dated March 16, 2004, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     Date: March 16, 2004.\n     To: Senator Arlen Specter.\n     From: Judge Edward R. Becker.\n     Re: Pending Asbestos Legislation S. 1125 (Fairness in \n         Asbestos Injury Resolution Act) (Status Report on \n         Progress of our Mediation).\n       You have asked that I memorialize my evaluation of the \n     current status of our ongoing efforts to achieve a consensus \n     among the manufacturers and other defendant companies, the \n     insurers, the reinsurers, organized labor, and the trial \n     lawyers, i.e., the stakeholders concerned with S. 1125, so as \n     to facilitate consideration of the legislation by the Senate \n     and make possible its ultimate passage in a form satisfactory \n     to the stakeholders and the Senate. This is an interim \n     evaluation. I will be in better position to evaluate the \n     situation after the weekly meeting this Thursday, March 18, \n     2004. That is because at our meeting of March 11, it was \n     represented to us that draft legislative language with \n     respect to a number of key issues, including ``start-up'' of \n     the National Trust Fund, on which the stakeholders are \n     apparently close to consensus, will be presented on March 18. \n     The start-up consensus, as I understand it, is to have the \n     insurers and manufacturers put up substantial sums on ``day \n     one'' so that the Fund can be jump-started and exigent claims \n     can come right into the Fund and not have to linger in the \n     tort system. I have urged that language be drafted to \n     authorize Bankruptcy Courts to approve immediate payments by \n     the Tier 1 (Chapter XI) companies into the Trust Fund. I will \n     give you a follow-up evaluation after the March 18 meeting.\n       As you know we have made enormous progress over the last \n     few months on quite a number of issues, and already have a \n     clean consensus draft of a comprehensive administrative \n     structure for processing claims which, subject to review by \n     Senate Legislative Counsel, can go right into the bill. Based \n     on representations at recent meetings, I believe that we can \n     expect (consensus) bill language in the next week or two, \n     tying up the few loose ends on the administrative structure, \n     particularly the statute of limitations issue and the \n     definition of exigent claims. The issue of limits on \n     attorney's fees will also have to be resolved, but I think \n     that is do-able. I also expect very shortly consensus bill \n     language covering non-discrimination by health insurers with \n     respect to coverage against workers receiving benefits \n     under S. 1125; and engrafting into S. 1125 Health \n     Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA) \n     presumptions regarding exposure criteria; i.e., rebuttable \n     presumptions concerning the extent to which employment (a) \n     in specific industries, (b) in specific occupations within \n     those industries, and/or (c) during specific time periods \n     constitutes ``significant occupational exposure.''\n       There are quite a number of other issues on which the \n     stakeholders represent that they are close to agreement \n     including:\n       1. Values as a range\n       2. Timing of payments\n       3. Exclusivity for all asbestos related claims (silica, \n     etc.)\n       4. The anatomy of medical monitoring\n       5. Collusive default judgment\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\n       6. The smoking matrix.\n       These matters can, I believe, be put into consensus bill \n     form quickly, and I will seek to establish a timetable at \n     Thursday's meeting.\n       Another key area on which the parties seem close to \n     agreement is the status of settlements and pending cases. The \n     views that you expressed--that a case that has been settled \n     should be out of the National Trust--seemed to be accepted by \n     all. There were two caveats. One related to partial \n     settlements--with some but not all potential defendants, but \n     I believe that a formula can be worked out to deal with that \n     situation. The second related to generalized agreements \n     between plaintiffs' counsel with large inventory of cases and \n     insurance carriers as to the terms of settlement when the \n     cases become ripe. I do not believe that such ``settlements'' \n     should qualify. I believe that other pending cases should go \n     into the S. 1125 National Trust. I note, however, that there \n     are 300,000 pending cases, and unless start-up can be quite \n     effective Labor would prefer that they be processed in the \n     tort system. I still believe that the pending claim issue is \n     resolvable.\n       Another critical area where much progress has been made is \n     ``sunset.'' Based on representations at last week's meeting, \n     I believe that we are in striking distance of an agreement on \n     sunset, including the timing of sunset; program review (so as \n     to anticipate the need for sunset); and return to the tort \n     system. There is some disagreement as to whether the return \n     to the tort system should be in state or federal court. I \n     understand that your position is that the return should be to \n     federal court, so as to avoid the excesses of certain state \n     jurisdictions. I agree, and believe that the stakeholders, \n     with the exception of the trial lawyers, will be satisfied \n     with that result. Another sunset-related issue that is under \n     discussion and needs resolution is whether, in the event of \n     sunset, the Tier 1 companies (those presently in Chapter XI) \n     go back to the Bankruptcy Court, so as to assure that funds \n     dedicated to Bankruptcy not be dispersed (disbursed) at \n     large. I believe that issue too to be capable of early \n     resolution.\n       In our recent meeting with high officials of the railroad \n     industry and the rail unions, we discussed in depth the \n     treatment of rail workers with asbestos disease under S. \n     1125. It was the position of the rail unions that the \n     preemption by S. 1125 of the right of rail workers to file \n     claims under the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA) is \n     unfair because non-rail workers maintain their full rights to \n     seek workers' compensation from their employers for asbestos \n     related diseases. However, our discussion revealed that the \n     supposed discrimination was largely illusory because 95% of \n     the rail workers with asbestos disease are retired and would \n     have no traditional workers' compensation claims. It was \n     acknowledged by all that the scheme of S. 1125 does leave \n     non-retired rail workers modestly worse off than their non-\n     rail counterparts, and we charged the stakeholders with \n     coming up with a formula that would create parity. We are \n     awaiting the results of their deliberations. If they do not \n     reach agreement, the Senate could settle it.\n       The insurers and reinsurers are struggling to come up with \n     an allocation formula that would obviate the need for an \n     Asbestos Insurer's Commission (appointed by the President). \n     If they cannot, the Commission can remain in the bill (as a \n     kind of ``club''--for S. 1125 already provides that if an \n     allocation formula is agreed to by all participants in each \n     insurer group and approved by the Commission and the House-\n     Senate Judiciary Committees, the Commission will terminate. \n     Section 212(2). I have entreated the stakeholders to work on \n     a redraft on the Asbestos Insurer's Commission language, \n     Sec. 219 et seq., which is presently cumbersome, and they \n     have agreed to do so. At the very least, the requirement of \n     100% agreement seems too high. I note that the creation of a \n     Commission is not a matter of great urgency because it \n     is anticipated that the start-up payment of both the \n     insurers and reinsurers will be very substantial, \n     postponing the need for a Commission decision on \n     allocation. We also discussed last week mechanisms for \n     assuring the contributions (and collecting of \n     contributions) from offshore reinsurers. A number of \n     potential statutory provisions were discussed, and I think \n     that this aspect of the matter can be resolved.\n       We had a good deal of discussion last week about what to do \n     with pending bankruptcies. I expressed the view, based upon a \n     conversation that morning with the bankruptcy judge who is \n     handing most of the asbestos bankruptcy cases, that it will \n     be quite some time, at least a year and probably a good deal \n     longer, before the major bankruptcies can be resolved; even \n     if plans are agreed upon and are confirmed, the insurers will \n     appeal. Consequently, I urged that the pending bankruptcies \n     be folded into the National Trust. The Tier 1 (Chapter XI) \n     companies are liable under S. 1125 for roughly 20% of the \n     Trust funding, so that their participation in the National \n     Trust is essential. Additionally, it appears that, with fast \n     start up, the claimants will receive compensation from the \n     Trust Fund much more quickly then they would from the \n     bankruptcy trusts. I believe that the stakeholders are \n     comfortable with this view. Drafting is simple.\n       It appears that Labor feels that the Tier 1 companies \n     should pay more than S. 1125 provides, i.e. what they would \n     pay on bankruptcy. The Tier 1 companies, however, point out \n     that they will already pay a significantly greater percentage \n     then the non-bankrupt companies, and further argue that any \n     effort to make them pay into the Trust Fund the amount they \n     might have to pay in bankruptcy is not sound, because: (1) in \n     most cases these amounts are at present speculative (usually \n     agreed to by only one class of creditors), and, at all \n     events, subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court (in one \n     case the Court disapproved); (2) the deal under S. 1125 is \n     different because in bankruptcy they are forever discharged \n     whereas under S. 1125 they may be back in the tort system; \n     and (3) companies such as Armstrong would be dealt a body \n     blow by such a provision. Since the increment is at most $1 \n     billion, I do not think that this is a ``deal breaker.''\n       I turn now to the few remaining issues. Medical screening \n     and education for high risk workers must be resolved. I do \n     not think that one is too tough. Some technical bankruptcy \n     issues such as the problematic floating Chapter XI lien and \n     some points raised by the Bankruptcy Administration Division \n     of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts must \n     be resolved. These are just drafting problems. There are, \n     however, three critical issues remaining, the second and \n     third of which will make or break the bill, and they are \n     related.\n       The first is subrogation of workers' compensation payments \n     (health insurer subrogation is apparently not a problem). \n     Labor firmly believes there should be no subrogation; it \n     represents that no similar federal program provides for it. \n     The insurers and business think there should be subrogation \n     to avoid ``double dipping.'' One major manufacturer \n     represented at the talks did not see failure to provide for \n     workers comp subrogation as a problem, but others thought \n     that the failure to mention subrogation in the bill would \n     alter future behavior by encouraging more comp claims. We \n     charged the stakeholders with ascertaining the dollar amounts \n     involved. I suspect that they are not as great as imagined, \n     especially in view of the number of workers with asbestos \n     disease who are retired. These appears to be a will to work \n     this out.\n       The second issue is ``transparency''--the need to assure \n     Labor and the claimants that the funding formula (for \n     insurers and especially manufacturers and other defendants) \n     will yield the sums projected by the bill's sponsors. Labor \n     maintains that on the present record there is no way to know \n     this. Business concedes that there is no extant list of the \n     companies who will be in the various tiers, and that there \n     will not be one. The companies acknowledge that they must \n     come up with a solution to the transparency problem, whether \n     it is joint or several liability, or guarantees, or \n     surcharges, or something else, or there can be no consensus. \n     They have promised to come up with something.\n       The final--and most difficult issue--is the funding level. \n     Labor claims that the projected $114 billion is grossly \n     inadequate to pay the needed compensation to the injured \n     workers. This matter is well beyond my portfolio. I believe \n     that Labor must come down considerably from the Leahy-Kennedy \n     values, and that business must ``sweeten'' considerably the \n     Frist values. If all the other issues can be worked out, \n     perhaps the Senate leadership can prevail on the stakeholders \n     to reach agreement on the projected dollars.\n       One final comment. I cannot praise too highly the \n     representatives of the stakeholders who have participated in \n     our dialogue. They are working assiduously, constantly (two \n     or three meetings per week), and, in my view, earnestly, and \n     in a spirit of cooperation and in good faith to try to reach \n     consensus. Senate staff has also been of very great help. I \n     believe that if we can keep up the current pace for another \n     four weeks, five at the most, we can get the job done. I may \n     be wrong. The dollars may be the final stumbling bloc, \n     However, I am prepared to give it my ``best shot,'' and to \n     come to your office every week to work with you to keep the \n     ball rolling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2988-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2988-S2989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HANH THAI DUONG\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Hanh \nThai Duong, a woman who epitomizes the American dream. Duong is the \nowner of a restaurant in my hometown of Louisville, KY, The Lemongrass \nCafe.\n  Duong's journey from Vietnam to America is a miraculous one. In 1979, \nwhen she was only 10 years old, the Vietnamese government told her \nfamily that they would be able to leave Vietnam because of her father's \nChinese ancestry, but only if they gave up all of their possessions and \npaid a sum in gold to the Vietnamese government. They decided the trip \nwould be worth the risk, so they left everything behind and boarded a \nfishing boat that took them to a new life in Hong Kong.\n  A year later, with the help of a relative in Louisville and a number \nof Catholic charities, Duong and her family left Hong Kong for \nKentucky. Duong's unwavering determination and a belief in the \nimportance of an education, helped her work her way through the \nUniversity of Louisville and earn a degree in finance and international \nbusiness.\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\n  After her parents retired, Duong followed in their footsteps and \nopened her own restaurant, The Lemongrass Cafe;, bringing a taste of \nher native land to her new home. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to \nrecognize and pay tribute to this remarkable woman.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article, ``Restaurant \na testament to Vietnamese family's drive'' from The Courier-Journal, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Feb. 22, 2004]\n\n          Restaurant a Testament to Vietnamese Family's Drive\n\n                          (By Byron Crawford)\n\n       The Lemongrass Cafe in Louisville's Highlands neighborhood \n     is more than a quaint oasis for Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese \n     cuisine. It is a monument to one Vietnamese family's appetite \n     for freedom and opportunity.\n       The cafe's proprietor, Hanh Thai Duong, 34, was 10 years \n     old in 1979 when the Vietnamese government told her parents \n     that because of her father's Chinese ancestry the family \n     would be allowed to leave Vietnam--if they gave up all their \n     possessions and paid the government a sum in gold.\n       ``You really leave empty-handed, but my mom and dad were \n     thinking for a better future for their children,'' Duong \n     said. ``My parents always said that the United States was the \n     land of opportunity. We left on a fishing boat for Hong \n     Kong.''\n       Such voyages were treacherous. The boats were small and \n     often unsafe.\n       The trips sometimes took weeks. Twenty to 30 passengers \n     jammed into tight quarters and often went days without food. \n     Pirates roamed the South China Sea, sometimes boarding the \n     fishing vessels, killing, raping and taking women and \n     children captives.\n       ``We were lucky. It only took us four or five days to reach \n     Hong Kong, but my aunt and her twins did not get to Hong Kong \n     . . . for like a month or so, and one of the twins died of \n     hunger and they ended up burying her out at sea,'' Duong \n     said. ``As soon as my aunt stepped on the ground in Hong \n     Kong, she passed away, too.''\n       Duong's baby sister was badly burned in an accident soon \n     after the fishing boat reached Hong Kong Harbor and was taken \n     to the mainland for treatment. The family lost track of the \n     child for months but finally found her in a refugee camp. \n     Duong's mother, not having seen the baby for months, did not \n     immediately recognize her.\n       Another of Duong's aunts, who then lived in Louisville, \n     sponsored the family to immigrate in 1980, and they were \n     flown to America by Catholic Charities, which they later \n     repaid. Duong's father, Trung Thai, had owned a successful \n     grocery-supply business in Vietnam, and her mother, Nga, was \n     a good cook. They opened a small restaurant from which they \n     have since retired.\n       Duong married at an early age but was determined to get an \n     education, and she worked her way through the University of \n     Louisville to earn a degree in finance and international \n     business. She and her husband, Edward Duong--who had twice \n     been captured while trying to leave Vietnam in violation of \n     government orders--later lived in New York City. But they \n     soon decided that they preferred Louisville, where \n     Edward Duong now works at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant.\n       Hanh Duong's older brother and younger sister both earned \n     degrees from UofL and are working in business. Another sister \n     owns a nail salon and her youngest sister is working her way \n     through college.\n       ``You think about your parents' sacrifice for you and you \n     don't want to fail,'' she said. ``You don't take things for \n     granted and you don't give up easily.''\n       Duong has forgotten much of her early life in Vietnam, but \n     a few vivid memories remain: one of her parents running with \n     her for shelter as bombs exploded nearby, and her mother \n     being wounded by a stray bullet near their home in Saigon \n     (now known as Ho Chi Minh City).\n       Today, Duong works hard in the Lemongrass Cafe, on \n     Bardstown Road to make happier memories for her children--a \n     daughter, Cheryl, 17, a senior at Male High School and a \n     Governor's Scholar who will enter the University of Kentucky \n     next fall, and a son, Nick, 9, a student at Greathouse/\n     Shryock Traditional Elementary School. Many of their \n     grandmother's favorite recipes are helping to lure customers \n     to their mother's cafe.\n       ``Other than the delicious food, I guess it was just the \n     simplicity of Lemongrass and the personality of Hanh that I \n     like about the place,'' said Jeannie Treitz, a frequent \n     customer.\n       A few years ago, Hanh said, she took her children to \n     Vietnam to show them the country their parents and \n     grandparents had fled.\n       ``They were raised here and they don't know how people have \n     to struggle in Vietnam,'' she said. ``I took them back so \n     they could understand that they have bundles of opportunities \n     here, and that they should work hard and never give up on \n     anything.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2989-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2989-S2990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RFIDS AND THE DAWNING MICRO MONITORING REVOLUTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I outlined some of the privacy \nchallenges we will soon face as new micro monitoring technologies begin \nto proliferate in our society. I spoke in particular about \nbreakthroughs in Radio Frequency Identification, also known as RFID.\n  My remarks were offered at Georgetown University Law Center, during a \nconference on the legal and technological challenges of video \nsurveillance. Micro monitoring is a subject that deserves the attention \nof the Senate and of the American people, and I ask unanimous consent \nthe text of my address be printed in the Record in the interest of \nadvancing this discussion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n   The Dawn of Micro Monitoring: It's Promise, and its Challenges to \n                          Privacy and Security\n\n       In our post-9/11 world, technology often has been our \n     crucial but silent partner in helping us to ramp up our law \n     enforcement and national security capabilities. We in this \n     city are profoundly aware of the new risks we face. But we \n     also need to do it right. The public does not want false \n     assurances, nor do they want to be unduly alarmed. What the \n     American people want is to actually be safer. And we still \n     have a way to go in accomplishing that.\n\n\n                  Tension Between Liberty And Security\n\n       In our constitutional system there is always tension \n     between liberty and security and never more so than since \n     September 11th. One of the difficult challenges we face is to \n     strike the right midpoint. Our constitutional checks and \n     balances are intended to help us do that.\n       The video technologies you are discussing today offer tools \n     that are better, faster and smarter, on scales of magnitude \n     that are unprecedented. As an advocate of emerging \n     technologies who also has a keen interest in them, I watch \n     these breakthroughs with great interest.\n       I have sought to find ways to encourage the commercial \n     sector to create new products and opportunities, and I have \n     promoted use of new technologies by law enforcement agencies, \n     while also protecting consumer privacy and constitutional \n     freedoms. That was the balance I sought to strike in my work \n     on CALEA and in other legislation that blends law \n     enforcement's needs, the needs of our robust technology \n     sector, and the privacy interests of the American people. The \n     hands-off approach to the Internet that I have favored is \n     another example, and right now I am working with others to \n     extend the Internet tax moratorium, to keep the Internet free \n     from discriminatory and multiple state and local taxes.\n\n\n              On The Cusp Of A Micro-Monitoring Revolution\n\n       The marriage of information-gathering technology with \n     information storing technology, manipulated in increasingly \n     sophisticated databases, is beginning to produce the defining \n     privacy challenge of the information age. Modern databases, \n     networks and the Internet allow us to easily collect, store, \n     distribute and combine video, audio and other digital trails \n     of our daily transactions. We are on the verge of a \n     revolution in micro-monitoring the capability for the highly \n     detailed, largely automatic, widespread surveillance of our \n     daily lives.\n\n\n                                 RFIDs\n\n       And one of the most dramatic and dazzling new challenges we \n     all will be facing soon is the emergence of a relatively new, \n     surveillance-related technology called radio frequency \n     identification--R-F-I-D for short.\n       RFID tags are tiny computer chips that can be attached to \n     physical items in order to provide identification and \n     tracking by radio. Their potential invasiveness is obvious \n     from their size, which already is surprisingly small. And \n     they will only get smaller.\n       In their basic function, RFID chips are like barcodes, \n     which by now are ubiquitous in our stores and offices and \n     crime labs and manufacturing plants.\n\n\n                          Barcodes On Steroids\n\n       But RFID chips are like supercharged barcodes--barcodes on \n     steroids, if you will. They are so small they can be tagged \n     onto almost any object. They do not have to be in open view; \n     RFID receivers just have to be within the vicinity--at a \n     security checkpoint, in a doorway, inside a mailbox, atop a \n     traffic light. And RFID chips can carry a lot more \n     information than barcodes. Some versions are recordable so \n     that they can carry along the object's entire history.\n       RFID chips are more powerful than today's video \n     surveillance technology. RFIDs are more reliable, they are \n     100 percent automatic, and they are likely to become more \n     pervasive because they are significantly less expensive, and \n     there are many business advantages to using them. RFIDs seem \n     poised to become the catalyst that will launch the age of \n     micro-monitoring.\n       I have followed RFID technology for some time and have \n     welcomed its potential for many constructive uses. I have \n     supported the use of RFIDs in a Vermont pilot program for \n     tracking cattle to curtail outbreaks, like mad cow disease, \n     and our Vermont program\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\n     is now being emulated for a national tracking system. RFID \n     technology may also help thwart prescription drug \n     counterfeiting, a use the FDA encouraged in a recent report. \n     Leading retailers like Wal-Mart and Target--as well as the \n     Department of Defense--are requiring its use by suppliers for \n     inventory control. Fifty million pets around the world have \n     embedded RFID chips. Of course, many of us already have \n     experience with simpler versions of the technology in ``smart \n     tags'' at toll booths and ``speed passes'' at gas stations.\n       But this is just the beginning. RFID technology is on the \n     brink of widespread applications in manufacturing, \n     distribution, retail, healthcare, safety, security, law \n     enforcement, intellectual property protection and many other \n     areas, including mundane applications like keeping track of \n     personal possessions. Some visionaries imagine, quote, ``an \n     internet of objects''--a world in which billions of objects \n     will report their location, identity, and history over \n     wireless connections. Those days of long hunts around the \n     house for lost keys and remote controls might be a \n     frustration of the past.\n       These all raise exciting possibilities, but they also raise \n     potentially troubling tangents. While it may be a good idea \n     for a retailer to use RFID chips to manage its inventory, we \n     would not want a retailer to put those tags on goods for sale \n     without consumers' knowledge, without knowing how to \n     deactivate them, and without knowing what information will be \n     collected and how it will be used. While we might want the \n     Pentagon to be able to manage its supplies with RFID tags, we \n     would not want an al Qaeda operative to find out about our \n     resources by simply using a hidden RFID scanner in a war \n     situation.\n\n\n                             Drawing Lines\n\n       Of course these are just some of the foreseeable \n     possibilities, and a lot depends on enhancements in the \n     technology, reductions in costs, and developments in \n     voluntary standard-setting, systems and infrastructure to \n     manage RFID-collected information. But the RFID train is \n     beginning to leave the station, and now is the right time to \n     begin a national discussion about where, if at all, any lines \n     will be drawn to protect privacy rights.\n       The need to draw some lines is already becoming clear. \n     Recent reports revealed clandestine tests at a Wal-Mart store \n     where RFID tags were inserted in packages of Max Factor \n     lipsticks, with RFID scanners hidden on nearby shelves. The \n     radio signals triggered nearby surveillance cameras to allow \n     researchers 750 miles away to watch those consumers in \n     action. A similar test occurred with Gillette razors at \n     another Wal-Mart store.\n       These excesses suggest that Congress may need to step in at \n     some point. When privacy intrusions reach the point of \n     behavior that is absurdly out of bounds, we find ourselves \n     having to deal with such issues as the ``Video Voyeurism \n     Prevention Act,'' a bill now before Congress that would ban \n     the use of camera to spy in bathrooms and up women's skirts, \n     a practice that by now has even been given a name, \n     ``upskirting,'' which I'm sure is as new to you as it is to \n     most of us in Congress.\n       Other powerful new technologies are on the horizon, like \n     sensor technology and nanotechnology. All the more reason to \n     think about these issues broadly and to establish guiding \n     principles serving the twin goals of fostering useful \n     technologies while keeping them from overtaking our civil \n     liberties.\n       With RFID technology as with many other surveillance \n     technologies, we need to consider how it will be used, and \n     will it be effective. What information will it gather, and \n     how long will that data be kept? Who will have access to \n     those data banks, and under what checks-and-balances? Will \n     the public have appropriate notice, opportunity to consent \n     and due process in the case mistakes are made? How will the \n     data be secured from theft, negligence and abuse, and how \n     will accuracy be ensured? In what cases should law \n     enforcement agencies be able to use this information, and \n     what safeguards should apply? There should be a general \n     presumption that Americans can know when their personal \n     information is collected, and to see, check and correct any \n     errors.\n       These are all questions we need to consider, and it is \n     entirely possible that Congress may decide that enacting \n     general parameters would be constructive. It is important \n     that we let RFID technology reach its potential without \n     unnecessary constraints. But it is equally important that we \n     ensure protections against privacy invasions and other \n     abuses. Technology may also help with the answers--for \n     example, ``blockers'' that deactivate RFID tags, and software \n     that thwarts spyware.\n\n\n                     Beginning A National Dialogue\n\n       There is no downside to a public dialogue about these \n     issues, but there are many dangers in waiting too long to \n     start. We need clear communication about the goals, plans and \n     uses of the technology, so that we can think in advance about \n     the best ways to encourage innovation, while conserving the \n     public's right to privacy.\n       We have seen this time and time again where a potentially \n     good approach is hampered because of lack of communication \n     with Congress, the public and lack of adequate consideration \n     for privacy and civil liberties.\n       Take for example the so-called CAPPS II program. No doubt \n     in a post-9/11 world, we should have an effective airline \n     screening system. But the Administration quietly put this \n     program together, collected passengers' information without \n     their knowledge and piloted this program without \n     communicating with us and before privacy protections were in \n     place. The result was a recent GAO analysis that showed \n     pervasive problems in the screening program and admissions \n     that we are now set back in our efforts to create an \n     effective screening system.\n       As another example, the Administration recently funded the \n     MATRIX program to provide law enforcement access to state \n     government and commercial databases. This was potentially a \n     useful crime-fighting tool. But there was insufficient \n     information about the program and about potentially intrusive \n     data mining capabilities, and there were unaddressed concerns \n     about privacy protections. Now 11 out of 16 states \n     participating in the program have pulled out--many, citing \n     privacy concerns--thus hampering the effectiveness of the \n     information sharing program. Again, had some of these issues \n     been vetted in advance, we may have been able to enhance law \n     enforcement intelligence.\n       Just recently, there were reports about the FBI's new \n     Strategic Medical Intelligence program, in which doctors have \n     been enlisted to report to the FBI ``any suspicious event,'' \n     such as an unusual rash or a lost finger. The goal of \n     preventing bio-terrorism is important. But there are many \n     unanswered questions about the program's privacy protections \n     and its ability to identify truly suspicious events and not \n     unrelated personal medical situations. Hopefully, this \n     program will not be hampered by lack of communication and \n     oversight.\n       I have written oversight letters to the Justice Department \n     and to the Department of Homeland Security on all of these \n     issues and am waiting for their responses.\n       I want to make sure that mistakes like those are not \n     repeated, especially with RFID technology, where there is so \n     much potential value. That is why I asked to speak with you \n     today, to begin the process of encouraging public dialogue in \n     both the commercial and public sectors before the RFID genie \n     is let fully out of its bottle.\n       This is a dialogue that should cut across the political \n     spectrum, and it should include the possibility of \n     constructive, bipartisan congressional hearings. The earlier \n     we begin this discussion, the greater the prospects for \n     success in reaching consensus on a set of guiding principles.\n       When several of us from both parties banded together years \n     ago to found the Congressional Internet Caucus, we were \n     united by our appreciation for what the Internet would do for \n     our society. Years later, we remain united, we remain \n     optimistic, and partisanship has never interfered in the \n     Caucus's work.\n       That is the spirit in which I hope a discussion can now \n     begin on micro-monitoring.\n       Thank you for your interest in these cutting-edge issues, \n     and thanks for this opportunity to share some ideas with you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2990-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2990-S2991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate \nInternational Women's Day, which is celebrated around the world on \nMarch 8. For nearly a century, women's groups worldwide have paused on \nthis day to celebrate the achievements and contributions of women \naround the globe. This day is also an opportunity to reflect on the \nchallenges that women continue to face in their daily lives.\n  Despite the progress women have made in many countries, women \nworldwide continue to confront discrimination, violence and even \nslavery. In central Africa and, specifically, in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, DRC, sexual violence has increasingly been used \nas a weapon against women and girls. These horrific acts cannot be \ntolerated, and those responsible for these atrocities must be held \naccountable. At the same time, the international community must reach \nout to help provide medical and psycho-social support to women and \ngirls affected by these horrors, and must work vigorously with civil \nsociety and local authorities to prevent these abuses in the future.\n  Sadly, these violent acts are not isolated instances. Rather, they \nare indicative of the violence occurring against women in many conflict \nzones. Experts note that women and girls are most affected by violence, \neconomic instability, and displacement associated with warfare. At \nhome, in flight or in refugee camps, they are frequently threatened by \nrape and sexual exploitation. Far too many victims of domestic violence \nand of human trafficking. In some countries, women fall victim to \n``honor killings,'' a deplorable practice whereby women are murdered by \nmale relatives for actions that are perceived to bring dishonor to the \nfamily. Other countries tolerate the burning of thousands of brides a \nyear due to insufficient dowries.\n  While I am pleased that the United States has begun to address the \nglobal HIV/AIDS crisis, the pandemic continues to exact a terrible \nhuman toll on communities around the world, and in sub-Saharan Africa, \nit is having a particularly devastating effect on women. As the ranking \nmember of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on \nAfrican Affairs, I have had the opportunity to travel to numerous \ncountries in Africa and see firsthand the devastating toll that HIV/\nAIDS and other infectious diseases are taking on the people of this \ncontinent. According to United Nations reports, over 25 million adults \nand children in Africa are infected with the HIV virus, the majority of \nthem in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in which women are infected \nwith the virus at a higher rate than men. UNAIDS, the United Nations \nProgram on HIV/AIDS, reports that women make up an estimated 58 percent \nof the HIV-positive adult population in this region, as compared to 50 \npercent worldwide. Young women and girls are especially at risk. The \nUnited Nations reports that in this region 6 to 11 percent of girls age \n15-24 are infected with HIV, whereas infection among boys of the same \nage group is 3 to 6 percent. International efforts to fight AIDS will \nnot succeed unless we make a sustained and serious effort to address \nthe factors that make women and girls so vulnerable to exposure. This \nmeans more than talking about legal rights, and more than talking about \neconomic empowerment. It means that we must take action.\n\n  Despite these difficulties for women, encouraging signs of women's \nprogress are also in evidence around the world. In Western and Central \nAfrica, international courts are holding those responsible for crimes \nagainst humanity, including the use of rape as a weapon of war, \naccountable for their actions\n  In Mexico, indigenous women, who once lived in the shadows of a \ndeeply patriarchal society, are increasing their influence in local \ncommunities. These women are increasingly buying small businesses and \nowning their own land, taking an aggressive stance against domestic \nviolence and contributing to decision-making in their communities.\n  In Afghanistan, women are finally back in school. The new Afghan \nConstitution, approved on January 4, 2004, provides equal rights and \nduties under\n\n[[Page S2992]]\n\nthe law to women and includes special provisions to encourage women's \naccess to education and government. Restoring human rights, and, in \nparticular, women's rights, is key to Afghanistan's successful \nreconstruction and transition to democracy.\n  Women of all cultures are being recognized on an international stage \nfor their contributions. Notably, Shiri Edadi won the 2003 Nobel Peace \nPrize for her efforts to promote democracy and human rights in Iran, \nparticularly for women and children.\n  The U.S. Senate can work toward protecting women's rights and \nimproving the status of women domestically and internationally by \nacting upon the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of \nDiscrimination against Women, or CEDAW. CEDAW is a comprehensive treaty \non women's human rights addressing almost all forms of discrimination \nin areas such as education, employment, marriage and family, health \ncare, politics and law. It has been over two decades since the United \nStates signed this treaty, and it still awaits consideration before the \nSenate. Once again, I urge the Committee on Foreign Relations to take \nup this treaty and allow the Senate the opportunity to offer its advice \nand consent on this important convention.\n  International Women's Day celebrates the progress women have made in \nthe face of adversity and pays tribute to women fighting against \ndiscrimination and other injustices. This year, Congress recognized \nDorothy Height for her tremendous work for women's rights. Ms. Height, \nwho fought against racism and violence toward African Americans, also \nbattled for women's full and equal employment, increased educational \nopportunities, and institutions for women in the United States. This \nyear, she was awarded a congressional gold medal for her contributions \nto our nation.\n  Women have made tremendous strides in the last century. In the United \nStates, more and more women are attending college and earning post-\ngraduate degrees. Worldwide, women are becoming increasingly active in \nthe political process--more women are being elected to office and \nappointed to positions of power than ever before. In the year 2000, 11 \ncountries were led by women.\n  While I recognize that women in the U.S. continue to make great \nadvances, work remains to narrow the wage disparity between men and \nwomen. Although some progress has been made in narrowing the gender \nwage-gap since Congress enacted the Equal Pay Act in 1963, unfair wage \ndisparities continue. I am proud to support legislative efforts to \ncorrect his discrepancy. In addition, I encourage the Senate to \nconsider legislation to reauthorize the TANF program. I believe that \nany welfare reauthorization bill that passes the Senate should help to \nensure that we are not just reducing the welfare rolls, but are also \nhelping current and former TANF recipients break the cycle of poverty.\n  Unfortunately, violence against women is still all too prevalent in \nour country. Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury among \nwomen of child-bearing age. One out of every six American women have \nbeen victims of a rape or an attempted rape. Many rapes go unreported, \nand more than half of the women attacked know their assailant. We must \ncontinue to adequately fund state and local programs, including support \nshelters for women suffering from violent abuse in their homes. These \nsafe havens deserve strong support and funding for the invaluable work \nthey provide for women and communities around the country.\n  As we honor women and celebrate their accomplishments and \ncontributions, we must recognize that there is still much more to be \ndone in the struggle for gender equity. Discrimination and violence \nagainst women continue to exist at home and abroad. The United States \nand the rest of the international community must reaffirm their \ncommitment to promote gender equality and human rights around the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2992-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In Stafford, VA, Thomas Rivers heard that another boy thought he was \ncute. Rivers responded by shouldering the classmate in hallways at \nschool, shouting slurs and spitting on him. The next year, 18-year-old \nRivers attacked the boy by bashing him in the back of the head with a \nmetal pole, nearly killing him.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2992-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2992-S2993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND MICROSOFT\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to address the European Commission's \nantitrust action against Microsoft. It is my understanding that \nantitrust authorities for the European Union member nations have given \nEuropean Competition Commissioner Mario Monti their unanimous backing \nfor a formal commission finding that Microsoft abused its market share \nof its Windows operating system for personal computers to leverage its \nway into related markets for networking and multimedia software. It is \nexpected that the European Commission will hand down a formal decision \nfinding that Microsoft is in violation of European Union antitrust \nlaws.\n  By imposing harsh, unprecedented penalties upon Microsoft, the \nCommission has extended its view of competition and regulation beyond \nEurope and onto the United States--to the detriment of U.S. laws, \nindustry and consumers.\n  For many years, the European Union and its member states have \ncriticized the United States for adopting laws and regulations that, in \nthe view of European policymakers, have had an extraterritorial reach. \nThe European Commission in particular has consistently urged the United \nStates to ensure that its legal determinations do not intrude into \nEuropean affairs. We now have a clear example of the European Union not \npracticing what they preach.\n  If the Commission rules that Microsoft is in violation of European \nUnion antitrust laws, it will undercut the settlement that was so \ncarefully and painstakingly crafted with Microsoft by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice and several state antitrust authorities. There \ncan be no question that the U.S. Government was entitled to take the \nlead in this matter--Microsoft is a U.S. company, many if not all of \nthe complaining companies in the EU case are American, and all of the \nrelevant design decisions took place here. I would hope that if the \nCommission were cognizant of America's legitimate interests in this \nmatter, it would act in a manner that complemented the U.S. settlement. \nI fear the Commission has selected a path that places its resolution of \nthis case in direct conflict with ours.\n  This is not the only example of the Commission's overreaching in this \ncase. In recent negotiations with Microsoft, the European Commission \ndemanded that Microsoft agree to ensure that computer manufacturers who \nsell pre-installed versions of Windows also install three competing \nmedia players--an obligation that the Commission insisted on imposing \nnot just within the EU, but globally. In spite of its objections to \nthese requirements, Microsoft agreed to the Commission's approach in \norder to reach a settlement. I understand the Commission proposes to \nimpose a fine of over $610 million on Microsoft--higher than any fine \nin the Commission's history. It has been suggested that the amount of \nthis fine was based not only on Microsoft's conduct in the EU, but in \nthe United States and elsewhere as well. One can only conclude that the \nCommission was not satisfied with how U.S. antitrust authorities and \ncourts resolved the case against Microsoft, and therefore decided to \nact as a kind of supra-national competition authority by fining \nMicrosoft for its conduct worldwide.\n  The Commission's proposed ruling, as well as its negotiation tactics, \nis unprecedented in its scope. By proposing\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\nto fine Microsoft for purported anticompetitive conduct and injuries in \nthe United States, the European Commission is directly challenging the \nadequacy of the United States' own antitrust laws, including the \nsettlement that Microsoft and U.S. authorities reached in the U.S. \nproceedings. In fact, the obligations proposed to be imposed on \nMicrosoft by the Commission are precisely the type that the U.S. \nDistrict Court and the U.S. Department of Justice rejected as \nundermining consumer welfare.\n  It is incumbent on the Departments of State and Justice to stand up \nnot only for an important American company but more importantly for \nlegitimate U.S. jurisdiction over alleged anticompetitive behavior in \nthe United States. The U.S. and the EU are signatories to a 1991 comity \nagreement on antitrust issues which requires that one government defer \nto the other if the principal issues being investigated involve \ncompanies of one of the parties. Here, the EU is investigating a U.S. \ncompany based on complaints from other U.S. companies. If the U.S. \nGovernment does not make a clear and strong statement objecting to the \nEU's extraterritorial approach, we will lose influence and credibility \nfor years to come to the detriment of all U.S. industry, as well as to \nU.S. consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2993-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               25TH ANNIVERSARY OF VETERANS UPWARD BOUND\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to commend the Veterans Upward Bound Program and all those \nassociated with it on its 25th anniversary.\n  Hundreds of students at the University of Massachusetts have \nbenefited from the program and gone on to earn bachelors, masters, and \ndoctorate degrees. These veterans are using the same enthusiasm and \ndrive that made them exemplary members of our Armed Forces, and are now \nvital forces for positive change in their communities.\n  For many years, the TRIO programs have been available to help more \nyoung men and women in our society to understand that college is within \ntheir reach. The Veterans Upward Bound Program does the same for \nveterans. It provides a bridge to help those who have served our \ncountry so well make the transition into college. Veterans learn how to \nuse the benefits available from the Veterans Administration and from \nveterans' associations and State and local veterans programs to obtain \nthe information and skills they need to qualify for college. Every \nyear, nearly 5,000 veterans are served by this impressive program and \ngo on to college.\n  Many of us share a strong commitment to the belief that each of us \ncan make a difference in improving the world around us, and all of us \nmust try. Enabling veterans to continue their education is in the best \ntradition of our country.\n  These are very difficult days in our history. As our service men and \nwomen return to civilian life, education can often have an essential \nand prominent role in their futures, and in the Nation's future too. \nVeterans Upward Bound programs are an important part of a nationwide \ngrassroots effort to enable our veterans to improve their own lives and \ncontinue to keep our Nation strong in many different ways.\n  The talented professionals who carry out these programs so well \ndeserve our gratitude. On this special anniversary, I commend them for \nall they do so well to make college a reality for our veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2993-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII WAHINE SOCCER PLAYER NATASHA KAI\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, It is with great pride that I rise \nto recognize Natasha Kai of Kahuku, HI, for her extraordinary athletic \nachievements. As a forward for the University of Hawaii Rainbow Wahine \nsoccer team, Natasha was recently named to the 2004 Women's Under 21 \nNational Soccer team. This achievement marks the first time any female \nathlete from the State of Hawaii has acquired a position on this \nprestigious, nationally recognized team. After attending two training \ncamps within the last month, Natasha competed amongst 40 of the \ncountry's top female athletes to earn a coveted spot on the national \nteam.\n  The national team is currently in China and competing in a tournament \nwith the hopes of making it to the 2004 Nordic Cup, the premier \ntournament to be held in Iceland later this summer. A few days ago, the \nnational team secured its first exhibition match win triumphing over \nthe Shanghai SVA team. Natasha made her international debut during that \nmatch and scored the first goal within the first three minutes of play. \nThe national team is off to a successful start and has two more \nexhibition matches before they return home.\n  I am doubly proud that Natasha hails from Kahuku High School, which \nis one of the schools where I first entered the classroom as a teacher. \nAs a multi-talented athlete at Kahuku, Natasha received four varsity \nletters each in soccer and track, as well as two in volleyball, and one \neach in basketball and cross country. Natasha was a two-time Oahu \nInterscholastic Association (OIA) All-Star soccer player, as well as a \n2001 All-State player of the year. During her senior season, she led \nthe Red Raider soccer team to a OIA division title win, a first for the \nschool. Natasha earned State track and field honors in the 110 meter \nhurdles, high jump, and long jump, and was the two-time record holder \nand State champion in the 300 meter hurdles. In 2001, as a volleyball \nplayer she was voted to the OIA-East first team. Basketball \naccomplishments include being named to the OIA First-team and State \nSecond-team that same year. In addition to her success on the field, \nNatasha also excelled in the classroom and was an honor student. As one \nof the most highly recruited female athletes in the State, Natasha \ndecided to stay and pursue her athletic endeavors at the University of \nHawaii at Manoa.\n  As a forward on the soccer field, Natasha is known for her explosive \nspeed and skill when evading defenders and scoring goals. During her \nfreshman year with the UH Wahine Rainbow soccer team, she started 16 of \nthe 17 games she appeared in and broke eight school records. Natasha \nwas named the 2002 Western Athletic Conference (WAC) freshman of the \nyear and WAC player of the year, and captured all-WAC first team \nhonors. As a 2002 UH Scholar athlete, she was also selected for the \nSoccer Buzz freshman All-West region first team and All-American third \nteam. The freshman scored two hat tricks against Tulsa and Boise State \nduring conference play and was named WAC Offensive Player of the Week \nthree times. Last season as a sophomore, Natasha led the Nation in \nscoring with 29 goals and again received her second WAC player of the \nyear and All-American honors. With the help of this skilled athlete, UH \nwon a record 13 matches and secured its first conference title in 2003.\n  The athletic accolades of Natasha speak volumes of her character, \nlove of the sport of soccer, and dedication to the game. I am confident \nthat all the people of Hawaii, particularly her family and friends, \ntake great pride in her great accomplishments.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week.\n  In 1981, a 9-1-1 public safety dispatcher from the Contra Costa \nCounty Sheriff's Office, in my home State of California, first had the \nidea to designate one week each year to honor the work of public safety \ntelecommunicators. In 1991, Congress issued a formal proclamation \nacknowledging National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week. In 1994, \nNational Public Safety Telecommunicators Week became a permanent, \nfederally designated week, observed annually during the second week of \nApril.\n  I commend our Nation's public safety telecommunicators, usually the \nfirst and most critical contact our Nation's\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\ncitizens have when they need emergency services. Over 500,000 9-1-1 \ncalls are made every day across the country. Telecommunicators provide \nthe best emergency assistance they can to each of the callers. People \ndepend on the skill, expertise and commitment of telecommunicators who \nhelp save lives by responding to emergency calls, dispatching emergency \nprofessionals and equipment and providing support to citizens in \ndistress. Telecommunicators also serve as the vital link for our police \nofficers, sheriffs and firefighters by providing them with information \nand insuring their safety.\n  Public safety telecommunicators have a tremendous responsibility to \nremain calm while handling stressful situations. Amid panic and fear \nfrom a caller, public safety telecommunicators obtain the necessary \ninformation, make critical decisions and quickly dispatch the \nassistance that saves lives and property. Although they may be \nanonymous to callers, each of these men and women deserve praise and \nrecognition for their hard work, not only during National Public Safety \nTelecommunicators Week but every day.\n  I am proud of the heroic work of public safety telecommunicators, and \nI offer my sincerest thanks for their compassion and \nprofessionalism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2994-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO NORMAN M. RICH, M.D.\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Dr. Norman \nM. Rich, M.D., Professor and Chairman, Department of Surgery, F. Edward \nHebert School of Medicine at the Uniformed Services University of the \nHealth Sciences--USUHS. This week, on March 26, 2004, Dr. Rich will \nmark the end of his 44-year career in Federal service.\n  Dr. Rich's Federal career began in the U.S. Army where he served for \n20 years as a career officer and physician from 1960 through 1980. As a \nmilitary surgeon with academic interests in the management of injured \npatients and vascular surgery, he earned international recognition; his \nmilitary awards include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the \nMeritorious Service Award and Vietnam Medals.\n  Dr. Rich was appointed as the Founding Chairman of the USUHS School \nof Medicine's Department of Surgery in August of 1977 and held that \nposition until October of 2002. For the past 16 months, he has \ncontinued to serve as an advisor and mentor to the Acting Department \nChairman.\n  As Founding Chairman, Dr. Rich was faced with the difficult task of \nestablishing a Department of Surgery at a university where the campus \nhad not yet been constructed. From the outset, Dr. Rich and his \nconsiderable reputation gave credibility to the newly established \nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and enabled the \nrecruitment of a competent faculty for its new Department of Surgery. \nHe utilized his collaborative relationships, both nationally and \ninternationally, to strengthen his department's curricula and lectures \nand thereby provided a military and academically unique environment for \nthe over 3,400 USUHS medical school graduates and thousands more future \nuniformed medical students.\n  Dr. Rich can take pride in having developed an academically sound \ncurriculum, recruiting competent faculty with military unique \nexpertise, meeting the initial and on-going accreditation requirements \nfor the School of Medicine, and creating a sound national and global \nreputation for the university. His efforts have aided the School of \nMedicine in attaining full accreditation and he has helped shape USUHS \ngraduates into what the Secretary of Defense has dubbed ``the backbone \nof the Military Health System.'' Indeed, his efforts are reflected in \nthe continued success of USUHS and its graduates and in the continued \nhealth of the millions of uniformed personnel and their families who \nhave benefited from his extraordinary expertise.\n  During the course of his career, Dr. Rich has published over 300 \nmanuscripts and authored or co-authored five books. Among these is the \ninternationally recognized ``Vascular Trauma.'' He has served on 10 \neditorial boards, including the major peer-reviewed journals focusing \nupon his specialty. His recent awards include: the 2003 National Safety \nCouncil Surgeons' Award for Distinguished Service in Safety presented \nby the American College of Surgeons, the American Association for the \nSurgery of Trauma, and the National Safety Council; recognition as a \nCitizen & Apothecary of London in 2001; and, the J.E. Wallace Sterling \nLifetime Alumni Achievement Award from the Stanford Medical Alumni \nAssociation.\n  Our Nation can be proud of Dr. Rich's long and distinguished career \nof service and I am pleased to join with his family, friends and \ncolleagues in expressing appreciation for the significant contributions \nhe has made to the health of the uniformed services and that of all \ncitizens. I certainly wish him continued success and happiness in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2994-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2994-S2995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SIEGLINDE KURZ\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I today honor of Dan Terry, who \nwill be retiring this May after 31 years of service as president of the \nCalifornia Professional Firefighters, CPF, a statewide organization \nrepresenting more than 30,000 career firefighters in over 150 \naffiliated local unions.\n  America's firefighters are the heroes of our times. We know that they \nare always going to be there protecting us through any challenge.\n  For more than three decades, as firefighters have protected us, Dan \nTerry has been protecting them. He has fought for safer working \nconditions and worked to increase firefighter education, training, and \nstaffing.\n  Thanks largely to his extraordinary efforts, California firefighters \nare now covered by statewide legislation that guarantees binding \ninterest arbitration, enhanced retirement benefits, survivor benefits, \nand firefighter illness presumption laws. Dan Terry has also fought to \nprotect firefighters' right to earn overtime pay as well as disability \nand workers' compensation benefits.\n  A retired fire captain with more than 20 years of service on the \nfront lines, Dan Terry was elected CPF president in May 1973. After 31 \nyears in office, he remains passionate and dedicated to the cause of \nimproving the lives of California firefighters and their families. Even \nafter leaving the presidency of CPF, he will remain active in the \norganization and in the service of California families and the \ncourageous firefighters who protect them every day.\n  On behalf of the people of California, I express our profound \ngratitude and admiration to Dan Terry for his outstanding service to \nour State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2995-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2995-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/23/senate-section/article/S2995-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-6708.

A bill to establish the Bleeding Kansas and the Enduring \nStruggle for Freedom National Heritage Area, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the great story of Kansas can be summed \nup in the State motto, ``Ad Astra per Aspera,'' to the stars through \ndifficulties. Though only a short phrase comprised of four words, the \nmeaning and passion behind the Kansas State motto are as profound as \nthey are descriptive of a State that though smaller than some, was a \ncatalyst for racial equality in this Nation.\n  From inception, Kansas was born in controversy--a controversy that \nhelped to shape a Nation and end the egregious practice of chattel \nslavery that brutalized an entire race of individuals in this country. \nI cannot think of a more noble or more important contribution provided \nto our Nation--through arguably it was one of the most turbulent and \ndarkest hours of our history. Without this struggle however, the battle \nto end persecution and transform our country into a symbol of freedom \nand democracy throughout the world would not have been realized.\n  This year marks the sesquicentennial of the signing of the Kansas-\nNebraska bill which repealed the Missouri compromise, allowed States to \nenter into the Union with or without slavery. This piece of \nlegislation, which was passed in May 1854, set the stage for what is \nnow referred to as, ``Bleeding Kansas.'' During this time, our State, \nthen a territory, was thrown into chaos with Kansans fighting \npassionately to ensure that the territory would enter the Union as a \nfree State and not condone or legalize slavery in any capacity. At the \nend of a very difficult and bloody struggle, Kansas entered the Union \nas a free State and helped to spark the issue of slavery on a national \nlevel. However, Kansas' contributions to the realization of freedom in \nthis Nation did not stop with the Kansas-Nebraska Act.\n  Keeping true to the motto, ``to the stars through difficulties.'' \nKansas opened up her arms to a newly freed people after the Civil War \nended. Many African Americans looked to Kansas for solace and \nprosperity when the South was still an uncertain place. Perhaps one of \nthe best examples of Ad Astra per Aspera was the founding of a town in \nKansas by African Americans coming to our State to begin their life of \nfreedom and prosperity.\n  Founded in 1877, Nicodemus, which was named after a legendary slave \nwho purchased his freedom, is the most recognized historically black \ntown in Kansas. Nicodemus was established by a group of colonists from \nLexington, KY and grew to a population of 600 by 1879.\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\nHowever, Nicodemus is not the only Kansas contribution that shaped a \nmore tolerant Nation. Kansas was also one of the first States to house \nan African American military regiment in the 1800s, the Buffalo \nSoldiers.\n  The Buffalo Soldiers were, and still are, considered one of the most \ndistinguished and revered African American military regiments in our \nNation's history. One of those regiments, the 10th Cavalry, was \nstationed at Fort Leavenworth, KS. In July 1866, Congress passed \nlegislation establishing two cavalry and four infantry regiments that \nwere to be solely comprised of African Americans. The mounted regiments \nwere the 9th and 10th Cavalries, soon nicknamed ``Buffalo Soldiers'' by \nthe Cheyenne and Comanche tribes. Lt. Henry O. Flipper, the first \nAfrican American to graduate from the United States Military Academy in \n1877 and commanded the 10th Calvary unit where he proved that African \nAmericans possessed the quality of military leadership. Until the early \n1890s, the Buffalo Soldiers constituted 20 percent of all cavalry \nforces on the American frontier. Their invaluable service on the \nwestern frontier still remains one of the most exemplary services \nperformed by a regiment in the U.S. Army.\n\n  These are just a few examples of why I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague from Kansas, Senator Pat Roberts, today and introduce the \nBleeding Kansas National Heritage Area Act, which will not only serve \nto educate Kansans but the Nation on the important contributions--and \nin many cases the sacrifices--made in order to establish this proud \nState. The creation of this heritage area will ensure that this legacy \nis not only commemorated but celebrated on a national level.\n  Specifically, the Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area Act will \ndesignate 24 counties in Kansas as the ``Bleeding Kansas and the \nEnduring Struggle for Freedom National Heritage Area.'' Each of these \ncounties will be eligible to apply for the heritage area grants \nadministered by the National Park Service.\n  The heritage area will add to local economies within the State by \nincreasing tourism and will encourage collaboration between interests \nof diverse units of government, businesses, tourism officials, private \nproperty owners, and nonprofit groups within the heritage area. \nFinally, the bill protects private property owners by requiring that \nthey provide in writing consent to be included in any request before \nthey are eligible to receive Federal funds from the heritage area. The \nbill also authorizes $10,000,000.00 over a 10 year period to carry out \nthis act and states that no more than $1,000,000.00 may be appropriated \nto the heritage area for any fiscal year.\n  Kansas has much to be proud of in its history and it is vital that \nthis history be shared on a national level. By establishing the \nBleeding Kansas and the Enduring Struggle for Freedom National Heritage \nArea, we will ensure that this magnificent legacy lives on and serves \nas a stirring reminder of the sacrifices and triumphs that created this \nNation--a Nation united in freedom for all people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2224\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This Act may be cited as the ``Bleeding Kansas National \n     Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area is a \n     cohesive assemblage of natural, historic, cultural, and \n     recreational resources that--\n       (A) together represent distinctive aspects of American \n     heritage worthy of recognition, conservation, interpretation, \n     and continuing use;\n       (B) are best managed through partnerships between private \n     and public entities;\n       (C) will build upon the Kansas rural development policy and \n     the new homestead act to recognize inherent strengths of \n     small towns and rural communities--close-knit communities, \n     strong local business networks, and a tradition of \n     entrepreneurial creativity.\n       (2) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area reflects \n     traditions, customs, beliefs, folk life, or some combination \n     thereof, that are a valuable part of the heritage of the \n     United States.\n       (3) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area provides \n     outstanding opportunities to conserve natural, cultural, or \n     historic features, or some combination thereof.\n       (4) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area provides \n     outstanding recreational and interpretive opportunities.\n       (5) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area has an \n     identifiable theme, and resources important to the theme \n     retain integrity capable of supporting interpretation.\n       (6) Residents, nonprofit organizations, other private \n     entities, and units of local government throughout the \n     Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area demonstrate support \n     for designation of the Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area \n     as a national heritage area and for management of the \n     Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area as appropriate for \n     such designation.\n       (7) Capturing these interconnected stories through \n     partnerships with National Park Service sites, Kansas State \n     Historical Society sites, local organizations, and citizens \n     will augment the story opportunities within the prospective \n     boundary for the educational and recreational benefit of this \n     and future generations of Americans.\n       (8) Communities throughout this region know the value of \n     their Bleeding Kansas legacy, but require expansion of the \n     existing cooperative framework to achieve key preservation, \n     education, and other significant goals by working more \n     closely together.\n       (9) The State of Kansas officially recognized the national \n     significance of the Bleeding Kansas story when it designated \n     the heritage area development as a significant strategic goal \n     within the statewide economic development plan.\n       (10) Territorial Kansas Heritage Alliance is a nonprofit \n     corporation created for the purposes of preserving, \n     interpreting, developing, promoting and, making available to \n     the public the story and resources related to the story of \n     Bleeding Kansas and the Enduring Struggle for Freedom.\n       (11) Territorial Kansas Heritage Alliance has completed a \n     study that--\n       (A) describes in detail the role, operation, financing, and \n     functions of Territorial Kansas Heritage Alliance, the \n     management entity;

Board of Education, Nicodemus and Tallgrass Prairie \n     sites through the interpretation and conservation of the \n     associated living landscapes outside of the boundaries of \n     these units of the National Park System.\n       (3) To describe the extent of Federal responsibilities and \n     duties in regard to the Heritage Area.\n       (4) To further collaboration and partnerships among \n     Federal, State, and local governments, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the private sector, or combinations \n     thereof, to conserve and manage the resources and \n     opportunities in the Heritage Area through grants, technical \n     assistance, training and other means.\n       (5) To authorize Federal financial and technical assistance \n     to management entity to assist in the conservation and \n     interpretation of the Heritage Area.\n       (6) To empower communities and organizations in Kansas to \n     preserve the special historic identity of Bleeding Kansas and \n     with it the identity of the Nation.\n       (7) To provide for the management, preservation, \n     protection, and interpretation of the natural, historical, \n     and cultural resources within the region for the educational \n     and inspirational benefit of current and future generations.\n       (8) To provide greater community capacity through inter-\n     local cooperation.\n       (9) To provide a vehicle, particularly in the four counties \n     with high out-migration of population, to recognize that \n     self-reliance and resilience will be the keys to their \n     economic future.\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\n       (10) To build upon the Kansas rural development policy, the \n     Kansas agritourism initiative and the new homestead act to \n     recognize inherent strengths of small towns and rural \n     communities--close-knit communities, strong local business \n     networks, and a tradition of entrepreneurial creativity.\n       (11) To educate and cultivate among its citizens, \n     particularly its youth, the stories and cultural resources of \n     the region's legacy that--\n       (A) reflect the popular phrase ``Bleeding Kansas'' \n     describing the conflict over slavery that became nationally \n     prominent in Kansas just before and during the American Civil \n     War;\n       (B) reflect the commitment of American settlers who first \n     fought and killed to uphold their different and \n     irreconcilable principles of freedom and equality during the \n     years of the Kansas Conflict;\n       (C) reflect the struggle for freedom, experienced during \n     the ``Bleeding Kansas'' era, that continues to be a vital and \n     pressing issue associated with the real problem of democratic \n     nation building; and\n       (D) recreate the physical environment revealing its impact \n     on agriculture, transportation, trade and business, and \n     social and cultural patterns in urban and rural settings.\n       (12) To interpret the effect of the era's democratic ethos \n     on the development of America's distinctive political \n     culture.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Brownback, a bill designating the \nBleeding Kansas and the Enduring Struggle for Freedom National Heritage \nArea. This project has joined communities throughout eastern Kansas in \nan effort to document, preserve and celebrate Kansas' significant role \nin the political struggle that led to the Civil War and in other \nhistoric struggles for equality that took place in our state.\n  Designated by Congress, National Heritage Areas are places where \nnatural, cultural, historic and recreational resources combine to form \ncomplete and distinct landscape. Our State, which has a proud heritage \nand compelling story, will benefit from this national designation that \nhelps preserve and celebrate America's defining landscapes. By \nenhancing and developing historic sites throughout eastern Kansas, we \nwill ensure that the traditions that evolved there are preserved.\n  During the Civil War, William Quantrill, the head of an infamous gang \nof Confederate sympathizers, lead a raid on Lawrence, KS. Though far \nfrom the main campaigns, this massacre caused Bleeding Kansas to become \na prominent symbol in the fight for the freedom of all people, and the \nterritory would become a battleground over the question of slavery. \nAfter\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\nthese attacks, the abolitionist senator Charles Sumner delivered his \nfamous speech called ``The Crime Against Kansas,'' in which he brought \nthe escalating situation into sharper focus for the Nation.\n  Almost 100 years later, Kansas became the battleground once again, as \nOliver L. Brown fought to prove that separate among the people of this \ngreat Nation is not equal. In fact, we will soon celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of the Brown v. Topeka Board of Education Supreme Court \ndecision, which was a landmark victory in the civil rights movement. \nThese are but two of the many stories that will make up this heritage \narea, marking an important era in our Nation's history.\n  I'd like to commend the Lawrence City Commission, the Douglas County \nCommission, and the Lawrence Chamber of Commerce, who have worked \ndiligently on Federal heritage area designation. And I encourage the \nSenate's swift passage of this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 2225. A bill to authorize an exchange of mineral rights by the \nSecretary of the Interior in the State of Montana; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nMontana Mineral Exchange Act with Senators Burns and Campbell.\n  This bill will enable the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and eastern Montana \nto create jobs and provide a shot in the arm for a local economy that \nhas been creative in forging its own destiny.\n  The Montana Mineral Exchange Act is the result of years of working \ntogether. President Geri Small has been a true advocate for the \nNorthern Cheyenne Tribe as she has worked tirelessly on this project \nfor years.\n  The Montana Mineral Exchange Act is a positive step forward in \ncreating good-paying jobs and boosting economic development in Montana. \nThis shows what Montana can do when we--the congressional delegation, \nthe governor's office, the private sector, and the Northern Cheyenne--\nwork together to develop our resources while creating jobs and \nprotecting our quality of life. Development of this high-quality coal \nwill allow Montana to move forward economically and compete with other \nenergy producing states for jobs and market share. I'm glad I could \nwork together with Governor Martz, Senator Burns, Congressman Rehberg, \nSenator Campbell and all of the parties involved to make this bill \nhappen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 2226. A bill to extend the period for COBRA coverage for \nrecipients of trade adjustment assistance; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nensure that displaced workers whose jobs have moved overseas have \naccess to affordable health care coverage.\n  Under the Trade Assistance Adjustment Act, unemployed workers who \nhave seen their manufacturing jobs shipped overseas are eligible for \nFederal subsidies to help them maintain their employer-based health \ncoverage through COBRA. Unfortunately, while these workers have access \nto these Federal subsidies for 24 months, they only have access to \nCOBRA coverage for 18 months. This discrepancy means that displaced \nworkers are unable to fully utilize these subsidies. Indeed, the \ndiscrepancy creates the anomalous situation in which displaced workers \ncan remain in their COBRA plan for 18 months, using the Federal subsidy \nto help defray their costs, but once their COBRA coverage runs out, \nthey have six additional months of Federal subsidy available but lose \ntheir existing health coverage. This leaves them no choice but to seek \ncoverage in the expensive individual market where they are not \nguaranteed coverage and where their subsidy may not be sufficient to \nhelp them afford coverage.\n  My legislation would fix this problem by making COBRA coverage \navailable for the full 24 months that the subsidy is available. This \nwill ensure that displaced workers can take full advantage of the \nassistance that Congress made available to them in 2002.\n  As more and more Americans see their jobs outsourced overseas, many \nstruggle to provide health insurance for their families. We have lost \n3,000 manufacturing jobs in February alone and have lost a total of 2.8 \nmillion since 2000. Congress took a critical step in authorizing \nFederal assistance for those who have lost these jobs. Now we must \nensure that displaced workers have access to health coverage so that \nthey can utilize this assistance. My legislation will ensure this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows.\n\n                                S. 2226\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prevent and punish counterfeiting and copyright \npiracy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAnticounterfeiting Act of 2004, along with Senators Murray, Hollings, \nSmith, and Allen.\n  Two years ago, I held a hearing entitled, ``Theft of American \nIntellectual Property: Fighting Crime Abroad and At Home,'' and I \nissued a report on the status of our fight against this crime. Today, I \nattended a hearing chaired by Senator Specter on a similar topic, again \ndriving home for me the serious problems encountered in today's world \nby American intellectual property.\n  What I have learned is that every day, thieves steal millions of \ndollars of American intellectual property from its rightful owners. \nOver a hundred thousand American jobs are lost as a result.\n  American innovation and creativity need to be protected by our \ngovernment no less than our personal property, our homes and our \nstreets. The Founding Fathers had the foresight to provide for \nprotection of intellectual property, giving Congress the power to \n``promote the progress of science and useful arts'' by providing \ncopyrights and patents.\n  American intellectual property represents the largest single sector \nof the American economy, employing 4.7 million Americans. It has been \nestimated that software piracy alone cost the U.S. economy over 118,000 \njobs and $5.7 billion in wage losses in the year 2000. Even more, the \nInternational Planning and Research Corporation estimates that the \ngovernment loses more than a billion dollars worth of revenue every \nyear from intellectual property theft.\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\n  To put that in perspective, with a billion dollars in additional \nrevenue, the American government could pay for child care services for \nmore than 100,000 children annually. Alternatively, $1 billion could be \nused to fund a Senate proposal to assist schools nationally with \nemergency school renovations and repairs.\n  There is another problem. Counterfeiters of software, music CDs and \nmotion pictures are now tampering with authentication features. \nHolograms, certificates of authenticity, watermarks and other security \nfeatures allow the copyright owners to distinguish genuine works from \ncounterfeits. But now, highly sophisticated counterfeiters have found \nways to tamper with these features to make counterfeit products appear \ngenuine and to increase the selling price of genuine products and \nlicenses. Put another way, not only do crooks illegally copy American \nintellectual property, they also now illegally fake or steal the very \nfeatures property owners use to prevent that theft.\n  Copyrights mean nothing if government authorities fail to enforce the \nprotections they provide intellectual property owners. The criminal \ncode has not kept up with the counterfeiting operations of today's \nhigh-tech pirates, and it's time to make sure that it does. The \nAnticounterfeiting Act of 2004 updates and strengthens the Federal \ncriminal code, which currently makes it a crime to traffic in \ncounterfeit labels or copies of certain forms of intellectual property, \nbut not authentication features. For example, we can currently \nprosecute someone for trafficking in fake labels for a computer \nprogram, but we cannot go after them for faking the hologram that the \nsoftware maker uses to ensure that copies of the software are genuine.\n  In addition, many actions that violate current law go unprosecuted in \nthis day and age when priorities, such as the fight against terrorism \nand life-threatening crimes, necessarily take priority over crimes of \nproperty, be they intellectual or physical. Moreover, the victims of \nthis theft often do not have a way to recover their losses from this \ncrime. For this reason, the Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004 also \nprovides a private cause of action, to permit the victims of these \ncrimes to pursue the criminals themselves and recover damages in \nfederal court.\n  Current law criminalizes trafficking in counterfeit documentation and \npackaging, but only for software programs. The Anticounterfeiting Act \nof 2003 updates and expands these provisions to include documentation \nand packaging for phonorecords, motion pictures, other audiovisual \nworks, and copies of other copyrighted works.\n  The existing provision with regard to counterfeiting addresses \ncertain items of intellectual property, including motion pictures, \nsoftware, and phonorecords. The Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004 updates \nthe coverage of this statute to include other copyrighted works, such \nas books. As published books and ebooks begin to be subject to the \npiracy already witnessed by motion picture, softward and recording \nindustries, they need the same protection.\n  This issue is not going way; to the contrary, it is growing, and \nCongress continues to focus on potential solutions, as evidenced by \ntoday's hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and an upcoming \nhearing in the Foreign Relations Committee. The 2002 version of this \nbill did not manage to secure passage and enactment into law, but there \nis reason for optimism that this year its fate will be different. \nAmerica's content providers, and the many jobs that depend on them, \ncould certainly use the help.\n  America is a place where we must encourage diverse ideas, and with \nthat encouragement we must protect those ideas. They are the source of \nour music, our art, our novels, our movies, our software, our products, \nall that is American culture and American know-how. The \nAnticounterfeiting Act of 2004 gives our ideas the protection they \ndeserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2227\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Anticounterfeiting Act of \n     2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) American innovation, and the protection of that \n     innovation by the government, has been a critical component \n     of the economic growth of this Nation throughout the history \n     of the Nation;\n       (2) copyright-based industries represent one of the most \n     valuable economic assets of this country, contributing over 5 \n     percent of the gross domestic product of the United States \n     and creating significant job growth and tax revenues;\n       (3) the American intellectual property sector employs \n     approximately 4,300,000 people, representing over 3 percent \n     of total United States employment;\n       (4) the proliferation of organized criminal counterfeiting \n     enterprises threatens the economic growth of United States \n     copyright industries;\n       (5) the American intellectual property sector has invested \n     millions of dollars to develop highly sophisticated \n     authentication features that assist consumers and law \n     enforcement in distinguishing genuine intellectual property \n     products and packaging from counterfeits;\n       (6) in order to thwart these industry efforts, \n     counterfeiters traffic in, and tamper with, genuine \n     authentication features, for example, by obtaining genuine \n     authentication features through illicit means and then \n     commingling these features with counterfeit software or \n     packaging;\n       (7) Federal law does not provide adequate civil and \n     criminal remedies to combat tampering activities that \n     directly facilitate counterfeiting crimes; and\n       (8) in order to strengthen Federal enforcement against \n     counterfeiting of copyrighted works, Congress must enact \n     legislation that--\n       (A) prohibits trafficking in, and tampering with, \n     authentication features of copyrighted works; and\n       (B) permits aggrieved parties an appropriate civil cause of \n     action.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 323, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 323) to authorize legal \n     representation in United States of America v. Elena Ruth \n     Sassower.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this resolution concerns representation by \nthe Senate legal counsel of five Members and four of their employees \nwho have been subpoenaed to provide testimony and documents in a \ncriminal trial by a defendant charged with disrupting proceedings at a \nhearing of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in May 2003. These \nsubpoenas are not well taken. As the testimony and documents sought by \nthese subpoenas are either irrelevant or cumulative of the testimony \nand evidence that will be offered at trial from other sources, evidence \nfrom these Senators and Senate employees is unnecessary. Moreover, \nunder controlling precedent, the testimony and documents sought by the \nsubpoenas are privileged under the Speech or Debate Clause of the \nConstitution.\n  This resolution would authorize the Senate legal counsel to represent \nthe Senators and staff who have been subpoenaed by the defendant, as \nwell as any other Members, officers, or employees who may be \nsubpoenaed, in order to quash the subpoenas and protect the privileges \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to this matter be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 323) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 323\n\n       Whereas, in the case of United States of America v. Elena \n     Ruth Sassower, Crim.
