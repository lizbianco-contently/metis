We have come to lift up \nthose who have been elected, appointed and anointed to complete the \nwill of Your people. Their task is not easy. It is fraught with \nfrustrating disappointments, stalled moments of doubt, hurts and pain. \nWe therefore reverently request to approach Your sovereign throne to \nask You to individually and collectively pour Your omniscience upon the \nMembers of this distinguished body of legislators.\n  Dear God, I am reminded of a time when one of Your servants told his \ncousin that she was ``called to represent her people and that her time \nis now.'' (Esther 4:14). We pray this morning, Father, that You will \nassist these Senators to act on behalf of a nation which not only \nbelieves in Your supreme desire to have justice reign but also in Your \nimmutable ability to heal our country economically, educationally, \nsociologically, and politically. We trust that You will guide these \nemissaries with Your Divine knowledge.\n  On this beautiful spring day we would ask that You gently touch each \nSenator's physical body where ailments and sickness have taken their \ntoll; give each of them the strength to endure the various debates of \ndifferences; speak to each of their families in such a way that they \nwill understand and appreciate the unselfish sacrifices which these \nmodern day patriots are experiencing.\n  Dear Father, give them the patience to persist; the tolerance to \nprevail; the ability to forgive; and the wisdom to place Your Spirit \nwith love as the foundation for their daily living. Assure each person, \nunder the sound of my voice, that their individual solos are unique; \nhowever, their collective voices create a harmonious choir which will \nthen be well pleasing unto You, and to the people of this great Nation. \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6407-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable John E.

There are now 2 minutes evenly \ndivided before a vote on the Bunning amendment. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I will be very brief. This amendment was discussed \npretty thoroughly yesterday. This sets a date certain for a vote on the \nreduction of the tax on the Social Security seniors from 85 to 50 \npercent; that we report a bill out no later than July 1, 2003; and that \nthe bill should be acted on no later than September 30, 2003, \nconsistent with the preservation of the Medicare trust fund.\n  Under the provisions of section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the point of order against the pending \namendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, has the proponent of this amendment any \ntime remaining? Have we completed the time remaining to speak in favor \nof the amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains a minute in \nopposition.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Is there any time remaining to speak for the amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am going to vote for this amendment. I \nthink all Senators should realize this is really a cover amendment. \nThis is an amendment which allows Senators to not do the real thing. \nWhat is the real thing? The real thing is a vote for the Dorgan \namendment which is next. The Dorgan amendment provides that Social \nSecurity taxes on 85 percent of Social Security benefits are not \ntaxable. That is the real thing. The current amendment before us is a \nsense of the Senate. It is a cover amendment. I am going to support it. \nI think all Senators should support it. But the real test is the next \namendment. If Senators vote for this amendment, if they want to reduce \nSocial Security taxes, they should vote for the Dorgan amendment \nbecause that is the real amendment. That is the one that counts.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I withdraw my motion to waive the point \nof order since none has been made against the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 148 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     Hollings\n     Voinovich\n       \n  The amendment (No. 589) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 556\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to the next vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the next vote is on the amendment that \nactually does what the previous amendment says the sense of Senate \nshould do. If you really believe with the sense of the Senate that we \nshould do this, the question is, Do you believe we should do it now? \nThe question here, it seems to me, is one of priorities. If 8 million \nsenior citizens are paying $1,500 more in taxes because of the change \nin 1993 and you want to repeal that change, then this particular \namendment will reduce taxes for those 8 million Americans.\n  Is this a greater priority than the issue of dividends and other \nissues in this bill? In my judgment, this is a greater priority. If you \nreally believe you want to cut taxes for 8 million senior citizens by \n$18 billion, now is the time to do that. Now is the time to make the \nchange to do that. If you choose not to, it is really hard to say you \nsupport this kind of a change.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to kill the \ngrowth package. It would eliminate the acceleration of all individual \nincome tax rate reductions, and it would eliminate the entire dividend \nexclusion.\n  What is also interesting about this amendment is that our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle who are solely responsible----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the bottom line is that this tax on \nSocial Security income is as high as it is because, in 1993, all except \none Senator now serving on the other side of the aisle imposed a tax in \nthe first place. I believe we should have an opportunity to repeal this \ntax. However, as my colleagues are aware, the revenue from this tax \ngoes into the Medicare hospital fund without other changes in Medicare. \nRepealing this tax would bankrupt the Medicare trust fund. We should \nconsider this in light of other Medicare legislation, and it ought to \nbe done in the Finance Committee.\n  This language is not germane to the measure now before the Senate. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order under section 305(b)(2) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments on the \nschedule for today which I did not have the opportunity to make this \nmorning.\n  We just had our first vote in what will be a very long day with a \nlengthy series of votes. Hopefully, we can do as much as possible to \nshorten that list over the course of the day and certainly not add to \nit too much.\n  I want to ask all of our Members to stay close to the Chamber. We \nwill be starting, with this vote, 10-minute votes, and that will be \nenforced. It will be the only way we can get through this bill in this \nso-called vote-arama. I know it is going to be tough in terms of \neverybody's schedules today. I would go ahead and talk to your \nschedulers and let them know we have these votes every 10 minutes.\n  Following passage of this bill later today, we will proceed directly \nto the global HIV/AIDS bill. We will work that bill through tonight, \nand hopefully finish that bill tonight. If we complete that bill \ntonight, Members can expect no rollcall votes tomorrow. The objective \nwill be to complete the jobs and growth package today, start on the \nHIV/AIDS bill, and hopefully finish today. If so, we will not have \nvotes tomorrow.\n  Again, I ask Members to stay close to the Chamber and the 10-minute \nvotes will be enforced.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 49, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 149 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There will be 2 minutes evenly \ndivided on the next amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  The Senator will suspend. The Senate will come to order. The Senate \nwill be made aware that votes will be limited to 10 minutes. There are \n23 amendments that remain pending which we want to complete in an \norderly fashion.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't care if anybody listens to me, \nbut it would be nice if everybody would shut up so you don't have to go \nthrough that 10 times today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to work with Senator Baucus \nto strengthen criminal tax penalties. We have seen in Enron-type \ncorporation scandals that there is no end to the cleverness of con \nartists in the corporate world. The con artists will even pay a little \ntax to cover up their deception. Then after the fraud, the corporation \nasks for its money back.\n  This amendment will ensure the corporate con artists pay full freight \nfor their crime of duping shareholders and workers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, obviously this is a good amendment. Also, \nwhen I finish speaking, I will offer an amendment in the second degree, \nwhich has been cleared on the other side, essentially to bring the \ncriminal provisions in the Tax Code up to date with the Sarbanes-Oxley \ncriminal provisions. The Sarbanes-Oxley bill did not address the \ncriminal tax provisions because that was not a tax bill. We do address \nit here.\n  I urge adoption, by voice vote, actually, of both amendments.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 624 To Amendment No. 555\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my second-degree \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There are now 2 minutes evenly \ndivided prior to a vote on the Specter amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of my \ncolleagues, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which calls upon \nthe Finance Committee and the Joint Economic Committee to undertake a \nstudy on tax simplification, with the view to presenting a report to \nthe Senate on a flat tax.\n  The complexities of the Internal Revenue Code are well known. Even \nAlbert Einstein said he could not understand the Internal Revenue Code. \nWe spend billions of hours, billions of dollars on the complexities of \nfilling out the tax\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\nreturns. This flat tax would enable us to file a return within a few \nminutes on a postcard.\n  This amendment does not commit the Senate to a flat tax, but it only \ncalls upon relevant committees to conduct a study. There has never been \na study of a flat tax. This amendment, cosponsored by Senator Grassley \nand Senator Bennett--and I think agreed to; we will soon hear from \nSenator Baucus--will be a significant step forward.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who seeks time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think it is a good idea to set up some \nkind of a body or commission to see if we can simplify the code, \nknowing that it is a daunting task. Nevertheless, we should try, \nincluding looking at the flat tax proposal that has been suggested by \nseveral Senators and other observers over the years. But at least let's \ngive it a try. We can certainly improve upon the code we now have.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate on the \nnext amendment, the Baucus amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is essentially what I call a ``more \nstimulus now'' amendment. It has two provisions. One, it accelerates \nthe year in which the dividend exclusion is effective. Under the \ncommittee bill, the dividend exclusion does not come into effect until \n2004, which basically means most taxpayers are not going to receive the \nbenefit until 2005 when they file their tax returns. All this takes \neffect in 2003 in my amendment, as well as the 10 percent. We are going \nto stimulate the economy.\n  In addition, there is acceleration of the child tax credit. The \namendment provides the full $400 be sent to those who qualify for the \nadditional child tax credit, and that is based on the 2002 returns. If \nthey qualify in 2002, they are entitled to the full $400 check in 2003. \nTo avoid the problem we faced in the 2001 bill, where sometimes they \ngot $300 and sometimes not, this will speed that up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Baucus' efforts. \nWe, in this bill, have tried to balance investment and spending \nincentives. This bill already provides $95 billion for children and the \nchild tax credit. The bill includes acceleration of the credit for low-\nincome families, whom Senator Baucus seeks to help.\n  In addition, I believe the market will benefit more from the proposal \ncontained in the bill because of how we have approached it in a \nbalanced effort. However, I do thank the Senator for his efforts.\n  I have to raise a point of order. The pending amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Montana increases mandatory spending and, if adopted, \nwould cause the underlying bill to exceed the committee's section \n302(a) allocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the \namendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable section of \nthat act in the budget resolution for the consideration of the pending \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It is now in order to consider \namendment No. 544, the Kennedy amendment. There will be 2 minutes \nequally divided on each side.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are involved in a debate between \nRepublicans and Democrats about how to get the economy going, but there \nis one reality, and that is that we have stagnation at the present \ntime.\n  There is one lifeline for millions of hard-working Americans who paid \ninto the unemployment compensation fund, and that is to extend the \nunemployment compensation benefits.\n  Today there are 18,000 Iraqi veterans who are on unemployment \ncompensation, and that number is increasing every single week. We are \ntalking about funds that have been paid into that fund by these \nworkers. They are entitled in a time of difficulty and challenge to get \nthat money back to help them meet their mortgage, put food on the \ntable, and take care of their children.\n  The American people understand fairness, and they understand, on the \none hand, if we are going to provide billions for the wealthiest \nindividuals in\n\n[[Page S6411]]\n\nthis country, we ought to look out for hard-working men and women who \nhave played by the rules, worked hard all their lives, have paid into \nthat fund, and now need that assistance. This is what that amendment \ndoes.\n  In the last 10 years, we have extended unemployment compensation \nbenefits seven times. It has been extended by Republican Presidents, \nand we ought to do it today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I said yesterday, we are willing to \nextend current unemployment benefits. We are willing to do it before \nthe end of the week. In fact, yesterday I offered a unanimous consent \nrequest to accomplish this, and it was rejected on the other side.\n  We have Senator Murkowski standing by ready to offer a unanimous \nconsent request to extend unemployment benefits. This amendment is \noverreaching. This amendment would go way beyond anything we have done \non unemployment at a level of 6 percent right now. In fact, this makes \nit as high as when unemployment was at 8 percent. We are asked to deal \nwith an amendment that goes way too far to score political points. That \nis why it should be rejected.\n  I raise the point on this amendment that the language is not germane \nto the measure before the Senate. Therefore, I raise a point of order \nunder section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment. I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Allard) \nis necesarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 578\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes evenly divided prior \nto a vote on the Lincoln amendment. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I hope everyone in this Chamber will \nagree that raising children is probably one of the most important and \nexpensive undertakings in which we have all engaged. I hope we will \nalso agree in this Chamber that the face of our country tomorrow will \nbe shaped by how well we raise our children today, and that is not just \nour children, it is everyone's children.\n  That is why I think my amendment is so important. Eight million \nchildren from working families at the very bottom of the income scale \nget no benefit from the child tax credit, but 4.4 million of those 8 \nmillion children would begin to get a benefit from the child benefit \nunder the Lincoln amendment.\n  By providing tax relief to those who need it the most, the Lincoln \namendment will have a direct and meaningful stimulative effect on the \neconomy. These families with children play by the rules. They go to \nwork each day at extremely low wage jobs. They pay significant payroll, \nState, local excise taxes, maybe even property taxes. They struggle to \nmake ends meet, yet they get no benefit from the child tax credit in \nthis bill.\n  On behalf of the children of this Nation, I encourage my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas has done well \nin the last tax bill and this tax bill to help in the area of \nrefundability, and I compliment her for that, but this amendment goes \ntoo far because it provides a new entitlement with regard to the child \ncredit.\n  The bill already provides $95 billion for the child credit. That is \nthe biggest part of this bill. It also includes acceleration of the \nchild credit for low-income families, an issue of great importance to \nSenator Lincoln as well.\n  The bill has a balance between spending and investment. The amendment \ncuts back significantly on the investment part, the partial dividend \nexclusion. I appreciate the Senator's efforts, but this amendment would \ngut our jobs bill.\n  The pending amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas increases \nmandatory spending and, if adopted, would cause the underlying bill to \nexceed the committee's section 302(a) allocations. Therefore, I make a \npoint of order against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator in Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the applicable section of that act for \npurposes of the pending amendment and for the 4.4 million children who \nwill be covered by this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is offered by myself, the \nSenator from Florida, Senator Nelson, and Senator Baucus, to extend the \nresearch and development tax credit. What we are saying here today is \nwe will implement a philosophy that has been a proven success in \ngenerating jobs in our economy, giving business the ability to deduct \nresearch and development costs in an information age when we know there \nare so many products and services yet to be created.\n  Since its enactment in 1981, the research tax credit has demonstrated \nit is a very powerful and effective tool for creating jobs. It should \nbe no surprise to my colleagues that research estimates indicate that \nagreeing to this amendment could, in the next 5 years, increase our \ngross domestic product by over $10 billion. There is no better \nstimulus.\n  We should make this investment. It is a bipartisan-supported effort, \nresearch and development tax credits. Compared to the other stimulus in \nthis bill, this is the tried and true way for the American public. We \nknow there is research and development in biotechnology, in computer \nsciences, medical research, and this will help us create jobs. I ask my \ncolleagues for their support.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The R tax credit doesn't expire until June 30, 2004. \nThat is more than 1 year away. The President has included permanent \nextension of R in his fiscal year 2004 budget. I want the people to \nknow I am committed to extending the credit in subsequent legislation.\n  However, we have before us the amendment by Senator Cantwell \nproposing striking the dividend exclusion in order to pay for the R \nextension. The exclusion for dividend income is a very significant \npiece of any jobs and growth plan--the President has it in his, \nobviously--even though in our bill it is scaled back some.\n  Finally, extension of this R credit is not germane to the jobs and \ngrowth bill. I therefore raise a point of order under section 305(b)(2) \nof the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, under section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of the Act \nfor consideration of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL, I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Talent) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the leader asked me to remind everybody \nthat starting right now the 10-minute rule for voting is going to be \nenforced because these votes are taking so long and we have so many \nmore votes to go.\n  I have made the announcement, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 587\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes evenly divided on the \nJeffords amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this amendment accelerates the marriage \npenalty relief for low-income married couples who claim the earned-\nincome tax credit. This marriage penalty relief was included in the \n2001 tax bill but does not become fully effective until 2008. Other \nmarriage penalty relief for the 2001 bill is accelerated as part of the \nbill under consideration today, but not the EITC marriage penalty \nrelief.\n  A copy of the Washington Post editorial of today on this issue is on \nyour desk.\n  The pending Senate bill accelerates the child tax credit for some in \nthis group. But like the House version, it would provide no marriage \npenalty relief for EITC recipients who can face a particularly deep \ndip.\n  Considering that in this situation, and two single parents each with \none child, each earning $10,000, if they remain single, each receives \nabout $2,500. If they marry, their total tax benefit falls by more than \n$1,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I urge you to look at the editorial at your desk.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I compliment Senator Jeffords for doing \na lot of work in this area. I was able to work with him on the 2001 tax \nbill to accomplish lots of what he wanted to accomplish in the area of \nrefundability. But what we have here is an example of going just a \nlittle bit further than we should. There is $95 billion in this bill \nfor children.\n  In addition, we accelerate the refundable child credit for low-income \nfamilies, the exact group Senator Jeffords seeks to help.\n  I note also that there are some problems with the earned-income tax \ncredit. It has 30-percent improper payments, according to the Treasury. \nThat is $10 billion a year of improper payments. The GAO lists this \nprogram on its high-risk list.\n  I think we are at a point where before we expand the earned-income \ntax credit we need to make sure it is reformed.\n  I haven't made a point of order yet, but I would like to make a point \nof order.\n  The pending amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont increases \nmandatory spending, if agreed to, and would cause the underlying bill \nto exceed the committee's section 302(a) allocations. Therefore, a \npoint of order is raised against the amendment pursuant to section \n302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act and the budget resolution for purposes of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 594\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to add the \nfollowing people as cosponsors: Ms. Collins, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Baucus, \nMr. Harkin, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Campbell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Now I can speak for 1 minute on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my amendment takes urgently needed steps \nto end Medicare's discrimination against rural States.\n  Doctors and hospitals in rural America provide some of the lowest \ncost, highest quality care in the country. Academics, researchers, and \npolicy people know this, but Medicare does not know it.\n  This amendment changes that by fixing unfair payment formulas once \nand for all. Doctors, hospitals, home health agencies, and ambulances \nin rural communities can count on payment fairness from this day \nforward by adopting this amendment.\n  My fairness amendment is paid for by changes in other parts of the \nMedicare Program, and it is not offset by other parts of the tax \nprovisions of this bill.\n  My amendment is a dose of commonsense medicine for Medicare in rural \nAmerica.\n  One final word to cancer patients in Iowa and across the country \nregarding the AWP offset. I am going to work in conference and directly \nwith the Secretary of HHS to ensure that seniors and their caregivers \nhave adequate payment for, and continued access to, important cancer \ntherapies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nMedicare amendments offered by both Senator Grassley and Senator \nHarkin.\n  Many of the provisions included in both amendments were part of \nlegislation that Senator Grassley and I offered last year. And many of \nthe provisions were included in the Senate Rural Health Caucus bill, \nwhich I support. Several of these Medicare provisions in these \namendments have also been recommended by the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, which advises Congress on Medicare payment policy. And they \nhave the support of the American Hospital Association. Taken together, \nthese changes mean a lot to rural providers and, by extension, rural \nseniors. They represent a significant leveling of the Medicare \nreimbursement playing field that my colleagues and I have sought to \naddress.\n  I would also like to add, however, that some of the offsets in the \nGrassley amendment have generated some controversy.\n  For example, the proposed changes to Medicare payment for Part B \ncovered drugs are of great concern to many cancer patients and \noncologists, among others.\n  Ideally, we would be legislating on these issues in the Finance \nCommittee so that the committee has a chance to weigh in on these \nissues. But I believe that the changes on the whole are positive for \nthe Medicare program, and so I intend to support both amendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley, as a cosponsor of his amendment.\n  As we all know, the reason this is so critical is that the health \ncare system in rural America is collapsing. For too long the Medicare \nreimbursements to urban centers have eclipsed those to rural \ncommunities at such a rate that cities, towns, and villages throughout \nrural America are in a real health care crisis.\n  In our State of Iowa, low reimbursement rates mean we can't recruit \nand retain health care professionals. Every time a hospital in Iowa \ntreats a Medicare patient, it loses money. That cost is shifted to \nsmall businesses, private insurance companies, private payers--in other \nwords, Main Street, Iowa.\n  This amendment takes a giant step forward in fixing this problem and \ngetting us on the path to making sure we in rural States have the same \nkind of reimbursements that people do in more urban areas. It would \ngive rural providers and hospitals, and the communities they serve, the \nsupport they need and deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nStevens be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \namendment we vote on be the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate has just taken a step in the \nright direction to address the economic crisis that is facing many of \nour States and communities by adopting the Collins-Rockefeller \namendment. But I think all of us know our States are facing a very \nsevere crisis; in fact, the most severe economic crisis since the \nSecond World War. Many of our State legislatures are facing cuts in \nhealth care, education, and even law enforcement.\n  Our States are facing deficits as high as $80 billion total, and we \nare very concerned because they are threatening to eliminate the health \ncare coverage of more than 1.7 million Americans.\n  Today when health care is one of the most difficult decisions our \nState legislatures have to make, we need to take the next step so we do \nnot lose more doctors, more hospitals; that patients do not see \ncontinuing increased costs to their health insurance; and we have \nMedicaid patients who are losing coverage.\n  My amendment takes the next critical step by providing $40 billion \nfor the relief package. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Washington. First, many priorities \nidentified by Senator Murray have already been addressed in Senator \nCollins' amendment. Second, I consider $40 billion for this amendment \nto be fiscally irresponsible. I do appreciate the needs for State \nfiscal relief, and that is why I supported Senator Collins' amendment. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against this very costly \namendment.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Washington increases \nmandatory spending and, if adopted, would cause the underlying bill to \nexceed the committee's section 302(a) allocation. Therefore, I raise a \npoint of order under section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive that act for the purposes of \nthe pending amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have just finished our eleventh rollcall \nvote in a row, and that is substantial progress. We have been here \nsince 9:15 this morning, and our goal was to address each of the \namendments in a systematic way. I commend the Chair for addressing \nthese amendments in a timely fashion. However, we still have a large \nnumber of amendments to dispose of. At this time, we are giving \nSenators a chance to catch their breath to go back to their offices, \nnot for a long time but about 47 minutes, and maybe even grab a bite to \neat. We will resume voting right at 2. Although we will not be voting \nover the next 45 minutes or so, it is my hope we will be able to \nproceed, which we will, to some opening statements on the bill that \nwill follow completion of the jobs and growth package, and that is the \nglobal HIV/AIDS bill, which we will be bringing to the floor.\n  In order to complete the jobs and growth bill and the global HIV/AIDS \nbill, we are going to take advantage of this 45 minutes to make some \nintroductory comments about the global AIDS package.\n  When the Senate resumes the jobs bill, we will automatically begin \nthe voting sequence. The first vote in the series at 2 p.m. will be the \nnormal 15 minutes. Following the first vote, the remaining votes will \nbe 10 minutes. I say again that the voting limit will be strictly \nenforced to allow us to finish our business as early as possible today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6415-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6415-S6421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA \n                              ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the first speaker on the global HIV/AIDS \nbill will be the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nLugar, who has done yeoman's work in getting us to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the recognition, and \nlikewise I appreciate the majority leader giving us this hour of \ndebate, because today it is very important the Senate consider the \nglobal HIV/AIDS bill.\n  For the past year, intense discussions have occurred in Congress and \nbetween the executive and legislative branches on how our country can \nbest respond to the global AIDS crisis.\n  In June 2002, the Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved an \nHIV/AIDS bill, initially introduced by Senators Frist and Kerry, with a \nlarge bipartisan group of co-sponsors. The Senate unanimously passed \nthat bill. However, the House of Representatives failed to act on it \nbefore the end of the 107th Congress.\n  At the start of this Congress, the Foreign Relations Committee \nundertook at the request of the new majority leader to reintroduce the \n2002 Senate-passed bill, with some minor changes requested by the \nDepartment of State. In addition, we revised portions of the bill to \ntake account of the President's AIDS initiative outlined in his 2003 \nState of the Union Address.\n  The Committee's efforts, therefore, incorporated many of the \nmodifications requested by the White House, including the addition of \nnew authorities for the Special HIV/AIDS Coordinator created by our \nlegislation last year and incorporated in the President's AIDS \ninitiative this year.\n  Our efforts resulted in S. 1009, currently on the Senate calendar. \nSimultaneously, the House proceeded with its own bill to authorize the \nPresident's AIDS initiative. The House passed that bill last month, and \nit was placed on the Senate calendar.\n  Many Senators, including myself, come to this debate with preferences \non how a bill should be structured on this subject. Nevertheless, I \nshare the majority leader's hope that the Senate will move quickly to \npass the House bill before us so that HIV/AIDS funding will not be \ndelayed any further and so President Bush can have an AIDS initiative \nin hand when he travels to the G-8 summit later this month of May. The \nHouse passed their bill by a vote of 375 to 41. It is a good bill \nworthy of the strong bipartisan support that it received.\n  The United States must have partners in the effort to stop HIV/AIDS. \nPassage of this bill will maximize the President's ability to enlist \nother nations in the fight against AIDS. American leadership is as \nimportant as American contributions to this objective.\n  We must be mindful of the President's recent observation that, ``Time \nis not on our side,'' in combating this disease. The global HIV/AIDS \npandemic is a humanitarian crisis of horrific proportions. In Africa, \nnearly 10,000 people contract the HIV virus each day. The United States \nhas a clear moral obligation, as the most powerful nation on earth, to \nrespond generously and quickly to this crisis.\n\n  But beyond our moral obligations, we should recognize that this bill \nis squarely in the self-interest of the United States and the American \npeople. If we are to protect our national security and overcome \nterrorism, we must devote ourselves to strengthening democracy, \nbuilding free markets, and encouraging civil society in nations that \notherwise might become havens or breeding grounds for terrorists. We \nmust seek to encourage societies that can nurture and fulfill the \naspirations of their citizens and deny terrorists the uncontrolled \nterritory and abject poverty in which they thrive.\n  Few conditions do more harm to these objectives than the HIV/AIDS \npandemic. It has imposed a crushing burden on the economies of numerous \nAfrican nations; it has exacerbated undercurrents of political \ninstability that weaken the fundamentals of responsible government; and \nit has destroyed millions of family units. Beyond the sick and the \ndead, the disease has created a generation of orphans, whose prospects \nfor a fulfilling and productive life have been diminished by the loss \nof parents and other family members.\n  The President has recognized the urgency of moving forward at this \nmoment in history and has announced his support very solidly. He \nbelieves we need to fulfill our altruistic role in the world and to \nprotect U.S. national security. We must join him in this effort by \npassing the bill before us.\n  The House bill would authorize the President's Emergency Plan for \nHIV/AIDS Relief. This plan would provide $15 billion over the next 5 \nyears for AIDS care, treatment and prevention in those countries \nalready facing an AIDS crisis and in those countries that have \nexperienced a dramatic increase in the disease.\n  The bill would establish the position of Coordinator for HIV/AIDS to \nensure an effective approach by the various agencies of the U.S. \nGovernment involved in combating the global spread of AIDS.\n  The bill also would provide the President with the discretion to \ndevote up to $1 billion a year for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria. In an effort to generate foreign \ncontributions to the global fund, the bill sets a ceiling for American \ncontributions at one-third of total contributions. In other words, we \nhope to stimulate at least $2 in foreign contributions to the global \nfund for each\n\n[[Page S6416]]\n\ndollar contributed by the United States.\n  The Senate can make history this week by passing this bill and \nsending the measure to the President for his signature. We should do so \nwithout delay.\n  I add, finally, this thought to the debate. The President of the \nUnited States, during the ceremonies in which the new members of NATO \nwere ratified by this body last week, and introduced to the public at \nthe White House by the President, took aside Members who were there, \nand even at a historic moment in which we were discussing NATO, he \ndiscussed with us the HIV/AIDS legislation. He indicated that he was \ngoing to the summit of the G-8, that it is critical that other nations \njoin us. It is critical today that we pass this legislation.\n  But in order for the HIV pandemic to be arrested, other nations must \nbe involved. The President emphasized to me and to others that his own \nadvocacy, his own power in that meeting with regard to this issue, is \ndependent upon having a bill. In a very pragmatic way, the President \nindicated the House bill, which passed by a large majority, is a good \nbill. I suspect if the President were to offer all of his amendments, \nif I were to offer those I have already suggested in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, likewise the distinguished ranking member, Members \nof the House and the Senate, who have a variety of ways in which we can \nimprove the situation, we could have a remarkable debate. As a matter \nof fact, we might have a substantial study of this situation for much \nof the rest of this Congress. Feelings are very strong on many of these \nissues.\n  I am sensitive to this in many ways, having tried, as chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, from the beginning of this year, to \nwrestle with this very piece of legislation and how we could bring it \nto fulfillment.\n  The President's response to all of this is that the House has passed \na good bill. Please pass the same bill without amendment. Please send \nit to me so I can sign it next week and take it in this month of May to \nthe G-8 summit to make a powerful statement in behalf of the world and \nin behalf of our leadership.\n  That has led to my course of action in which I have indicated to my \ncolleagues that I intend to support the President. I intend to support \nthis bill that is before us. I will oppose amendments to the bill \nbecause that will clearly complicate the process. A conference would be \nrequired. It is not clear how rapidly the conferees could either meet \nor come to conclusion, and we have a recess 1 week from now, which \nleaves the President in limbo without a bill.\n  It is those considerations that I hope Members will keep in mind, \nwill understand, and will in fact support. But at least I appreciate in \nthis opening statement an opportunity to state my own convictions, my \nown course of action, and the leadership, at least in this body, that I \nadvocate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand fully the situation of my \nfriend from Indiana. As my colleague, Barry Goldwater--and we both \nserved with him--used to say: In your heart you know we could have a \nbetter bill.\n  But we have a time problem. We have a circumstance where the House \nhad, frankly, thumbed its nose at us last time. We passed unanimously a \nbill which was much more significant than this bill, led by our \nmajority leader and by my friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry. \nThey put together a real robust, significant bill.\n  This is a mere shadow of that bill in my view. But I end up almost \nthe same place as my friend from Indiana, my chairman does. That is, \nyou play the hand you are dealt. The House doesn't give a darn about \nthis bill. Frankly, they are threatening if we add any amendments to \njust ditch it. So once again we are yielding to the lowest common \ndenominator.\n  The fact is, they have a whip hand right now. The fact is, I want the \nPresident to be able to have a bill when he goes to the G-8 because I \nbelieve he is committed to trying to get the rest of the world to do \nmore than they are doing. He wants to be able, to use a phrase he likes \nto use, lay his cards on the table. He wants to be able to ante up and \nsay: This is what I am ready to do. Now, what are you all going to do?\n  I am willing to help him do that, even though this is not--this is \nnot--the best bill. The best bill was the Kerry-Frist bill. That was \nthe best bill we had, and we passed it. I think we voted it out \nunanimously last time. It was much more significant than the bill we \nhave now. Then my friend and I, both faced with a similar dilemma, came \nalong with what, a Lugar-Biden/Biden-Lugar bill, which was better than \nthis bill.\n  But I am not here to talk about that. I am here to say we need a \nbill. I want everyone to know we are trying our best. I hope the \nmajority leader would attest to the fact I have been straight up with \nhim. We want to add a couple of amendments. Frankly, we are going to \nhave a rough road to hoe. I think we will get one--I hope so, because I \nthink the House may accept it if it is added on--which I think is very \nimportant.\n  Parochially, Senator Santorum and I, although he is not the one \npushing it and I am--one is on the debt relief, which is something my \nfriend from Indiana and I have worked on for years in various forums. \nAnd I think we should get the global AIDS fund up to that minimum \nthreshold of $500 million.\n  Last July, the Senate unanimously approved a bill initiated in the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations by Senators Kerry, Frist, Helms and \nmyself. It stalled in the other body. There was little interest \nexpressed by the Bush administration, and the bill died.\n  In January of this year, as one of the first orders of business, we \nbegan discussions in the Committee on Foreign Relations on moving \nforward on the Kerry-Frist-Helms-Biden bill. Unfortunately, each time \nwe tried to proceed with the bill, the White House or the majority \nleader asked the chairman to delay, because the administration wanted \nmore time to work on its proposal.\n  We might have passed a very strong bill months ago. But we did not. \nNow we are told that time is up, that we must take up the House bill, \nand that we must not amend the House bill.\n  I must say that I find it curious that we were asked to delay, and \nnow we are told we cannot amend this bill. But I will return to that \nsubject in a moment.\n  HIV/AIDS is the worst epidemic that mankind has ever seen. It is a \nsource of instability. It is highly damaging to economic development in \nsome of the poorest countries of the world. It is a humanitarian \ndisaster. It is, in short, a national security issue, and will be for \nthe foreseeable future.\n  It is right and proper that the Congress and the President work \ntogether to develop a comprehensive program of assistance.\n  As the world's leading economic power, we have a responsibility to \nlead the world in fighting this plague. I commend the President for \nfocusing attention on this important question. It has clearly helped us \npush this legislation toward the finish line.\n  But now that we are nearing that finish line, I think we need to make \na few modifications. The bill before us was passed by the House with, I \nam sure, the best of intentions.\n  It does not, however, as the title suggests, provide leadership. I \nbelieve there is considerable room for improvement in the House-passed \nbill.\n  I acknowledge that the bill does some useful things.\n  First and foremost, it acknowledges the severity of the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic, and authorizes substantial funds over a 5 year period to \naddress it--$15 billion over 5 years, to be exact. That's a heck of a \nlot of money, and well above the current budgets for these programs.\n  It provides for a strategy, and a coordinator to pull together all \nthe agencies working on this issue. These are all good things.\n  Unfortunately, the House bill has several flaws.\n  The bill gives no guidance on the amount of our contributions to the \nGlobal Fund. In Fiscal Year 2004, the bill authorizes ``up to'' $1 \nbillion. So it could be $1 or $1 billion. Which one is it? What do we \nreally expect the Committee on Appropriations to provide? The \nPresident's budget requests just $200 million for the fund, which is \nfar from adequate.\n  For the remaining 4 years the bill, there is no specific amount set \nforth. It\n\n[[Page S6417]]\n\nmerely authorizes ``such sums as may be necessary.'' This is an \nabdication of Congressional responsibility. It's like giving a \ncontractor money to build a house without stating what you want the \nhouse to look like. Who would do something that unwise?\n  I believe that it is our job to set priorities, and funding levels. \nThe voice of Congress should be heard on this issue. There will be an \namendment by one of our colleagues authorizing a responsible \ncontribution of the fund.\n  The House-passed bill does not deal with the issue of debt relief for \ncountries suffering the burden of an AIDS epidemic.\n  Last year the Senate-passed bill included a provision, authored by \nmyself and Senator Santorum, extending increased debt relief to \ncountries with a severe public health crisis such as AIDS. We should do \nno less this year.\n  The House-passed bill contains language that I think is bad policy. \nIt contains a requirement that one-third of all dollars devoted to \nprevention must be earmarked for abstinence-only until marriage \nprograms.\n  I am concerned that this limitation is impractical.\n  I believe that the Agency for International Development and other \nagencies working on the ground are competent to decide how much money \nto spend on abstinence-only programs based on local conditions.\n  We should not assign arbitrary percentages to one element of a \ncomprehensive strategy to prevent the spread of AIDS without a \nrationale. How did the other body come to the conclusion that 33 \npercent was appropriate? I do not know. I doubt that anyone does.\n  There are other problems with the bill. Some are more serious than \nothers.\n  We will try, with a few amendments, to fix them in an expeditious \nway.\n  The majority leader has suggested that we must not amend this bill \nbecause there is no time for a conference or for consideration by the \nother body. With all respect to the leader, I believe he is mistaken.\n  The reconciliation bill we just passed will not go to conference. The \nleadership of both bodies intends to bring back the conference report \non that bill before the recess. I can assure the leader that any \nconference on this bill would be far simpler than the conference on the \nreconciliation bill.\n  Morever, the bill need not even go to conference--it could go through \nthe House again, containing the amendments by the Senate. That happens \nall the time around here. There's no reason that action cannot be \nscheduled promptly--if the House leadership wants it.\n  What the leader is really saying is this: we must be a rubber-stamp \nfor the other body. We cannot amend it, not even one word, or else the \nbill will be in trouble.\n  I simply don't believe that.\n  The Senate has a duty to debate and vote on amendments. If you oppose \namendments, vote them down. But don't vote them down because you think \nan amendment will doom the bill.\n  Let us have a debate. We will do it quickly. We have no intention of \ndelaying passage of this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support a \nlimited number of amendments. Then we can send it to the other body, \nand get it to the President by the end of next week.\n  Frankly, I feel a little bit like I was misleading the public at \nlarge, as if I were the leader on this subject. The leader on this \nsubject has been Senator John Kerry, on our side of the aisle. So I \nwould like, with the permission of my colleagues, to yield to Senator \nKerry to make the substantive opening statement on this bill, since I \nwill have an opportunity to manage it. Again, I compliment him and \nSenator Frist, who, frankly, were the emotional, political, and \nintellectual engines getting this going.\n  If there is no objection, I yield the floor to my friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am extraordinarily grateful, not just for \nthe yielding by my colleague from Delaware, and my friend of many years \nhere, but I am also very grateful for the comments he just made. I \nappreciate enormously his acknowledgment of the work that has gone into \nthis legislation from the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Frist \nand I did start this effort a number of years ago. In fact, we chaired \na major bipartisan, frankly apolitical, completely nonpolitical effort \nnationally, bringing together most of the people involved in this issue \nfor a long period of time to solicit from them their thoughts about the \nbest way to try to put together, for the first time, a comprehensive \napproach to the issue of AIDS.\n  The reason for wanting to make it comprehensive, obviously, is that \neverything else was failing. There was and is a sense of implosion in \ncontinents and countries as a consequence of what is happening.\n  No country ever had the capacity to provide as much leadership or to \nprovide as much resource as the United States of America to help to \ndeal with this issue. It is good that we are at least on the floor of \nthe Senate today for some brief period of time dealing with this \nquestion of the HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act which comes over \nto us from the House. The scope of the AIDS epidemic really cannot be \nunderestimated. It is now spreading to the Caribbean. It is in East \nEuropean former Soviet bloc countries. It is in Asia. The \nnondiscriminating way that AIDS kills women and children, men and boys, \nyoung and old alike, tears up families, and destroys human \ninfrastructure, is beyond people's belief, absent an extraordinary \neffort comprehensively to begin to coordinate a global effort to combat \nit. It is the worst public health, social, and humanitarian crisis of \nour age.\n  It is imperative the United States lead the efforts to deal with it. \nIt should not only be on our agenda today, but it needs to be on our \nagenda in the months and years to come.\n  Obviously, Congress should send to the President legislation that \nsubstantially increases funding for our global AIDS programs, and \nindeed this bill will do that. But we need to leave no doubt in the \nworld's mind that we are going to be at the forefront of that fight in \nthe years to come.\n  To underscore what the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee just said, the President could have had this legislation last \nyear, or even earlier this year, had the administration and Republican \nallies in Congress wanted it. Last July, the Senate unanimously passed \nand sent to the House the bipartisan United States leadership effort \nagainst HIV/AIDS.\n  I thank the majority leader for his efforts to join me in again a \ncompletely nonpartisan effort to try to behave in a globally \nresponsible way and in a way that lives up to the highest values and \nstandards of our country.\n  I introduced that bill a year ago today, along with Senators Frist, \nBiden, Helms, Daschle, and some 10 other cosponsors. That bipartisan \nbill was the most comprehensive global HIV/AIDS bill ever introduced in \nthe Congress. It authorized more than double the annual $1 billion \nlevel of funding for AIDS, TB, and malaria programs over each fiscal \nyear of 2003 and 2004, it created an HIV/AIDS coordinator in the \nDepartment of State, it ensured the Government had a comprehensive 5-\nyear global strategy on HIV/AIDS, and it provided USAID, CDC, and other \nHHS agencies with the necessary authorities and resources to carry out \nan effective program of prevention and treatment abroad.\n  The House of Representatives had ample opportunity to act on this \nbill before Congress adjourned last November, but it failed to even \ntake it up. Nor was the House interested in conferencing the full bill. \nThe administration provided no impetus, no leadership, and no effort in \norder to try to get the House to do so. Apparently the \ncomprehensiveness of the bill was too much for the House Republicans to \nhandle.\n  Speaking to this point on November 13 of last year, Congressman Hyde, \nchairman of the House International Relations Committee, stated that \n``Discussions have broken down between the Senate and the House over \nthe size and the scope of the bill.'' And there was no intervention \nwhatsoever by the administration to try to bring those parties together \nat any time.\n  It is more than regrettable that our colleagues in the House refused \nto act last year. Although this bill predated President Bush's AIDS \ninitiative announced this year in his State of the\n\n[[Page S6418]]\n\nUnion Address, that very worthy initiative could easily have been \nfunded and carried out under the provisions of the Senate-passed bill. \nWe had a missed opportunity, one that could have saved lives. As \nChairman Hyde wrote earlier this week in his own op-ed in the \nWashington Post, ``In the five minutes or so required to read this \ncolumn, another 30 people will die and another 55 will become \ninfected.''\n  Just think how many people could have been helped had the \nadministration and the House not missed the opportunity offered by the \nSenate last year to ramp up our efforts.\n  Since the beginning of this year, Senator Biden and I have worked \nconsistently with Senator Lugar, chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, to produce a bipartisan global HIV/AIDS bill. Regrettably--\nand I do regret--each step of the way those efforts were repeatedly \nfrustrated by the White House and some Members on the other side of the \naisle. Our most recent effort, S. 1009, the United States Emergency \nPlan for AIDS Relief Act of 2003, introduced by Senator Lugar on May 7 \nand cosponsored by Senators Biden, Daschle, and Sarbanes, was based on \nthe very draft the majority leader, Senator Frist, brought us for \nconsideration after consultation and input from the White House. But \nthat effort, too, died on the vine.\n  The White House and the Senate majority leader have made it \nabundantly clear that the President now wants the Senate to move \nquickly to pass the bill without amendment. Having been at the \nforefront of the legislative effort to combat this, I am delighted the \nPresident now wants to have a bill in hand when he meets with the G-8 \nleaders in June. I agree that we can and must leverage other nations to \nincrease their efforts and their resources to combat the AIDS pandemic. \nAnd I am confident the President will be able to tell his colleagues \nand the Congress that we are united in the fight against AIDS. However, \nthe bill we send him ought to not only provide substantially increased \nresources to fight AIDS, but it should also embody comprehensive, \nbalanced, and effective policies and programs.\n  The pending House bill does well in resources in terms of \nauthorization--$15 billion over the next 5 years for the three most \ninfectious global diseases, HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Like last year's \nbipartisan Senate bill on which it is modeled, the House bill \nestablished an HIV/AIDS coordinator, and it mandates a coordinated, \ncomprehensive, and integrated U.S. 5-year strategy. But the bill \nremains flawed. If left unaddressed, those flaws will seriously \nundermine the effectiveness and the comprehensiveness of the U.S. AIDS \nprograms.\n  The House bill provides insufficient resources for the Global Fund to \nFight AIDS, TB and Malaria, the public-private partnership established \nin 2001 with the strong support of President Bush and United Nations \nSecretary General Kofi Annan. The global fund reflects the \ninternational community's determination to marshal increased resources \nto combat not only HIV/AIDS but also TB and malaria. Tommy Thompson, \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, currently chairs the global \nfund's board of directors. Whereas the Bush administration's new AIDS \ninitiative is focused on only 14 countries--12 in Africa and 2 in the \nCaribbean--the global fund's scope is worldwide, covering not only \ncountries where AIDS is rampant, but also countries such as Russia, \nChina, and India, where the epidemic is growing rapidly.\n  The Bush administration's preference for bilateral efforts over \nmultilateral efforts, in my judgment, is discernible because of the way \nthe allocation of funds within the President's announced initiative \ntakes place. The President promised $15 billion over 5 years. But only \n$1 billion of those funds--that is $200 million a year--would go to the \nglobal fund. This annual figure of $200 million a year is already $150 \nmillion less than we have provided in fiscal year 2003 alone. The \nPresident's proposal provides for no increases over the 5-year period.\n  The House bill authorizes ``up to $1 billion'' for the global fund \nfor fiscal year 2004. On the face of it, that looks like an \nimprovement. It is calculated to look like an improvement, but it is \nnot an improvement. The House bill fails to guarantee any specific \nfunding level, and it caps U.S. contributions at 25 percent of the \nfund's total contributions.\n\n  This is simply not adequate. We can, and we should, do more. At a \nminimum, we should be able to guarantee that our contributions to the \nfund for fiscal year 2004 are significantly increased over the 2003 \nlevel.\n  I know some of my colleagues believe other countries are not \ncontributing enough to the fund. I share that concern, but I am proud \nthat the United States of America is the largest donor to the fund, and \nwe ought to be. In my view, that is commensurate with leadership, and \nleadership is what is needed. However, other countries can and should \ndo more, and if leveraging our contributions will enable Chairman \nThompson and the leadership of the global fund to raise more resources, \nI am all for that.\n  S. 1009, the Lugar-Biden-Kerry bill that was introduced earlier this \nmonth, would authorize $1 billion for the fund for fiscal year 2004, \nand $500 million of this would be available without any strings \nattached. To receive the additional $500 million, the fund would have \nto raise $2 billion in contributions from sources other than the United \nStates. So it provides real leverage, and that is what we ought to be \ndoing. In effect, the United States would be providing one-third of the \nfund's resources--a figure with which all of us ought to be able to \nlive. I will support changes in the House bill to strike the House \nlanguage on the fund and achieve those higher funding levels.\n  Second, the House bill mandates that one-third of the funds spent on \nprevention go only to abstinence-until-marriage programs. Now, none of \nus disagrees that abstinence is an important component of AIDS \neducation. It is important as a matter of values, and of course we \nought to engage in that effort. But the effectiveness of these programs \ndepends literally on their comprehensiveness and on their relevancy to \nthe population you are targeting. That means you need all three \ncomponents of the so-called ABC model: abstinence; be faithful, which \nincludes reducing the number of partners; and the use of condoms.\n  Obviously, abstinence does not apply to all target populations. For \nexample, take a situation where you have people who are married or they \nare in a monogamous relationship. It is well and good to promote the \nconcept of abstinence, which we should do, but abstinence-until-\nmarriage programs have their greatest resonance with young people, and \nI believe we ought to fund those types of programs. But we should not \ntie the President's hands by specifically earmarking the percentage of \nfunds to be spent on these programs because that denies the reality of \nwhat you find on the ground in terms of the targeted population.\n  I will support an amendment to strike this earmark. We ought to be \nrational enough as human beings to understand that you do not want to \njust promote abstinence. What happens when somebody falls short of the \nabstinence, as everyone in the world knows occurs? Then you want at \nleast to have that person also educated as to what the possibilities \nare to still prevent the spread of the disease.\n  In my view, we should be providing the administration with maximum \nflexibility to ensure that our assistance programs are well targeted to \nthe countries in which we are working. Regrettably, the House bill \ncontains a number of earmarks and limitations ideologically driven but \nnot practically driven, which reduce the flexibility and undermine the \ncapacity to work with various high-risk populations at the epicenter of \nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\n  The House bill guarantees that faith-based organizations may \nparticipate in U.S. Government-funded HIV/AIDS programs even if they \nchoose not to participate in all elements of the program. For example, \nthey can be involved in the component that respects abstinence but they \nmay choose not to be involved in providing counseling on safe sex and \ndistributing condoms.\n  Faith-based organizations are on the front lines of the fight against \nHIV/AIDS, and I respect that. We welcome that. And they should be. We \nneed them there. I do not believe we should ask any organization, \nfaith-based or otherwise, to compromise their principles in this \neffort, and I would not do that. But if the U.S. Government is\n\n[[Page S6419]]\n\nfunding their programs, it is important, with respect to the \nexpenditure of our dollars, that we guarantee that those dollars be \nspent in the most effective way and that we need to respect the \ninterventions that, in fact, prevent HIV infection, even those they \nobject to on a moral or religious ground.\n  An organization that does not wish to give out condoms should \nabsolutely not be required to do so, but it also ought to be required \nto give accurate and medically sound advice on the effectiveness of \nthat method. I will support an amendment to the House bill that makes \nit clear that all organizations that are funded by the U.S. Government \nin this fight must follow that policy.\n  Last year, the Senate-passed AIDS bill contained a title on debt \nreduction that was authored by Senators Biden and Santorum. It urged \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to renegotiate the Enhanced HPIC \nInitiative to provide funds for HIV/AIDS programs through greater debt \nreduction. The House bill we are now considering contains no such \ntitle, despite strong support for it from many quarters, including the \nCatholic and other churches. This deficiency in the House bill ought to \nbe corrected. I strongly support Senator Biden's amendment to put that \ntitle back in the bill.\n  This bill has been a long time in coming. It is here now. Obviously, \nit is important for the Senate to advance our efforts with respect to \nAIDS. In my judgment, the amendments that are being offered will \nimprove this legislation in terms of its resources, in terms of its \npolicy, and the flexibility for the President.\n  I hope those amendments will be adopted, notwithstanding the Chair's \ndesire not to have any amendments, because they will provide us with \nthe capacity to have the full measure of the policy we ought to be \npassing in order to deal with this issue. It is better to have \nsomething that is comprehensive and effective than something that \nmerely meets political cosmetic needs and does less than what is needed \nto address this extraordinary challenge.\n  I also believe there is time yet. There is time, if there is good \nwill on both sides and if there is Presidential leadership, to \nconference a bill with these amendments. There is no reason we should \nnot make that available to the Senate. We can guarantee the President, \non our side, that if we do that in good faith, he will have a bill \nbefore he goes to the G-8 summit. But if our efforts to improve this \nbill fail, I will still support it, Mr. President, imperfect as I think \nit is, because stemming the AIDS pandemic is the goal and any measure \nthat begins the steps towards that cannot be ignored and is better than \nnone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be speaking for about 10 minutes or \nso. The Senator from Illinois and I were just discussing all of us who \nwant to speak on, and that we, the Senator from Illinois and the \nSenator from Massachusetts, from whom we just heard, have worked so \nhard on this effort.\n  I think what I will do is get my opening statement out of the way, \nand then we will come back to the bill a little later today.\n  I will yield a minute or so to the Senator from Illinois, if he would \nlike to make a comment. I know we are a little constrained for time. We \nare going back to the growth bill in about 9 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for yielding 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a historic piece of legislation. I \nthink the United States is making a commitment to a world problem that \nis going to haunt us for decades to come.\n  I salute President Bush for his leadership. I am glad this has been \nbipartisan. My only regret is that it comes to the floor in a very \ntight procedural situation. I hope we will have time to have an honest \ndiscussion about a few issues and still deal with this bill on a timely \nand dispatched basis.\n  I salute the Senator from Tennessee, the majority leader, for his \ncommitment, as well as the Senator from Massachusetts, and my good \nfriend and neighbor from Indiana, Senator Lugar.\n  I am going to withhold any further statements for a little later on \nin the bill. As we get into the dialog, I will offer a few ideas.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we really only have 35 minutes to speak on \nthe bill itself, now that we are officially on the bill. My colleagues \ncan tell from the comments today that this initiative is a huge \nbipartisan initiative that is supported strongly by Democrats and \nRepublicans. I think they will see as the debate goes forward that \nnobody thinks the bill is absolutely perfect in the sense that they \ndon't as individuals agree with everything in the bill itself. Again, \nreflected in the comments we have just heard, if we step back, we are \nseeing an unprecedented commitment on behalf of this institution, the \nSenate, the House of Representatives, the Congress, with passage of a \nbill that follows the leadership of President Bush of $15 billion over \na 5-year period.\n  I especially appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nMassachusetts because, indeed, Senator Kerry and I have been working on \nthis issue for years, in an apolitical way, in working with CSIS, which \nis a nonprofit group that all of us know, and we have brought in the \nexperts from all over the world. They have done a beautiful job. We \nhave sent delegations to China to look at the issue and broadly support \nit.\n  I think that is what this bill is all about. So much of what we do \nappears so partisan and, indeed, we will disagree on dollars and how \nmuch should go to the global fund. Some people feel passionately it \nneeds to be more. Others say: Let's give a little more time to the \nfund. At the end of the day, when we pass this bill, this bipartisan \nbill--it comes from the House, but it is an assimilation of all the \nideas we have been working on--it is something of which we can be quite \nproud.\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, his \nmade comments I especially appreciate because it walked through the \nchallenges we face in addressing an issue that is very difficult for a \nlot of people because it involves stigma, a virus that wasn't even \naround 23 years ago. The HIV, when I was doing medical school and the \ninternship and the early years of residency, had never been heard of, \nnot talked about in the textbooks until 1981, when we saw the first \nthree or four viruses. That virus has now killed 23 million people, has \n40 million people infected, and will kill, in the best of all worlds, \nanother 60 million people.\n  As history looks back at this day or at this year or at these \nSenators in this body, it will be able to say we did everything \npossible to reverse the course of that destruction. At the end of today \nwe will say, yes, for this point in time--we have lots of other steps \nto take--this is the first major step. This is what I wanted to say to \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This is not going to cure the \nvirus. We have no cure. We have no vaccine. We can reverse that trend, \nbut this is the first major step.\n  The President took the lead in the State of the Union Message. It is \nvery complementary to the work I have worked with Senator Kerry and \nSenator Lugar and Senator Biden and Senator Durbin on over the years. \nThat is most important. This little HIV virus is only about 100 \nnanometers. That is tiny. It is microscopic. It is invisible to the \nnaked eye. A meter is about that big. It is a billionth of a meter in \nterms of size, 12,000 times smaller than a human hair. So it is \namazing. We are just entering this era where we understand viruses and \nhow we can fight them to the point that we can effectively combat them, \nbut something that small can cause so much destruction.\n\n  In terms of process, which people have referred to, we will begin \nlegislation later today on this $15 billion 5-year effort to combat the \nworldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic. The bipartisan support is reflected in the \nfact that the bill that I, in talking to the leadership on the other \nside of the aisle, said, how can we best immediately begin the response \nto the destruction of this virus, meaning not put it off 6 months or 12 \nmonths or 3 months or a year, and it is using this piece of legislation \nwhich will come to the floor later today.\n  Some have suggested, you kind of knock out the deliberative process \nby\n\n[[Page S6420]]\n\ngoing to the House bill. I disagree. We have put together various \nbills. If you look at the House bill, while not everybody agrees with \neverything in it, it really is an assimilation of the proposals put \nforward that looks at prevention, care, and treatment. That is what is \nbeautiful. It is the amount of money, $15 billion, about $3 billion a \nyear for 5 years, the money, but also it is the first time in \nlegislation that we have linked a public health approach, which you \nneed, to this greatest of all humanitarian and public health \ntragedies--challenges, as Senator Kerry has just said on the floor, \nthat you link prevention, care, and treatment. With that, over time, we \nwill be able to reverse the course of this virus.\n  The treatment strategies themselves have to do with antiretroviral \ndrugs. Some people say, let's put all the money there. We don't have a \ncure yet, so to put all the money there doesn't make sense. We have to \ngo back and look at both prevention, which we know is 100-percent \neffective, the prevention strategies--I refer back to Uganda, and what \nis being done there--and also the care. How do you manage people with \nHIV/AIDS? It could be other antibiotics. It could be nutrition. It \ncould be care. That is why the overall planning and the comprehensive \nnature of this bill is so important.\n  The bill before us does represent a lot of coming together into a \nfocus of agreement and consensus on a range of issues--not all of the \nissues, but on, I would say, most of the issues. That is why we can't \nlet the perfect be the enemy of what the good is in this particular \nbill.\n  It is true that in less than 3 weeks the President of the United \nStates, if we pass this bill, will be able to go to the G-8 conference, \nand that is important. That is not necessarily the driving reason to do \nit, but it does give us an additional reason to do it--in addition to \nthe fact it will save lives, which is the most important issue to all \nof us--that the President of the United States can show that we are a \ncaring nation, we are not just a good nation but we are a great nation \nin terms of reaching out, the caring, the compassion as we go forward. \nWe will be able to lead--yes, we are a powerful nation--and get other \nnations to participate because we can't solve this problem by \nourselves. The United States can't do it. We don't know the answer. We \ndon't have enough money to do it. But when we can bring the family of \nnations, contributing both commitment and money, we will be able to \ncure this little virus as we go forward.\n  There are lots of issues in the bill we will talk about later. One of \nthe most important is that we can start immediately. We will have a \nskilled coordinator--that is part of the underlying package--will be \nable to move forward, begin the planning, begin the implementation. \nThen through the appropriations process we will be able to add the \nappropriate money.\n  Let me close as I opened: Again, we will have the opportunity to talk \nlater tonight at greater length. History, ultimately, will judge how we \nrespond. We have done a pretty good job through study, committees, \nthrough bills, through proposals, through debates, through the \nappropriations process, but this gives us the first disciplined, \ndedicated, focused, comprehensive response which links the public \nhealth with the scientific. That is what this is about.\n  History will look back on this day as the first major step in \nreversing this greatest of humanitarian challenges of the 21st century. \nWe do have a choice. We could put it off for later or we could choose \nto do it now. I believe we will choose to act tonight, ultimately pass \nthis bill, and, with that, it will be a demonstration of why we are not \njust a good Nation but a great nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader for \nbringing this important piece of legislation to the Senate floor. It is \ndesperately needed. The Senate passed something very similar to this \nproposal 9 months ago. Despite our urgent and repeated requests, \nRepublican leaders in the House refused to act on that bill. But \nsomething important happened between then and now. In his State of the \nUnion Address to the Nation, President Bush proposed an historic U.S. \ncommitment to the global AIDS fight. We applaud the President's \nsupport. I also want to acknowledge Secretary of State Colin Powell, \nwho has shown great leadership on this issue of global AIDS and taken \nsome criticism for it.\n  Our colleagues in the House of Representatives, especially \nCongressmen Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos, also deserve thanks for their \ncommitment to this cause. Here in the Senate, many of us have seen the \nface of AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean personally. This fight has \nbenefitted from their leadership. I especially want to acknowledge the \nwork of Senators Durbin, Kerry, Biden, Leahy, Feingold, Kennedy, Frist, \nLugar, and DeWine.\n  Last August, I traveled with several of our colleagues to South \nAfrica, Kenya, Botswana, and Nigeria. We wanted to get a clear look at \nthe development challenges in Africa. The challenges are myriad and \nmassive. They include investment and trade, education and agriculture. \nOne of Africa's greatest challenges is health care--particularly AIDS.\n  In South Africa, I had the privilege to deliver 1,000 pounds of \nclothes and toys, donated by the people of South Dakota to children in \nSouth Africa affected by HIV/AIDS. Those toys provided some glimmer of \nhope to the South African children who received them. But this bill \noffers the beginning of real hope. This bill holds out the promise that \nsome of those children will grow to be adults and perhaps have children \non their own.\n  On that trip, I met a young girl named Mary. She lives in Soweto. She \nhad recently lost both of her parents to AIDS. She had been left to \ncare for her four younger siblings. She was 12 years old. Mary and her \nsiblings are among the world's more than 14 million ``AIDS orphans''--\nchildren who have lost their mother, or both parents, to AIDS. \nWorldwide, more than 30 million people have already died from AIDS. \nLast year, AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses claimed the lives of 3.1 \nmillion people. And 5 million more people became newly infected. Today, \nmore than 42 million people are infected with HIV or living with AIDS. \nMore than 75 percent of them live in Africa or the Caribbean.\n  I am convinced that, if we combine America's resources and technology \nand the great compassion of the American people with the courage and \nhope shown by Mary and so many others, we will defeat this disease.\n  HIV/AIDS is the great humanitarian crisis of our time. But it is more \nthan a humanitarian crisis. AIDS is a national security issue. It is a \npublic health issue. It is an economic issue. And it is a moral issue. \nWe have the tools to fight this disease. It is our duty and our \nobligation to use them. The U.S. commitment to the global AIDS fight \nhas increased significantly in the last few years. But we could have, \nand should have, done far more, far sooner. We must not delay any more.\n  This bill is another step in our fight. It would more than double \ncurrent U.S. spending for international AIDS programs. It calls for a \ncomprehensive strategy that integrates prevention, treatment, research \nfor a vaccine and help support children--like Mary, orphaned by the \ndisease.\n  The President is right in calling for us to target nations in Sub-\nSaharan Africa and the Caribbean. These nations represent the epicenter \nof the global AIDS crisis. But a crisis is looming in Asia and Central \nand Eastern Europe. We must do now in those areas what we did not do \nsoon enough in Africa. We must intervene now to stop the spread of HIV/\nAIDS before it reaches the epic proportions experts warn we could see. \nFor that reason, Democrats will offer an amendment to this bill to \nguarantee a robust American commitment to the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The bilateral efforts aimed at Africa \nand the Caribbean are needed to address today's crisis. A strong U.S. \ncommitment to the Global AIDS Fund is needed to prevent tomorrow's \ncrisis.\n  We will also offer an amendment to give the President the flexibility \nhe needs to confront this epidemic. The House bill ties the President's \nhands on prevention programs. Abstinence must be a central piece of any \nsuccessful prevention program. But earmarking 33 percent of prevention \nfunds for one approach is counter-productive.\n  We will also offer other important amendments. One will relieve the \ndebt\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\nburden on the world's poorest nations--many of whom are burdened also \nby this AIDS crisis. Another will provide American food aid to people \nsuffering from AIDS in desperately poor nations. We know that many \npeople who suffer from AIDS actually die from starvation and \nmalnutrition. Emergency food aid from America's farmers can help keep \nthem alive.\n  It is important to note, however, that this is just an authorization \nbill. By itself, it does not commit one dime to prevent AIDS or help \nits victims. The real test of our commitment to children like Mary and \nothers living with and threatened by AIDS will be whether we fund this \npromise. A prescription you can't afford to fill does no good at all. \nThe President calls his proposal an ``emergency plan.'' He is right. \nThis is an emergency. We should treat it like an emergency. After we \npass this bill, we must appropriate the full amount it prescribes.\n  We can react to the plight of AIDS orphans like Mary with denial and \ndespair. Or we can respond--as this proposal does--with a determination \nto save those children and the millions of others threatened by HIV/\nAIDS.\n  In Uganda, mothers with AIDS create ``memory books'' for their \nchildren. In their dying days, they gather together photos and stories \nthey want their children to know. They know that they will not live to \nsee their children grow up. With this bill, we have a chance to write a \ndifferent book--a different kind of history in this fight against AIDS. \nLet us write that book. Let us pass this bill today. Then, let us \nquickly agree to commit the resources it promises.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, are we in morning business? What is the \nstatus of where we are, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is to resume consideration of the \ntax reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I ask unanimous consent to have an opportunity to \naddress the global AIDS bill very briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6421-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6421-S6428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    JOBS AND GROWTH TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 614\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The business now is the amendment of the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMikulski be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nvery important amendment for the seniors of this country. This does \nthat. First and foremost, before we pass the dividend tax cut and the \ntop rate tax cut, we will proceed to develop and pass a comprehensive \nprescription drug benefit that is equivalent to what we receive in the \nSenate. I have heard many colleagues express the concern I share, which \nis that the seniors and the disabled of this country ought to have the \nsame ability to have the prescription drug coverage we as Federal \nemployees do.\n  This amendment simply sets our priorities straight. It says before we \nproceed with these two tax cuts, we will pass a comprehensive \nprescription drug benefit based on FEHBP, the most common portion of \nwhich is used by Senate and House Members. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. I feel exactly \nabout Medicare and prescription drug issues as the Senator from \nMichigan, but this is not the way to do it. This amendment reduces our \njobs and growth package even before the Finance Committee takes up a \ncomprehensive prescription drug benefit and Medicare improvement bill.\n  I hope everybody knows that I am very committed to reporting a $400 \nbillion bill out of the Finance Committee, and doing it this summer, \nhopefully within the month. This will add a comprehensive prescription \ndrug benefit for seniors.\n  The amendment before us jumps the gun. I am working in a bipartisan \nway on a prescription drug policy that fits within that $400 billion \nframework in our budget resolution. In fact, I have a 4 o'clock meeting \ntoday with Senators on that issue that, obviously, I am not going to be \nable to keep because of these rollcall votes. We need to keep the jobs \nand growth package complete.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to raise a point of order. This \nupsets the balance of our bill. This language is not germane to the \nmeasure before the Senate. Therefore, I raise a point of order under \nsection 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Due to the fact the budget resolution does not contain \nenough revenue to do what our distinguished chairman has just \nindicated, this amendment is necessary to make that happen.

Mr. President, I ask that the amendment, as modified, \nbe accepted by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to vitiating the yeas and \nnays?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from Ohio if the \nmodification is the one that changes the ratio of the membership?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. It changes the ratio of the membership and increases \nmore representation by minority. It takes off the head of the IRS, and \nit is more evenly balanced and meets the problems that we talked about \nlast night.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The yeas \nand nays are vitiated.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 592), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand the next amendment is the Graham of Florida \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Warner amendment is once again set \naside.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the Warner amendment and all \nrelevant amendments be temporarily set aside so we can next proceed to \nthe Graham of Florida amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 617\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Graham amendment?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nRockefeller and Kerry be added as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, we have more dismal news on the \nstate of the economy in today's press; that the April sales in the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S6423]]\n\nStates declined .9 percent below those in March. This is what the chief \neconomist of Wells Fargo had to say about this development: Consumers \nare tapped out. They have done a marvelous job of supporting the \neconomy, but they are basically done. We need something else to pull up \nthe slack.\n  I suggest that what we need is this amendment which will place money \nin the hands of those Americans and institutions most likely to spend \nand therefore create demand. Those include payroll, small business. It \nincludes those who have already lost their jobs and their unemployment \nbenefits and State governments. This proposal would focus on the next 2 \nyears----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. The period of time in which we need to have a \nstimulus. Most importantly, this would not add to the national debt \nbecause it would be fully offset, therefore avoiding the potential that \nby adding to the deficit we will add to the economic problems that we \nwill have in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from today's \nWashington Post on consumer spending be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 15, 2003]\n\n                  Consumers Trimmed Spending In April\n\n\n              drop in gasoline sales was factor in decline\n\n                 (By Dina ElBoghdady and Anitha Reddy)\n\n       Consumer spending dipped in April as shoppers were more \n     concerned about their jobs than the easing of tensions with \n     Iraq, increasing prospects that economic growth will be tepid \n     at best in the second half of the year.\n       The Commerce Department reported yesterday that April \n     retail sales fell 0.1 percent from March, when pent-up demand \n     created by February's snow storms helped boost sales 2.3 \n     percent.\n       Excluding auto purchases, April sales declined 0.9 percent, \n     the report showed.\n       ``Consumers are tapped out,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief \n     economic officer at Wells Fargo & Co. ``They've done a \n     marvelous job of supporting the economy, but they are \n     basically done . . . We need something else to pull up the \n     slack.''\n       A large portion of the overall sales decline came from \n     consumers spending less on gasoline. Gas purchases fell 5.9 \n     percent from late March to late April as gas prices slid by \n     about a dime on average.\n       But shoppers also held back on their purchases of clothing, \n     furniture and garden supplies because of uncertainty about \n     holding on to their jobs, or finding new ones, if necessary. \n     The jobless rate is 6 percent today, compared with slightly \n     over 4 percent a year ago. Consumers' hesitancy was a big \n     factor preventing the postwar bounce that economists had \n     expected.\n       ``It's not just that the unemployment rate is a problem, \n     it's that the people who are unemployed are unemployed for a \n     longer period of time,'' said John E. Silvia, chief \n     economicst at Wachovia. ``The job pool is stagnant.''\n       A tax cut might prompt shoppers to increase spending and \n     help fuel a more robust recovery, said David A. Wyss, chief \n     economist at Standard & Poor's Corp.\n       Wyss said the savings patterns of the average American \n     indicate that any extra money in after-tax pay would be spent \n     rather than saved.\n       ``The saving rate is pretty much flat, which certainly \n     suggests that consumers are spending as much money as they \n     have,'' Wyss said. ``You can't expect them to do much more \n     than that.''\n       Sales fell 3.2 percent at clothing and accessory stores, \n     1.4 percent at department stores and 0.5 percent at \n     restaurants and bars.\n       ``I've just been going out a lot less,'' said Tonya Sawyer, \n     a claims adjustor shopping at the Fashion Centre at Pentagon \n     City. ``So I don't have the need for clothes or make-up.''\n       Instead, the 30 years old said she relies on new books and \n     CDs, rental videos and her dog Bella to entertain herself in \n     her Arlington apartment. Sales at stores that sell sporting \n     goods, books, music and hobby materials increased 1.2 \n     percent.\n       Even the one demographic group that stores hoped might show \n     steadfast devotion to shopping--teenage girls during prom \n     season--was being wary.\n       ``It's finding what you want at the right price'' that's so \n     hard, said Breona Cain, a high school senior from Largo who \n     was at Pentagon City with two friends yesterday, searching \n     for the perfect accessories for her dress.\n       Auto sales rose 2.5 percent in April, thanks to widespread \n     no-interest financing offers.\n       ``Consumers have shown they're opportunistic,'' said Frank \n     Badillo, senior economist at Retail Forward Inc., a market \n     research firm. ``So certain sectors are benefiting in what is \n     otherwise a weak environment.''\n       Some economists say that in such an uncertain climate it's \n     too early to guage the outlook for the rest of the year.\n       ``The April results should most properly be viewed as \n     transition from a war footing to a normal peacetime \n     footing,'' Ken Mayland, president of Clear View Economics, \n     said in a report. ``Consumers are betwixt and between a \n     `recession' mindset and a `recovery mindset. They have not \n     bought in to either.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, speaking on behalf of Senator Grassley, this \nis a complete substitute and therefore, obviously, will have to be \nopposed. It strikes all of the good work from the committee bill \nregarding the child credit, marriage penalty, AMT, reduction of rates \nfor individuals and small businesses, as well as the dividend relief.\n  We certainly appreciate the Senator's concerns about unemployment \ninsurance and relief for the States. Obviously, we are committed to \naddressing the unemployment insurance issue. As everyone now knows, we \nhave $20 billion for State aid in the bill, and therefore we will have \nto make a point of order. The matter is not germane to the measure now \nbefore the Senate. Therefore, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act I \nask that the point of order against my amendment be waived.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 35, nays 65, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 160 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--35\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--65\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this question, the yeas are 35, the nays \nare 65. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 550 Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending Warner \namendment is set aside.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask to have the amendment set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. My request is on behalf of Senator Collins, Senator \nCraig, Senator Allen, and Senator Murkowski. I do so because we have \nmade a conscientious effort, together with the cooperation of the \nmanagers of this bill, to find the offset and we simply could not find \nthe offset.\n  The thrust of our amendment is for the teachers in America. The \namendment is very simple. It compensates them through a tax deduction \nfor each time they reach into their own pocketbooks or pockets to buy \nschool supplies for their students. We need to increase\n\n[[Page S6424]]\n\nthat amount from $250 which is current law. We need to broaden it so \nthey can use some of the deduction for purposes of continuing \neducation. This is an amendment not for the rich; it is simply for \nthose who serve America and ask very little by way of salary.\n  We cannot move it at this time, but the managers very generously have \nacceded to this colloquy. The managers have agreed to look at this in \nfuture tax legislation and for the time being will agree to extend it \nso this current law of the $250 deduction will not expire at the end of \nthis calendar year.\n  I ask the question of my colleague.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator accurately stated what my intentions are, \nbut let me say it for myself so the Senator knows I have said it.\n  First of all, I need to thank the Senator for his cooperation in \nworking with us on this amendment so we can expedite the bill. Also, I \nmake clear I am a strong supporter of the Senator's legislation and the \nexpansion of it and would agree to make sure we get this done before \nthe end of the calendar year, so that would involve extending it and \nexpanding these teacher provisions.\n  This all deals--so everyone knows what we are talking about--with the \nextension of legislation passed within the last 2 years. It sunsets. We \nmake these permanent, and there would be a significant increase in the \nabove-the-line deduction for teachers.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. \nPerhaps the ranking member may wish to address this issue. If the \nranking member would care to make a comment about the withdrawal of the \namendment of the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nasking the question. All I can say at this point is we will do the very \nbest we can.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I move to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 575\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The business before the Senate is the Kyl \namendment.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, is there an order for me to speak to the Kyl \namendment at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor for 1 minute.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is the amendment that would return money \nto the States from the tobacco company payments to trial lawyers, money \nthat exceeded reasonable fees as determined by a common standard in the \ncourts and an IRS Code provision.\n  What we have done in this amendment is to apply it only \nprospectively, not retroactively. The fee is a reasonable fee plus 500 \npercent, and in any event the lawyers are guaranteed--and, colleagues, \nplease note this--$20,000 per hour. That is what the lawyers are \nguaranteed in those cases, those 10 to 15 cases per year to which this \nwould apply.\n  Those fees were not set by contract. They were not set by courts. The \nmoney is going to be paid by the tobacco companies. The only question \nis, are these excess fees going to be paid to the tobacco lawyers or \nare they going to be paid to the States?\n  I will have at both desks a chart which shows how much money each of \nthe States would receive. It is between $6 billion and $9 billion in \ntotal. You can see the amount listed on this sheet. I ask you to \nconsult that because that is money your States would receive if this \namendment is adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who speaks in opposition? The Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, this amendment was already offered in the \nSenate Finance Committee. It was defeated by a bipartisan vote of \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Finance Committee.\n  IRS should not be involved in setting the fees for CEOs in this \ncountry. They should not be involved in setting the fees for plumbers \nor electricians. And they should not be involved in setting the fees \nfor attorneys who have had voluntary agreements between defendants and \nthe plaintiffs about what they should be paid, which have been approved \nby the courts. All of these fees have been approved by the courts or by \nthe arbitrator. They were voluntarily agreed to.\n  Lawyers don't get paid by the hour in these cases; they get paid by \nthe job. IRS should not determine what are correct payments for \nservices.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield me 10 seconds?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield it if I have any time remaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I want to point out company lawyers were paid $700 million \nper year, per year, for 5 years. Plaintiffs' lawyers had to risk $100 \nmillion of their own money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. \nTherefore, I make a point of order the amendment violates section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I move to waive the provision. I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. REID.

Senators will please \ntake their conversations off the floor.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this afternoon we are being asked to buy a pig in a \npoke.\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\nThat is what we would say in Louisiana--a pig in a poke. Please \ncolleagues, do not vote for the underlying bill. Senator Corzine and \nSenator Schumer and I offer an amendment which is a $350 billion \nalternative that is truly stimulative. It tries to work with the \nadministration but takes out the nonstimulative portion and puts in a \nrebate on wages. If we want to create jobs, then let us stop taxing \nthem.\n  Our amendment also treats States as respected partners and not as \ncharitable aid organizations, which they are not.\n  It also says that tax cuts aren't the only way to stimulate the \neconomy; that you can make strategic investments. As politicians, live \nup to your promises to children by funding education and health care.\n  Don't buy a pig in a poke, and don't turn your back on the 2 million \ncompanies, 2 million farms, and 2 million partnerships that do not get \na penny from the dividend tax cut.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the way to make sure the American people \nare not buying a pig in a poke is to get more money in the pockets of \nthe taxpayers so that there is less money around here for 535 Members \nof Congress to play with.\n  I want to speak in regard to this amendment; that the complete \nsubstitute will cut back our efforts to reduce marginal rates for \nfamilies and small businesses.\n  In addition, the bill will make millions of taxpayers subject to the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  I appreciate the Senator's efforts on the child tax, and we already \nhave a $95 billion child tax credit.\n  We also have significant State aid in the bill.\n  We have a point of order, as we have had before on an amendment like \nthis.\n  I raise that point of order--that the language is not germane to the \nmeasure now before the Senate. The point of order is under section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthat act for the consideration of this amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my understanding is there are pending \nvotes that require unanimous consent to be set aside.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 620\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Landrieu amendment No. 620 is before the \nSenate.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this amendment would go a long way to \nsend the right message to our guardsmen and reservists. Over 370,000 \nhave been activated since September 11 and the attack on this city and \nour Nation.\n  As we know, it has been made painfully aware to us that many of these \nguardsmen and reservists who serve take a cut in pay because they leave \ntheir jobs, they close their businesses to temporarily serve us.\n  This amendment will give their employers, and themselves if they are \nan employer, the opportunity to write off 50 percent of the cost of \ntheir salaries so those salaries can be maintained while they are \nprotecting and serving us. It is the least we can do.\n  The other side is going to say they will get to it later. Let's get \nto it today. Let's not let this tax bill pass without honoring the \nGuard and Reserves and giving them a chance to keep their businesses \nopen while they keep us safe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment proposes to offer a 50-\npercent tax credit for employers of reservists to encourage \ndifferential pay.\n  This amendment does not benefit those who are self-employed and \nprovides little benefit to small businesses with little equity.\n  In addition, nearly 80 percent of the cost of the military tax bill, \nwhich we have already passed in the Senate, is dedicated to reservists \nwith the above-the-line deduction that was included because Senator \nDeWine pushed very hard for it.\n  The amendment is paid for by reducing the dividend exclusion which is \nessential to our growth package; in other words, to keep a well \nbalanced growth package.\n  So the amendment I see as an attack on the jobs and growth bill, and \nI ask that it not be adopted.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order on germaneness, that the \namendment is not germane. The point of order comes under section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFeingold, Senator Stabenow, and Senator Mikulski be added as cosponsors \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthat act for the consideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes on \nthe various amendments next up be temporarily laid aside so we can \nproceed to the Landrieu amendment No. 621.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \npatience. Senator Sessions and I offered this amendment. We are not \ngoing to ask for a vote, but I would like to explain it in 1 minute. We \noffered this amendment to try to technically correct a glitch in the \nrenewal community law. It only affects districts in Louisiana and \nAlabama now, but it could affect, in the near term, districts in 40 \nother States.\n  I am going to ask the chairman of the Finance Committee to consider \nthis fix. It only costs $14 million a year and it will help create jobs \nin some of the poorest areas in our country. So if I could ask for \ntheir consideration, I will at this time withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have spoken to the Senator from Louisiana. \nI know the chairman is appreciative of her efforts along with the \nSenator from Alabama. He is anxious to continue to work with her on \nthis matter. He appreciates their very strong interest in trying to \nrectify this situation. On behalf of the chairman, I can say he will be \nwilling to work with her.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I, too, have spoken with the Senator and \nunderstand her concerns and will do my utmost to help resolve the \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 557\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes on \nthe earlier amendments be temporarily laid aside so we can now proceed \nto amendment No. 557 by the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. Two years \nago, on the last tax bill, we took a historic step in this body. We \nsaid part of college tuition should be tax deductible. We required that \nthe first $3,000 be deductible for a family making up to $160,000 a \nyear. This will raise that. It goes up to $4,000 in the next fiscal \nyear under the previous law, and then it expires in 2006. This law \nwould make it permanent and raise the amount to $8,000 initially, next \nyear, and then $12,000 in future years.\n  It is very simple. It pays for itself, by the way, by reducing the \ntop rate not by three points but by one point. The choice is simple. \nMiddle-class people have an awfully difficult time paying for college. \nIf you are rich, you can afford it. If you are poor, we help you, and \nwe should. But the middle class gets stuck. Families are up late at \nnight worrying about how they are going to pay the tuition bill.\n  I ask my colleagues, which do they choose? Bring the top rate down \nbut not as quickly and help middle-class families with the second \ngreatest expense they face other than their home, or bring the rate \ndown quickly? It is a simple choice. I hope the body will vote for the \nmiddle-class parents who are stuck with these huge tuition bills.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we added the tuition provision in the bill 2 \nyears ago, and it is obviously supported by a broad number of people in \nthe body. The problem is that this addition is way too expensive and \ncomes out of the top rate reduction from the bill that is on the floor, \nthe acceleration of the marginal income tax rate provision of the bill.\n  Obviously, we have to oppose this particular amendment. This is a \nmatter that could be dealt with in a different way but not by paying \nfor it in the manner it is paid for. It is not germane. Therefore, I \nraise a point of order under 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask that the point of order be waived, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the modification says the offset included \nin the amendment repeals the tax credit for refurbishing of nonhistoric \nstructures only, not historic structures, with which people had \nconcerns.\n  If you believe the American economy needs a shot in the arm right \nnow, then you should vote for this amendment. Our amendment allows \ncompanies that have made money overseas to bring it back right now. \nThey are taxed at 35 percent. When faced with a choice of whether they \nkeep it overseas or bring it back, they keep it overseas. We are going \nto allow a 1-year exemption. The tax will be lowered from 35 percent to \n5.25 percent. They have 1 year to invest the money to create jobs in \nthis country. As with Senator Boxer's very fine amendment in our bill, \nit cannot go for executive pay. The money has to be invested in America \nto create jobs.\n  I believe this will be a tremendous stimulus to our economy, and I \nurge its adoption.\n  I yield 10 seconds to my friend from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 10 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will vote for this \none-time infusion of private sector dollars to create jobs and \nencourage business investment in plants and equipment. This infusion \nwill happen immediately. I think it is what we need to fight for \nbecause our people are hurting out there.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                        USE OF FUNDS REPATRIATED\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator Ensign for his \nleadership on the Invest in the USA Act. As we said earlier, this \ninfusion of cash will provide an immediate and much needed boost to the \neconomy. Over the next year, it is estimated that this legislation, \nwhich is included in this bill as an amendment, will bring $140 billion \nin foreign earnings back into the United States.\n  As my friend is aware, under our amendment, which is the Invest in \nthe USA Act of 2003, these funds are to be used as a source for worker \nhiring and training; infrastructure; research, and\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\ndevelopment; capital investments; or the financial stabilization of the \ncorporation for the purposes of job retention or creation. Any attempt \nto use these funds to increase executive pay would be a violation of \nthe intent of this legislation.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the Senator from California is absolutely \ncorrect. These funds are meant to stimulate the economy. I pledge to \nwork with Senator Boxer and our colleagues in conference to ensure that \nthese funds may not be used for executive pay.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Senator's \namendment. This amendment was offered in the Senate Finance Committee. \nRepublicans and Democrats joined to defeat this amendment.\n  There is no question that the international tax laws need to be \nassessed. We have agreed to do that in the Finance Committee. The \nRepublican leadership said they would look at all international tax \nlaws and consequences.\n  This is a retroactive tax break. This bill is supposed to be \nstimulative in the future, not in the past. This amendment will reward \ncompanies for what they did a long time ago when we ought to be looking \nat the bill in a prospective nature.\n  A retroactive tax cut is not what we need. We ought to examine \ninternational tax laws. We have an agreement to do it in a bipartisan \nfashion. This does not belong in the bill at this time.\n  I make a point of order that the amendment is nongermane under \nsection 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I move to waive that section of the \nCongressional Budget Act. Also, I note that many of the people who \nvoted against this amendment in the Finance Committee will be voting \nfor it today.\n  Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I \nmove to waive the applicable sections of that act for the consideration \nof this amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 75, nays 25, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 165 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--75\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--25\n\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 611\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, my understanding is the next amendment is \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this bill increases the child tax credit \nfrom $600 to $1,000 effective back at the beginning of this year.\n  My amendment simply takes it back another year to the beginning of \n2002. This is an efficient way of targeting money to those who are most \nlikely to use it to give stimulus to the economy.\n  I offset the additional cost by delaying part of the final reduction \nin the top marginal rate for a year and a half. This asks the top 1 \npercent, actually less than 1 percent of the taxpayers, to take part of \ntheir reduction somewhat later. It gives a benefit to 27 million \nAmerican families by asking less than a million American families to \nwait for the final part of their additional tax reduction for a year \nand a half.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6429-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6429-S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                 Senate\n\n    JOBS AND GROWTH TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendment includes an acceleration for low-income \nfamilies paid for by tax increases on small business owners. We need to \nbalance incentives for spending and investments. We have a correct \nbalance in this bill. This amendment breaks this balance.\n  There also would be a budget point of order, and I make that, that \nthe amendment increases spending and if adopted would cause the \nunderlying bill to exceed the committee section 302(a) allocations. \nTherefore, a point of order ought to rise against it pursuant to \nsection 302(f).\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in this debate about creating jobs, we \nhave a clear choice. The Republican bill, according to virtually all \neconomic analyses, doesn't create jobs until the year 2004. What few \njobs it does create this year are vastly outdone by the bill we have \nbefore us now. This bill creates 1 million jobs this year.\n  If this bill is about fiscal responsibility, we have a choice. The \nRepublican bill will use $422 billion of Social Security trust funds. \nOur legislation has been scored at $152 billion. There is a dramatic \ndifference between this bill and our bill when it comes to fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  We are talking about providing meaningful help to the vast majority \nof American taxpayers who need help now, who can be spurred with \neconomic incentive. This bill does it by providing a wage credit of \n$300 per person. A family of four would be entitled to $1,600 when the \nchild tax credit and marriage penalty provisions are added.\n  There is a clear choice. This bill is fiscally responsible. This bill \nprovides the kind of broad-based relief we want. This bill provides the \nkind of jobs this country so badly needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 1 minute does not give justice to saying \nwhat is wrong with this amendment, so I will just give two or three \npoints.\n  First, in regard to the marriage penalty relief, it provides for \nacceleration of the standard deduction of married couples but doesn't \ndo anything regarding the expansion of the 15-percent individual income \ntax bracket. And that is a major part of marriage penalty relief. It \ndoesn't help hard-working, middle-class families the way it should.\n  Second, in regard to the child tax credit, this proposal only \nincreases the child tax credit to $700 in 2003 and $800 in 2004. The \nmark accelerates it to the full $1,000 in 2003.\n  Again, for real relief for working families, the wage credit is a key \ncomponent of this proposal.\n  This would send $300 checks to anyone, regardless of whether they \npaid any income tax, and even if they didn't file an income tax return.\n  There is a point of order on this amendment. I raise that point of \norder: That it increases mandatory spending and, if agreed to, it would \ncause the underlying bill to exceed the committee's section 302(a) \nallocation. Therefore, a point of order lies against the amendment \npursuant to 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthat act and budget resolution for consideration of the pending \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 167 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I salute the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from Iowa and their colleagues for their resolve in making the \nHouse legislation into a responsible bill.\n  My amendment would make it a better bill. It would take the money \nthat would go to millionaire taxpayers and give it, instead, to middle-\nincome taxpayers. We do so by tripling the amount of income that is \ntaxed at the 10-percent rate.\n  We keep the committee's increases in the child tax credit, its \nelimination of the marriage penalty and the alternative minimum tax, \nand its offsets would extend unemployment benefits for those who have \ncurrently run through them. It would also freeze the top rate at its \npresent level.\n  In my amendment, a family of four with an income of $40,000 a year \nwould receive a $2,232 tax cut in 2003, which is more than double the \namount in the committee bill. A single taxpayer with an annual income \nof $40,000 would receive a $600 tax cut compared with $282 under the \ntax bill. And that is with the same cost--$350 billion--over 10 years, \nwith tax relief evenly distributed and a much better economic stimulus.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, once again, we have a substitute that \nwould basically eliminate all the growth we have in our growth package. \nWe have a well-balanced package before us between short-term \ninvestment, long-term investment, between consumer spending and \ninvestment.\n  This amendment is not about investment; it is all about spending.\n  I hope we will defeat the amendment. This language happens to not be \ngermane to the measure now before us. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. On behalf of the Senator from Minnesota, pursuant to \nsection 904 of the Congressional Budget Act, I move to waive the \napplicable sections of that act, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of May 14, 2003 under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my amendment is the family caregiver \nrelief amendment. It gives help to those who practice self-help. It \nwill provide tax relief for family caregivers who face the crushing \nconsequence of caring for a chronically ill family member.\n  Some of our families are facing extraordinary challenges, such as \ncaring for a loved one with special needs, a child with autism or \ncerebral palsy, a parent with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, or a spouse \nwith multiple sclerosis. I want to give help to those families who are \npracticing family responsibility.\n  My amendment would provide a tax credit up to $5,000 for family \ncaregivers. This tax credit would help people pay for prescription \ndrugs, home health care, specialized daycare, and respite care. One in \nfive Americans has a multiple chronic condition requiring some type of \nmedical intervention. That means over 26 million people were supported \nby many organizations.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for my family caregiver relief tax \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, once again, albeit good intentions on \nthe part of people offering these amendments, what they are doing in \nthe process of offering their very favorable new program--one on which \nI have legislation, in fact--they are destroying the growth in our \ngrowth package by taking money from the growth portions and the \ninvestment portions of our bill to do other good things.\n  Right now, we are concerned about the economy. We have a balanced \nbill and want to keep it balanced. We don't want to destroy portions of \nour bill to create a new program. However, the Senator knows I am very \ninterested in long-term care, and I hope she will work with me and the \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Graham, in the hopes that she can join us in \nadvancing long-term care insurance for senior citizens but doing it in \na context that doesn't destroy other very important pieces of \nlegislation.\n  This language is not germane to the measure before us. Therefore, I \nraise a point of order under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the consideration of the pending amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Under the agreed framework of this legislation, the tax \nreduction part of the growth package, those tax reductions will \nterminate in 2012. As an attempt to build the kind of growth package \nthis Congress wanted to do, I believe a majority wants to do, we have \nadded some tax increases. Those tax increases are permanent. In order \nnot to affect the agreement and impact the budget in any way, I have \nproposed that those tax increases be terminated on 12-31-2015. It would \nhave absolutely no budgetary impact in any way.\n  So I believe we made an agreement to bring this package together. The \ntax growth package will terminate in 2012.

Mr. President, this amendment sunsets offsets not in this \ndecade but in the next decade. Many of the provisions in this bill \nshould be permanent; that is, corporate inversion legislation, \nshelters, provisions that should change the law. That is good public \npolicy. Not all of the provisions in this bill are offsets just to make \nthe budget numbers work. Rather, they are provisions which make good \npublic policy and should continue.\n  Also, it violates the Byrd rule because it raises an extraneous \nmatter in a reconciliation bill.\n  I make a point of order that the amendment violates section 313 of \nthe Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If the Senator will yield, this is probably the most \nimportant amendment of the night. I ask consent each side be allowed 2 \nminutes instead of the customary 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The amendment I sent to the desk on behalf of myself, \nSenator Miller from Georgia, Senator Kyl, Senator Lott, Senator Frist, \nand others, would do several things. It would make this dividend \npackage and make the growth package a lot more robust. It would \naccomplish the President's objective of eliminating double taxation of \ndividends. We tax dividends higher than any other country in the world. \nWe are tied with Japan. We would eliminate double taxing.\n  We would have 50-percent exclusion on dividend income in 2003, and \n100 percent in 2004, 2005, and 2006. This would have a very \nsignificant, positive impact on the stock market, on individuals' \n401(k)'s, on people who have teacher retirement accounts, and others. \nIt would help them dramatically. Some estimate 5 percent, some say 10 \npercent, some say 20 percent, some say more. I encourage my colleagues \nto vote for it.\n  We also would adopt the House provision dealing with expensing. This \nis a much more accelerated and more upfront accelerated expensing \nprovision than what we had in the Senate bill and certainly over \npresent law. Current law is $25,000. This goes to $100,000 of expensing \nand would last for 5 years. The Senate bill we have before the Senate \nhas $75,000 and goes over 10 years. This encourages a lot of companies, \nand bigger companies, companies that have an annual investment of \n$400,000, would get to be able to deduct in 1 year $100,000. It is more \nrobust in the expensing provision and more robust in the dividend \nprovision.\n  It would encourage investment; it would encourage jobs; it would \nencourage growth. I encourage our colleagues to vote in favor of this \namendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, let me read a quote of American Enterprise \nInstitute, conservative economist, commenting on this amendment:\n\n       Clearly, this proposal is one of the most patently absurd \n     tax policies ever proposed.\n\n  That is AEI, Republican economist, commenting on this amendment. Why \nsay that? First, this amendment goes far beyond any other attempt to \neliminate double taxation of dividends. What is the effect of this \namendment? The effect of this amendment is in many cases to not only \neliminate double taxation of dividends but to also eliminate single \ntaxation of dividends.\n  In many cases, as a consequence of the way this amendment is \nwritten--which we saw just for the first time half an hour ago--is to \nsay there is no taxation on many dividends offered by corporation \nshareholders, not the shareholder paying any tax, and not the \ncorporation paying any tax.\n  Second, who subsidizes this if that is the nontaxation of dividends \nunder this proposal? Americans are subsidizing this. Who? Americans \ntoday who otherwise would receive the relief under the marriage penalty \ncontained in this bill are going to be subsidizing and paying for, in \neffect, these tax-free dividends. That is because that is the pay-for \nin this bill.\n  In addition, this bill increases the budget deficit so our children \nwill be paying for many of those tax-free dividends contained in this \nbill.\n  Next, this is a huge yo-yo tax provision. Now you see it, now you \ndon't; 50 percent 1 year, 100 percent the next year, 100 percent \nanother year, then zero. Tell me if any corporation will be able to \nplan on whether or not to pay dividends with a tax policy like that. \nClearly, they will wait for the 100 percent and they will not know if \nit will be continued in law.\n  This is absurd and irresponsible to enact tax legislation like this. \nI strongly urge Senators to consider what they are doing tonight if \nthey support this amendment. This is an outrage.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis amendment. It is much more robust than in the underlying bill, and \nit is what the President wants. I think it will grow the economy and \ncreate jobs. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike Sec. 350.\n       On page 19, line 11, strike ``100'' and insert ``65.''\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senate will be in order, please.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, most people think we are debating a tax \ncut bill. There are some tax cuts in the bill. But there is also a $35 \nbillion tax increase--a $35 billion tax increase on schoolteachers who \nwork overseas, ministers who work overseas, Catholic relief workers, \ncharitable workers, and technicians who work overseas, earn income \noverseas, and pay taxes overseas. We are now changing the law to \neliminate the exemption they have always traditionally enjoyed. They do \nnot live in this country and don't get the benefits of living in this \ncountry, and therefore we give them a tax exemption. That has been \neliminated in the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma. It is a $35 billion tax increase to pay for the dividend \nprovisions of the legislation.\n  We just voted, incidentally, for overseas corporations, if they bring \ntheir profits back to the United States--guess what we did. We voted to \ntax them at 5 percent for 1 year. But if an individual works overseas \nand makes money, we are now saying that your tax exemption has been \neliminated; you will pay taxes in the country where you are getting a \ncredit against your income tax, but you will pay taxes as if you \nlived--resided--and worked in United States. It is a $35 billion tax \nincrease on people making $50,000 to $75,000 a year in order to pay for \na dividend tax cut from which most people are not going to benefit.\n  My amendment is paid for by reducing 3 years of the dividend \nreduction from 100 percent down to 65 percent elimination of the \ndividend tax. That is substantially more than we passed in the Finance \nCommittee. You still get a major dividend tax cut, much larger than the \nFinance Committee passed and eliminate the taxes on individuals working \noverseas--middle-income and moderate-income people. We are robbing \nPeter to pay for Paul. Unfortunately, we are taking it from middle-\nincome people.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let us set the record straight. This is \nnot a tax increase. This is a loophole closure for people who live \noverseas. Taxpayer dollars should, in fact, not be subsidizing an \nemployer's cost of sending an employee overseas. This subsidy equals \n$98,000 of taxes for each employee each year. Repeal will not cause \npeople to be double taxed because of the fact that the foreign tax \ncredit can be used against American taxes owed. A vote for the Breaux \namendment will in fact gut the dividend exclusion we just passed.\n  The bottom line is, let us weight the advantage of the dividend \nexclusion of the 234 million people who will benefit from that against \nonly 358,000 people who benefit from section 911.\n  I think it is pretty clear that this amendment should be defeated. It \nwill destroy the well-balanced provisions we put together between \ninvestment and consumer spending, a well-balanced bill between helping \ninvestment and helping people of lower income with the refundables that \nare in the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. All time has expired. The question is on agreeing \nto the amendment.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 667.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require a parent who is chronically delinquent in child \nsupport to include the amount of the unpaid obligation in gross income)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Inclusion in Income of Amount of Unpaid Child \n     Support.--Section 108 (relating to discharge of indebtedness \n     income) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(h) Unpaid Child Support.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For purposes of this chapter, any unpaid \n     child support of a delinquent debtor for any taxable year \n     shall be treated as amounts includible in gross income of the \n     delinquent debtor for the taxable year.\n       ``(2) Definitions.--For the purposes of this subsection--\n       ``(A) Child support.--The term `child support' means--\n       ``(i) any periodic payment of a fixed amount, or\n       ``(ii) any payment of a medical expense, education expense, \n     insurance premium, or other similar item,\n\n     which is required to be paid to a custodial parent by an \n     individual under a support instrument for the support of any \n     qualifying child of such individual. `Child support' does not \n     include any amount which is described in section 408(a)(3) of \n     the Social Security Act and which has been assigned to a \n     State.\n       ``(B) Custodial parent.--The term `custodial parent' means \n     an individual who is entitled to receive child support and \n     who has registered with the appropriate State office of child \n     support enforcement charged with implementing section 454 of \n     the Social Security Act.\n       ``(C) Delinquent debtor.--The term `delinquent debtor' \n     means a taxpayer who owes unpaid child support to a custodial \n     parent.\n       ``(D) Qualifying child.--The term `qualifying child' means \n     a child of a custodial parent with respect to whom a \n     dependent deduction is allowable under section 151 for the \n     taxable year (or would be so allowable but for paragraph (2) \n     or (4) of section 152(e)).\n       ``(E) Support instrument.--The term `support instrument' \n     means--\n       ``(i) a decree of divorce or separate maintenance or a \n     written instrument incident to such a decree,\n       ``(ii) a written separation agreement, or\n       ``(iii) a decree (not described in clause (i)) of a court \n     or administrative agency requiring a parent to make payments \n     for the support or maintenance of 1 or more children of such \n     parent.\n       ``(F) Unpaid child support.--The term `unpaid child \n     support' means child support that is payable for months \n     during a custodial parent's taxable year and unpaid as of the \n     last day of such taxable year, provided that such unpaid \n     amount as of such day equals or exceeds one-half of the total \n     amount of child support due to the custodial parent for such \n     year.\n       ``(3) Coordination with other laws.--Amounts treated as \n     income by paragraph (1) shall not be treated as income by \n     reason of paragraph (1) for the purposes of any provision of \n     law which is not an internal revenue law.''.\n       (b) Effective Date; Implementation.--The amendments made by \n     is section shall apply to taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2002. The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     publish Form 1099-CS (or such other form that may be \n     prescribed to comply with the amendment made by subsection \n     (b)(1)) and regulations, if any, that may be deemed necessary \n     to carry out the purposes of this Act, not later than 90 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will only take about a minute of the \nSenate's time to explain this amendment, which I am very happy has been \ncleared on both sides.\n  This amendment is based on a bill that Congressman Chris Cox and I \nwrote, and it is a money raiser. It actually raises, over the 10-year \nperiod, in excess of $400 million.\n  What it does, in essence, is say this: If a parent who is ordered to \npay child support fails to pay that child support, and fails to pay at \nleast 50 percent of that child support then that delinquent parent \nwould have to add the amount that he or she was supposed to pay to \nchild support to his or her gross income.\n  Each year, nearly 60 percent of the 20 million children who are owed \nchild support receive less than the amount they are due, and more than \n30 percent receive no payment at all.\n  This amendment will bring much-needed relief to the millions of \nfamilies who are not receiving the child support they desperately need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  I am very pleased this amendment has been signed off on by both \nsides.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the majority leader addresses the \nSenate, could we dispose of the Boxer amendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Just by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If time is yielded back in opposition, the \nSenate can dispose of the amendment.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We have no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 667) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have had tremendous progress. It has \nbeen a long day. Most of us have been actually here on the floor for \nalmost 11 hours. We have made great progress. We have completed 25 \nvotes. Yet in conversations with the assistant Democratic leader, it is \nvery clear we have a number of other amendments that people have \nexpressed an interest in. We have dealt with most of the major \namendments that have been discussed over today and yesterday and the \nday before. I know there are a number of other amendments people would \nlike to talk about, would like to vote on, but I encourage Senators, \ndue to the late hour, that we try to get that list as small as \npossible, and that Members talk to the chairman and ranking member and \ncondense that list as narrowly as possible.\n  So our colleagues will know, as I said 2 days ago, and as I said \nyesterday, and as I said today, we are going to finish this bill \ntonight, and we are going to go to the global HIV/AIDS bill with the \nintention of completing that tonight. And that means if it is 10 \no'clock, if it is 11 o'clock, if it is 12 o'clock, if it is 1 o'clock, \nwe will be having rollcall votes.\n  Thus, I encourage everybody to focus, to use common sense, to be \nreasonable in terms of the amendments they put on the floor at this \njuncture. But I repeat, we will continue having rollcall votes until we \nfinish the jobs and growth bill, as well as the global HIV/AIDS bill, \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Democratic leader has asked me to \nannounce that he has joined with the majority leader in recognizing \nthis bill needs to be finished tonight. As the majority leader has \nindicated, following this bill, we are going to complete the global \nHIV/AIDS bill, which has a number of amendments we will have to dispose \nof.\n  Right now I have here about 14 amendments. There are a couple on the \nother side. The rest of them are on this side. We know how strongly \npeople feel about their issues, but I would like to say Senator Dorgan \nand I have been waiting for a long time to offer an amendment on \nconcurrent receipts. We are not going to offer that amendment tonight \nbecause we have an opportunity to offer that at a later time on another \npiece of legislation. When the defense bill comes through here--both \nthe defense bill and the defense appropriations bill--we can do that. I \nknow I will find another place at a later time to offer the notch-baby \namendment.\n  I feel strongly about both of these issues, but I had one amendment \nyesterday. It was a good debate. I would hope that people who have the \nopportunity to offer an amendment--and we\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\nrecognize that--would look to see if we have debated these issues \nbefore. We have voted on some issues several times already, and if they \nmust offer an amendment, maybe we could dispose of it by voice vote. \nAlthough I have not agreed with most of the votes that have occurred \nhere in the last couple days, I have a pretty good indication how the \nvotes are going to turn out tonight on the rest of these amendments. So \nI would rather that we were not finishing the bill tonight. The two \nleaders have said we are finishing the bill tonight or in the morning--\nand that does not mean we are going to have a break before morning \ncomes.\n  So I hope everyone will work with us and do what they can to get rid \nof these amendments in a way that they feel is appropriate.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think sometimes discretion is the better \npart of valor. We have been on this bill for 2 full days. I have \namendments which I would like to offer. I am willing to forego those \namendments.\n  As the Senator from Nevada said, there are about 14 amendments left. \nThat means in 5 more hours we will be here on this bill, before we get \nto the global HIV/AIDS bill.\n  I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle--and I guess I \nparticularly appeal to Senators on my side of the aisle--that there are \na couple here that probably could and should be voted on but some of \nthem probably not.\n  There will be another day. There will be another tax bill. There will \nbe other opportunities for us to offer amendments. I think, frankly, \nafter a couple, three or four or five more amendments, it is about time \nto wrap up this bill. We know what the conclusion is going to be on all \nthe amendments. As the Senator has said, some of the subjects have \nalready been addressed. Some have not, but some of the subjects already \nhave been addressed. I have been working with the chairman of the \ncommittee throughout this bill to try to work out a good process. My \njudgment is that we should whittle down the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have we already agreed on a list or are people still \nable to add to it?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The answer to the question is, we have not agreed to a \nlist. Technically people are still able to add.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you have a list?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We do have a list. We have 14--12 on our side at least.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that no other amendments be in \norder this evening on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think in fairness to everyone I should \nread what the amendments are. We have a Kennedy amendment on drugs; \nGregg amendment on pension interest rates; Dodd amendment on higher \neducation; Dorgan amendment on debt collection, with Senator Byrd; \nDorgan, to protect Social Security, on which he will take a voice vote; \nHollings has an amendment on striking out the tax cuts--he will take a \nvoice vote on that; Senator Levin, on inversion; Senator Rockefeller, \nschool construction; Senator Durbin, on health coverage for caregivers; \nSenator Kennedy, on No Child Left Behind; in addition to the managers' \namendment; and those on the previous list which we have three on the \nprevious list; and an Edwards amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on our side we have just three, a Gregg \namendment, and possibly two Santorum amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that there be no further \namendments in order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the Santorum amendments, we would like to \nknow the subject of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, am I on the list? I was not read off.\n  Mr. REID. You are on the previous list.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from New Mexico making a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object, have Members been given \nnotice that a motion of this sort was to be offered? Have Members been \ngiven notice that a motion of this sort is to be offered?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You have had it in mind most of the day. But, no, they \nhave not. I am just kidding the Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might respond, the answer is no, not formally. I \nsuggest that after about 15 minutes or so, we put the request again. At \nleast we can go through a couple amendments now, then renew the request \nin 15 minutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has made a \nrequest. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Harkin wishes to be added to that \nlist. I would add to the request of the Senator from New Mexico, that \nwe handle second-degree amendments as we have handled amendments on the \nbill up to this point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, I have an amendment that \nI believe is technical, although important, with no revenues. It was \napproved by this side and is awaiting approval by the other side. I ask \nthat it be added to the list, and I don't think we will have to debate \nit. But I can't forgo the opportunity to bring it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. While we are coming to an agreement, could we move \nforward. Senator Gregg is prepared with his amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I object to the request. I think it \nshould be worked out with the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I withdraw the request.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So everyone can have a fair opportunity.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield to Senator Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am not going to call up the amendment. I \nwill withdraw the amendment. I do wish to speak for 1 minute on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. My amendment addresses a problem that faces a large number \nof our largest employers in the country and that's the funding of \npension plans. Because there is no longer a 30-year Treasury bond \nissued in this country, the values of pension plans are being \nartificially underaccounted. As a result, many companies are going to \nhave to take money which they might spend on employees or money they \nmight spend on plants and equipment and put it into funding in order to \ncover what is an artificial shortfall.\n\n  This amendment is supported by the AFL-CIO and by the business \ncommunity. This includes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business \nRoundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers, the ERISA \nIndustry Committee, the American Benefits Council, the American Society \nof Pension Actuaries, the Committee on Investment of Employment Benefit \nAssets, and Financial Executives International, and other major \nbusiness groups.\n  My amendment is an attempt to address what we all understand to be a \nproblem that is created through the fact that there is no longer a 30-\nyear Treasury bond being issued. The amendment extends a fix put in \nplace last year and uses a composite of high quality corporate bonds as \na new standard during that extension period. Then the amendment sets up \na commission, the purpose of which is to come up with a new standard \nfor the purpose of valuing what the pension funding mechanism should be \nand how much should be put into pension plans.\n  So it is an appropriate action. The problem is it has to be taken \nbefore the middle of the summer.\n  I will withdraw the amendment at this time in order to move the \nprocess along.\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the next amendment in order \nbe the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 545\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I call up amendment 545 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 545.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To eliminate the dividend and upper bracket tax cuts, which \n    primarily benefit the wealthy, to provide the additional funds \nnecessary for an adequate medicare prescription drug benefit, including \n assuring that the benefit is comprehensive, with no gaps or excessive \ncost-sharing, covers all medicare beneficiaries, provides special help \n  for beneficiaries with low income, and does not undermine employer \n                          retirement coverage)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. REPEAL OF PARTIAL EXCLUSION OF DIVIDENDS AND \n                   ELIMINATION OF ACCELERATION OF TOP RATE \n                   REDUCTION IN INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX RATES.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Partial Exclusion of Dividends.--Section 201 \n     of this Act, and the amendments made by such section, are \n     repealed.\n       (b) Elimination of Acceleration of Top Rate Reduction In \n     Individual Income Tax Rates.--Notwithstanding the amendment \n     made by section 102(a) of this Act, in lieu of the percent \n     specified in the last column of the table in paragraph (2) of \n     section 1(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended \n     by such section 102(a), for taxable years beginning during \n     calendar years 2003, 2004, and 2005, the following \n     percentages shall be substituted for such years:\n       (1) For 2003, 38.6%.\n       (2) For 2004 and 2005, 37.6%.\n       (c) Effective Date.--Subsection (a) and (b) shall take \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment substitutes the funds that \nhave been allocated for the dividend tax, the $120 million, plus the \naccelerated funds that come from accelerating the lowering of the upper \ntax rates, which is another $30 billion, which is $150 billion, and \nadds that into a prescription drug benefit program. That is effectively \nwhat this amendment does.\n  Effectively we are making judgments. We are making decisions and \npriorities this evening. It does seem to me that there is a greater \nneed to make sure we are going to have a solid prescription drug \nprogram that is going to be the third leg of the Medicare system. The \nMedicare system provides for hospitalization and physician services. It \ndoes not provide for a prescription drug program. This will ensure that \nwe have adequate funds for a prescription drug program that hopefully \nwe will enact by the end of this session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time in opposition? The Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on behalf of the chairman, I oppose this \namendment. It is not germane to the underlying bill. It takes money \naway from our job creation package, and it is premature. The amendment \nis premature because the Finance Committee will shortly take up a \ncomprehensive Medicare prescription drug and Medicare improvement bill. \nWe are on target to do so before the Fourth of July recess. The \ncommittee has been working to reach out to both Democrats and \nRepublicans on a policy that makes sense and can work, and most of all \nwe are here to help seniors get access to prescription drugs. The \nbudget resolution contains the reserve fund of $400 billion that we \nintend to spend in a bipartisan way on behalf of seniors who have \nlacked affordable drug coverage for too long.\n  The President deserves credit for kick-starting the debate on \nMedicare this year by dedicating $400 billion in this budget to make \nMedicare stronger. We have come a long way toward accomplishing that \ngoal. The chairman continues to work with colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this amendment is not germane and I raise \na point of order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry: Since the amendment only changes \nthe figures, is it not then germane? Since it only adjusts and changes \nthe figures that are in the underlying bill, therefore is it not \ngermane?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I raise the point that it is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If it deals with figures that are not \ncontained in the underlying bill, it would not be germane.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. They are included. They are included, Mr. President. \nThey are changing the figures which are in the underlying bill and, \ntherefore, this amendment is germane just for these provisions in the \nbill.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, after looking at it, it is our opinion \nthat these numbers have nothing to do with it. It just guts the numbers \nand, therefore, it is not germane, and we raise the point of order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is germane. It is a simple striking. \nIt conforms to the rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. THOMAS. It has nothing to do with prescription drugs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are talking about relevancy of the amendment, and it \ndoes just strike the relevant provisions. It is germane. The text of \nthe amendment does not speak to prescription drugs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the opinion of the Chair that the \namendment does address numbers which are addressed in the underlying \nbill and, therefore, the amendment is germane.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, point of order, I make a point of order, \nthere is obviously a quorum present. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has no authority to note the \npresence of a quorum. The quorum call is appropriate. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we believe it is legitimate and we want to \nmove forward. All this does is do away with dividends. Therefore, we \nare agreeable to having an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 173 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\n\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 545) was rejected.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we now \nproceed to the amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 572\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to improve \naccess to higher education for middle- and low-income families by \nexpanding the HOPE and lifetime learning tax credits and Pell grants, \nas well as deficit reduction. This is done by eliminating the 10 \npercent dividend exclusion for amounts greater than $500 and \neliminating acceleration of the top tax rate reduction.\n  I have outlined in the amendment the purpose of this proposal. I do \nnot think any of us would disagree that the long-term economic strength \nof our Nation will depend upon whether or not the next generation \nreceives the higher education necessary to provide our Nation with the \nbenefits of learning so the country can grow.\n  I am simply asking the question, as many Americans are, as we are \ntalking about reducing Pell grants and doing nothing to expand the HOPE \nand lifetime learning proposals which are directly designed to assist \nmiddle-income families, can we not, on an evening when we are about to \nadopt a massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, set aside some of \nthese funds to adequately provide for educational opportunities for \npeople who would not otherwise be able to afford them? That is the \npurpose of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator please send his amendment to \nthe desk?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is amendment No. 572. It is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 572.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the reading of the \namendment is dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To improve access to higher education for middle income \nfamilies by making resources available to expand the Hope and Lifetime \n Learning Scholarship Credits and for lower-income families by making \nresources available to increase the maximum Pell Grant to $4500 and to \n  provide an equal amount for deficit reduction by eliminating the 10 \n percent dividend tax exclusion for amounts above $500 and eliminating \n      acceleration of the 38.6 percent income tax rate reduction)\n\n       On page 19, line 9, strike ``sum of'' and all that follows \n     through line 15 and insert ``$500 ($250 in the case of a \n     married individual filing a separate return).''.\n       On page 18, after line 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 109. ELIMINATION OF ACCELERATION OF TOP RATE REDUCTION \n                   IN INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX.\n\n       Notwithstanding the amendment made by section 102(a) of \n     this Act, in lieu of the percent specified in the last column \n     of the table in paragraph (2) of section 1(i) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by such section 102(a), for \n     taxable years beginning during calendar years 2003, 2004, and \n     2005, the following percentages shall be substituted for such \n     years:\n       (1) For 2003, 38.6%\n       (2) For 2004 and 2005, 37.6%\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this amendment, like the last one, ought \nto be verified and categorized as violating the truth-in-advertising \nlaw. This amendment has nothing to do with education. It does not \nmention education other than in the title. All it does is eliminate the \ntop rate reduction which hurts small businesses. It cuts the dividend \nprovision. This is an amendment that will actually increase taxes. It \nhas nothing to do with education, and it should be defeated.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, the purpose I have outlined in the \namendment says what it is for. Some may want to interpret it otherwise, \nbut this is a vote on whether we value higher education enough to \nensure that all Americans have access to it.\n  Mr. THOMAS. If we are going to debate this, it says nothing about it \nin the text of the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. The purpose states it clearly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does anyone seek the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 572. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 174 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Shelby\n       \n  The amendment (No. 572) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside so we can consider the Hollings amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 607\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I call up my amendment 607 on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Chafee and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for himself \n     and Mr. Chafee, proposes an amendment numbered 607.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike titles I, II, IV, and V.\n       Strike section 601 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 601. SUNSET\n\n       Except as otherwise provided, the provisions of, and \n     amendments made, by section 362 shall not apply to taxable \n     years, beginning after December 31, 2012, and the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 shall be applied and administered to \n     such years as if such amendments had never been enacted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader \nadmonished that we act with common sense and be reasonable. So in \nacting with common sense and being reasonable, this amendment \neliminates the tax cuts from this measure because the country cannot \nafford it.\n  At the very moment we are running at a $500 billion or more deficit--\nwhich is a $500 billion stimulus, incidentally--we have just adopted a \nbudget that calls for a $600 billion deficit stimulus each year for 10 \nyears. What we are really engaged in is a pollster charade whereby the \npollsters admonish tax cuts have to be voted for in order to get \nreelected.\n  This country cannot afford the tax cuts, and it is time we looked \nupon the\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\nneeds of the country rather than the needs of the campaign.\n  I yield what time I have remaining to my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Chafee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we are debating a bill called the Jobs and \nGrowth Tax Relief Reconciliation Tax Act of 2003. Two years ago this \nsame month, we debated and passed a bill called the Economic Growth and \nTax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. Whatever these bills are called, \nthey add to the deficits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. There is not an elected official in the United States who \ndoes not want to cut taxes. The good ones only do it responsibly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I at least want to compliment the sponsors of \nthis amendment for not having a gimmicky amendment. This is a flat out, \nstraight assault. It simply abolishes all the tax cuts in the bill. So \nI do compliment my colleagues on their very straightforward approach. \nHowever, that makes the vote pretty easy. I urge my colleagues to vote \nthis amendment down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 607) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside so we can consider the Dorgan amendment that \nSenator Reid of Nevada will call up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 668\n\n  Mr. REID. I call up amendment No. 668.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Dorgan, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 668.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. ENSURING DEFICIT REDUCTION.\n\n       (a) Trigger.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the provisions as described in subsection (b) shall take \n     effect only as provided in subsection (c).\n       (b) Provision Described.--A provision of this Act described \n     in this subsection is--\n       (1) a provision of this Act that accelerates the scheduled \n     phase down of the top tax rate of 38.6 percent to 37.6 \n     percent in 2004 and to 35 percent in 2006; and\n       (2) a provision of this Act that provides a 50 percent \n     dividends exclusion between December 31, 2002, and December \n     31, 2003, and a 100 percent dividends exclusion between \n     December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2006.\n       (c) Delay.--\n       (1) In general.--Each year when the final monthly Treasury \n     report for the most recently ended fiscal year is released, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury shall certify whether the on-\n     budget deficit exceeds $300,000,000,000 for such year.\n       (2) Effective date.--The provisions described in subsection \n     (b) shall become effective on January 1 in the calendar year \n     following the issuance of the final Treasury report only if \n     the Secretary has determined that the on-budget deficit is \n     $300,000,000,000 or less for the recently ended fiscal year.\n       (d) Discretionary Spending Limitation.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, in any fiscal year subject to the delay provisions of \n     subsection (c)--\n       (A) the amount of budget authority for discretionary \n     spending for Federal agency administrative overhead expenses \n     shall be limited to the level in the preceding fiscal year \n     minus 5 percent; and\n       (B) with respect to a second or subsequent consecutive \n     fiscal year subject to this subsection, the amount of budget \n     authority for discretionary spending for Federal agency \n     administrative overhead expenses shall be limited to the \n     level in the preceding fiscal year.\n       (2) Definition.--In this subsection, the term \n     ``administrative overhead expenses'' mean costs of resources \n     that are jointly or commonly used to produce 2 or more types \n     of outputs but are not specifically identifiable with any of \n     the outputs. Administrative overhead expenses include general \n     administrative services, general research and technology \n     support, rent, employee health and recreation facilities, and \n     operating and maintenance costs for buildings, equipment, and \n     utilities.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment would cut Federal agency \nadministrative overhead expenses by 5 percent and delay the \nacceleration of the top income tax rate reduction and availability of \nthe dividend tax exclusion relief in the reconciliation bill if the \nSecretary of the Treasury certifies that the on-budget deficit, \nexcluding Social Security surpluses, for the most recently ended fiscal \nyear is over $300 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there anyone in opposition to the \namendment?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is another amendment where we \nessentially voted on this concept several times, of taking money from \nthe reduction in the tax package, in this case the top rate. Again, I \nwould urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 668) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside so we can consider the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 \nminute to introduce his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 669\n\n  (Purpose: To provide health care coverage for qualified caregivers)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the clerk to read amendment No. 669.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 669.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we live in a nation that pays people more \nto watch its pets than it pays to watch its parents in nursing homes. \nWe live in a nation where we pay more to parking lot attendants than to \nthose who attend our children in daycare centers. These underpaid \ncaregivers of America have no health insurance.\n  This amendment provides resources to States to provide health \ninsurance to caregivers, such as child care workers, personal \nattendants for the disabled, nursing home aides, and home health aides.\n  This amendment will give us a choice between helping a limited group \nof wealthy people or helping those who care for our children, our \ngrandchildren, our parents, and our grandparents.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, again, this is another amendment which \neliminates the reduction of the top income tax bracket acceleration. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 669) was rejected.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 618, as Modified\n\n(Purpose: To expand the incentives for the construction and renovation \n                           of public schools)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask consent that the pending amendments \nbe set aside so we can consider the Rockefeller amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 618, \nwhich is the modification at the desk. Senators Reid, Mikulski, \nBingaman, and others are cosponsoring it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] for \n     himself and Mr. Daschle,\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Pryor, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reid, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Levin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 618, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in Today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The average public school in this country is 42 \nyears old. Last week, I visited two in West Virginia; one was 88 years \nold, and the other was built the year the Titanic was sunk. It is a \ndisgrace.\n  This amendment will provide $25 billion which, because of interest-\nfree payments, would actually only cost the Federal Treasury less than \n$8 billion over a period of 2 years and create 500,000 jobs, build new \nschools, and create opportunities for our young people.\n  I hope my amendment will pass. I ask for a vote on my amendment. A \nvoice vote is acceptable.\n  Mr. KYL. For my colleagues, this is another amendment which takes tax \ncuts from the tax cut bill; therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from West Virginia ask for \nthe yeas and nays?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 618), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be \nset aside so the Senator from Michigan and I can enter into a \ncolloquy----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Concerning the amendment he might otherwise have.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Montana. Some \nU.S. companies have opened sham offices in Bermuda and pretended that \nthe sham offices are the parent corporation, and thereby avoided taxes \nwhich the rest of us have to pay and which, indeed, their competitors \nhave to pay. It is called inversion. It is not only a sham, it is \nshameful.\n  This bill takes some steps in addressing future inversions, but in \nterms of people who have already inverted, there is a lot of additional \nwork to do. The ill-gotten gains which some companies have obtained \nthrough these sham moves to Bermuda should be confronted. It is not \nonly unpatriotic, it is costing American taxpayers about $2 billion \nover the next 10 years.\n  My amendment would have addressed the future tax avoidance of people \nwho have already gone through these sham moves to Bermuda.\n  Rather than offering the amendment at this time--it is a somewhat \ncomplicated amendment--I ask the Senator from Montana whether he might \nbe able to support an effort along this line in the future.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan raised a very \ngood point. There are provisions in the bill which address corporations \nthat invert--that is, 100 percent invert--in tax shelters in Bermuda or \nother tax havens. That was shut down in March of this year. The next \ncategory is of companies with 50-percent or 80-percent ownership that \nalso are inverted overseas. The Senator from Michigan makes a very good \npoint that this, too, should be addressed.\n  I will work with the Senator in the committee to address this \nwindfall that these companies get from existing inversions. I will work \nwith the Senator to try to shut that down.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend and I will not be calling up my \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 616\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside to consider the Dayton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I call up amendment numbered 616.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 616.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DAYTON. This amendment would end the phony practice of making tax \ncuts phase in, phase out, appear, and reappear like popups on a \ncomputer screen and say any new tax provision must take full effect 1 \nyear after enactment and remain in effect until changed by a subsequent \nCongress.\n  The revolving sunset makes a mockery of tax policy and of the Senate. \nBusinesses and individual taxpayers cannot make prudent decisions when \nthe Tax Code changes with every new year or new budget resolution.\n\n  This gimmickry is fictional and farcical, and it makes the Senate \nlook foolish and foolhardy. We owe the American people and we owe this \ngreat institution something better than that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. We would all like to accomplish what the distinguished \nSenator proposed, but under the reconciliation procedures and the \nbalanced budget amendment we do have sunsets that we have to contend \nwith. Whether it is 10 years or 5 years or 3 years, it is not possible \nto permanently adopt many of these changes we are considering. It would \nbe nice if we could, but under our rules, obviously, we cannot.\n  Secondly, there are times when it is important to be able to phase a \nprogram in because you cannot accomplish all of the changes within the \nvery short period of time allotted for the first year. For example, the \ndividends proposal we approved earlier this evening falls into that \ncategory.\n  While what the Senator says is laudable, as a practical matter it \ncannot be accomplished.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 616) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 670\n\n (Purpose: To provide a dividend exclusion which eliminates the double \n                    taxation of corporate dividends)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside to consider the Santorum amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] for himself \n     and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, proposes an amendment numbered \n     670.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in Today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I offer this amendment which deals with \nthe issue of variable annuities and how they are dealt with under the \ndividend proposal which disadvantages long-term savings annuities, \nretirement annuities, and as a result puts them in a competitive \ndisadvantage vis-a-vis other savings vehicles. This amendment is \noffered to correct that.\n  My understanding is the amendment as drafted, because it deals with \nvariable annuities, is outside the window of the Byrd rule and outside \nof reconciliation and subject to the Byrd rule.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 670 Withdrawn\n\n  Therefore, I withdraw my amendment, but this is an issue that needs \nto be addressed. We need to encourage this, not disadvantage them. I \nhope the conferees consider this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the next amendment is that of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 603 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have amendment No. 603, which was a\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\nfollow-on to the amendment Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania was \nintending to offer. If we had extended the tax exclusion we are \nproviding here for dividends to annuities as well, this would put small \nbusiness retirement plans at a disadvantage. My amendment was trying to \nensure that that not happen.\n  Since he has chosen to withdraw his amendment, I will not offer this \namendment, No. 603. I withdraw it as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment, without objection, is \nwithdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 662\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we now \nproceed to the Edwards amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from North Carolina \nis recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I call up amendment No. 662.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Edwards], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, and Mr. Graham of South Carolina, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 662.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to close the \n                  ``janitors insurance'' tax loophole)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, this is a simple proposal from Senator \nMcCain, Senator Graham of South Carolina, and myself. What we are \ntrying to do is eliminate one of the worst tax scams in the Tax Code \ntoday. What we have is companies getting billions of dollars in tax \nbreaks for buying life insurance policies on janitors, secretaries, and \nother working people. The companies get billions for this. They are \nalso the beneficiaries of the policies when these working people die. \nSo the janitors themselves, the secretaries themselves, the workers \nthemselves get absolutely nothing--not a dime.\n  Officials in the Reagan administration tried to eliminate this tax \nscam. Officials in the Clinton administration tried to eliminate it. It \nis time for us to bring it to an end.\n  We have specifically excluded key employees from this amendment, so \nthis amendment just eliminates the fraudulent portion of this tax \nbreak. I ask my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me speak in opposition to this amendment. \nThere are some problems, as the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina has pointed out. But this is a very big deal that affects a \nlot of people. It is not something we should be dealing with without \nthe proper debate that should attend it. As a result, in addition to \nthe fact that it is not germane, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nit.\n  I make a point of order that under section 305(b)(2) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, the measure is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act and the \nbudget resolution for purposes of the pending amendment. I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To preserve the value of the low-income housing tax credit)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The low-income housing tax credit is the Nation's \n     primary program for producing affordable rental housing.\n       (2) Each year, the low-income housing tax credit produces \n     over 115,000 affordable apartments.\n       (3) Since Congress created the low-income housing tax \n     credit in 1986, the credit has created 1,500,000 units of \n     affordable housing for about 3,500,000 Americans.\n       (4) Analyses have found that certain approaches to reducing \n     or eliminating the taxation of dividends have the potential \n     to reduce the value of the low-income housing tax credit and \n     so reduce the amount of affordable housing available.\n       (5) As of 2001, over 7,000,000 American renter families (1 \n     in 5) suffer severe housing affordability problems, meaning \n     that the family spends more than half of its income on rent \n     or lives in substandard housing.\n       (6) More than 150,000 apartments in the low-cost rental \n     housing inventory are lost each year due to rent increases, \n     abandonment, and deterioration.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any reduction or elimination of the taxation on \n     dividends should include provisions to preserve the success \n     of the low-income housing tax credit.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I offer this amendment along with Senators \nCorzine, Mikulski, Kerry, and Rockefeller. It is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment.\n  It addresses the potential detrimental effect on the low-income \nhousing tax credit by proposing to reduce or eliminate taxes on \ndividends. If those proposals with respect to dividends are passed, \nthey could provide a disincentive for corporations to invest in the \nlow-income tax credit, which is the major form of support for low-\nincome and moderate-income housing, and rental housing in particular, \nin the United States.\n  I understand this amendment is acceptable to the other side. I urge \nits adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we support the amendment and urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include Senators \nLandrieu and Sarbanes as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 672) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the treatment of net operating loss in calculating \n tax attributes under section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986)\n\n       On page 281, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this \narticle written by David Henry in Business Week magazine printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Why This Tax Loophole for Losers Should End\n\n       Is there no end to the ugly superlatives that fallen \n     telecom giant WorldCom Inc., is amassing? First, its top \n     execs reigned over the greatest alleged accounting fraud in \n     history. Then, the company filed the largest corporate \n     bankruptcy. Now, it is lining up to collect what could be one \n     of the biggest single corporate tax breaks of all time.\n       To the fury of its competitors, WorldCom is angling to \n     share a $2.5 billion benefit from Uncle Sam. How? By \n     exploiting a provision in the Internal Revenue Service code \n     so it can hang onto previous losses of at least $6.6 billion \n     and enjoy years of tax-free earnings. What's more, the ploy \n     would protect new management against any takeover for at \n     least two years. And, WorldCom could use the losses to offset \n     even income it picks up by taking over other companies. \n     ``WorldCom is in an enviable, position,'' says Robert \n     Willens, tax accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc. ``It \n     will have copious tax losses and can be a powerful \n     acquirer.''\n       WorldCom's new owners--the holders of its $41 billion of \n     bad debt--are driving a truck through a loophole that needs \n     to be closed pronto. It was left open by Congress when the \n     lawmakers overhauled IRS rules to stamp out a notorious trade \n     in corporate tax losses. At one time, owners of loss-making \n     businesses could see their companies along with their \n     accumulated tax loss--often their only asset--to profitable \n     companies. Now, tax losses are snuffed out when company \n     ownership changes hands.\n       So, WorldCom is going through hoops to avoid that fate. \n     Pending a final vote by creditors later this year, the \n     company is changing its bylaws to prohibit anyone from \n     building a stake of more than 4.75% in the company. They have \n     to keep bidders at bay for at least two years, otherwise the \n     IRS would argue that control of WorldCom has changed hands \n     and that the tax losses--which, assuming a 38% tax rate, \n     could give a $2.5 billion boost to earnings--should be wiped \n     out. ``It is the perfect poison pill,'' says Carl M. Jenks, \n     tax expert at law firm Jones Day.\n       The perverse tactic is increasingly popular. The former \n     Williams Communications Group put a similar 5% ownership \n     limit in place last fall when it became WilTel Communications \n     Group Inc. after a bankruptcy reorganization. The bankruptcy \n     judge overseeing UAL Corp. agreed on Feb. 24 to similar \n     restriction on UAL securities in order to preserve its $4 \n     billion of tax losses. ``We will generally recommend that any \n     company with net operating losses worth anything adopt these \n     restrictions,'' says Douglas W. Killip, a tax lawyer at Akin \n     Group Strauss Hauer & Feld.\n       For WorldCom's rivals, the tax break is salt on a wound. \n     William P. Barr, a former U.S. attorney general and now \n     general counsel of Verizon Communications, fumes that World-\n     Com is trying to ``compound its fraud by escaping the payment \n     of taxes.'' WorldCom's bankruptcy reorganization will \n     eliminate the cost of servicing some $30 billion of debt. \n     That, the company projects, will help it to make $2 billion \n     before taxes next year. By using the tax losses, it will be \n     able to keep about $780 million in cash it would otherwise \n     owe the government. In fact, it won't be liable for any tax \n     at least until the accumulated losses are worked through. \n     And, because it racked up the $6.6 billion in losses just \n     through 2001, WorldCom could have billions more to play with \n     once the numbers for 2002 are finally worked out.\n       What's more, the poison pill is likely to deter any company \n     from buying WorldCom and dumping some of the obsolete assets \n     still clogging the telecom industry. That will slow any \n     recovery in capital spending and hurt WorldCom's competitors. \n     ``It is bad when business decisions are motivated by tax \n     reasons and not based on sound economics,'' says Anthony \n     Sabino, bankruptcy law professor at St. John's University.\n       Rivals are likely to push the IRS to find a way to stop \n     WorldCom from utilizing the losses, observers say. But their \n     chances of success are slim because the IRS never issued \n     regulations that could have nullified the ploy. And the \n     courts generally rule against the agency when it attempts to \n     write rules retroactively, Willens says.\n       Still, it's time to close the stable door before any more \n     horses bolt. Besides, Uncle Sam could use the money right \n     now.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is an amendment that attempts to \nclose a big loophole that may get huge. This is an amendment that deals \nwith the problem that was identified in this Business Week article \nhaving to do with MCI-WorldCom now coming out of\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nbankruptcy. When you are coming out of bankruptcy, your debts are taken \noff but they are offset. By the way, you aren't taxed on the \nforgiveness of that debt but you offset that tax forgiveness, if you \nwill, against attributes like net operating losses.\n  MCI has figured out a way to restructure coming out of bankruptcy so \nthey can cheat these operating losses and will probably not pay taxes \nfor the next 10 years.\n  This is a huge loophole. You have the biggest stock scandal in \nhistory. MCI comes out of bankruptcy, and they are setting a new \naccounting standard which is as scandalous as the first one.\n  This is something we need to deal with. I will not force a vote \nbecause I know this is a new thing and we have not had a hearing. But \nthis is major problem that we need to address because other companies \nare going to take this loophole and run with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwill withdraw his amendment. I have had a lot of discussion with him \ntonight on it. He makes a very strong case about something which I have \nnot studied, nor am I convinced he is wrong. But based upon how I \napproach bankruptcy--that is, I see bankruptcy as an impartial person, \na judge making a decision on whether a business ought to continue or go \nout of business or how it ought to be restructured--we are talking \nabout tax legislation that has been on the books for an awfully long \ntime.\n  But we are also aware, as the Senator has told me, of crafty people \ngiving advice to corporations on how they can maybe restructure and \nbecome strong and avoid taxation such that other corporate entities \nthat are competitors maybe would have a disadvantage. But I am not \nconvinced of it. I would probably have to fight the amendment if it \nwere offered tonight.\n  I can promise the Senator, first of all, we will go into depth on \nthis matter with Treasury, with my own Finance Committee staff, and \nwith the Joint Committee on Taxation staff, and it probably will lead \nto a hearing. I hate to promise with the workload of the committee on \ntaxes, on welfare, and on prescription drugs this summer that we are \ngoing be able to have a hearing tomorrow. But I will give very serious \nconsideration to the very strong position that the Senator from \nPennsylvania has made.\n  The Senator is a member of my committee. He is a strong advocate for \nhis position. I don't think it is going to get lost in the dust. I will \ndo what I can to keep it paramount in my mind because I want to make \nsure we don't have crafty people advising people who are in bankruptcy \nany more than we have crafty people advising about corporate tax \nshelters who are not in bankruptcy. We will look into it with the same \nvigor that I pursued other corporate tax shelters and as I pursued \nother inversions and other attempts of corporations to avoid taxation.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 648 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 648) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we will next turn to the amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 666\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

This small test showed that we had people getting calls at 4 \no'clock in the morning from private collection agencies.\n  The former IRS Commissioner said if Congress were to appropriate $296 \nmillion to hire additional IRS compliance employees to work on these \naccounts, the IRS would collect $9 billion.\n  This bill puts in more money than that and says it will collect $900 \nmillion, which is only one-tenth of the amount.\n  I don't think we ought to decide that we ought to provide private \ncollection agencies the responsibility to collect this debt. This is a \nresponsibility of the Federal Government. In any event, why would you \nwant to spend money for something that is one-tenth as effective as \nwhat the Commissioner says can be done with the IRS?\n  I ask for a favorable vote on this amendment.\n  The amendment is cosponsored by Senators Byrd, Baucus, Mikulski, and \nSarbanes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment will undermine our efforts to \nensure that those who owe taxes will pay them. There is over $250 \nbillion in uncollected debt. The IRS, obviously, has the primary \nresponsibility. But over 40 States and the Department of Education use \nprivate collectors, and they must abide by the various rules that \napply, including the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights and the Fair Debt \nCollections Act. Therefore, there is an opportunity to collect money \nthat is owed the Treasury as a result of this provision.\n  So striking this provision would not only be bad policy but also \nwould, unfortunately, lose about $1 billion in revenue from the \nunderlying bill. As a result, the reduction in revenues in excess of \nthe levels set out in section 202 of H. Con. Res. 95, the fiscal year \n2004 concurrent resolution on the budget, would raise a point of order, \nand I do raise a point of order under section 202 of that resolution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there should be no point of order. But let \nme say, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act and the \nbudget resolution for the consideration of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 43, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 176 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\n\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will clarify: The point of order was \nnot sustained. The amendment is pending.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest that the Senate now vote by \nvoice on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n666.\n  In the opinion of the Chair, the noes have it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest that the Chair put the question \na second time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n666.\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I now urge the Chair to recognize the \nSenator from Massachusetts for the purpose of a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I am not going to \nask to vote on, after discussing it with both the chairman and the \nranking member, and other colleagues. I thank Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus and particularly Senator Kennedy and Senator Clinton, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Graham, and Senator Feinstein. This is an \namendment that would have affected positively 37 States in the country. \nAmong the top 10 States that would have been helped in a completely \nnonpartisan way would have been Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, \nOhio, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, California, New York, and many \nothers. This refers to the safety net hospitals in our country that are \npicking up the costs of those who are the most disadvantaged who need \nhealth care.\n  Unfortunately, in this amendment the funding under the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program has been cut as an offset in this legislation \nby some $800 million. There are 2 million additional uninsured in this \ncountry. None of them have the ability to be able to get care unless we \nare providing the so-called disproportionate share allocation to those \nhospitals. I ask the chairman and the ranking member if they would \nagree that when the Medicare bill comes up in about a month that at \nthat time it would be appropriate for the Finance Committee to try to \nrectify what is happening here because the increasing numbers of \nuninsured are literally flooding the hospitals and urban centers and \nrural communities where they don't have the capacity to be able to \nprovide the care. It seems extraordinary that we can find the money for \nthose who earn more than $315,000 a year at the expense of those who \nare the most vulnerable in our society.\n  I hope we will rectify it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate very much what Senator \nKerry has stated to us. I want everybody to know that I share their \nconcerns. I think I expressed and shared that in legislation on which I \njoined with Senator Baucus last fall, not reintroduced this year. But \nSenator Baucus and I reflected on this and accommodated this as one of \nmany factors in a Medicare bill that we put together. The \ndisproportionate share program, of course, is a primary source of \nsupport for safety net hospitals which serve vulnerable patients. I \nagree that the safety net hospitals are also under considerable \nfinancial strain and that the disproportionate share hospital cuts now \nin effect make it even harder. That has been compounded by a weaker \neconomy. The number of uninsured has gone up.\n  Nationally, the 2003 disproportionate share hospital cliff represents \nan estimated reduction of $1.1 billion to total State allotments for \nfiscal year 2002 to 2003. I supported fixing this in the past, as I \nhave stated.\n  In June, we will in fact be considering Medicare prescription drug \nlegislation. I think it is very appropriate to deal with that at that \nparticular time. I am committed to working with my colleagues on this \nimportant issue in the context of our work on the Medicare prescription \ndrug bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I, too, pledge to work with the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. Last year the Senator from Ohio and myself \nintroduced legislation in the Medicare providers bill to address this \nvery issue. It is called the DSH cliff, essentially. The Medicaid \npayments are scheduled to go off a cliff--that is, dramatically \nlowered--and we had extended the level of payments for a couple years \nlast year to avoid the cliff, the point being that we are very \ncognizant of the problem facing the large public hospitals, \nparticularly in urban areas that serve a disproportionate number of \nlow-income people.\n  We will certainly work very hard to deal with this when we take up \nthe Medicare legislation in the next couple of months.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember. I know they will both work in good faith to try to address this \nissue.\n  I know the Senator from California wanted a moment to say something.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important issue to virtually every \nurban community. For California, the cuts to Medicaid DSH payments \nmeans a loss of over $184 million a year. At Fresno Valley Hospital \nalone this cut is worth $6 million a year. We have had a number of our \nhospitals close, due in part to cuts to disproportionate share \npayments.\n  I want to particularly thank the Senator from Massachusetts, and the \nmanager of the bill, the chairman of the committee, and the ranking \nmember for their commitment to take this matter up on the Medicare \nbill. I look forward to working with them to fix this important \nprogram.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are quite late at night and, just for \nclarification, we will put forth a unanimous consent, but we are \nwaiting for final passage. We are waiting for the managers' package to \nbe completed. That will take about 20 to 25 minutes or so. What we will \ndo is set the bill aside and go ahead with the global HIV/AIDS bill and \nplan on going straight to the first amendment. The plan is to spend \napproximately 10 minutes equally divided and then go directly to a \nvote, after which the managers' package will be ready, and we will go \nto final passage on the jobs and growth bill.\n  Let me turn to the Democratic leader to see if that is satisfactory, \nto make the best use of the time. We can't have final passage until we \nhave the managers' package. That is going to be about 20 minutes. We \nwill be able to dispense with the first amendment on the AIDS bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have been discussing this matter for \nthe last hour or so. We understand there are no more amendments to be \noffered on the tax bill, so we are prepared now to go to the managers' \namendment. In order to make the most efficient use of the time, we felt \nit might be helpful to go to the first\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\namendment. In fact, there will be additional amendments on that. We \nwanted to finish the bill tonight.\n  This is in keeping with our discussions. I would hope we could go \nahead and offer the first amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the minority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We have a number of amendments on this side. And when I \nsay ``a number,'' we have more than one. We are getting time agreements \non all the amendments. For the benefit of the Senate, I might tell you \nquickly of the major amendments that we have and the time agreements: \nThe Durbin-Kerry, et cetera, amendment on global AIDS funding is 10 \nminutes equally divided. Senator Feinstein has an amendment; it is up \nto 30 minutes equally divided. Senator Dorgan has an amendment and has \nagreed to 10 minutes equally divided. Senator Kennedy has an amendment, \n30 minutes equally divided. Senator Dodd has one, 20 minutes equally \ndivided; Senator Boxer, 10 minutes equally divided.\n  The reason I bothered to tell you that is I think we can do this. I \nthink we can meet the objective of the majority leader to get this bill \npassed. People are being very cooperative. If we move like this, I \nthink we should do it quickly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no other \namendments be in order, other than a managers' amendment, which must be \nagreed to by both managers and the two leaders, and that the bill now \nbe temporarily set aside and the Senate resume consideration of the \nglobal AIDS bill as under the previous order, and that the other \nprovisions of the order with respect to S. 1054 remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Reserving the right to object, I am in the midst of a \nnegotiation on a colloquy we will put in so we can withdraw an \namendment. I want to make sure that has been accepted.\n  Mr. FRIST. The Senator would be able to do that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If there is no guarantee that we are going to have \nacceptance of the colloquy, then I cannot offer my amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the request \nbe amended to accommodate the colloquy offered by the Senator from New \nJersey or an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I also \nhave an amendment being submitted that I would like to be included on \nthe list.\n  Mr. FRIST. Is that request for the global HIV/AIDS bill? Just to \nclarify, on the global HIV/AIDS bill, people will still be able to \npropose amendments. The unanimous consent was for the underlying jobs \nand growth bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6445-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6445-S6450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA \n                         ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know it is late at night, so I will \nabbreviate this debate. I hope it is no reflection on the seriousness \nof this issue. Everyone understands the global AIDS epidemic is a \nchallenge facing our generation and our children's generation to which \nwe need to respond.\n  As I said earlier today, there has been outstanding leadership on \nthis issue on both sides of the aisle. The President of the United \nStates, in the State of the Union Address, set a standard and goal for \nAmerica that deserves the applause of both sides of the aisle--a $15 \nbillion commitment to the global AIDS fight.\n  I have seen extraordinary efforts on both sides of the aisle, with \nSenator Frist, our majority leader, on the Republican side, as the \nnominal and real leader on this issue, as well as Senator Lugar; and on \nour side, Senator Biden, as well as Senator Kerry. The list goes on.\n  The reason I raise these points at this moment is this: I served for \n14 years in the House before I came to the Senate. It is a very \nimportant Chamber. They make important decisions. But all wisdom \ndoesn't reside on that side of the rotunda. What I am asking you to \nconsider this evening as the initial amendment on this issue is what we \nhave already voted for in the Senate on a bipartisan basis. What I am \nsuggesting to you is not novel; it is not radical; it is not partisan; \nit is what the Senate agreed to do. I am asking us to stand behind our \nbipartisan position and say to our friends in the House this is not a \nwholesale change of your bill, but it is a modification that is \ncritically important.\n  Let me tell you why I think it is critically important and why I hope \nwe can stand together as the Senate and say to the House Members, \nplease, let's work together for this modification, which is really to \nthe benefit of all of us.\n  Here is what it does. It relates to our contribution to the global \nfund. It is what we have already voted for in the Senate. It says that \nin the next fiscal year, 2004, we will contribute $1 billion to the \nglobal fund under the following conditions: The first $500 million will \ngo to the global fund, with no strings attached, no limitations. The \nsecond $500 million will go, as long as it is matched by other \ncontributions--and not just matched but matched on a 2-to-1 basis.\n  In other words, the second tranche of $500 million will require $2 of \nforeign contributions from other nations for every $1 contributed by \nthe United States. That is the approach that I believe is sensible. It \nsays we are committed to the global fund and we understand that they \nneed resources, but the United States cannot carry this alone. We will \nlead because we are the richest nation on Earth, and our President has \ncommitted us to this leadership. But then, once we have made the $500 \nmillion commitment, we will turn to the rest of the world to join us in \nthis effort.\n  That is not a radical notion; it is a notion which, frankly, the \nHouse version of this bill considers as well. But there is an error in \nthe language in the House bill. Some of you have said to me you just \nwant to take this bill as passed by the House, pass it in the Senate, \nnot change a word, and hand it to the President on Air Force One on his \nway to the G-8 conference.\n  If you will turn to page 38 of the House version, there is a serious \nerror about the match. It suggests, when you read it, that we are not \nputting up a third of the money to be matched but 25 percent. It is \njust a drafting error. But as wise, as seasoned, and as experienced as \nthe House Members may be, they made a mistake.\n\n  This amendment corrects that mistake and it says it is truly a 2-to-1 \nmatch. We will come up with one-third. They made a mistake in drafting. \nWhy would we want the President to take that mistake with him on Air \nForce One?\n  I also tell you that this bill does something the House bill doesn't \ndo. I think it is something they would readily agree to. We all know, \nat least, that the global fund has been recently reviewed by the GAO \nand it was found to be a good organization, committing money to good \nprojects around the world. But we owe it to the taxpayers of this \ncountry to make sure that the dollars we put in the global fund are \nwell spent.\n  So this amendment, offered by myself, Senator Daschle, Senator Kerry, \nand others, makes public and available all the approved proposals to \nthe global fund--transparency--so we can see what they are funding.\n  It lists all the organizations that make up the country coordinating \nmechanism. It lists all the organizations receiving funding, and it \ncalls for a report from the global fund that includes where the money \nis going to be spent.\n  That is the kind of accountability and transparency which does not \nviolate the spirit of the House bill but merely adds provisions which I \nthink protect taxpayers' dollars in a responsible way.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time and yield to the other side for \ntheir response. I hope my colleagues will favorably consider this \namendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this \namendment. I want to give everyone a bit of the philosophy developed in \nthe House that my colleagues have not had the opportunity to observe. \nThere are numbers very important in this debate.\n  The United States has had a tremendous commitment. The United States \nwill continue to have a tremendous commitment. What we are trying to do \nis make sure the other countries also join in this commitment and that \nit does not become solely a U.S. fund.\n  This chart shows that the United States has maintained its commitment \nto the global fund. We have pledged $200 million a year. Here is what \nis happening with the other countries: They started at 275. By 2006, \nthey dropped off to a little bit above zero. By 2008, they hit zero. \nThat is what the commitment is at the present time.\n  This chart shows how the fund is shaping up at the moment. The United \nStates is putting in 51 percent of the money, not 33 percent of the \nmoney--51 percent of the money.\n  Some of the numbers you have heard go back to 2001, 2002, and 2003 \nwhen we had a higher commitment, but the other countries had a higher \ncommitment. They were almost at $150 million. That has been dropping \noff steadily.\n  When we get into the pledges, it drops off considerably faster. We \nhave to do something to get the other countries energized to still be a \npart of this. This should not be, cannot be, and will not work if it is \njust U.S. funds.\n  This chart shows the way that it shapes up with the bill, the way the \nHouse brought it out. We will be providing 42 percent, then 60 percent, \nthen 96 percent, then 99.5 percent, and then 100 percent of the fund if \nthis amendment is not defeated. I do not think we ever intended to be \n100 percent of the entire world solution to this problem, and we are \nnot doing our job with the rest of the world if we become 100 percent \nof the solution. It is participation by the countries that is extremely \nimportant.\n  The global fund administrator supports the leveraging efforts. He \nrecognizes what is happening with those pledges and what is happening \nwith the rest of the world. He says:\n\n       I hope and expect that the U.S. will continue to ensure \n     that its contribution represents a ``fair share'' relative to \n     the total commitments to the fund, potentially through a \n     ``challenge grant''--\n\n  And that is the way it is written coming out of the House. It is \nsaying that we will put up money to encourage others, and as they reach \ntheir goals on the pledges, we will increase ours. We are setting aside \nan extra $1 billion to do that.\n\n       . . . potentially through a ``challenge grant'' mechanism \n     as we await the new and renewed pledges of other donors.\n\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\n\n  We have the support of the administrator of the global fund. We at \npresent are exceeding what we envisioned doing in that fund. We know it \nis extremely important. The only way that it works is if we have the \ninvolvement from all of the countries or at least more of the countries \nthan we have at the present time.\n  The intent of the global fund was to be a global multilateral \nresponse to these epidemics. Thus far, the United States has clearly \nshown its commitment to this issue, and we are asking others to \ncontribute to this necessary cause. The global fund cannot become an \n``us'' or a U.S.-only fund. If it is to be successful, other countries \nhave to be a part of the contributions.\n  I ask my colleagues to join in defeating this amendment so that we \nkeep that challenge grant commitment there. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 4\\1/2\\ minutes. The opposition \nhas 5 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield whatever time the Senator from Illinois needs on \nthe remaining time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I agree with everything the Senator from \nWyoming said. This amendment agrees with everything the Senator from \nWyoming said. There is no doubt about the fact that the United States \nshould not carry this burden alone. The House was right to establish a \nstandard that the United States would be contributing as long as other \nnations contributed as well. That is exactly what this amendment says.\n  I think we have passed the point of questioning whether the global \nfund is an important investment in fighting global AIDS. In fact, we \nwere instrumental as a nation in setting up the global fund. Now I \nthink we have to work with other countries around the world to ensure \nits success.\n  The global fund is operating now in 92 countries in the first two \nrounds. The grants are intended to respond to locally defined needs, \nand it has really shown successful pilot programs. But the fund is in a \ndire situation at this moment.\n  Those who have joined our global AIDS caucus know that when we met \nlast week with Dr. Feecham, who heads up the fund, they are running out \nof money to deal with the global AIDS epidemic.\n  I am saying let's put $500 million into the global fund from the \nUnited States but no more money unless it is matched 2 to 1 from other \nsources than the United States. I am completely in agreement with the \nSenator from Wyoming. This should not be the United States alone. I ask \nyou to merely stand by the position of the Senate which we voted for on \na bipartisan basis last year.\n  I yield to the minority leader, Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is exactly \nright. I do not disagree with anything the Senator from Wyoming said. \nWe agree it should not be a commitment solely made by the United \nStates, and that really is the whole purpose of this legislation. That \nis why we are trying to pass this legislation tonight so the President \ncan take this authority with him to the conference and use it as \nleverage, use it for setting the example, use it as an opportunity to \nlay out our expectations for the rest of the world.\n  We are simply saying we are going to commit to 500, and you have to \ncommit to a billion. You have to commit two times to the one unit we \nare committing. We want a 2-to-1 ratio internationally, and we are \nbasically setting a floor. We say we will do the 500, and you come up \nwith the rest. It has to be a 2-to-1 ratio accommodation to address \ndirectly the concerns legitimately raised by the Senator from Wyoming. \nSo there is no disagreement. We just want world cooperation, world \ninvolvement, world commitment, and we believe this is an opportunity to \nachieve that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me try to describe what I believe is \nthe lay of the land at this stage. We have had in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee about 4 months of discussion about various ways that this \nissue might be approached. And that followed, as was pointed out \nearlier in the day in the debate, the remarkable bill that was offered \nby Senators Frist and Kerry last year. It passed unanimously. It did \nnot receive consideration in the House, and it did not become law.\n  The issue was revived in a big way when President Bush mentioned this \nprominently in his State of the Union Address. President Bush not only \nmentioned it then, but he has been mentioning it on almost every \noccasion when he has met with Senators. This is very important to us, \nit is very important to our President, and it is very important to the \nworld that a bill pass this evening.\n  The situation comes down to this. In the Foreign Relations Committee, \nultimately, the distinguished ranking member, Senator Biden, and I \nformulated a bill which we believed had a strong majority in our \ncommittee. We believed it had a strong majority potentially on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The House of Representatives, in the meanwhile, under the leadership \nof Congressman Hyde and Congressman Lantos, has passed an excellent \nbill, in our judgment. We believe we could have improved upon it. The \namendments that are being offered tonight all suggest they might \nimprove upon it.\n  As a matter of fact, some have foreign policy objectives that I would \nagree with wholeheartedly. But the issue tonight comes down to this: \nThe President of the United States has visited with me, Senator Biden, \nand others, as late as last Thursday--and, in fact, in Indianapolis on \nTuesday. He has indicated to me he believes the only chance that he \nwill have a bill he can sign, that he can take to the G-8 meeting that \ncommences June 1, is if the Senate adopts the House bill without \namendments, without conference, without possible parliamentary \nstrategies that stand between the President and a bill that he will \ntake to the G-8.\n  Why does he want to do that? Because he wants money from the G-8. He \nwants commitments. He wants somebody besides the United States in this \nball game. It is very important that he succeed. This is not a \nperipheral item for the President. It is up front. He has appealed in \nevery way he knows.\n  I have told him I will support him, and I will do the best I can to \nmanage a bill this evening that passes that has no amendments, however \nmeritorious, because I believe that way he will have a bill, we will \nhave success at the G-8 and, more importantly, the people who are going \nto be helped will be helped as opposed to our having an extended study \nin which people come from the left, from the right, from the center, \nperfecting this and that, but we do not have a bill and our President \ngoes to the G-8 without that momentum of support he wants.\n  Now, that will be the issue in my remarks on each amendment. It \nfinally comes down to the fact that I will ask my colleagues in the \nSenate to defeat amendments; to pass the bill; to do so promptly; to do \nso tonight, so that the issue is concluded, the President is supported, \nand he moves on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 40 seconds for each side.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that I have an additional 2 \nminutes--I will not ask that again tonight--to respond to or to \nreaffirm some of what the chairman said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is true we did go see the President. The Senator from \nIndiana and I have a slightly different take on what we told the \nPresident. My view is the President has incredible leverage with the \nRepublican House. And my point to the President was: Mr. President, \nwhat we had in the Biden-Lugar bill and, prior to that, the bill of the \nleader, Senator Kerry, and Senator Feingold, who have been the real \nleaders on this issue, you liked all of it; you said it was okay, and \nso, Mr. President, I do not know why you cannot pick up the phone, call \nMr. DeLay and say, I, the most popular Republican in the Nation, want \nthis.\n  He said he cannot do that, he will not be able to get a bill.\n  He also said he needs this bill. Why do we need this before the G-8? \nHe says he needs this before the G-8 to demonstrate to the G-8 we are \ndoing something and we expect them to do more.\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\n  I take the President at his word that that is why he wants it, but \nthe reason why the Durbin amendment is so important is everybody knows \nthe House does not really care about this bill. The House bill says up \nto a billion dollars--up to, meaning zero to a billion. My argument to \nthe President is, if we have $500 million at the front end, everybody \nin the G-8 will believe it and he will really have leverage.\n  The problem I have is, I do not understand why the President of the \nUnited States is unwilling to exercise his leverage on the House \nleadership. So I really think we are helping him in spite of what he \nwants. Let's help him.\n  Sometimes, as my dear mother used to say: This is for your own good, \nJoey.\n  This is for his own good. We give him a bottom line of $500 million \nto go to the G-8. Then Chirac will look and say, they mean it. If you \ngo with zero to a billion, knowing that Mr. Hastert, who does not like \nthis bill, Mr. DeLay, who does not like this bill, the same House that \nkilled this bill before, they will say, we do not have to do anything. \nWe know those guys are not going to do anything. Their reputations are \nwell earned and well known.\n  I do not say that in a pejorative way. They do not like this bill. \nEverybody knows they do not like this bill. They do not even like their \nown bill.\n  Because the President, to his credit, said in the State of the Union, \nI want one, they had to pass something. So let's help the President. \nLet's give him some leverage.\n  I would be willing to bet that if this passes, I will be dumbfounded \nif the President does not pick up the phone and say, Denny, I need a \nlittle help--meaning Speaker Hastert--and, Mr. DeLay, we are both from \nTexas; me, President, you No. 2. Maybe we can get this done.\n  I have confidence in the President's leadership. So let us help him \nout. Give him some leverage. Let him get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, to get away from the rhetoric about what the \nPresident can and cannot do, let's go back to the amendment. The \npurpose of the bill we are looking at now is to make sure we are \nproviding a challenge grant for the world. That is what we have been \nasked to do. That is what the President wants to take to the G-8. That \nis what we need to do right now. We do not need to put out a promise \nthat we are going to have $500 million immediately. The up to $1 \nbillion--that is still a big number for me. I have trouble saying it. \nThe promise of up to $1 billion is if there is a match by the others. \nIf they match, we give. The House agreed to that. We will agree to it. \nBut to put in another number there to show we are willing to go even \nfurther than any other country in the world and maybe even be willing \nto fund the fund 100 percent is not a good idea at this point.\n  What we need to do is follow what the House did, make sure there is \nan assurance there that the President can take. We do not need to try \nand outbid the rest of the world when they are not even bidding. When \nyou go to an auction sale, you do not drive up your own bid. That is \nwhat we are doing, is an auction sale. We are trying to provide a \nlittle bit of psychology to get everybody to participate so they will \nhave more concern even in their own country. So let's not bid against \nourselves. Let's defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Durbin \namendment, which strikes an important balance between supporting the \nGlobal Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria and demanding accountability and \nappropriate burdensharing.\n  The Global Fund holds tremendous promise for leveraging donations to \nensure maximum impact, helping us all to get the most for our money. It \nnot only deserves U.S. support--it needs it to survive, because our \nleadership sends a critical signal to the rest of the donor community. \nToday we are being urged to strengthen the President's hand with other \ndonors at the next G-8 meeting. Well Mr. President, I want to \nstrengthen his hand. Making a strong commitment to the fund--and \nconditioning part of that commitment on a significant effort from other \ndonors, definitely fits the bill.\n  The President's historic commitment in his State of the Union Address \nraised expectations around the world. But the United States cannot \npossibly tackle this pandemic alone. We must throw down the gauntlet, \nand signal our substantial support for the fund and our respect for its \nmission. This is the kind of leadership that can make the President's \nvision a reality, making a real difference in the lives of millions \naround the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming must be arguing \nwith himself, because there is no argument on this side of the aisle. \nWe agree with him. The United States should lead, but we should also \nask other countries to join us, and the formula we have come up with is \nnot a partisan response. It is the formula that came out of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, chaired by a great Republican Senator from Indiana \nnamed Lugar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask my colleagues to join in supporting the Biden-Lugar \napproach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 9 seconds.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The President of the United States needs an opportunity to \nforward our cause. Please give him that opportunity.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide emergency funding for food aid to HIV/AIDS \n              affected populations in sub-Saharan Africa)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. EMERGENCY FOOD AID FOR HIV/AIDS VICTIMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     found that ``For persons living with HIV/AIDS, practicing \n     sound nutrition can play a key role in preventing \n     malnutrition and wasting syndrome, which can weaken an \n     already compromised immune system.''.\n       (2) Whereas there are immediate needs for additional food \n     aid in sub-Saharan Africa where the World Food Program has \n     estimated that more than 40,000,000 people are at risk of \n     starvation.\n       (3) Whereas prices of certain staple commodities have \n     increased by 30 percent over the past year, which was not \n     anticipated by the President's fiscal year 2004 budget \n     request.\n       (4) The Commodity Credit Corporation has the legal \n     authority to finance up to $30,000,000,000 for ongoing \n     agriculture programs and $250,000,000 represents a use of \n     less than 1 percent of such authority to combat the worst \n     public health crisis in 500 years.\n       (b) Commodity Credit Corporation.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     immediately use the funds, facilities, and authorities of the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation to provide an additional \n     $250,000,000 in fiscal year 2003 to carry out programs \n     authorized under title II of the Agricultural Trade \n     Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (7 U.S.C. 1691 et \n     seq.) to assist in mitigating the effects of HIV/AIDS on \n     affected populations in sub-Saharan Africa and other \n     developing nations, and by September 30, 2003, the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development shall enter into agreements with private \n     voluntary organizations, non-governmental organizations, and \n     other appropriate organizations for the provision of such \n     agricultural commodities through programs that--\n       (A) provide nutritional assistance to individuals with HIV/\n     AIDS and to children, households, and communities affected by \n     HIV/AIDS; and\n       (B) generate funds from the sale of such commodities for \n     activities related to the prevention and treatment of HIV/\n     AIDS, support services and care for HIV/AIDS infected \n     individuals and affected households, and the creation of \n     sustainable livelihoods among individuals in HIV/AIDS \n     affected communities, including income-generating and \n     business activities.\n       (2) Requirement.--The food aid provided under this \n     subsection shall be in addition to any other food aid \n     acquired and provided by the Commodity Credit Corporation \n     prior to the date of enactment of this Act. Agricultural \n     commodities made available under this subsection may, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, be shipped in \n     fiscal years 2003 and 2004.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment provides $250 million in \nfood aid through the Commodity Credit Corporation to those who are \nsuffering from AIDS/HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa. The Senate is \nalready on record in supporting this level of food aid. During the \nconsideration of the fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations bill, the \nSenate approved a bipartisan amendment that would have provided $500 \nmillion for this type of food aid. That was reduced to $250 million in \nthe conference. This amendment would simply add back the amount which \nwas cut in conference.\n  In 1984, 8 million people were in need of food aid. In sub-Saharan \nAfrica today, that number is 11 million. Some are predicting that it \nwill go up to 20 million. Yet there is little attention in 2003 to this \ncrisis.\n  The United Nations reports that 29.4 million adults and children are \ninfected with the HIV virus in sub-Saharan Africa, and 11 million \norphans currently living in Africa are facing the risk of malnutrition \nas a result of the AIDS crisis.\n  The relationship between these two crises is very strong. The World \nFood Program Director, James Morris, testified before the Senate on \nFebruary 25 of this year and stated that HIV and AIDS was the central \ncause of famine in that part of Africa. Poverty in that part of the \nworld contributes to the AIDS epidemic. Not only are the health systems \ninundated but poverty and hunger lead many women to be commercial sex \nworkers. Devastation in the rural areas causes many men to become \nmigrant workers in urban areas which leads to multiple partners. In \naddition, once a person is infected with the HIV virus, for those who \nare lucky enough to get medical treatment, good nutrition is crucial in \nhelping ward off infections. Malnutrition complicates and accelerates \nthe problems associated with this HIV infection. The body is unable to \nfight the disease when it is starving for food.\n  This is a crisis that calls out for a dramatic response. Anyone in \nthis Senate who has held a child in his or her arms who is dying of \nmalnutrition and starvation--and some of us have--will never forget \nthat experience. The fact is that tonight in sub-Saharan Africa, there \nare hundreds of thousands--millions--of people at risk, especially \nchildren.\n  This Senate has already made the decision that it would support $500 \nmillion. That was cut to $250 million in conference on the omnibus. I \npropose that we restore that $250 million, and do what we should do--do \nwhat a generous and good country must do at this point.\n  I ask that my amendment be supported by my colleagues.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Dorgan-Leahy \namendment. This amendment tries to get at the heart of two \ninterconnected problems that are literally wiping out countries in sub-\nSaharan Africa. Famine and AIDS.\n  This amendment directs the Secretary of Agriculture to use the \nauthorities of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to provide $250 \nmillion in desperately needed food aid to HIV/AIDS victims in sub-\nSaharan Africa and other developing countries. Moreover, it allows the \nadministration to sell this food aid and use the money to purchase \ndrugs, medical equipment, and other supplies to help combat HIV/AIDS in \nsub-Saharan Africa.\n  In other words, this amendment takes a small step in addressing two \nof the most critical problems on the African continent.\n  We have all seen the pictures and heard the statistics about AIDS in \nAfrica. But, let me take just a moment to reiterate a couple of points. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, about 30 million \nadults and children are infected with the HIV virus in Africa. As of \n2001, an estimated 21.5 million Africans had died of AIDS, including \n2.2 million who died in that year. AIDS is now the leading cause of \ndeath in Africa.\n  At the same time AIDS is ravaging the continent, a famine has placed \nmore than 40 million Africans at risk of starvation. Men, women, and \nchildren of all ages of all religions are dying, because they cannot \nget enough to eat.\n  There is a direct connection between HIV/AIDS and malnourishment. The \nHouse bill recognizes that fact. Let me read to you one section--and I \nam quoting: ``Healthy and nutritious foods for individuals infected or \nliving with HIV/AIDS are an important complement in HIV/AIDS medicines \nfor such individuals.'' The bill goes on to say: ``Individuals infected \nwith HIV have higher nutritional requirements than individuals who are \nnot infected with HIV . . . Also, there is evidence to suggest that the \nfull benefit of therapy to treat HIV/AIDS may not be achieved in \nindividuals who are malnourished . . .''\n  There are plenty of statistics, medical studies, and reports. But, it \nis common sense. When people are starving, its harder for their bodies \nto fight the HIV/AIDS virus.\n  We know that HIV/AIDS is the worst public health crisis in human \nhistory. We see 40 million people at risk of starvation in Africa. We \nneed to do something about it right now.\n  To be sure, H.R. 1298 is an important bill and it is a good start at \ntaking action. But there is a gaping hole in this bill--resources. This \nbill does not appropriate one dime of money to address this problem. \nLet me repeat that. This bill does not appropriate one dime of money to \naddress AIDS or famine in Africa.\n  As I have said over and over, we can have the best policies in the \nworld, but\n\n[[Page S6450]]\n\nif we don't have the money to back them up, our policies simply will \nnot be effective.\n  I am a member of the Appropriations Committee. I have seen the \nPresident's budget request for P.L. 480 food aid. Is there an increase \nto effectively deal with this problem? No. The President's budget \ndecreases food aid by $574 million. That is a 32 percent cut from last \nyear's level.\n  More importantly, the funds we do provide in the fiscal year 2004 \nbudget won't be available for months. We don't have months. By then, \nthe problem will have gotten worse. More people will have died. We need \nto break this cycle. That is exactly what this amendment does. It tells \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to use existing authorities to provide \n$250 million in food aid for HIV/AIDS affected populations in sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n  We are not giving the Secretary of Agriculture any new authority. The \nCCC can already provide $30 billion to support agricultural programs--\nboth here and abroad. This amendment simply says that we should use \nless than 1 percent of this authority to combat the worst public health \ncrisis in human history.\n  We all know that we need to act for humanitarian reasons. But, we \nshould not forget that there are important national security reasons \nfor taking action to address AIDS and famine in Africa. For example, \nCIA Director Tenent testified that ``[t]he chronic problems of sub-\nSaharan Africa make it, too, fertile ground for direct and indirect \nthreats to United States interests. Governments without accountability \nand natural disasters have left Africa with the highest concentration \nof human misery in the world''.\n  This should not be a hard amendment to support. Each and every \nSenator has already essentially expressed his or her support for this \namendment. Let me explain.\n  During Senate consideration of the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill, Senator Bill Nelson and I offered a bipartisan \namendment to add $500 million in emergency food aid to sub-Saharan \nAfrica. The amendment was accepted by the Senate, but was reduced by \nthe House to $250 million in the conference committee.\n  My amendment simply directs to Secretary of Agriculture to use the \nauthorities of the Credit Commodity Corporation to restore this $250 \nmillion that the Senate supported but the House eliminated in \nconference.\n  I want to remind people that this $500 million figure was not picked \nout of the air. It was based on an assessment by humanitarian \norganizations with field operations in Africa. More importantly, this \nfigure represents the U.S. share of what is needed to combat this \nproblem. In other words, it doesn't let other donors off the hook.\n  I would point out that the Dorgan-Leahy amendment has a wide range of \nsupport from international relief organizations--from Catholic Relief \nServices to Oxfam to the International Rescue Committee. In addition, \nagricultural organizations, as represented by the Coalition for Food \nAid, supports this amendment.\n  This is not a partisan issue. One has to look no further than \nRepublican Representative Frank Wolf's op-ed in Sunday's Washington \nPost on this very issue. It is, however, a security issue. It is a \nhumanitarian issue. It is a moral issue.\n  The AIDS pandemic in Africa is out of control. A famine threatens the \nlives of 40 million people. We need to act. We need to act now. We need \nto provide real resources. This amendment does all of these things.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as required.\n  The argument against the Dorgan amendment, which I will make, is that \na budget point of order clearly is applicable against this particular \namendment, and at the appropriate time I will raise that budget point \nof order.\n  I say simply that the bill we are considering, which came through the \nHouse of Representatives and is the basis for our debate today, does \nmention food assistance, and does so generously, as a prevention \ntechnique. It is mentioned at several points throughout the \nlegislation. So it has not been overlooked. But the amendment that is \nbeing offered by my distinguished colleague clearly approaches \nappropriations language, as opposed to authorization language, and \nclearly is in violation of the budget we have adopted. At the \nappropriate time, I will seek recognition to raise the budget point or \norder.\n  In addition, the fact is that once again it amends the basic bill we \nare attempting to pass tonight, which is very important for Members to \nconsider.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is indeed a point of order. But I \nhope someone in this Chamber will take it upon themselves to explain to \nthose who are sick and to the hungry children who are dying that this \ncan't be done because there was a point of order in the Senate at 11 \no'clock at night in consideration of this bill. The fact is we have \nalready made this decision. This is not a partisan issue. We have made \nthis decision previously.\n  The Senate said we will provide $500 million to try to provide \nassistance to those who are devastated by HIV and devastated by \nmalnutrition and hunger. We have already made that decision in the \nSenate. It was cut to $250 million in conference.\n  Let us again decide that this emergency problem cries out for our \nresponse and not for a claim of a point of order. This is talking about \nfeeding hungry people who are devastated by famine and who are ravaged \nby HIV and AIDS. This deserves our support, and deserves it tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as each one of us discussed amendments \ntonight, there are ways in which this bill could be perfected. There \nwill be an opportunity in a humanitarian way to try to perfect our \nwork. Our work tonight, however, is to pass this legislation so that \nour President has a bill at the G-8. In furtherance of that, I note \nthat the pending amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota increases mandatory spending, and, if adopted, would cause \nthe underlying bill to exceed the committee section 302(a) allocations. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to \nsection 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthat act for the consideration of the pending amendment and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 48, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 178 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee in a colloquy regarding subtitle E, \nsection 364, of the Jobs and Growth Tax Reconciliation Act of 2003, S. \n1054.\n  This section would limit the deduction for charitable contributions \nof patents and similar properties. It is my understanding that this \nprovision would include a limitation on tax deductions for donation of \nthe following items: any patent, copyright, trademark, trade name, \ntrade secret, know-how, software, or similar property, or applications \nor registrations of such property. The effective date of this \nlimitation would apply to contributions made after May 7, 2003.\n  I have a specific concern about this provision.\n  I understand the intent behind this change is to eliminate abuses \nassociated with deductions claimed under IRC 170(e)(1)(B). What has \nresulted, however, is the unintended consequence of capturing \nlegitimate and pending contributions that were in the process of being \nformalized, but not enacted by the effective date.\n  Specifically, I am concerned about the impact of a pending \ntransaction between two organizations in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania. The process to formalize the referenced donation began in \nDecember 2002, with the targeted date of April 21, 2003, for a signed \nand completed transfer.\n  In an effort to clarify the impact of S. 1054 on this specific \npending transaction, the involved organizations have\n\n[[Page S6457]]\n\nworked with your staff to provide adequate background and substantial \ndocumentation to verify the legitimacy of the concern.\n  I inquire of the chairman of the Finance Committee if he would \ncomment on Section 364 of the bill, and my stated concern about a \npending transaction?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor raising this issue. He is correct that my staff has been working \nwith these organizations to obtain a fuller understanding of their \ntransaction. We have learned that there is widespread abuse involving \ndonations of patents and similar property. We made this provision \neffective May 7, 2003, so that abusive donations could not be rushed to \ncompletion if a later effective date was chosen.\n  We will continue our discussion with these organizations, and will \nobjectively consider their concerns and whether further clarifications \nare appropriate as the bill moves to conference.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Chairman Grassley, for your willingness to \nwork with me on this issue as the Jobs and Growth Tax Reconciliation \nAct of 2003 moves forward.\n\n\n                          Limitation Provision\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Frist, and wonder if I could ask him to address a concern I and \nother Senators have about a provision entitled ``Limitation'' which is \nlocated on page 62, line 13 of the bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This provision says that no funds made available to carry \nout this act may be used to provide assistance to any group or \norganization that does not have a policy ``explicitly opposing'' \nprostitution and sex trafficking. On its face, this provision appears \nharmless. No one here supports prostitution or sex trafficking. In \nfact, we abhor these practices, which are demeaning and degrading \ntowards women, and also extremely dangerous. The rate of HIV infection \namong prostitutes in Cambodia is estimated to be 40 percent. India is \nfacing a similar catastrophe. It is no secret that commercial sex \nworkers and sex trafficking are a major cause of HIV transmission in \nAsia and in parts of Africa. We all want to see these practices end.\n  But the reality is that they exist. Prostitution and sex trafficking \nare rampant, not only in parts of Africa and Asia, but in Eastern \nEurope and the former Soviet republics, the Caribbean, and parts of \nLatin America. Any effective strategy to combat HIV/AIDS must include \nprograms to reduce its spread through prostitution and sex trafficking. \nAs difficult as it is, this reality cannot be ignored.\n  There are organizations who work directly with commercial sex workers \nand women who have been the victims of trafficking, to educate them \nabout HIV/AIDS, to counsel them to get tested, to help them escape if \nthey are being held against their will, and to provide them with \ncondoms to protect themselves from infection. This work is not easy. It \ncan also be dangerous. It requires a relationship of trust between the \norganizations and the women who need protection.\n  I am concerned that this provision, which requires such organizations \nto explicitly oppose prostitution and sex trafficking, could impede \ntheir effectiveness. In fact, some or many of these organizations may \nrefuse to condemn the behavior of the women who trust they need in \norder to convince them to protect themselves against HIV. I would ask \nthe Majority Leader how we can avoid that result, because we need to be \nable to support these organizations.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his question. I agree \nthat these organizations who work with prostitutes and women who are \nthe victims of trafficking play an important role in preventing the \nspread of HIV/AIDS. We need to support these organizations, because HIV \ntransmission through this type of behavior is widespread in many parts \nof the world. At the same time, we do not want to condone, either \ndirectly or indirectly, prostitution or sex trafficking. Both are \nabhorrent.\n  I believe the answer is to include a statement in the contract or \ngrant agreement between the U.S. Government and such organization that \nthe organization is opposed to the practices of prostitution and sex \ntrafficking because of the psychological and physical risks they pose \nfor women. Such a statement, as part of the contract or grant \nagreement, would satisfy the intent of this provision.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the majority leader. I think that is important, \nbecause we do not want to impose requirements which have the unintended \nresult of impeding the ability of these organizations to do their work, \nor interfering with our ability to support them.\n\n\n                              section 333\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nask the Chairman of the Finance Committee about the Committee's intent \nwith respect to Section 333, the section entitled ``Denial of Deduction \nfor Certain Fines, Penalties, and Other Amounts.'' As currently \ndrafted, Section 333 eliminates tax deductions for amounts paid or \nincurred at the direction of a governmental entity in relation to the \nviolation of any law or the investigation or inquiry into the potential \nviolation of any law.\n  Although I appreciate the Chairman's intent, I am concerned that this \nprovision is drafted too broadly and applies to fees and compliance \nexpenses that are mandated by regulators and that depository \ninstitutions must pay. For example, banks and thrifts are subject to \nroutine, as well as special, examinations as part of supervisory \nreviews by State regulators, the FDIC, the Office of Comptroller of the \nCurrency, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of Thrift \nSupervision. The purpose of these supervisory examinations is to ensure \nthat depository institutions are operating in a safe and sound manner \nand in full compliance with regulations. Institutions are then required \nto correct any deficiencies.\n  Currently, Section 333 could be interpreted to eliminate the \ndeductibility of these fees because they relate to examinations, which \nare, to some extent, inquiries into potential violations. Also, this \nSection could be interpreted to preclude tax deductions for remedial \nmeasures undertaken pursuant to a regulator's order, or to address \nconcerns raised in an examination. As a result, we could be in a \nsituation where the regulators are requiring audits or imposing other \ncompliance-related costs, but the companies are prohibited from taking \ndeductions for the required payments.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate the concern of the Senator from Alabama \nwith respect to Section 333. It was not the Committee's intent to \nprohibit deductions for amounts paid by companies as a condition to \ntheir operation in a regulated industry.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I too am concerned that the language of \nSection 333 could have unintended consequences. It was my understanding \nthat Section 333 was intended to exclude certain payments.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Maryland is correct. The Committee \naddressed this issue in its publication entitled: ``Technical \nExplanation of Provisions Approved by the Committee on May 8, 2003.'' \nFootnote 164 of this publication states:\n\n       The bill does not affect amounts paid or incurred in \n     performing routine audits or reviews such as annual audits \n     that are required of all organizations or individuals in a \n     similar business sector, or profession, as a requirement for \n     being allowed to conduct business. However, if the government \n     or regulator raised an issue of compliance and a payment is \n     required in settlement of such issue, the bill would affect \n     that payment.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would ask that the Chairman clarify the text of Section \n333 in order to specifically exclude such payments.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is my intention to amend and clarify Section 333 in \nthe conference report in order to reflect the Senators' comments and to \ncarve-out certain fees and expenses paid by companies operating in \nhighly-regulated industries.\n  Mr. SHELBY. In addition we have received letters from Chairman \nGreenspan of the Federal Reserve Board, Director Gilleran of the Office \nof Thrift Supervision and Chairman Powell of the FDIC expressing their \nconcern regarding the breadth of Section 333. At this time, I would \nlike to incorporate these letters into the Record. Mr. Chairman, thank \nyou for your attention to an issue that is of great importance to many \ncompanies in a variety\n\n[[Page S6458]]\n\nof industries. I look forward to working with the Chairman to amend the \ntext of Section 333 in the conference report.\n\n\n                              syndication\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I want to bring to the Chairman's attention \na matter that has arisen regarding the bonus depreciation provision \nthat was enacted last year in the Job Creation and Worker Assistance \nAct of 2002. When the House developed this provision, it wanted to \nensure that the provision would stimulate the production of new, as \nopposed to ``used'', equipment and other products. Thus, the additional \ndepreciation deduction was restricted to those taxpayers who first \n``used'' the product. Inadvertently, the ``original use'' requirement \nof this provision excluded many of the transactions in heavy equipment \nthat the provision was intended to stimulate. Specifically, the \nprovision inadvertently excluded multi-unit sales of equipment that \nwere placed in service by manufacturers over a period of time and then \nsold to the ultimate purchaser of the equipment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is correct. The Senator from Oregon refers to a \ncommon form of financing transportation and other equipment that \ninvolves the production of numerous units, all subject to a common \nlease. We refer to this form of financing as ``syndication''.\n  Mr. SMITH. I have language that would correct this oversight in the \noriginal 2002 Act. My language would ensure that sales of equipment \nwhich involve numerous units of the same good, subject to the same \nlease, would not inadvertently be excluded from the bonus depreciation \nbenefits of the 2002 Act, simply because the manufacturer was placing \nthe goods into service as they were being manufactured, prior to his \nultimate sale of the goods, subject to the master lease, to the \nultimate purchaser. My language would ensure that no abuse of the bonus \ndepreciation could occur and that the final sale of the products occurs \nwithin a short period of time. I would ask the Chairman to reassure the \nmany heavy manufacturers of the United States and the purchasers of new \nequipment that this oversight in the 2002 Act will be rectified when \nthe House and Senate meet in conference to iron out the differences in \nour respective tax legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I can assure the Senator from Oregon that I support the \neffort to clarify this situation in conference and ensure that the 2002 \nbonus depreciation provision is available to purchasers of equipment \npursuant to this method of financing multi-unit sales of heavy \nequipment. I thank the Senator for bringing this inadvertent error in \nthe original 2002 Act to my attention.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator. I propose that the conference adopt \nlanguage to clarify this unfortunate oversight.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate the Senator from Oregon providing me with \nthis information. This is a serious oversight in the original language \nand I will work closely with the Senator to ensure that this is \ncorrected in conference with the House.\n  Mr. SMITH. I sincerely appreciate the Chairman's support and the good \nwork he is doing as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n\n                         income forecast method\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus, regarding a provision \nin the bill that provides needed clarification and helps to insure an \naccurate reflection of taxpayers' income.\n  The provision I refer to resolves certain uncertainties that have \narisen recently regarding the proper application of the income forecast \nmethod, which is the predominant cost recovery method for films, \nvideotapes, and sound recordings. The provision merely reinforces the \ncontinued efficacy of existing case law and longstanding industry \npractice. For example, the provision clarifies that, for purposes of \nthe income forecast method, the anticipated costs of participations and \nresiduals may be included in a property's cost basis at the beginning \nof the property's depreciable life. This was the holding of the Ninth \nCircuit in Transamerica Corporation v. U.S. (1993). The provision also \nclarifies that the Tax Court's holding in Associated Patentees v. \nComm., 4 TC 979 (1945), remains valid law. Thus, taxpayers may elect to \ndeduct participations and residuals as they are paid. Finally, the \nprovision clarifies that the income forecast formula is calculated \nusing gross income, without reduction for distribution costs.\n  I would like to confirm my understanding with Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus that by providing these clarifications and eliminating \nuncertainty the provision was intended to put to rest needless and \ncostly disputes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am happy to confirm the understanding of the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana. The provision was adopted to \nprovide needed clarifications in order to eliminate the uncertainties \nthat have arisen regarding the proper application of the income \nforecast method. I believe the disputes that have arisen regarding the \nmechanics of the income forecast formula are extremely unproductive and \nan inefficient use of both taxpayer and limited tax administration \nresources. By adopting these clarifications, I believe the committee \nintended to end any disputes and prevent any further waste of both \ntaxpayer and Government resources in resolving these disputes. Any \nexisting disputes should be resolved expeditiously in a manner \nconsistent with the clarifications included in the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley. The disputes resulting from any \nuncertainty regarding the proper application of the income forecast \nmethod are extremely unproductive and wasteful. To avoid further waste, \nresolution of any disputes must be resolved in a manner consistent with \nthe clarifications contained in the bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank both of my distinguished colleagues for this \nimportant clarification. I hope this puts to rest any uncertainty and \nwasteful disputes regarding the proper application of the income \nforecast method.\n\n\n                               dividends\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would like to engage the distinguished chairmen of the \nSenate Budget and Finance Committees in a colloquy on the Budget \nCommittee chairman's dividends amendment. As my colleagues are aware, \nno provision of the economic growth package is more important to me \nthan my amendment providing $20 billion in short-term fiscal relief to \nStates and localities. If we are to kick-start our economy through \nFederal tax relief, we must help our States avoid raising taxes and \nslashing spending. And in the process of passing this bill, the last \nthing we can afford is to exacerbate the States' fiscal woes.\n  I am therefore concerned that the language of the Budget Committee \nchairman's dividends amendment does not adequately protect States from \nrevenue loss. As you know, I cannot vote for a dividends amendment that \nwould lessen the benefits of my fiscal relief provision without an \nassurance that it would be fixed in conference. I therefore seek the \nassurances of the distinguished Budget and Finance Committee chairmen \nthat they will do all they can in conference to protect States from \nrevenue loss associated with any dividends provisions in the final \nbill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I, too, believe that there is no more \nimportant component of this bill than its fiscal relief provisions, and \nI have serious reservations over any dividends language that would \nfurther hurt the States that we are trying to help. I join my colleague \nfrom Maine in asking my colleagues, the distinguished chairmen of the \nSenate Budget and Finance Committees, for assurances that they will do \nall they can in conference to prevent States from losing revenue as a \nresult of any dividends language.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the distinguished Senators from Maine and \nNebraska for raising this issue again. They have carried the torch for \nthe States throughout the debates on the budget and an economic growth \npackage.\n  I am pleased to provide the assurances that my colleagues seek. The \nintent behind my amendment is not to add to the fiscal plight of \nStates, and I will do all I can to ensure that any dividends language \nthat emerges from conference does not cause States to lose tax \nrevenues.\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would echo the comments of my colleague from \nOklahoma. I, too, will do all that I can in conference to ensure that \nStates revenues are not reduced by any dividends provisions that are \nincluded in the final product.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my distinguished colleagues, both for their \nassurances and for their leadership in putting together a growth \npackage that can stimulate the economy and create new jobs.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I, too, thank my colleagues for their \nassurances.\n\n\n     Colloquy between Senator Ensign and Chairman Grassley on the \n             Depreciation Treatment of Hospitality Business\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, the Chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  First of all, I want to commend my distinguished colleague for his \nstrong leadership in crafting the tax cut package before us today that \nis so critical to creating new jobs and building economic growth for \nthe citizens of my State of Nevada and across the country.\n  I would say to my distinguished colleague that I am very concerned \nabout recent efforts by the IRS to carve up integrated hotels, \nrestaurants, and casino businesses into different pieces subject to \ndifferent depreciation treatment.\n  Equipment, furniture, and similar personal property used in the \nhospitality business, and in the retail industry more generally, have \nlong been depreciable over a 5-year period. However, the IRS is now \nasserting on audit that the tables, chairs, carpeting, and other \nfurniture and equipment used in the gaming portion of such hospitality \nfacilities must be depreciated over a longer 7-year period used for \nminiature golf courses and bowling alleys, while the same table, chair, \nand carpeting 10 feet away in the hotel portion of the facility \ncontinue to be depreciated over 5 years.\n  The IRS has promulgated no regulation on this point and is unable to \ncite any applicable statutory or judicial authority for its assertion \non audit.\n  In the face of this uncertainty, I would ask the chairman of the \nFinance Committee to clarify whether these efforts by the IRS are \nconsistent with the congressional intent of the depreciation provisions \nof the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If the Senator will yield, I would say to my \ndistinguished colleague from Nevada that I share his concerns and that \nit may not properly reflect congressional intent for the IRS to \nseparate an integrated hotel, restaurant, and casino business into \ndifferent pieces subject to different depreciation treatment. \nEquipment, furniture, and similar personal property used in a such a \nbusiness should be depreciable in accordance with the current law \ntreatment of the hotel industry and the retail industry generally. I \nwill be happy to work with the Senator to provide appropriate \nclarification for depreciation of assets used for gaming in the \nhospitality industry.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 545\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this Republican tax bill provides lavish \nsupport for the wealthy, but it gives only the back of its hand to \nAmerica's senior citizens. This amendment changes those backward \npriorities. It eliminates the dividend tax cut and the cut in the top \nrate bracket, and uses the funds to pay for a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit for the elderly.\n  The two tax cuts my amendment eliminates will primarily benefit the \nrich. Prescription drug coverage under Medicare will benefit 40 million \nsenior citizens and the disabled individuals, who are overwhelmingly of \nmodest means and typically have high medical costs. These men and women \nhave stood by our country through war and depression. Giving them the \nmedical care they deserve is a higher priority than giving the wealthy \neven greater wealth. When Republicans side with the wealthy, they call \nit free enterprise. When senior citizens ask for fair treatment, \nRepublicans call it class warfare.\n  Medicare is not class warfare. It's a solemn promise between \ngovernment and the American people. It says, ``Play by the rules, \ncontribute to the system during your working years, and you will have \nhealth security in your retirement years.'' Because of Medicare, the \nelderly have long had insurance for their hospital bills and their \ndoctors bills. But the promise of health security at the core of \nMedicare is broken every day because Medicare does not cover the \nsoaring price of prescription drugs.\n  Too many elderly citizens must choose between food on the table and \nthe medicine they need. Too many elderly Americans are taking only half \nthe drugs their doctor prescribes--or none at all--because they can't \nafford them. Today, the average senior citizen has an income of \n$14,000--and prescription drug bills of $1,500, and many senior \ncitizens pay far more than that.\n  Every day, senior citizens face the harsh fact that prescription drug \ncosts are going through the roof, while their incomes are stagnating. \nOver the last four years, prescription drug costs have gone up by 16 \npercent a year, while the Social Security benefits on which senior \ncitizens depend have gone up only 2.3 percent a year. Hard-pressed \nemployers are cutting back on retiree prescription drug coverage--and \nsome retirees are losing their coverage altogether, because their \nformer employers are now bankrupt.\n  While millionaires receive huge tax breaks they do not need under the \nRepublican tax plan, the Republican budget shortchanges senior citizens \nwho desperately need prescription drug coverage. Prescription drug \nspending for senior citizens will total $1.8 trillion over the next \ndecade but the Republican budget allocates only $400 billion for \nMedicare.\n  Even worse, the Republican budget's $400 billion for Medicare isn't \neven reserved for prescription drug coverage. The President wants to \nspend tens of billions of this amount on so-called reforms to force \nsenior citizens to give up Medicare and join HMOs or other private \ninsurance plans. Relief for hard-pressed doctors, hospital, home health \nagencies, and nursing homes is also supposed to come out of this \nminimal allocation.\n  It is important for every Senator to understand who it is that \nMedicare protects--and who it is that the Bush administration would \nforce into an HMO or other private insurance plan. The typical Medicare \nenrollee is a 75-year-old widow, living alone. Her total income is just \n$11,300 a year. She has at least one chronic condition and suffers from \narthritis. In her younger years, she and her husband worked hard. They \nraised a family. They stood by this country through economic hard \ntimes, the Second World War, the Korean war, and the cold war. They \nsacrificed to protect and build a better country--not just for their \nchildren but for all of us.\n  This is the woman Republicans want to force to give up her doctor and \njoin an HMO. This is the woman they say should give up her freedom to \ngo to the physician and hospital of her choice, so that HMOs can \nprofit. This is the woman who would be victimized if Congress allows \nthe GOP plan for Medicare to become law.\n  Senior citizens deserve prescription drug coverage--no ifs, ands, or \nbuts. Republicans say Medicare is a failed program--but millions of \nsenior citizens know better. Republicans believe that the private \nsector does a better job of controlling costs than Medicare--but \nstudies show the reserve is true. Republicans say senior citizens \nshould be forced to give up the doctors they trust, so that HMOs and \nprivate insurance plans can enjoy higher profits--but the American \npeople don't agree; and the U.S. Senate shouldn't agree either.\n  Senior citizens are faced with a deadly double whammy. Prescription \ndrug costs are out of control, and private insurance coverage is drying \nup. Last year, prescription drug costs soared by a whopping 14 percent. \nThey have shot up at double-digit rates in each of the last five years. \nWhether we are talking about employee retirement plans, Medigap \ncoverage, or Medicare HMOs, prescription drug coverage is skyrocketing \nin cost, and becoming more and more out of reach by the elderly.\n  It used to be that the only seniors with reliable, adequate, \naffordable coverage were the very poor on Medicaid. Today, because of \nthe state fiscal crisis created by the recession and the let-them-eat-\ncake attitude of the Republican party, even the poorest of the poor can \nno longer count on protection.\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\nStates are now facing the largest budget deficits in half a century--an \nestimated $26 billion this year, and $70 billion next year.\n  The result is that States are cutting back on prescription drug \ncoverage for those least able to pay. Thirty-nine States expect to cut \ntheir Medicaid drug benefit this year. In Massachusetts, 80,000 senior \ncitizens were about to lose their prescription drug coverage under the \nState's Senior Advantage program on July 1. Emergency action by the \nState legislature saved the program, but only after making substantial \nreductions in coverage.\n  Tax cuts in this Republican bill will make the States' fiscal \nsituation even worse. Because State taxes are often pegged to the \nFederal system, the dividend tax cut alone will cost States $11 billion \nover the next 10 years.\n  Ten million of the elderly enjoy high quality, affordable retirement \ncoverage through a former employer. But retiree coverage is plummeting \ntoo. In just 8 years--from 1994 to 2002--the number of firms offering \nretiree coverage fell by a massive 40 percent.\n  Medicare HMOs are also drastically cutting back. Since 1999, more \nthan 2 million Medicare beneficiaries have been dropped by their \nMedicare HMOs. Of the HMOs that remain in the program, more than 70 \npercent limit drug coverage to a meager $500 a year or less, and more \nthan half only pay for generic drugs. Medigap plans that offer drug \ncoverage are priced out of reach for most seniors--and even the \ncoverage offered is severely limited.\n  Thirteen million Medicare beneficiaries have no prescription drug \ncoverage at all. Only half of all senior citizens have coverage \nthroughout the year.\n  Previous Republican proposals have shown what happens to senior \ncitizens when funds are inadequate. High deductibles, gaps in coverage, \ndemeaning asset tests, and incentives for employers to drop retiree \ncoverage are just some of the unacceptable features of programs that \ngive crumbs to the elderly and plums to the wealthy.\n  This amendment strikes two provisions of the tax bill that primarily \nbenefit the rich, in order to provide funds to give the elderly the \nprescription drug benefit they deserve. The first provision the \namendment strikes speeds up the reduction of the top tax rate from 38.6 \npercent to 36 percent. Virtually all the benefits of this Republican \ntax rate reduction go to people earning more than $310,000 a year. \nPeople earning a million dollars a year or more will receive a tax cut \nof $60,000. I ask Members of the Senate: Do persons with a million \ndollars in income a year really need another $60,000 in tax cuts? \nSurely, our values and priorities have not become so warped that we \nthink it is more important for millionaires to be richer than it is for \nsenior citizens to have life-saving prescription drugs.\n  The second provision the amendment strikes is the dividend tax cut. \nThat cut does virtually nothing for senior citizens and everything for \nthe wealthy. The provision in the bill is only a partial elimination of \nthe tax on dividends, but its intention is clearly to set the stage for \nfull repeal of the tax. The full repeal would certainly be welcomed by \nmillionaires. They will get an average tax break of $52,000. But a low-\nincome elderly person with $8,600 in income will get a tax cut \naveraging $1. And the average elderly person with an income of $14,000 \nwill get a tax cut of $26. Do the Members of the Senate really believe \nthis is the right priority for our country?\n  The funds saved from this amendment--$115 billion over 10 years--will \nbe used to provide a better prescription drug benefit than will be \npossible if this tax bill passes in its current form. Passing this \namendment will be a clear statement by the Senate that mending the \nbroken promise of Medicare is more important than lavishing unneeded \nand undeserved new tax breaks on millionaires.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Kennedy to extend unemployment benefits for millions \nof Americans. These fellow citizens are out of work through no fault of \ntheir own. They need our help, and by extending their benefits, we will \nalso help stimulate our struggling economy.\n  In my own State of Washington, we have lost over 80,000 jobs since 9/\n11. The Kennedy amendment would help some 102,000 workers in my state \nwho will exhaust their benefits over the next few months. It will help \nnearly 4 million workers nationwide.\n  These are people who want to work and who are looking for jobs but \ncan't find them in our slow economy. It is not easy to find a job in \nthis economy. Just listen to these statistics. The average number of \njobs for which unemployed adults have applied is 29. The average for \nthose who have been unemployed for 9 months or more is 39, and \nunemployed adults over 44 years old apply for an average of 42 jobs \nbefore they find work.\n  Despite these efforts, these workers are now being threatened with \nmortgage foreclosures and repossession of their vehicles. One in four \nunemployed workers has had to move to other housing or move in with \nfriends or relatives.\n  They are facing problems in health care. For instance, one-third of \nthe unemployed were once covered by health insurance, but now they have \nlost these benefits because they have lost their jobs.\n  They are spending less on food, medical care and clothing for their \nchildren.\n  I know these workers will help provide a real and immediate stimulus \nfor our economy because they will buy groceries, pay their utility \nbills, make house payments and pay for other essential needs for their \nday to day existence. Nearly 80 percent of these workers say that \nunemployment benefits have been very important in helping their \nfamilies meet their basic needs.\n  In fact, a recent study by Economy.com found that the single most \neffective stimulus measure would be an extension of unemployment \ncompensation benefits. The study also found that each dollar dedicated \nto extending the program would boost the economy by $1.73, while each \ndollar connected to reducing the taxation of dividends would boost the \neconomy by just nine cents.\n  So I urge my colleagues to extend unemployment benefits for these \nworkers. They need and deserve our help, and helping them will directly \nhelp our economy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 557\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nSchumer's amendment to expand the higher education tax deduction. This \namendment would make the higher education tax deduction permanent and \nincrease the amount that taxpayers can claim for a deduction. The \nhigher education tax deduction helps families afford a college \neducation at a time when tuition increases are outpacing the cost of \ninflation. Families need help to be able to give their children the \nopportunities and support needed for a good solid education.\n  In our information-based economy, the value of a good education is \nthe key to success. I know this from personal experience. When I left \nthe House of Representatives, I went to work for a high technology \ncompany in Seattle, WA. I did not have any expertise or knowledge in \nthis area, but because I had a solid education that gave me the \nfoundation to learn on the job, I was able to learn quickly and thrive \nin my new environment. That is the value of a good education.\n  My experience is hardly unique. According to the Department of Labor, \nthe typical worker will change jobs nine times during his or her \ncareer.\n  When workers change jobs, they will find that more and more \nemployment opportunities require a college degree. Eight of the 10 \nfastest-growing occupations require at least a bachelor's degree. At \nthe same time, jobs for people who have not attended college are \nquickly disappearing. Twenty-three of the 25 fastest-declining careers \ndo not require a degree.\n  A college degree is no longer a luxury--it is an imperative.\n  There is a ``perfect storm'' brewing at colleges across this country \nthat is making it increasingly difficult for families to afford a \ncollege education. First, endowment earnings are down, significantly \nreducing revenue for colleges and universities. Second, the economy has \nbeen sluggish for so long that corporate and individual charitable \ngiving has been reduced across the country. Third, the sluggish economy \nhas put State budgets across the country in crisis. All of these \nfactors are contributing to the skyrocketing costs of college tuitions.\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\n  In Washington State, the legislature has significantly cut funding \nfor higher education and that means tuition is going up. In just the \nlast 2 years, tuition at 4-year universities and two-year colleges has \nincreased by 12 percent each year. Over the past decade, tuition at the \nUniversity of Washington has shot up an astounding 103 percent.\n  This trend is not limited to my State.\n  The vast majority of American families rely in part on federal aid to \nhelp finance their children's college education. A recent General \nAccounting Office report illustrated this point. It found that more \nthan 75 percent of all undergraduate students receive some form of \nfederal financial assistance. In addition, more than 40 percent of all \nundergraduate students benefit from a higher education tax credit.\n  With the cost of tuition on the rise, we can expect that even more \nfamilies will require aid to send their kids to college.\n  We cannot let the opportunities of higher education slip out of \nreach. Expanding access to federal financial aid is a critical long-\nterm investment in our workforce, and in our economy.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 575\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I voted to sustain the point of order against the Kyl \namendment because there needs to be more analysis as to its ultimate \neffects. The amendment is very complicated. I tried to determine the \neffects of the legislation in the absence of hearings, and could only \nbegin to scratch the surface due to the many conflicting \nrepresentations from various parties. We have not had the necessary \nfoundation established as to the effects of this amendment.\n  There are many facts that should be developed before we embark on \nthis course of action. Either the Finance Committee or the Judiciary \nCommittee should hear from the parties involved, including the States, \nand develop a factual record as to what occurred during the course of \nthe litigation. Senators should have access to the record on these \nissues through the hearing process. After the facts have been \ndeveloped, then a determination should be made on the issue. It is not \na timely decision absent the development of such a record.\n  I am prepared to participate in hearings, find the facts and make an \ninformed judgment on whether sound public policy would be served by a \nmechanism, through the tax code or otherwise, to limit compensation for \nanyone in the marketplace.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 575\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona. This amendment would \nretroactively breach the contracts entered into by States and their \nattorneys, and the settlement agreement reached in the tobacco-related \nMedicaid expenses litigation.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the context in which this historic \ntobacco settlement came about. There were over 40 years of law suits \nbrought against tobacco companies, occurring over three different time \nperiods.\n  When these attorneys brought this litigation, cases against tobacco \ncompanies would go on for years and years, almost always with little or \nno favorable results. In order to catch the deception and subterfuge of \nthese companies, these cases needed staying power. The attorneys \nbringing these cases needed the ability to withstand significant losses \nwhile they uncovered the facts needed to make the damning case that the \ntobacco companies had been hiding from the public.\n  The plaintiffs' attorneys undertook this riskiest of cases against \ndaunting odds, with a high likelihood of never getting paid at all. In \nthe first phase of tobacco litigation, no one was able to muster the \nresources needed to bring these cases. Then a group of attorneys in the \npublic interest pooled over $100 million of their own money in order to \nwithstand the onslaught put up by tobacco companies bent on hiding the \ntruth from the public.\n  The tobacco companies spent approximately $700 million a year in \nlegal fees to their lawyers during this period. Thanks to their \ntenacity, their legal skill, and the righteousness of their cause, in \nthe end the attorneys who brought this action prevailed. They secured a \nsettlement that returned $246 billion to the States. That is \n``billion'' with a ``b.'' To put it in perspective, that is almost as \nlarge as our entire budget deficit.\n  Let me say that again the tobacco settlements resulted in a huge \nwindfall for the States and for the American people. I daresay that, in \nthis day and age when State budgets are more squeezed than ever as a \nresult of Federal cuts and unfunded mandates, if the States were \noffered this deal again, including the attorney's fees, they would take \nthe deal in a heartbeat. In a heartbeat.\n  And the money collected by the States under this settlement is only \nthe beginning. The settlement funds a new public education program to \nreduce youth tobacco use; it provides money every year for tobacco-\nrelated research; it dissolves the organizations that have historically \nserved as the tobacco companies' propaganda machines; and it prohibits \ntobacco advertising aimed at children, such as the use of cartoon \ncharacters.\n  Supporters of this amendment would have you believe that its \nprovisions somehow make the existing system fairer. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  The American way is to reward those who take a risk and succeed. We \ngrant patents that protect inventions for 17 years. We give copyright \nowners exclusive rights to their works for their entire life, plus \nanother 70 years. More importantly, we don't punish people who come up \nwith a great idea and turn it into a success. To the contrary we let \nthem keep the fruits of their labor. But under the logic of this \namendment, we would seek to penalize Bill Gates' $40 billion net worth, \nsimply because he started with little more than a great idea and a \nvision to make it happen, took the risk, and prevailed. Just like these \nattorneys who brought the tobacco cases.\n  Supporters of this bill would also have you believe that it is only \nthe trial lawyers and their supporters who oppose this amendment. \nNothing could be further from the truth. Among others, consumer \nadvocates people who look out for the little guy strongly oppose this \namendment.\n  I also find it ironic that this amendment, which would abrogate a \nsettlement entered into by the States, is being offered by some of the \nvery same Senators who have made a career of advocating for States \nrights. This amendment, which would abrogate the contractual rights of \nprivate parties, is being offered by some of the very same Senators who \nhave made a career of upholding the right to enter into contracts \nwithout undue regulation.\n  Just to be clear my colleagues refuse to interfere in the right of \nStates to send defendants to execution without competent counsel, but \ninsist on interfering to undo an agreement where the States reap $246 \nbillion from the tobacco companies. Quite simply, they have got their \npriorities backwards.\n  I might also remind my colleagues of one other historical fact: Some \nof the Senators who are pushing this amendment today are the same folks \nwho, just a few years ago, were doing everything in their power to \ndefeat Federal attempts to force the tobacco companies to pay for the \nhuge damages they have inflicted on the American people. Fortunately \nfor the American people, and for the 50 States, they failed. Now, \nhowever, they are trying to undo this successful settlement after the \nfact.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is America. We make deals and we stick to \nthem. We do not go back on our word. I urge you to oppose this \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 594\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor and support \namendment No. 594 being offered by the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee with respect to the Medicare Program.\n  The amendment provides approximately $25 billion over 10 years to \nreduce the inequity in the Medicare Program between urban and rural \nareas and between the States that has so penalized health care \nproviders in New Mexico and includes language from four bills that I \nhave either introduced this year or introduced last year.\n  First, I am pleased the Grassley amendment includes the language from \nS. 379, the Medicare Incentive Payment Program Improvement Act of 2003, \nwhich I introduced with Senator Thomas and makes automatic the 10 \npercent bonus payment intended to physicians\n\n[[Page S6462]]\n\nin rural, medically underserved areas. Under current law, physicians \nmust go through a cumbersome application process, if they even know \nthey are eligible and can apply, and subject themselves to increased \nscrutiny for audits if they do apply. Consequently, few doctors are \nreceiving the payment intended to provide physicians incentives to \ntreat Medicare patients in medically underserved areas and to retain \nthose doctors already providing services in those areas.\n  Second, the Grassley amendment includes language that significantly \nreduces the geographic inequities that are a part of the current \nMedicare physician payment system and disadvantages New Mexico \nphysicians. This language is similar to that in S. 881, the Rural \nEquity Payment Index Reform, REPaIR, Act of 2003, which I introduced \nwith Senator Cochran and is a companion bill to H.R. 33, introduced in \nthe House of Representatives by Representative Bereuter. Reducing the \ninequity in just the work component of the physician payment schedule \nwill increase payments to New Mexico physicians by an estimated $3 \nmillion annually.\n  Third, this amendment includes language from legislation I introduced \nlate last year entitled the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Department \nFair Payment Act with Senator Snowe to extend the hold harmless for \nrural hospitals in outpatient departments, and adds a 5 percent add-on \npayment for clinics and emergency room visits in rural hospitals.\n  And fourth, the amendment lifts the rural cap in the Medicare \ndisproportionate share hospital, DSH, program, which comes from the \nMedicare Safety Net Hospital Improvement Act that I introduced last \nyear with Senator Roberts. This provision will add an estimated $4 \nmillion annually to New Mexico rural hospitals.\n  In addition, I would like to applaud the chairman for including \nlanguage from legislation, S. 816, introduced by Senator Conrad that I \nwas an original cosponsor of and entitled the Health Care access and \nRural Equity Act. Among other things, the language eliminates the \ndisparity in hospital payments caused by the differential paid to rural \nand small urban hospitals compared to large urban hospitals and \nsignificantly reduces the disparity caused by the wage index in the \nhospital payment formula. Although rather arcane provisions in the \nhospital payment formula, they result in significant disparities in \npayments and the changes will have an important impact on hospitals \nthroughout New Mexico.\n  Before closing, I would like to express profound concern with respect \nto the offsets used by the amendment, which include the addition of \ncopayments for clinical services and the impact the change in payments \nfor outpatient department prescription drugs will have on oncology \nphysicians. However, Chairman Grassley has committed to work to address \nthe need for a revision in payments to oncology doctors and we will \nwork to change the language with respect to copayments for clinical \nlaboratory services as this language moves forward.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to explain my vote against the Grassley amendment during \nconsideration of the tax bill.\n  Since joining the Senate in 2001, I have been an avid and consistent \nsupporter of rural health care and Medicare providers.\n  It was a hard decision to vote against this amendment. However, I \ncould not in good conscience, support an amendment that as an offset \nwould increase out-of-pocket expense for our Nation's seniors.\n  Medicare beneficiaries are already coping with having to choose to \nbuy their medicines or put food on the table. They are struggling to \npay for their share of health care costs, and even increased health \nplan premiums. It is unconscionable to think that we would ask them to \nmeet deductibles and make copayments on outpatient lab services--\nsomething they have not had to pay for in the past. At this point, no \nconcrete analysis is available showing the impact this would have on \nseniors and their out-of-pocket costs.\n  At a time when we are growing increasingly concerned about how much \nseniors are having to spend to access the care they need, how can we \nask them to pay more? We have not even delivered the promise of a \ncomprehensive outpatient prescription drug benefit.\n  I was prepared to support Senator Harkin's amendment--which he \nwithdrew. That amendment, which included many of the provisions in the \nGrassley amendment, would have resulted in over $870 million to \nFlorida's hospitals over the next 10 years. That amendment, however, \neliminated the dividend tax cut beyond the initial $500--an offset I \ncould support.\n  Last year, I was a cosponsor of the Beneficiary Access to Care and \nMedicare Equity Act of 2002. This bill, by Senator Baucus, included a \nmyriad of provisions benefiting rural health care providers, and as a \nresult, beneficiaries residing in rural areas.\n  Furthermore, earlier this year, during consideration of the budget \ndebate, I supported an amendment by Senator Harkin to help rural health \ncare providers and hospitals receive a fair reimbursement for services \nunder Medicare. That amendment reduced tax cuts to the wealthiest \nincome brackets--an offset I could support.\n  I am committed to improving the state of health care in our rural \ncommunities and will continue looking for ways to do so, but not on the \nbacks of our Nation's seniors.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 596\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I regret that I was detained in my effort \nto return to the floor, from another appointment, to vote on the \nCollins amendment, No. 596. Had I been present, I would have voted in \nfavor of the amendment. I have been speaking again this week with our \nGovernor of Idaho about the current fiscal difficulties faced by State \nand local governments. In both his role as Governor of our State and as \nthe incoming chairman of the National Governors Association, Governor \nKempthorne has eloquently argued the case for Congress to work with the \nStates to address this situation. I am pleased that the Senate today \ncould come to bipartisan agreement in its approach to temporary fiscal \nrelief.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 654\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President. I commend my colleagues for their work \non this important amendment, which injects much needed flexibility and \nfunding for safety net hospitals that treat especially vulnerable \npopulations. This amendment alleviates pressure on those hospitals and \nallows ``extremely low-DSH States'' to increase Medicaid DSH allotments \nto 3 percent in Fiscal Year 2004. Currently, Federal law restricts \nMedicaid DSH allotments to ``extremely low-DSH States'' to only 1 \npercent of Medicaid Program costs.\n  I thank Senators Bingaman and Domenici for their work and for their \ndogged commitment to the cause. I have supported low DSH improvement \nlegislation in the past, and I am thankful for their leadership on this \nimportant issue this year.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman and \nranking member of the Finance Committee, Senators Grassley and Baucus, \nfor agreeing to accept the language in the amendment being offered by \nme and Senators Enzi, Lincoln, Smith, and Nelson of Nebraska, that \nwould increase the Federal allotment to States for Medicaid \ndisproportionate share hospital, or DSH, payments to what are called \n``extremely low-DSH States'' from 1 percent of overall Medicaid \nspending in each State to 3 percent. The language comes from \nlegislation, S. 204, that I introduced with Senators Enzi, Lincoln, \nBaucus, Smith Harkin, Domenici, Johnson, Nelson of Nebraska, and \nDayton, and was cosponsored by Senators Pryor, Dorgan, and Daschle, \nentitled the Medicaid Safety Net Improvement Act of 2003.\n  This amendment is important to the continued survival of many of our \nNation's safety net hospitals that provide critical health care access \nto a number of our Nation's 41.2 million uninsured citizens, including \n373,000 in New Mexico, through the Medicaid disproportionate share \nhospital, or DSH, program.\n  At a time of growing numbers of uninsured and increased financial \nstrain on our Nations' safety net, we need to increase the ability of \n``extremely low-DSH States' to address the problems facing their safety \nnet and to reduce\n\n[[Page S6463]]\n\nthe current inequity in funding among the States. In fact, many \nhospitals have resorted to cutting services or eliminating jobs to deal \nwith the growing uncompensated care problem, and it threatens the \nhealth care safety net across this country.\n  At Memorial Medical Center in Las Cruces, NM, the hospital recently \nannounced the elimination of its maternity and mental health care \nservices due to the rapidly growing burden of uncompensated care. While \nthe elimination of those services has been temporarily forestalled, the \nuncompensated care burden and bottom line deficits at that hospital \nremain and the personnel layoffs of over 100 staff members in that \ncommunity has already occurred.\n  Indeed, the stories about the growing burden on hospital emergency \nrooms across the country are well known. This is completely and \ndirectly related to the economic recession facing our country and makes \nthis amendment directly relevant to this legislation.\n  It is also why the amendment has the support of the American \nAssociation, the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health \nSystems, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the \nFederation of American Hospitals, the Association of American Medical \nColleges, and the Catholic Health Association of the United States. As \nthey write, ``Today, safety net hospitals face a confluence of \nchallenges--including increased uncompensated care as more Americans \nfind themselves without health insurance--that put critical pressure on \nhospitals' ability to serve their entire communities.''\n  The 20 States that would benefit from this amendment include: Alaska, \nArkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, \nMontana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South \nDakota, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. I would add that the \nlegislation does not impact the Federal DSH allotments in other States \nbut only seeks to give ``extremely low-DSH States'' the ability to \nrespond to the growing burdens of uncompensated care in their States.\n  I would note that Hawaii and Tennessee have been included in their \namendment because their respective States currently do not have DSH \nprograms and are prohibited from making such payments. The amendment \nprovides them that authority under certain circumstances.\n  I would like to once again thank Senator Grassley and his staff \nmembers, Ted Totman, Colan Roskey, Jennifer Bell, and Leah Kegler, \nSenator Baucus and his staff members, Bill Dauster, Liz Fowler, Kate \nKirchgraber, and Andrea Cohen, for their help in getting this amendment \npassed. In addition, this would have never come to fruition without the \nstrong support by Senators Enzi, Lincoln, Smith, Nelson of Nebraska, \nand the other cosponsors of S. 204.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 666\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am in support of the Dorgan amendment \nto the reconciliation tax cut bill that would strike a provision in the \nbill to privatize tax collection by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The proposal to privatize tax collection is misguided. Privatizing \ntax collection will hurt both Federal employees, by contracting out \nFederal jobs, and taxpayers, who could be subject to the abuse and \nmismanagement of a private company. Privatization of tax collection has \nalready been tried by the IRS in a 1996 pilot project. The pilot \nproject was such an extraordinary failure that a further 1997 pilot \nproject was cancelled. The contractors who conducted the project did \nnot protect the sensitive information of taxpayers, and the project \nultimately did not save the Federal Government any money.\n  The proposal would allow private companies to engage in collection \nactivities without providing adequate safeguards for taxpayers against \nabusive activities. It is my understanding that the Fair Debt \nCollections Practices Act, known as FDCPA, which provides the most \nimportant protections for consumers from abusive or unfair actions by \ndebt collectors, would not fully apply to the activities of the private \ntax collectors. I am particularly concerned that a taxpayer's ability \nto recover certain damages from an abusive private tax collector may be \nseverely limited under this proposal.\n  In addition, the privatization of tax collection is a major change to \nthe way our Government works. To make such a change without holding any \nhearings on the matter, and without considering all aspects of the \nproposal, particularly the failed pilot project and whether or not the \nplan will actually save money, is irresponsible.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the critical issue of \nState fiscal relief, which I believe adds tremendous value to this \neconomic growth package. As I have discussed on numerous occasions, I \nbelieve that one of the best stimulants for the economy is providing \nassistance to our State and local governments, which is why I have \nfought for its inclusion in this package.\n  Since December, when I first identified elements that I believed \nwould stimulate the economy, I insisted on a State and local fiscal \nrelief component. Today, I am pleased that the Senate is taking action \nthrough this floor amendment to further refine both the agreement and \nlanguage that Senator Smith and I insisted must be included in the \ngrowth package as passed by the Senate Finance Committee.\n  The growth package that the Senate Finance Committee reported \nestablishes a $20 billion trust fund in S. 1054, the Jobs and Growth \nTax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, to provide critical, flexible \nrelief for both State and local governments. Also, I would like to \nthank Chairman Grassley for his willingness to work with me to identify \nappropriate offsets that ensured this proposal would not increase the \nnet cost of the growth package, and also that the relief provided was \nnot only flexible, but helped to meet the challenges faced by our \ncommunities.\n  By securing support to include a $20 billion fiscal relief trust fund \nin this package, I was able to ensure that States and localities \nreceived the help they need in balancing their fiscal year 2004 \nbudgets. Fiscal relief to State and local governments is vitally \nimportant to the health and strength of our economy, which is why I \nfought to ensure that half of the $20 billion would be modeled after my \nbill, S. 201, and would be flexible and divided between State and local \ngovernments with 40 percent going to localities and 60 percent to \nStates.\n  The floor amendment under consideration will provide $20 billion in \nState and local aid to be distributed in fiscal years 2003 and 2004. \nTen billion dollars in flexible funding will be distributed between \nstate and local governments, with the remaining $10 billion provided to \nStates through a temporary increase to the Federal Medical Assistance \nPercentage, known as FMAP, to help alleviate the short-term spike in \nMedicaid costs.\n  Because I thought it was important, we are providing $4 billion in \nflexible funding to local governments. While I know a number of my \ncolleagues have questioned the necessity and importance of providing \nrelief to local governments, I strongly believe that local governments \nhave all the more pivotal and increasing responsibilities at a time \nsuch as this, when they face decreasing revenues. And a large \npercentage of this increased burden has come from unfunded federal \nmandates related to education, homeland security and election reform. \nBy including $10 billion in flexible funding, distributed between state \nand local governments, we will ensure that essential government \nfunctions are performed.\n  As we all know, our states and local communities are struggling. For \nthe past 3 years, while the economy has been in a downturn, they have \nworked to meet the needs of residents, while 49 out of 50 States \nincluding Maine are also required to balance their budgets. In fact, \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures reports that since fiscal \nyear 2001, the combined budget shortfall in states has totaled more \nthan $200 billion. And the outlook for fiscal year 2004 is not proving \ndifferent. In January, 36 states reported budget gaps totaling more \nthan $68 billion for this year alone. In Maine, the Governor and \nLegislature were forced to trim $1.2 billion from their biennial budget \nin the wake of a $150 million shortfall in fiscal year 2003.\n\n  Some argue State budget shortfalls result from overspending--yet a \nreport issued by the National Governors Association shows that State \nspending from 1995 to 2001 increased 6.5 percent per year, a rate \nidentical to spending from\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\n1979 to 2003. Rather, it has been a drop in the stock market and the \neconomy concurrent with increased costs associated with necessities \nlike elementary and secondary education, programs under the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, homeland security, and \nMedicaid--that has been the real culprit in burdening State and local \nbudgets.\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures has reported a \nsubstantial decline in projected revenue, including drops in income, \nsales and property tax receipts, and user fees. Indeed, data suggest \nthat over three-fourths of the combined State budget shortfall is due \nto declines in State revenues. Again, unlike the Federal Government, \nStates don't have the option of running deficits--and after 3 years, \nmost practical belt-tightening measures have already taken effect.\n  On the spending side, the NCSL estimates that unfunded mandates for \nthe policy areas I just mentioned account for up to $82 billion in \nincreased expenses. And States rightly argue that the vast majority of \ntheir increased cost burden comes from the growing unfunded Federal \nmandate for providing care to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid \nprovides access to health care for almost 43 million of America's poor, \nelderly and disabled citizens and it alone is a program for which costs \nhave grown by 11.1 percent from 1990 to 2000.\n  Because of benefit shortfalls in the Medicare program--such as a \nprescription drug benefit--Medicaid ends up providing more vital \nservices. Indeed, while seniors and the disabled represent only one-\nquarter of the Medicaid population, they account for almost three-\nfourths of all Medicaid expenses. For example, in fiscal year 2002 \nStates provided $6.9 billion in prescription drug assistance to \nMedicare beneficiaries, and another $5.5 billion in copayment and \npremium assistance.\n  That is why providing fiscal relief is so critical--because while \nthere is no question this population needs to be served, there should \nalso be no doubt we can't leave States to be the last line of defense \nin footing the bill.\n  It is the same with issues like education--and that is why I also \nsupport providing flexible funding for States and localities to use as \nthey see fit. In California 20,000 teachers are at risk of being laid \noff, in New York local districts are raising property taxes to offset \nthe expected 4 percent cut in State education aid, and in Nebraska \nofficials have told 1,000 students that their academic scholarships to \nstate universities are being canceled and 431 college positions were \neliminated. We are making such great advances in education--and we all \nknow that education is the key to our future economic success. By \nproviding fiscal relief, the Federal Government is continuing its \ncommitment.\n  Of course, the level of assistance that Congress is providing would \nnot eliminate any State or local governments' total budget shortfall. \nBut it will provide vitally important assistance and has the support of \nthe largest State and local associations that represent our country's \nlocal elected representatives and leaders. Moreover, providing this \nState and local fiscal assistance within the tax package is entirely in \nkeeping with our efforts to stimulate the economy.\n  According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, ``Analysts at \nGoldman Sachs figure State and local belt-tightening will shave as much \nas a half-point from the economy's growth so that overall fiscal policy \nwill be no more than neutral next year.'' After all, dollars spent on \neducation, health care and transportation have an economic value today \nand tomorrow.\n  In fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that for every $1 \nbillion invested in transportation, 47,500 new jobs are created. And \nlet us not forget that State and local governments account for more \nthan 15 million jobs nationwide. As we take steps to put more money \ninto the hands of consumers, we must also make sure that those who are \nemployed by a State or local government, either directly or through a \ngovernment service contract, are able to stay employed.\n  Providing short-term fiscal relief to help State and local \ngovernments balance their budgets is vitally important to the long-term \nviability of our economy. I thank Chairman Grassley for his leadership \non this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I joined 49 of my colleagues in voting \nto waive the Congressional Budget Act in support of Senator Dorgan's \namendment to restore the pre-1993 tax treatment of Social Security \nbenefits.\n  In 1993, I joined a majority of Congress in voting for the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act, which combined with subsequent similar laws, \neliminated the deficits of the early 1990s and the debt that had grown \nexponentially under Presidents Reagan and Bush. Included in this 1993 \nAct was a provision that changed the way Social Security benefits for \nindividuals making over $25,000 and couples with income over $32,000 \nwere taxed. Like many of my colleagues at that time, I believed there \nwere more appropriate ways to eliminate the deficit, but budget \nprocedures prevented them from being considered, and, while there were \npartisan amendments offered at later dates to reverse this policy, they \ndid so by increasing the deficit, so I and a majority of my colleagues \nopposed these proposals.\n  Today's vote was different. It was different because the President \nand the Republican majority have brought about a striking reversal in \nour Nation's fiscal policies. In the span of less than 3 years, the \ngovernment's fiscal situation has deteriorated from budget surpluses to \nnear record budget deficits. We have gone from concerns that we would \nretire our mountains of public debt too quickly to considering the \nPresident's request to increase our debt limit to its highest level \never. And, today we are voting on a tax bill that will only exacerbate \nboth of these problems. Indeed, it appears that the majority is \nresolutely determined to cut dividend taxes for the most affluent in \nour society. These actions are being taken without regard for fiscal \nsoundness and without any consideration of the impact and the burden \ndecisions we make today place on future generations.\n  In this environment, Senator Dorgan's amendment to aid senior \ncitizens rather than the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, is the \nappropriate policy because at the very least if we are going to deficit \nspend, we should direct those resources to those individuals who have \nalready contributed in so many ways to this great Nation.\n  It would be my hope that we can find a way to address 1993 OBRA in a \nmanner that aids deserving seniors while protecting the long term \nsolvency of Social Security and restoring some sense of discipline to \nthe Federal budget process.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to share my thoughts on the \ntax measure before us. Few issues touch more Americans than the \neconomy. Now that hostilities with Iraq are winding down, we need to \nfocus on our own economy. Economic discussions tend to take on an \nunfortunate partisan tone, and I know that this bitterness is on \ndisplay on the floor of the Senate today as we debate the President's \nlatest tax cut proposal.\n  Regrettably, we often forget that we share a common goal: Every \nsingle member on this committee wants America to succeed. We all want \nAmericans to find good jobs, to have access to affordable health care, \nto educate our children, and to retire with dignity and comfort. While \nwe have sharp divisions on how to achieve that common goal, I hope we \ncan remember at the end of the day that all of our intentions are good.\n  Despite all of our best intentions, we are facing nothing short of a \nbudget crisis in America. CBO has revised its deficit projections \nupward yet again to reflect an end-of-year deficit of $300 billion. \nFederal revenues are on track to fall to the lowest level since 1959, \neven without more tax cuts, and we are about to vote on whether to \nraise the debt ceiling by almost another $1 trillion.\n  At the same time, we must make good on our commitments to the Iraqi \npeople to help rebuild that country. We need to follow through on \ncommitments here at home: to fund education and water projects and \ntransportation and veterans' programs. Let's not forget that we will \nrun right through the Social Security trust fund without setting aside \nso much as a dime for the young men and women who are paying into that \nsystem today, nor have we\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\ntaken any steps to address the imminent Medicare crisis.\n  Now, I admit that I went to college quite some time ago, and I \nunderstand that economic theories come and go, but I do not believe \nthat basic math has changed. If you spend more than you have, you run \nup a deficit.\n  Yesterday in the Banking Committee we considered the nomination of \nDr. Gregory Mankiw to become chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisors. Given the health of this economy, we are certainly in need of \nsome good advice. On reviewing some of Dr. Mankiw's work, I was \nespecially interested in a passage from his 1998 book ``Principles of \nEconomics,'' which talks about the dangers of short-term policies: \n``People on fad diets put their health at risk but rarely achieve the \npermanent weight loss they desire. Similarly, when politicians rely on \nthe advice of charlatans and cranks, they rarely get the desirable \nresults they anticipate. After Reagan's election, Congress passed the \ncut in tax rates that Reagan advocated but the tax cut did not cause \nrevenue to rise. Instead, tax revenue fell. . . and the U.S. federal \ngovernment began a long period of deficit spending.''\n  On several occasions, I have expressed concern that this \nadministration is sacrificing the long-term health of this Nation for a \npopular, short-term political measure. And the President's own nominee \nfor the Council of Economic Advisors appears to share my concern.\n  I voted in 2001 for the President's tax cut plan. While I would have \npreferred to see more of that $1.3 trillion go to working Americans, I \nnevertheless agreed with a majority of my colleagues that a projected \nsurplus of $5.6 trillion over 10 years was too high, and that we needed \nto refund some of that money. We face a starkly different picture \ntoday, and I simply do not understand how my distinguished colleagues \ncan reverse course so completely with respect to their long-standing \nstated principles.\n  For example, the majority leader of this body, Senator Bill Frist, \nsaid back in 1996 that ``we have a moral obligation to balance the \nbudget.'' Senator Santorum, back in 1995, said that ``the American \npeople are sick and tired of excuses for inaction to balance the \nbudget. The public wants us to stay the course towards a balanced \nbudget, and we take that obligation quite seriously.'' And Senator \nLott, just last year, said that ``the most important thing really does \ninvolve . . . keeping a balanced budget, not dipping into Social \nSecurity, and continuing to reduce the national debt.''\n  I would like to focus on Majority Leader Frist's statement that \nrunning budget deficits is a moral issue. What he meant by that was \nthat when we run a deficit, we defer the hard decisions for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  In February, a group of 10 Nobel Prize-winning economists spoke out \nagainst the President's latest plan: ``Passing these tax cuts will \nworsen the long-term budget outlook, adding to the nation's projected \nchronic deficits. This fiscal deterioration will reduce the capacity of \nthe government to finance Social Security and Medicare benefits as well \nas investments in schools, health, infrastructure, and basic research. \nMoreover, the proposed tax cuts will generate further inequalities in \nafter-tax income.''\n  And just a few weeks ago, Fed Chairman Greenspan appeared before the \nBanking Committee and said, in as many different ways as he possibly \ncould, that tax cuts should only take place in the context of fiscal \ndiscipline. In other words, don't cut taxes if you can't pay for the \ncuts.\n  To quote once again from Dr. Mankiw: ``Prosperity tomorrow calls for \nsacrifice today. It is the rare politician that is willing to call for \nthat.'' In a radio address on March 3, 2001, when we still had record \nsurpluses and we were on a course to pay down the debt, President \nGeorge W. Bush proclaimed, ``Future generations shouldn't be forced to \npay back money that we have borrowed. We owe this kind of \nresponsibility to our children and grandchildren.'' At the time, this \nwas an easy statement to make. Now, however, fiscal discipline requires \nsacrifice, and we need President Bush to follow through on the promise \nof leadership through hard economic times. I call on President Bush to \nexercise leadership and put an end to this tax cut mania. No one likes \nto deliver hard messages, but that is the price of true leadership.\n  Every time I talk to someone from South Dakota, I hear the same \nthing: Our schools need more funding; our water projects need more \nfunding; our veterans need more funding; the list goes on and on. But \nthe simple fact is, we just don't have the money anymore. And we \ncertainly won't have the money if we continue on this reckless course \nof tax cuts that will fill the pockets of those who already have more \nmoney than they can spend in a lifetime. I agree that we shouldn't let \ngovernment grow too big. But we shouldn't destroy it either.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am voting against this bill because I \ncame to the Senate to represent California families and this tax cut \nfor the wealthy elite is not in their interest. It contradicts the \nbasic American values of fairness, responsibility, and opportunity.\n  We are now in the longest period of continued job losses since the \nGreat Depression. In the first 3 months of this year alone, America \nlost another half a million jobs. As result, 8.8 million people are \nunemployed today. That is 2.8 million more than when President Bush \ntook office. Most troubling, 1.9 million of those workers have been out \nof work for more than a year and a half. But instead of targeting the \nmajority of the benefits to a majority of the people, this bill targets \nits benefits to the very top.\n  There is not a single responsible economist I know who thinks this \ntax package will get us out of the terrible economic condition we are \nin. In fact, 11 Nobel laureate economists and hundreds of others have \npublished an open letter saying that passing these tax cuts ``will \nworsen the long-term budget outlook, adding to the Nation's projected \nchronic deficits. This fiscal deterioration will reduce the capacity of \nthe Government to finance Social Security and Medicare benefits as well \nas investments in schools, health, infrastructure, and basic \nresearch.''\n  Those Nobel laureates also added that the tax cuts would generate \nfurther inequalities in after-tax income. The reason for that is that \nthis package is skewed to those who do not need it.\n  That kind of windfall for the wealthy is bad policy. That is why I \nsupported the Democratic alternative and other amendments that would \nhave spread the benefits of the bill to more Americans.\n  The Democratic Plan for Jobs, Opportunity and Prosperity would put \nover 1 million people back to work by the end of 2004. The Democratic \nplan would provide three times more economic boost right now than the \nRepublican plan. At the same time, the Democratic plan would put us \nback on the path to fiscal responsibility.\n  The Democratic plan would have cut taxes for every working American, \nproviding an average benefit of $1,630 to a family of four making \n$50,000 a year. And it would have provided real assistance to the 8.8 \nmillion Americans who are currently unemployed. Our plan would have \ncreated a new credit for every working American, which will provide \n$300 for each adult in a family and $300 for the first two children. We \nwanted to accelerate the refundability of the child tax credit, \naccelerate the elimination of the marriage penalty, and extend and \nexpand unemployment insurance for those looking for work, including the \n1 million people who have already exhausted their benefits.\n  Also, the Democratic plan would have sparked growth by helping the \nStates sustain vital services during the economic downturn and \nencouraging small businesses to invest. As part of the Democratic \nproposal, we proposed a 50 percent tax credit in 2003, worth $8 \nbillion, to help small businesses pay their share of insurance \npremiums. And very important for California, our plan would have \nprovided $40 billion in immediate aid to State and local governments. \nWe also proposed tripling the amount of investments small businesses \ncan write off immediately from $25,000 to $75,000 in 2003.\n  I was deeply troubled that my colleagues cared so much for the elite \nfew that they voted against a number of amendments that would have \nhelped working Americans. They rejected an effort to cut taxes on \nsocial security benefits for middle-income seniors. They rejected \nexpanding the child tax\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\ncredit. They supported raising taxes on Americans working abroad. They \nfought efforts to increase tax benefits to help families pay for higher \neducation. And they fought every effort to get more meaningful \nassistance to the States in this time of crisis.\n  There were two bright spots during the Senate consideration of this \nlegislation. First, the Senate passed the Invest in the USA Act \namendment that Senator Ensign and I introduced. It will create a one-\ntime incentive for U.S. companies to bring $140 billion dollars in \nfunds earned abroad back to the U.S. for job creation, investment in \nplants and equipment, and for other economically stimulative uses.\n  The Senate also adopted an amendment offered to crack down on \ndelinquent parents who do not pay child support. My amendment, which is \nbased on bipartisan legislation that I introduced, penalizes those who \ndo not pay the child support that they owe.\n  Despite these two improvements, the bill--and some destructive \namendments, such as an expansion of the dividend exclusion--is deeply \nflawed, unfair, and fiscally dangerous--creating massive deficits, \nwhich will hurt economic growth.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \npending legislation, S. 1054.\n  Our economy today is in a precarious position. It was reported \nyesterday that retail sales in April fell. Initial unemployment claims \nremain well above 400,000, the level typically associated with a weak \nlabor market. This morning we learned that industrial production \ndecreased by one-half of 1 percent last month and that capacity \nutilization fell to 74.4 percent, and is now at the lowest level in 20 \nyears. Our industrial base is producing less, we have more plants and \nequipment idle which has led to fewer jobs, reduced consumer spending \nand increased economic insecurity for the vast majority of Americans. \nThe unemployment rate has risen to 6.0 percent, the highest level sine \n1994 and our economy has grown only at rate of 1.5 percent over the \npast 6 months, far below its potential. This growth rate is far too \nslow to create enough jobs for the nearly 9 million unemployed American \nworkers who want to find work but can not because there are not enough \njobs to be had.\n  The facts indicate the serious nature of the problem facing the \neconomy in the short run. Our economic growth is not strong enough to \neven maintain our job base, much less create the jobs needed for those \nwho lost their jobs during the recession.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation before us today will not help solve \nthese serious problems. The administration's proposal would create very \nlittle stimulus this year, when it is needed the most. Two economic \nconsulting firms used by the administration reached this conclusion. \nOne estimate, performed by Economy.com, calculated that the President's \nproposal will add only 0.4 percent to our gross domestic product this \nyear. The President's proposal will not create enough jobs this year, \nwhen people are out of work and can not find a job because there are \nnone to be had. Macroeconomic Advisers issued a report, entitled `A \nPreliminary Analysis of the President's Jobs and Growth Proposals' \nwhich concluded that the plan would create only 242,000 jobs by the end \nof this year. That is less than half the 525,000 jobs that we have \nalready lost this year alone.\n  The President's proposal falls far short of what the economy truly \nneeds. Instead the administration proposal focuses on large permanent \nstructural tax reduction aim at providing the maximum benefit to the \nwealthiest few. This will have very little stimulative effect while \ncosting a great deal in both the present and the future. Far from \nstimulating the economy, the President's tax cut will create a large \nstructural deficit which will slow future economic growth and result in \nfewer jobs. That is not just my conclusion. The Committee for Economic \nDevelopment, CED, found that the President's proposal, ``would raise \nthe cumulative 2004-2013 deficit by about $920 billion (including \ninterest) and raise the annual deficit ten years from now by about $100 \nbillion.\n  Large structural deficits have real consequences. They reduce \nnational savings and investment, raise real interest rates and reduce \neconomic growth. The costs of the President's plan over the long run \nare so substantial that the President's plan would actually reduce \nfuture economic growth. Macroeconomic Advisers concluded that ``as \ninterest rates rise, the initial increase in the stock market and \ndecline in the cost of capital are reversed. Weakening investments \nleads to a sustained decline in labor productivity and hence potential \nGDP.'' They found that the President's plan will reduce economic growth \nin the long run. Economy.com reached a similar conclusion. It estimated \nthat the President's plan would actually shrink the economy over the \nnext 10 years.\n  In his April 26 radio address, the President stated: ``Some Members \nof Congress support tax relief but say my proposal is too big. Since \nthey already agree that tax relief creates jobs, it doesn't make sense \nto provide less tax relief and, therefore, create fewer jobs.'' In \nregard to that statement, the Washington Post reported, ``Asked to \nevaluate Bush's new argument, one Republican economist with close \nadministration ties quipped, `I suppose it matters whether you think \neconomics matters.'' '\n  I believe that economics matter. I also believe that when you pursue \neconomic policies based on ideology instead of sound economic \nprinciples you end up hurting the lives of millions of Americans and \nthreatening our economic future and prosperity. Look at the record of \nthis administration: Since the President took office, the economy has \nlost 2.7 million private sector jobs. That is the largest job loss \nunder any one President since we began keeping such statistics. This \nadministration is on track to become the first administration since the \nGreat Depression to witness a decrease in the number of jobs in \nAmerica. When the President took office, what he, in effect, inherited \nwas a 10-year surplus estimated at $5.6 trillion. That was a projection \nout for 10 years: a surplus of $5.6 trillion. Now with the policies \nthat he has enacted and the policies that he is proposing, in \nparticular, of course, this very heavily weighted tax cut for the \nbenefit of upper income people, we will go from projecting a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus over the 10-year period to projecting a $2.1 trillion \ndeficit. That is a seismic shift in our position.\n  Many of my colleagues in the Senate as well as the President have \nargued that these deficit estimates are inaccurate because they fail to \ntake into account the so-called dynamic effects from the President's \nproposed tax cuts. In a recent speech the President said that, ``in \norder to get rid of the deficit, you boost revenues coming into the \nTreasury by encouraging economic growth and vitality'' through his \nproposed tax cut. Yet when the Congressional Budget Office analyzed \nthese dynamic effects under nine different models, it found that these \ndynamic effects made little difference on net and that under five of \nthe nine models theses effects actually increased the deficit. That is \nunder all of the various assumptions used by the CBO the so-called \ndynamic effects that the President has argued would help the tax cut \npay for itself will not only fail to deliver on that promise but may \nactually increased the deficit. This is yet another example of engaging \nin a policy driven by political ideology instead of sound economics.\n  This bill is modeled on the failed economic policy that this \nadministration has advanced: vast tax cuts for the extremely wealthy. \nThe administration's proposal as estimated by the Brookings Institution \ncreates a tax giveaway of over $89,000 to the average millionaire while \nproviding only $482 to the average family with an income of $50,000. \nThis truly represents the priorities of `Leave No Millionaire Behind' \ninstead of `Leave No Child Behind.'\n  This does not have to be the case. The Congress could enact sensible, \nprudent policies which provide a real, substantial boost to our \neconomy, create many more jobs now when they are needed, maintain our \neconomic strength and security over the long run. Senator Daschle \npresented an alternative that would create real jobs, grow the economy, \nhelp unemployed workers, and assist State and local governments that \nare facing their worst fiscal crisis since WWII. Extending unemployment \ninsurance benefits serves to stimulate the economy immediately as those \nreceiving the benefits\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\nare almost by definition sure to turn around and spend what they \nreceive. Providing aid to State and local governments will allow them \nto forestall cuts to vital programs or tax increases, either of which \nwould only exacerbate our current economic problems.\n  Comparing the Democratic alternative and the administration's \nproposal, the conclusions are the same using almost any economic model: \nThe Democratic plan would create over 1 million jobs at by the end of \nthis year, which is twice as many jobs as the administration's own \nestimate of their plan; the Democratic plan would provide more stimulus \nto the economy this year leading to higher economic growth; and the \nDemocratic plan is temporary and far less costly than the President's \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, I oppose this legislation and I urge my fellow \ncolleagues to vote no on this bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, our economy is in a slump unlike any in \nrecent memory. In fact, we are experiencing a downturn with features \nunseen since the days of the Great Depression.\n  In the last 2 years, we have lost over 2.6 million jobs in the \nprivate sector. That is the longest continous decline in the number of \njobs in over 50 years. It has almost doubled the number of Americans \nwho are stuck in long-term unemployment--out of a job for over half a \nyear.\n  The unemployment rate has just risen to 6 percent, with 8.8 million \nAmericans out of work.\n  The stock market has lost value by more than ten percent each of the \nlast 3 years. The last time that happened was, again, the Great \nDepression of the 1930's. A drop of almost 30 percent in the value of \nthe stock market has decimated the retirement savings of millions of \nAmericans, and drained over $5 trillion in wealth from their net worth.\n  That is why we are here today, to debate how to respond to this \ncrisis. This crisis is real, it is affecting millions of families \ndirectly and indirectly across this country. In addition to the \nthousands of jobs lost with every new report, millions more families \nare concerned about the security of their own jobs.\n  In fact, the situation is so precarious that the Federal Reserve, \nunder the leadership of Alan Greenspan, has shifted its historical \nconcern about inflation to a worry we haven't seen since the 1930's--\ndeflation. Despite a series of 12 interest rate cuts in a row, that \nthave pushed interest rates to forty-year lows, the Federal Reserve's \nmeetings are now focused on keeping us out of the kind of deflation \ntrap that Japan has been stuck in for more than a decade.\n  When the Fed is more worried about deflation than inflation, you know \nyou have a probiem.\n  And while we ended the last century with the Federal budget in \nbalance for the first time in a generation, we now begin the new \ncentury facing deficits bigger that we have ever seen. The \nCongressional Budget Office has just raised its estimate of this year's \ndeficit to $300 billion, and that doesn't even count this $350 billion \ntax cut before us today.\n  Wall Street analysts expected the actual deficit to be closer to $400 \nbillion or even more for this year--the biggest dollar figure ever.\n  This kind of budget policy is the reason why we will soon be voting \nto raise the national debt ceiling--to allow us to borrow enough money \nto pay the bills we have already incurred.\n  This will be the single largest increase in the national debt in our \nhistory, adding almost a trillion dollars to the debt limit, raising it \nto over $6.7 trillion.\n  Just a few short years ago we were paying down the national debt.\n  We have gone from a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion to a $1.8 \ntrillion deficit. This is a record of economic bad news that has not \nbeen equaled in most American's lifetimes.\n  Now we are piling up additional debt, and adding heavy new interest \ncharges to the spiraling costs of this administration's irresponsible \nbudget policy. Over the next 10 years, we will add an additional $1.7 \ntrillion in interest costs on that Debt--$1.7 trillion that will not be \navailable for homeland defense, for health care, for education, for law \nenforcement.\n  How well I remember. How the men and women in the business community \nwould come to me in the decades of deficit and tell me, ``Balance the \nbudget, stop borrowing money like nobody else needs it. Get the \ngovernment out of the credit markets so we can invest and grow.''\n  Where are those voices we used to hear on the Senate floor, imploring \nus to reverse decades of borrowing and return to the straight and \nnarrow of balanced budgets?\n  We need a strong dose of those principles now. We need an economic \nstimulus that works. And we need an economic policy that does not \nmortgage our future, that does not dump the bill on our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  We need a plan that we can afford, that treats the very real, \nspecific problems that average families in Delaware and around the \ncountry are facing today. Unfortunately, the bill before us is the \nwrong plan, at the wrong time, at the wrong price.\n  We need an economic policy that has an impact right now, in the very \nshort term--an impact on consumer spending, on the demand side, to give \nemployers a reason to bring those workers back.\n  That means tax cuts for the vast majority of American families who \nneed some relief, and who can be counted on to go out and spend that \nmoney--to create demand for more products, create more jobs.\n  But in addition to the very real and very serious problems we are \nfacing today, in the very near future, just around the corner, the \nretirement of the baby boom generation will stretch our Social Security \nsystem to the breaking point.\n  Just a decade from now, surpluses in the Social Security system--\nextra funds that help to cover some of our current deficits--those \nsurpluses will disappear. Then the drain on our resources will \naccelerate until--according to the Social Security System's trustees--\nby 2030 Social Security and Medicare will be a third of every Federal \nincome tax dollar, and by 2040, almost half of every Federal income tax \ndollar.\n  That is clearly an impossible situation that we cannot permit to \noccur. We must act now to makes sure that we have the resources to keep \nthe promises we made to the millions of Americans who have paid their \nSocial Security taxes over the years.\n  But every dime of the $350 billion tax cut before us today is \nborrowed from Social Security--it breaks our promise to those who \ndepend on Social Security, and sends the bill to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  The solution we are seeking today, for the ongoing loss of millions \nof jobs, must not ignore the crisis in federal finances that is \nbeginning now and crests just a decade away.\n  It is not just that it is unfair and irresponsible to put the burden \nof our choices off on our children. That should be reason enough to \nreject this policy out of hand.\n  But a moment's reflection tells us that if we borrow $350 billion, or \n$550 billion, or--if the President had his way, $726 billion--if we \nborrow that money from the same capital markets where our corporations \nand home buyers get their money, that policy is self-defeating.\n  It raises the cost of money, and slows the economy down, while \nhanding out windfall tax breaks that people will get without any change \nin the behavior.\n  That policy is indeed unfair. It is irresponsible. And it is \nineffective.\n  But a kick-start that gets people spending and businesses hiring--and \nthat has a reasonable cost--that kind of policy can work.\n  First, we all know that the real price of this bill is not $350 \nbillion. We have already heard that key members of the Republican \nleadership do not expect that the tax increases in this bill, that keep \nthe cost of the tax cuts down, will survive a conference with the \nHouse. If those tax increases go, the cost of this bill goes up.\n  And key provisions in the bill--like the dividend exemption--phase in \nslowly and then are supposed to expire after ten years. Even if you buy \nthe idea--which I don't--that giving a tax break to the small \npercentage of Americans who receive dividends can somehow turn the \neconomy around, how can you expect that change to happen if businessmen \nknow they should wait a few years until the exclusion is phased in?\n\n  And what kind of permanent change in corporate behavior can we expect\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n\nwhen we know that the door is going to slam shut on this deal 10 years \nout?\n  One answer is that they don't expect that door to close. They expect \nthe dividend provision and others to be extended. Or more and more \ndividends could be excluded--that creeping expansion and acceleration \nhas been the pattern since we passed the 2001 tax cuts.\n  Full exemption of dividends, if it were in place at the end of this \ndecade, would cost $750 billion over the next 10 years.\n  For that and many other reasons, this tax cut, as big and \nirresponsible as it is, is just a place holder for even more \nreductions, and even more deficits, even more debt.\n  But designed this way, to get ten pounds of tax cuts into a five \npound bag, so to speak, has resulted in a tax cut that even a \nconservative economist who supports the administration has called, and \nI quote from yesterday's Washington Post, ``one of the most patently \nabsurd tax policies every proposed.''\n  But maybe if this bill offered the average American family some real \ntax relief, maybe if we could expect a little help for the millions of \njobless men and women stuck in long-term unemployment, some of the cost \nwould be worth it.\n  Tragically, there is no reason to expect this legislation to do \nanything to stimulate the economy this year or next. The way this tax \ncut is designed, there is no reason to expect any benefit to the \neconomy, and every reason to believe that the deficits it creates will \ncause harm.\n  Estimates by Congressman Henry Waxman, who examined corporate \nstatements, show that the top three executives at Fortune's largest 100 \ncompanies would get a tax cut of $118 million if dividends were totally \nexcluded from taxation, the goal that administration officials admit is \nthe real aim of the partial exclusion in this bill. Under full \nexclusion, twenty one executives would get a tax cut of $1 million.\n  That is for doing nothing. Just for doing what they already do. That \nis not corporate tax reform, it is simply a windfall. I trust that \nthose men and women earn every dime they already make. But no one can \nargue that a $118 million personal windfall into the already large pay \npackages of those executives is going to create a single new job.\n  I you really wanted to fix the problem of dividend taxation, even \nRepublican economists--indeed, especially Republican economists--will \ntell you that you should eliminate the tax at the corporate level. That \nat least has the potential of changing the behavior of firms that now \nmust choose between borrowing that is not taxed and dividends that are \ntaxed.\n  That could be part of an honest debate about tax reform and job \ncreation.\n  And when Alan Greenspan endorsed the idea of reforming dividend \ntaxes, he said it should be done in a way that does not add to the \nnational debt, and that it should be part of a bigger plan of reform. \nThis proposal flunks all of those tests.\n  Only 13 percent of the impact of this bill will be felt in this year, \nMr. President--and less than half in its first 2 years. And the vast \nmajority of the revenue losses come in the future, as the crisis in \nSocial Security approaches. This plan turns economic logic on its head.\n  This is not designed to stimulate the economy--if it were, it would \nprovide a quick, short-term boost to family incomes, and would give \nbusinesses incentives to act right now to increase investment and \ncreate jobs.\n  Under this bill, the one-tenth of one percent of Americans who have \nan income of over $1 million will receive an average tax cut of \n$64,000. But those Americans in the middle 20 percent of the income \nspectrum would get an average tax cut of $233.\n\n  That's right, the average American gets a tax cut of $233, under this \nbill.\n  That is not fair. But it is not good economic policy either. Those \ngood men and women fortunate and hard-working enough to make over a \nmillion dollars a year are not going to change their behavior, they \naren't going to create any new jobs, just because they get an \nadditional $64,000.\n  But getting money to the families who will go out tomorrow and spend \nit, getting money to those who are about to lose long-term unemployment \nbenefits, getting money to the states to prevent further state tax \nincreases or spending cuts--that has the best hope of giving the \neconomy the stimulus it needs.\n  The tax cut program that makes sense and that I supported would \nprovide a tax cut for every American taxpayer--for example, $300 for \nevery adult, $300 for the first two children. It increases the child \ntax credit to $700 this year and $800 next year. And for middle class \nand working families, this tax cut plan that I supported accelerates \nrelief from the marriage penalty.\n  Altogether, a middle class family of four would have gotten a tax cut \nof $1630 this year under the Democratic tax cut plan.\n  And if you add to that my proposal to allow parents to deduct the \ncost of college tuition a family with kids in college could get an \nadditional $3000 tax break. That is real help, for real families, to \ndeal with a real problem, and frees up real money to stimulate the \neconomy.\n  Incredibly, this so-called ``Jobs'' bill makes no provision to extend \nthe life of the long term unemployment program that expires in just two \nweeks. With the number of long-term unemployed at record levels and \ngrowing, this bill simply ignores their needs.\n  Equally astounding, the bill provides almost nothing for the states \nwhose fiscal crisis is dragging the economy down. State budget cuts in \neducation, health care, law enforcement--even homeland security--slow \nthe economy as workers lose jobs and businesses lose customers.\n  While there appears to be $20 billion in aid to the states in this \nbill, in reality, the reductions in federal dividend and income \ntaxation will cut as much as $11 billion from state taxes based on \nthose sources.\n  Under the tax cut plan I support, small businesses would get three \ntimes the tax write off for investments--$75,000 worth--this year, and \na tax deduction for 50 percent of the cost of new equipment, along with \nhelp getting health insurance for their employees.\n  The tax cut I support would get $20 billion in real help to the \nstates to confront the fiscal crisis that is compounding the national \neconomic slump.\n  And the tax cut program I voted for would extend unemployment \nbenefits to help those looking for work sustain that search in a time \nof record job losses.\n  Finally, the plan I supported is affordable. Its effects take place \nimmediately, and it would not leave a hole in our finances for our \nchildren to repair.\n  That's the plan I supported, and it is the plan our country needs. I \ncannot vote for this bill that is now before us because it fails to do \nso.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support this fiscally \nirresponsible and unfair tax cut package.\n  Our economy is struggling right now. Eight-and-a-half million \nAmericans are out of work, and we now have about 2.7 million fewer \nprivate sector jobs than were in existence at the beginning of this \nadministration. No President since the Great Depression has ended a \nterm with fewer jobs than when his term began. Michigan has an \nunemployment rate of 6.7 percent, among the highest in the Nation. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Michigan lost 17,700 jobs \njust last month, the most of any State in the country. That brings the \ntotal number of Michigan jobs lost since the Bush administration took \noffice to over 178,000, and the total number of unemployed in Michigan \nto 344,000.\n  We are also back into a deep deficit ditch. As recently as January \n2001, the Office of Management and Budget projected a 10-year surplus \nof $5.6 trillion. Now, under the recently passed budget resolution, we \nface an estimated deficit of $1.95 trillion over the same time period, \nincluding record deficits of over $300 billion for this year and the \nnext. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently reiterated that \nthe bigger the deficits, the higher the long-term interest rates, which \nmeans higher home, car, college and credit card payments for us all.\n  Our economy needs a lift now. It needs real jobs and real growth now, \nnot a rehash of the same policies that were tried and failed in the \nrecent past.\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\nUnfortunately, this bill only provides more of the same failed \npolicies.\n  While the bill purports to cost $350 billion over 10 years--an amount \nwhich already is fiscally irresponsible given our current deficit--this \nnumber is arrived at by using a budget gimmick that masks the true cost \nof the bill, which in reality is upwards of $660 billion over 10 years. \nThe bill would completely exclude dividend income from individual \ntaxation in 2004 through 2006, a policy that is expensive, not very \nstimulative to our economy and sharply slanted towards upper income \nfolks. But then the bill ``sunsets'' the dividend exclusion so that it \ndisappears beginning in 2007. Not only is that bad policy, it is also \ndisingenuous and deceptive to the American people.\n  This bill also is too generous to those who need it the least. The \ntop 10 percent of taxpayers would receive well over 50 percent of the \ntax benefits, and in 2003, those with incomes above $1 million would \nreceive an average tax cut of $64,400, while those in the middle of the \nincome spectrum would receive an average tax cut of only $233. \nProviding large tax cuts to the wealthy in the hopes that the benefits \nwill trickle down to everybody else hasn't worked before, and there is \nlittle reason to think that it will work now. Following the same \napproach that failed time and again just doesn't make sense.\n  This plan provides no unemployment benefits to any of our 8.7 million \nunemployed Americans. It is ironic that in a bill that is based on the \nPresident's so-called ``Jobs and Growth'' package, the Republican \nmajority is not addressing the immediate need for job assistance for \nmillions of Americans. It is elementary economics that providing \nadditional unemployment benefits is an excellent way to jump start a \nstagnant economy. The money we are talking about is money that will be \nspent. According to a 1999 Department of Labor study, every $1 invested \nin unemployment insurance generates $2.15 in Gross Domestic Product. \nThat is what our economy needs, not wildly expensive tax cuts that do \nlittle in the short term at a huge long-term cost.\n  While I am pleased that this bill contains funds to assist our \nstruggling State and local governments, it does not do enough. Our \nStates currently are facing their worst fiscal crisis in over 50 years, \nwith many being forced to raise taxes or cut vital services like \nMedicaid in order to balance their budgets. Instead of doing all that \nwe should to assist them, this bill includes a dividends exclusion \nprovision that will actually strip States of revenues, something which \nwill stimulate neither jobs nor growth.\n  I supported and voted for a tax package that was about creating jobs \nnow, when we need it, in a way that did not mortgage our future.\n  The plan I supported was estimated to put more than 1 million people \nback to work by the end of 2004 at a fraction of this bill's costs. It \nwould have cut taxes for every taxpaying American, providing a tax cut \nof $1,630 to a family of four through a wage credit, an acceleration of \nthe child tax credit, and an elimination of the marriage penalty. It \nwould have helped small businesses by providing them with a 50 percent \ntax credit to help employers maintain health coverage for their \nworkers, and would have provided large and small companies with \nincentives to invest and create jobs by allowing small businesses to \nimmediately write-off more investments and providing bonus depreciation \nto all companies. It also would have provided unemployment benefits for \nnearly 4 million laid-off workers, including those who have already \nexhausted their benefits. What our sagging economy needs right now is \nimmediate jobs, growth, and stimulus, and that is what the plan I \nsupported offered.\n  Instead, what passed is a package that is the wrong medicine for our \nailing economy. It will create fewer jobs than what is needed. It will \nslight middle-class families in favor of the wealthy. And it will \ndramatically increase the deficit and national debt and drive up \ninterest rates, which will make it more expensive to buy a house, pay \nfor college, or pay off credit card debt. That is just not a plan that \nI can vote for.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deepest \ndisappointment in the actions of the Senate today. Today, across the \ncountry, States face a fiscal crisis as State legislatures attempt to \nclose an estimated $17.5 billion budget gap. Today, more than 2 million \nAmerican workers have been unemployed for more then 6 months. Today, \nfamilies across the county are struggling to make ends meet. Today, our \ncountry is seeing steadily increasing deficits, now projected at over \n$300 billion this year alone. And today, in the Senate, we passed a \nhugely expensive tax package that will overwhelmingly benefit the \nwealthy.\n  It is for that reason I voted against the Finance Committee's jobs \nand growth package. I have consistently argued that the best way to \nmeet the needs of our Nation is to find a balance between cost and \nbenefit, and the votes I have taken today are a reflection on this \ndesire. I voted to double the amount of funding that would go to \nstruggling State legislatures and local governments. I supported \nefforts to get more money into the hands of working families. I also \nsupported amendments that would assist small businesses with the cost \nof health insurance and new equipment. These initiatives are the most \neffective, as well as the most cost effective, means of stimulating the \neconomy.\n  I would like to take a moment to applaud the pieces of the Finance \nCommittee's package that were actually beneficial to working families. \nMarriage penalty relief and accelerating the increase in the child tax \ncredit are both worthy proposals that would benefit millions of \nfamilies. In addition, the small business expensing provision is an \nexcellent way of helping small businesses with startup costs thereby \nproviding a significant boost to the economy. However, we could, and \nshould, have done more--more help for the struggling economy and \nstruggling families at less damage to our bottom line. I was \ndisappointed to see proposals fail today that would have expanded on \nall of these provisions; proposals that would have gotten more money \ninto the hands of families who would spend it and could have provided a \nlarger, faster boost to our failing economy.\n  My greatest disappointment, however, was with an amendment that was \nable to pass. Since the administration announced its support for a \ncomplete elimination of the taxation on dividends, I have voiced my \nopposition to this proposal. Forty-two percent of the benefits under \nthis proposal would go to the richest 1 percent of taxpayers. Those are \ninexcusable figures for a provision to be included under a so-called \ngrowth package. The dividend proposal will not spur the economy, will \nnot help working families, and will not help States with their budget \nshortfalls. These are the goals we should be working towards, and I \nbelieve that we have fallen severely short in passing this legislation \ntoday.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am pleased that the manager's of the \nJobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, Chairman \nGrassley and ranking member Baucus, have agreed to included in their \nmanager's amendment my provision, which is supported by many members in \nthis body, that addresses the issue of the tax burden that is faced by \nwholesalers of domestic distilled spirits.\n  I want to take this opportunity to express my support for this \nlegislation and also to share my broader concern about how the current \nFederal Excise Tax, FET, system places an undue burden on distillers \nthat must, at a minimum, not be increased to fund this legislation or \nfor any other reason.\n  I introduced this amendment because I believe that the existing FET \nsystem for domestically produced distilled spirits penalizes spirits \nwholesalers across the nation. These are mostly family businesses that \ncreate high wage jobs. Yet spirits wholesalers often find themselves in \nthe position of, in essence, having to float Uncle Sam a loan when they \npurchase U.S. made spirits from their distillers.\n  Let me briefly explain how this situation comes about in the \nmarketplace. Under Federal law, spirits produced in the United States \nmay not leave the distillery premises until the FET is collected. Thus, \nthe cost of the FET is factored into the price of the goods that is \npaid when the wholesaler accepts possession from the distiller. The \nwholesale, in turn, may wind up having to warehouse these products for \na considerable time before they are sold to a\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\nretailer. The fundamental issue here is the time value of the FET--\nvaluable working capital for these businesses--while the wholesale \nwarehouses products without realizing any income from their sale.\n  This amendment would create a tax credit available to the wholesalers \nin order to offset these FET carrying costs. I believe this is \nfundamentally fair and will help protect and create good jobs in the \nwine and spirits wholesale tier across the nation.\n  However, in introducing this amendment and supporting its inclusion \nin the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, I want to \nmake one thing perfectly clear. In supporting this bill, I want the \nAdministration, and officials at the Treasury Department and the Bureau \nof Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to understand that by doing so I \nreject the connection that some have tried to make between this issue \nand Section 5010 of the tax code, the wine and flavors tax credit. In \npast years, the suggestion has been made that any revenue loss to the \nU.S. Treasury caused by the provisions of my amendment be offset by \nrepealing Section 5010. I reject that notion because there is no \nlogical link between the two issues.\n  Section 5010 is a component-based tax provision allowing distillers \nto claim a credit for wines and other flavoring components that are \nadded to their products. Thus, a distiller will pay the full spirits \nFET for that portion of a product that is derived from distilled \nspirits. However, many products sold as spirits contain wine and other \nnon-spirits flavorings, which are subject to tax at lower rates. Under \nSection 5010, the distiller is entitled to a credit for the difference \nbetween the wine and the spirits tax for that portion of the product \nthat is not derived from spirits.\n  Section 5010 is important. It has the added policy virtues of being \non the side of common sense, economic competitiveness and fundamental \nfairness. All of this is why I have fought hard to protect 5010 from \nseveral serious threats over the years.\n  I am pleased that, with the inclusion of my amendment in this bill, \nthe Senate has once again shown its support for solving this problem \nwhich penalizes spirits wholesalers of domestically produced distilled \nspirits. I am also pleased that the Senate has seen fit to address this \nimportant issue without harming Section 5010 or otherwise increasing \nthe tax burden on distillers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleague from \nIowa, Senator Grassley, for his leadership in providing much needed \nassistance to our Nation's hospitals and doctors. Specifically, I would \nlike to thank him for his support of the disproportionate share \nhospitals--DSH--program, and for his support of fair and equitable \nMedicare reimbursement for America's doctors.\n  The Medicaid DSH program is an essential program that provides relief \nto many of our Nation's safety net hospitals; hospitals that experience \nfinancial difficulty because they treat larger numbers of the \nuninsured, low-income, and Medicaid patients. By raising payment rates \nto these hospitals, the DSH program helps to alleviate the \ndisadvantaged financial situation suffered by many of these hospitals, \nand helps to ensure that all who need access to hospital care are able \nto receive that care.\n  Under current rules, a state's DSH payments may not exceed an \nallotment amount that is set in law for that state. In my home state of \nNew Mexico, DSH payment adjustments are set at less than 1 percent. \nThis 1 percent is far less than the national average of 8 percent, thus \nclassifying my state as an ``extremely low DSH state.'' This lack of \nfunding has seriously threatened the viability of many New Mexico \nsafety net hospitals, and it puts at risk the care of some of our \nneediest citizens.\n  Today however, as a result of the work done by this body, Medicaid \nDSH allotments for States like New Mexico that have extremely low \npayments will be raised from 1 percent to 3 percent. This additional \nfunding will help to ensure that our hospitals can continue to treat \nMedicaid and other low income or uninsured patients, and it will help \nrelieve some of the pressure on our State's budget.\n  In addition to the assistance provided to the DSH program, this \nCongress has also taken a proactive approach to resolving another issue \nof great importance to me, fair and equitable Medicare reimbursement \nfor America's doctors.\n  In many Medicare payment localities, current Federal policy \nundermines a doctor's ability to see Medicare patients by establishing \ndisparity in reimbursement levels. Rural physicians are among the \nlowest Medicare dollar reimbursement recipients in the country, and I \nsubmit that this is the reason these areas cannot effectively recruit \nand retain their physicians.\n  This practice is unfair and it is discriminatory. There is not reason \ndoctors in Albuquerque, NM should be paid less for their time than \ndoctors in New York City. Doctors should be valued equally, \nirrespective of geography.\n  Today, Congress has agreed to fix many of these inequities, and has \nprovided for a more balanced reimbursement formula. By increasing \nMedicare physician reimbursement, we will improve patient access to \ncare and increase the ability of states to recruit and retain \nphysicians. When Medicare physician reimbursement rates are raised, \npatients are the ultimate beneficiaries.\n  I have enjoyed working with my colleagues, including Senator \nBingaman, on these very important issues.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, pursuant to section 313(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I submit for the Record a list of \nmaterial in S. 1054, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act \nof 2003 reported by the Finance Committee on May 13, 2003, considered \nto be extraneous under subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) \nof section 313. The inclusion or exclusion of material on the following \nlist does not constitute a determination of extraneousness by the \nPresiding Officer of the Senate.\n  To the best of my knowledge, S. 1054, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2003, contains no material considered to be \nextraneous under subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) of \nsection 313 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak regarding the jobs \nand growth package that was reported by the Senate Finance Committee \nand that has been considered on the Senate floor. It was a long and \noften arduous journey that brought the bill here for consideration, and \nI especially thank the majority leader and Finance Chairman Grassley \nfor their extraordinary and tireless efforts in ensuring we were able \nto pass a package in committee and consider this economic stimulus bill \nin the full Senate.\n  Let us remember, this debate began when the President rightfully and \nforcefully made the case that we have an obligation to help jump-start \nan economy that was already in the doldrums even before the tragedy of \nSeptember 11. Over the past few months--as we worked to pass a budget \nfor the first time in 2 years and as the tax cut package moved through \nthe respective House and Senate committees--some said the reductions \nshould be smaller--some said larger--and others even believe that no \ncuts were warranted. Last week, the House passed a very different tax \nbill than the one the Senate is considering today, further reflecting \nthe diversity of deeply held beliefs as to our appropriate course of \naction in Congress.\n  I have believed since last fall that the American people must know we \nare serious about creating jobs with a plan that can be effective now. \nWe have lost 2.3 million jobs since March 2001, and with 48,000 jobs \nlost in April alone, we have reached the highest level of unemployment \nin 8 years at 6 percent. In the last quarter of 2002, the economy was \ngrowing at a languid 1.4 percent annual rate, and the Commerce \nDepartment's latest report showed the economy was still at a weak \ngrowth rate of 1.6 percent. Consumer spending has increased more slowly \nthan at any time since the 2001 recession, and capacity at the Nation's \nfactories is at a low of 72 percent--meaning that demand can and must \nbe increased.\n  So the President is absolutely right to make passage of a robust \ngrowth package central to his agenda, and I applaud his unflagging \nleadership in rejuvenating our economy. At the same time, I have also \nheld throughout this debate that to deficit-finance too high\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\na level of tax cuts would be to risk condemning future generations to \nthe corrosive economic effects of unsustainable deficits--and tying \nhands of future Congresses in addressing our most pressing domestic \nchallenges.\n  With a net $350 billion for stimulus, the package reported by the \nFinance Committee is consistent with these principles, and those that \nare embodied in a letter I signed along with Senators Voinovich, \nBaucus, and Breaux before consideration of the budget resolution. In \nthat letter, we stated our belief that ``our nation would benefit from \nan economic growth package that would effectively and immediately \ncreate jobs and encourage investment.'' But we also expressed our \nbelief that ``any growth package that is enacted through reconciliation \nthis year must be limited to $350 billion in deficit financing over 10 \nyears and any tax cuts beyond this level must be offset.''\n  So how did I arrive at 350? It was not by simply splitting the \ndifference. It was by making a clear, bright-line distinction as to \nwhich measures were truly effective, short-term stimulus and which were \nnot. The $350 billion package approved by the Finance Committee \nprovides for all of the President's proposals that can truly have the \nimmediate, stimulative effect our economy requires in their entirety. \nIndeed, as economist William Gale of the Brookings Institute has said, \nwithin that $350 billion figure, we would likely get most of the short-\nterm job boost.\n  To pay for dividend tax cuts that could create long-term growth, the \nFinance Committee package employs genuine offsets. With all the \nprovisions of the committee plan in effect for the full 10 years--\naccelerating policy that was already passed by the Congress in 2001--it \ncreates the kind of continuity and stability for both markets and \nconsumers that is critical in making investment and spending \nstrategies.\n  While some undoubtedly believe we should pass a significantly larger \ntax cut, let us remember that $350 billion in net tax cuts is by no \nmeans inconsequential. In fact, if enacted it may be the third largest \ntax cut in history--and is being considered just 2 years following the \nlargest tax cut in history. Moreover, the Finance Committee bill is a \nresponsible bill that recognizes the lessons learned from past debates \non economic stimulus--that boosting both consumer purchasing power and \nbusiness investment is vitally important to economic growth.\n  For example, the package would cut the marginal tax rates across the \nboard--impacting workers' paychecks by increasing their take-home pay \nthis year. The bill also accelerates tax relief for families with \nchildren, including a provision not in either the President's plan or \nthe House bill to accelerate the increase in the amount of the child \ntax credit that is refundable for working families with low incomes--\nbuilding on my inclusion of refundability in the 2001 tax package. \nMarried couples would also receive tax relief from the unfair marriage \npenalty through the expansion of the standard deduction and the 15 \npercent tax bracket.\n  To spur investment, the Finance Committee bill triples the amount a \nsmall business can write off for investments in new business assets--\nand with small businesses representing 99 percent of all employers--\ncontributing to 51 percent of private-sector output--and providing \nabout 75 percent of net new jobs, that is exactly the kind of policy \nthat can help create jobs soon. It would also provide needed capital to \nsmall businesses by expanding the ability of pension plans and other \ntax-exempt entities to invest in the securities of Small Business \nInvestment Companies. This provision alone is expected to create an \nadditional 16,000 jobs due to the additional investment capital \navailable for small businesses.\n  Furthermore, the State fiscal relief provision in the Finance \nCommittee plan can provide additional economic stimulus. With States \nfacing combined shortfalls of more than $68 billion in fiscal year 04, \nI thank Chairman Grassley for working to include a ``trust fund'' in \nthe package of $20 billion in relief for the States and local \ngovernments to use as they see fit to address increasing \nMedicaid costs, transportation needs, homeland security infrastructure, \neducation, and other critical functions.\n\n  I know some have argued State budget shortfalls result from \noverspending. Yet, as a report issued by the National Governors \nAssociation shows, State spending from 1995 to 2001 increased 6.5 \npercent per year, a rate identical to spending from 1979 to 2003, and I \nwould like unanimous consent to print that report in the Record.\n  I also have here a letter from the heads of the Conference of State \nLegislators, the Council of State Governments, the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, the National Association of Counties, the National League of \nCities and the International City/County Management Association \ndocumenting that States and localities are experiencing their worst \nfiscal conditions since World War II. I ask unanimous consent this \nletter also be printed in the Record along with my statement.\n  Moreover, according to a recent Wall Street Journal article, \n``Analysts at Goldman Sachs figure state and local belt-tightening (in \ntheir budgets) will shave as much as a half-point from the economy's \ngrowth. . .'' By providing State fiscal relief, we have the opportunity \nto return that half-point of growth to our economy. And let us \nremember, dollars spent on education, health care, and transportation \nhave an economic value today and tomorrow.,\n  Indeed, should State decide to use a portion of the assistance on \ntransportation, it is worth nothing that, according to the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, for every $1 billion invested in transportation, 47,500 \nnew jobs are created. And let us not forget that State and local \ngovernments account for more than 15 million jobs nationwide. As we \ntake steps to put more money into the hands of consumers, we must also \nmake sure that those who are employed by a State or local government, \neither directly or through a government service contract, are able to \nremain employed.\n  On that note, I am pleased an amendment was included here on the \nfloor to further refine the agreement and language that Senator Smith \nand I included in the growth package reported by the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  After working to generate strong bipartisan support for this issue, \nthe Senate Finance committee established a $20 billion trust fund in S. \n1054, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, to \nprovide critical, flexible relief for both State and local governments. \nI also want to thank Chairman Grassley again for his willingness to \nwork with me to identify appropriate offsets that enured this proposal \nwould not increase the net cost of the growth package.\n  By securing support in committee to include a $20 billion fiscal \nrelief trust fund, I was able to ensure that States and localities \nreceive the help they need in balancing their fiscal year 2004 budgets. \nThe subsequent amendment we passed on the floor, with my support \nincluded my proposal which requires half of the $20 billion to be \ndistributed between State and local governments--with States receiving \n$6 billion and localities receiving $4 billion. The remaining $10 \nbillion goes to States through a temporary increase to the Federal \nMedical Assistance Percentage, known as FMAP, to help alleviate the \nshort-term spike in Medicaid costs. The assistance would be distributed \nin fiscal years 2003 and 2004.\n\n  So, again, the Finance Committee bill fully provides for the \nappropriate range of short-term stimulus measures. At the same time, \nfor me--as I have stated--the net $350 billion cost of that package \nstrikes a balance in keeping with the requirements imposed by my \nallegiance to the principles of fiscal responsibility. Because I came \nto this debate as one deeply rooted in the idea that perhaps the issue \nthat best demonstrates our commitment to the generation of tomorrow is \nbalancing the Federal budget. I have said time and again that there is \nnot goal more critical to the economic future of our Nation--and that \nis not just my view.\n  As Chairman Greenspan recently testified, ``(The deficit) does affect \nlong-term interest rates, and it does have an impact on the economy.'' \nAnd he has also warned that, ``If . . . you get significant increases \nin deficits which induce a rise in long-term interest rates, you will \nbe significantly undercutting the benefits'' of tax cuts. If you \nconsider that the two sectors that are keeping the economy afloat right\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\nnow--housing and automobiles--are also two of the most interest rate \nsensitive--just imagine where we would be in the future with high \nunemployment and high interest rates.\n  And it is not just our future economy at stake--if that by itself \nisn't reason enough for fiscal prudence. I will recall the years we \nfought to arrive at balanced budgets and surpluses--and reaching that \nfiscal ``holy grail'' in the late 1990s was supposed to open a window \nof opportunity to address the domestic challenges of the coming \ndecade--most significantly, strengthening Social Security and Medicare.\n  Yes, even then, many of us were mindful that projections of future \nsurpluses were just that--projections. That is why even as I supported \nthe tax cuts in 2001--to provide, in Chairman Greenspan's words--an \n``insurance policy'' against the effects of a recession, and to provide \nrelief at a time when Americans were suffering under the highest tax \nburden since World War II--I proposed and I championed a trigger \nlinking the level of spending and taxes to the level of surpluses \nactually realized.\n  Of course, none of us could have foreseen that so many challenges \nwould soon arrive, as the President has said, ``In a single season.'' \nSeptember 11, the war on terrorism, and the necessity of disarming the \nIraqi regime, the costs of bolstering our homeland security--all those \nshook an already fragile economy and sparked a return to deficits. In \nfact, CBO attributes fully 68 percent of the evaporated $5.6 trillion \nin surpluses to the recession and economic downturn.\n  So here we are, with CBO having projected just this month that the \ndeficit will be $300 billion--which is 22 percent higher than their \nprojection from only 3 months ago and about 92 percent more than last \nyear! Keep in mind that is without accounting for the approval of \nadditional tax cuts or additional costs of pressing national priorities \nlike the war in Iraq, homeland security costs, and passing a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. And Citigroup economic forecasters have \nrecently predicted that the 2003 deficit could be as high as $500 \nbillion.\n\n  Even optimist projections that assume higher-then-expected \nproductivity growth anticipate substantial long-term deficits. And if \ngrowth remains just ``average'', the Nation will fact unsustainable \nbudget deficits. Just this month, economists with Goldman Sachs \nexpressed alarm about projections that Federal debate will grow from 33 \nto 49 percent of gross domestic product--a circumstance they say will \nundermine the economy, instead of spurring economic growth. And as we \nface a true cumulative deficit through 2013 projected to be nearly $4.5 \ntrillion--not counting the $2.7 trillion in surpluses from Social \nSecurity that are currently being sued to mask the size of the \ndeficit--we cannot tolerate the confluence of burgeoning deficits in \nperpetuity with the retirement of 77 million baby boomers beginning in \n2013.\n  That is why it was critical that--in establishing a policy on the \ntaxation of dividends that could be built on as we assess the reaction \nof, and overall impact on, the financial and business sectors--the \nFinance Committee package pays for it with offsets. As Chairman \nGreenspan has said, cutting taxes on dividends will ``bolster the \neconomy's long-term ability to grow''--but they should also be paid \nfor.\n  As reported by the Finance Committee, the bill includes real offsets, \nscored by the Joint Committee on Taxation, to fully compensate the \napproximately $80 billion cost of the provision. Moreover, in providing \na capped exclusion of $500 for the taxation of dividends, with an \nadditional exclusion for dividend amounts above $500 that goes from 10 \npercent to 20 percent over 10 years, the proposal would benefit all \ntaxpayers who receive dividends, eliminating the tax entirely for 84.7 \npercent of all taxpayers.\n  One of the arguments that proponents of eliminating the tax on \ndividends use to tout the proposal's benefits is that it will reduce \nthe cost of capital for business over the long term. I agree. However, \ncutting taxes on dividends affects the financial markets as well.\n  I am concerned that enacting a shorter term provision with a sunset \nwould have negative consequences and potentially harm the economy. \nKevin Hassett, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, has \ncommented on such a dividend plan, saying that, ``Since the eliminate \nof dividend taxes is only temporary, investors must evaluate the risk \nthat dividend taxes will come back. If they do, then the cash flows to \ninvestors from owing stock will plummet, as will the value of shares. \nUnder such circumstances, it is undeniable that government policy \nsignificantly increases the fundamental risk of stocks. It would be \nhard to imaging that this would be good for the stock market or the \neconomy.''\n  Moreover, the benefits of cutting taxes on dividends cannot be viewed \nin isolation--the effect on the budget must be factored in the \nanalysis. A key point is that, as the Federal budget goes further in \nthe red, the associated mounting Federal debt will ``crowd out'' \nprivate capital in the marketplace--having a damaging impact on the \neconomy. This will become more and more evident as we approach the end \nof this decade, with the pressures of the very large increase in baby \nboomer retirements.\n  The bottom line is that, while deficits have supplanted surpluses due \nto war costs and the lingering effects of recession, we have a \nfundamental responsibility to ensure they are a temporary phenomenon--\nnot a perpetual cycle ``as far as the eye can see.'' The years of \nbalanced budgets in the late 1990s should be no brief fiscal interlude, \nbut rather the rule--so lowering taxes and containing deficits until we \nreturn to balanced budgets must not be mutually exclusive goals.\n  Again, the tax bill that was reported out by the Finance Committee \nprovides the right balance of tax relief that would stimulate both \nconsumption and investment. The fiscally responsible growth policies \ncontained in that package meet the dual, critical challenges of \nimmediate, stimulative economic growth without further inflating budget \ndeficits and returning to a perpetuity of red ink. And, as I have said, \nthe dividend plan in the Finance bill is a long-term policy that takes \nan important, but incremental step to eliminating that ax on dividends.\n  Regrettably, however, the temporary dividend proposals in the final \nbill, I believe, is not good long-term tax policy. If we assume a \nfuture Congress will extend this provision permanently, then the true \ncost would be over $300 billion--adding further to ballooning deficits \nwell above the $350 billion net cost of the Finance Committee bill. On \nthe other hand, if Congress does not extend the policy, it could have \ndire implications on the financial markets and companies.\n  Finally, it must be noted the way in which this provision is paid for \ndilutes the important benefits of the section 179 expensing by \nsunsetting its expansion and cutting short marriage penalty relief \nproposed by the President. Therefore, for the reasons I have just \ndetailed, I regret I am unable to support the final package, as \namended.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referred to \nearlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows::\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2003.\n     Hon.

Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Daschle: \n     With the international challenges our Nation faces, including \n     a possible military engagement with Iraq, continuing tension \n     on the Korean Peninsula, and the ongoing war on terrorism, \n     coupled with sluggish economic growth, we believe it is \n     critical a budget resolution for Fiscal Year 2004 (FY2004) be \n     enacted this year. We are committed to working in a \n     bipartisan manner to this end.\n       We believe that our nation would benefit from an economic \n     growth package that would effectively and immediately create \n     jobs and encourage investment. We appreciate President Bush's \n     leadership in identifying this need and beginning this \n     important debate with his economic growth proposal.\n       Given these international uncertainties and debt and \n     deficit projections, we believe that any growth package that \n     is enacted through reconciliation this year must be limited \n     to $350 billion in deficit financing over 10 years and any \n     tax cuts beyond this level must be offset. All signatories to \n     this letter are committed to defeating floor amendments that \n     would reduce or increase this $350 billion amount.\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\n       We look forward to working with you on a bipartisan budget.\n           Sincerley,\n     John Breaux.\n     Max Baucus.\n     Olympia Snowe.\n     George V.

We believe a \n     partnership among the federal, state and local governments \n     and the private sector is necessary to expeditiously achieve \n     this recovery. With state and local governments experiencing \n     their worst fiscal conditions since World War II, we are not \n     positioned to help stimulate the economy. Additionally, \n     states and localities continue to deal with the excessive \n     inflationary costs of certain state-federal partnerships, \n     such as Medicaid. Finally, state and local governments \n     continue to fill gaps in unfunded federal mandates and \n     underfunded national expectations. Instead, state and local \n     governments are reducing workforces, deferring capital \n     projects, cutting programs and imposing fee increases and \n     raising income, sales and property taxes. These activities \n     work against economic recovery and the partnership we feel is \n     critically needed.\n       We are very pleased with the Senate's past response to and \n     action on our request for fiscal assistance and partnership \n     in economic recovery. We are eager to work with you to \n     develop reconciliation and economic recovery legislation. \n     Thank you for your consideration of our concerns.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on S. 1054, the \nJobs and Growth Reconciliation Tax Act of 2003.\n  This debate on the tax reconciliation bill is necessary and long \noverdue. I think it is clear that Members on both sides of the aisle \nagree that our economy is struggling and a growth package is \ndesperately needed. However, there are wide differences of opinion on \nthe contents of the best package and the best way to implement it.\n  I am, and always have been, a proponent of the President's original \ngrowth package of $726 billion. Implementing the President's proposed \nbill would create millions of jobs, increase the gross domestic \nproduct, GDP, and personal income, and in the process, stimulate \noverall growth of our Nation's economy.\n  My home State of Georgia would reap overwhelming benefits from the \nPresident's proposal if enacted into law. For instance, between 2004 \nand 2008, 26,720 additional Georgia citizens would secure jobs; Georgia \ntaxpayers would average $4.2 billion more in disposable income per \nyear; and Georgia taxpayers would average $2.2 billion more in personal \nsaving per year.\n  Between the President's proposal, the House-passed bill and the \nSenate bill, the Senate bill of $413 billion, which is loaded with tax \nhikes in the form of offsets, is by far the weakest of the three bills. \nThis bill will do little to stimulate the economy and provide almost no \ntax relief to the millions of Americans who seek it. While many of the \ntax reducing provisions contained within this bill are worthwhile and \nsound, now may not be the best time to go forth with them given the \nstate of our economy and the increasing budget deficit.\n  Tax cuts will significantly improve the American economy, but only if \nCongress makes wise decisions about which taxes to cut and how to cut \nthem. Addressing the double tax on dividends is a big step in the right \ndirection, but the economy will not reap major benefits unless the tax \nis reduced in an economically beneficial manner.\n  Several proposed amendments will strengthen this bill, but it has a \nlong way to go for it to be in a form that will truly stimulate the \neconomy and create jobs.\n  I will vote for the passage of this bill, but only for the sake of \nadvancing the process and moving the bill to conference so that it can \nbe improved. Should this bill come out of conference looking much like \nit does now, I will most likely oppose final passage of the growth and \neconomic stimulus bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the tax \nreconciliation bill being considered by the Senate today. This tax cut \nbill is not fiscally responsible. When President Bush entered the White \nHouse our country enjoyed a record budget surplus. The fiscal \nirresponsibility of this administration quickly turned that surplus \ninto record deficits. Now this bill will bring our country further into \ndebt, cause more hard working Americans to lose their jobs, and put a \ngreater share of the tax receipts in the pockets of our country's most \nprivileged.\n  I have several concerns about the bill before us. First, these tax \ncuts are tilted even more heavily to the very wealthy than the tax cuts \nthe President championed in 2001. Just look at the rate reductions. For \nthree income brackets, rates would drop by 2 percentage points, but the \ntop rate falls by 3.6 percentage points. While the 2001 bill calls for \nmarriage penalty relief beginning in 2004, the Senate rejected an \namendment offered by Senator Jeffords to provide immediate marriage \npenalty relief to those who qualify for the earned-income tax credit. \nSadly, this administration has chosen to support tax policies where \npeople making over $1 million will reap enormously, while working \nfamilies will receive very little tax relief.\n  Second, these plans have taken tax gimmickry to a whole new level by \npretending that most of the provisions will expire after just 3 years, \nat the end of 2005. By doing so, this bill attempts to jam in as much \nof the President's dividend tax proposal as they can into the Senate's \n$350 billion limit at the expense of more reasonable tax cut provisions \naimed at low- and middle-income working families. It is obvious that \nproponents of these tax cuts have no intention of allowing any of these \nprovisions to expire and in fact will come back to this floor again and \nagain asking for them to be made permanent. Instead of acting in a \nfiscally responsible manner, they are masking from the American people \nthe true, astronomical costs of this bill.\n  Third, these cuts will push our country deeper in debt. The \nnonpartisan\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that the President's full tax \ncut would add $2.7 trillion to the deficit through 2013. At the same \ntime the administration is pushing for Congress to pass a $1 trillion \nincrease in the Federal debt limit that does not account for additional \ntax cuts. I do not think we can afford another large tax cut at this \ntime until we get our own fiscal house in order.\n  Clearly, this tax cut plan is not about growing the economy or \ncreating jobs. It is about starving the Government and wooing some \nvoters. In fact, leading economists have stated repeatedly that the \nelimination of taxes on dividends paid to investors--the centerpiece of \nthe President's tax cut proposal--would do very little to spur economic \ngrowth or reduce the Nation's jobless rate.\n  In 2001, I voted against the Bush tax cut bill because it was too \nskewed toward the wealthiest Americans and too fiscally irresponsible. \nSince then, we have gone from record surpluses to record deficits, and \nthe economy is still floundering. Passing another enormous tax cut this \nyear will only continue this trend and increase the economic problems \nthat our children and grandchildren will inherit.\n  Earlier this year, the President said we should not pass our fiscal \nproblems onto future Presidents, Congresses, and generations. I agree \nwith him. Unfortunately, this tax cut bill will drive us deeper into \ndebt and will do exactly what the President says we should avoid, \nburden our children.\n  While the promise of another tax cut sounds great, I am not going to \nask my children and grandchildren and everyone else's children and \ngrandchildren to pay for it. It is not right. It is not fair. And it is \nnot the American way.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that certain \nprovisions of S. 1054 have engendered concern in the equipment leasing \nindustry. I recognize that assets used by vital American industries are \noften lease-financed. It is not the intention of the Senate or \nCommittee on Finance to impede legitimate leasing transactions. I wish \nto assure the markets that in any final legislation, the tax incentives \nutilized in leases that are considered appropriate under current law \nwill be maintained.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, earlier today my colleague on the Finance \nCommittee, Chairman Grassley, offered an amendment to S. 1054, the \npending tax bill, to improve Medicare funding for rural patients and \nproviders. I supported the amendment, which passed, 86-12.\n  Many of the Grassley amendment's provisions were taken from S. 3018, \nMedicare legislation Senator Grassley and I introduced legislation last \nyear. Many of those provisions were also included in the Senate Rural \nHealth Caucus bill, which I support. And several of the provisions have \nbeen recommended by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), \nwhich advises Congress on Medicare payment policy.\n  Taken together, these changes--including an equalization of the \nhospital base payment amount, changes to the Critical Access Hospital \nprogram, and language to improve access to physician care in rural \nareas--will go a long way toward ensuring greater geographic equity in \nMedicare reimbursement.\n  That said, I believe the way in which the Senate passed these \nprovisions--as an amendment to tax legislation--is far from perfect. A \nMedicare bill, debated in the Finance Committee, is the proper vehicle \nfor changes to the Medicare law, and I would have preferred that these \nprovisions be considered in that manner.\n  A full debate in the Finance Committee will allow senators to \nexchange views and advocate changes they believe are important for \nMedicare. A debate in the Finance Committee will allow Medicare \nstakeholders an opportunity to share their views as well. Whether with \nrespect to spending or offsets, the Committee should have the \nopportunity to consider all of those views fully.\n  For example, while the provisions in the Grassley amendment are \nimportant, they do not represent a full list of Medicare changes I \nwould like to see. Most notably, the amendment does not address \nMedicare's most severe inadequacy: the lack of an outpatient drug \nbenefit. Further, the amendment does not address many concerns facing \nMedicare's various payment systems, including payments for physicians, \nnursing homes, teaching hospitals and hospital outpatient departments, \nto name a few.\n  As for offsets, the Grassley amendment included three: a freeze in \nMedicare DME payments; establishment of copayments and deductibles for \nMedicare outpatient laboratory services; and reductions in payment for \nMedicare Part B-covered drugs. These offsets are not without \ncontroversy.\n  For example, while independent experts agree that Medicare overpays \nproviders for Part B drugs, agreement is less apparent on the proper \npayment providers should receive for the administration of these drugs. \nAnd while it is true that lab services are nearly unique in not \nrequiring coinsurance under Medicare, it's also true that lab services \nare less discretionary than many other Medicare-covered services.\n  Debate in the committee--as we recently had on the tax bill--is \nimportant to the legislative process. I urge Chairman Grassley to hold \na markup on Medicare legislation, so that changes to Medicare--\nincluding enactment of a Medicare drug benefit--can be considered in \nthe appropriate manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will read \nthe bill for the third time.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2 which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \n     section 201 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2004.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If we are going to finish this bill, which we will, we will \nfinish it tonight. The plans are to finish the bill tonight. I know \nthere are a number of amendments.

Even if we invent a vaccine tomorrow, we will have plenty of \nopportunity to refine this bill or the framework upon which this bill \nwas started at a later date.\n  I again encourage all people who are considering amendments to not \noffer those amendments. Our intent is to defeat each one. I remind \neverybody, this is a bipartisan bill.\n  It did come from the House of Representatives, built on lots of other \nbills on which we have been working, and only one Democrat and a \nhandful of Republicans voted against this bill. Therefore, I encourage \nour colleagues to withdraw amendments.\n  We will be working together in a bipartisan fashion to improve this \nfight against a devastating virus. The intent is to complete this bill \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the majority leader will yield, would the majority \nleader seek to ascertain how many amendments will indeed be called up \nyet?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, indeed I hope the managers can agree on a \nlist of amendments. Again, I know a lot of people--we have been working \non colloquies, and we will continue to do that, if necessary, to show \nwhat our intent is. Again, I am not sure if a final list has been \nsettled upon. I encourage it to be as small as possible. I inquire of \nthe other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are working on a definitive list as we \nspeak. There are some amendments that may only require a voice vote, \nbut at this point there are at least three or four amendments that may \nrequire rollcalls but with very short time limits. I know of no one on \nour side requesting more than 10 minutes in an effort to offer their \namendments. So we should be able to move these quickly.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do not believe we have any amendments on \nour side to be offered tonight. I encourage my colleagues to yield back \ntime, again after careful explanations on their amendments so people \nknow what they are voting on, but yield back time accordingly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all rollcall votes be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the leadership try to determine how \nmany amendments are really going to be called up? We have cast 30 or 31 \nrollcall votes already today. It is now 17 minutes until midnight. We \nused to ask for a show of hands as to which Senators were serious about \ncalling up amendments, and I would hope the leaders would do that. I \nwould like to stay around and finish action on the bill, but I am not \nbound to do so. If we are going to have several, I will ask unanimous \nconsent for a leave of absence from the Senate for the rest of the \nevening and be on my way home.\n  I would love to stay around and finish voting with other Senators. I \ndo not want to presume to be the leader tonight, but I have been known \nto ask other Senators for a show of hands as to which Senators were \nserious about calling up amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I respond by saying I am scared to death to ask the other \nside how many amendments we actually have. We heard from the Democratic \nleader that there are four amendments that will likely require rollcall \nvotes.\n  From our side of the aisle, we have no amendments. We made it very \nclear what our strategy is, and that is to defeat the amendments. Why? \nBecause it is the clearest way to help the hundreds of thousands of \npeople who we know will benefit if we pass this bill tonight and get it \nto the G-8 so that the President can use it appropriately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest we get on with these amendments. The sooner we \ndo so, the sooner we will finish.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I be granted a leave of \nabsence for the remainder of the evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 682\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), for herself, \n     Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Corzine, \n     Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Biden, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 682.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I rise today with Senators Leahy, Clinton, Durbin, \nJeffords, Harkin, Lautenberg, Reid, Schumer, Corzine, Boxer, Feingold, \nand Biden to offer an amendment to strike the earmark included in the \nbill which mandates that 33 percent of all prevention funds must be \nused exclusively for abstinence before marriage programs.\n  I deeply believe this bill has one major flaw. I appreciate the bill, \nand I know the effort that went into it. It is a big step forward. But \nwhen it comes to AIDS, prevention is the name of the game.\n  Over one-half of the AIDS cases that are expected between today and \n2010 can be prevented. The World Health Organization says of the 45 \nmillion new HIV cases anticipated, 29 million could be averted with \neffective prevention.\n  I was mayor of San Francisco when AIDS was discovered. We had one of \nthe first AIDS program in the country. I spent 9 years of my life as \nMayor developing AIDS prevention programs, seeing what worked and what \ndid not work. What I found was that there has to be flexibility. What \nworks for one group of people or community might not necessarily work \nfor another.\n  I believe one of the major flaws of this bill is the earmark which \nwould require that 33 percent of the prevention funds--that is $1 \nbillion over 5 years or $200 million a year--must be spent exclusively \non abstinence before marriage programs. Abstinence will not work for \neveryone.\n  We offer this amendment not because we are opposed to abstinence \nprograms or do not want to see them funded. Rather, there are many \nadditional approaches that are also effective and we believe it is \ncritical that there be the necessary flexibility for a particular \ncommunity or country to design a prevention program that best meets the \nneeds of its people.\n  I deeply believe that when we look at prevention, we have to consider \na number of programs. Let me give a few examples of prevention programs \nthat should be funded under this bill:\n  Voluntary counseling and testing. This is an important component to \nstop the spread of the virus. Access to testing is important to ensure \nthat one knows they are infected. Often, the disease is spread from \nhusband to wife because he does not even know he is HIV positive. So \ntesting is prevention.\n  Another form of prevention is stopping the spread of HIV from mother-\nto-child. Nevirapine is effective in preventing the transmission of HIV \nfrom a mother to her child. Studies have shown that combining drug \ntherapy with counseling and instruction on use of such drugs can reduce \ntransmission by 50 percent.\n  Blood safety is also an important preventive measure. While the U.S. \nhas taken the necessary steps to nearly eliminate the transmission of \nHIV by blood transfusion, many countries lack resources and \ninfrastructure to take similar action including the creation of a \nnational blood supply, use of low-risk blood donors, screening of blood \ndonations, and reducing the number of unnecessary transfusions.\n  Sexually transmitted disease control is another prevention tool. Left \nunchecked, sexually transmitted diseases can expand the risk of HIV/\nAIDS two to five times.\n  Lastly, empowering women is an important component to prevention. In \nAfrica, women account for 58 percent of HIV/AIDS cases, and the number \nis rising. This means that providing women around the world with health \nand educational opportunities, equal rights before the law, protection \nfrom sexual violence and sexual trafficking, can help them take control \nof their lives and help reduce the spread of HIV.\n\n  It is unrealistic to think that sexual abstinence is the most \nappropriate prevention strategy in every community. There has been \nresearch conducted in our own society on how an abstinence only \napproach fails to reach everyone. Therefore, I fail to understand then \nhow this approach will work in the developing world.\n  I deeply believe that the 33 percent earmark is the wrong approach to \ntake with this bill. The amendment we have submitted would replace that \n33 percent earmark with language that would give local communities the \nflexibility necessary to design prevention programs that work for them. \nIt includes abstinence. It includes faithfulness. It would also include \nthe use of condoms for sexually active people.\n  I believe our amendment is simple and straight forward. Let local \ncommunities, working in conjunction with the USAID and others, develop \nprevention programs that work for them. Congress should be passing \nlegislation that simply gives local communities and health care \nproviders the necessary resources to implement programs that are \neffective given their unique cultural, social, and medical \ncircumstances.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the leader for yielding the \nfloor. I thank the Senator from California for the spirit in which she \nis putting this amendment forward. She wants to see the best possible \nhappen. I appreciate the tenor and spirit she is putting forward.\n\n  I reiterate what the chairman of the committee said: We want to get a \nbill through. If we put this amendment in, it is not going to get done \nin time for the G-8 meeting.\n  The second issue, this week the First Lady of Uganda was visiting and \nspoke to a number of us. Uganda has been a wonderful model with great \nsuccess thus far working on reducing the incidence of AIDS from a 21 \npercent level of infection of AIDS in their country in 1991 to 6 \npercent in 2002. She said very clearly and directly this is about a \nchange of culture, about pushing a model of ABC which started with \nabstinence and be faithful. That was the key, the key area they needed \nto push in that they got the most success, the right thing to do.\n  I point out in this area, the way the bill reads, in this actual \nprovision, 33 percent of 20 percent would be used for abstinence \nprograms, but not just abstinence programs. It would be abstinence and \nother programs along with it. Effectively, we are talking about roughly \n6.5, 6.7 percent of the money. This is a small amount. It is a clear \nmessage we think needs to be sent along with an effective model that \nworked very well in Uganda and is being implemented in Senegal, Zambia, \nEthiopia, and Jamaica because it has proven so successful.\n  This is an important provision to leave in because if we change it, \neven with the good intentions of the Senator from California, it will \nstall, if not really put the bill way back, because this issue involved \na major dispute with the House.\n  Second, the abstinence programs have worked, in the clear places they \nhave been used, particularly in Uganda, the model that has been most \nfrequently cited.\n  Third, it is a small portion of the funding; 6.7 percent is actually \nin use here.\n  I urge for all those reasons my colleagues vote down the Feinstein \namendment and stay with the provisions of the bill as sent over from \nthe House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have heard this interesting discussion by \ntwo Senators I like a great deal. I cannot add to the experience the \ndistinguished Senator from California had as\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\nmayor of San Francisco and, in fact, in her work as a national leader \nin efforts to prevent AIDS.\n  I say also to my good friend from Kansas that I remember being in \nUganda at a time when they were first becoming aware of the fact they \nhad an AIDS problem. I was sitting with President Museveni when he got \nhis first real briefing, by USAID officials, of the calamity of AIDS in \nhis country. At that time he switched from opposing the use of condoms \nas an acceptable way to protect against AIDS to supporting it.\n  It is one of the reasons Uganda is a model for Africa today. Of \ncourse they support abstinence. So does the Senator from California. Of \ncourse they support fidelity. So does the Senator from California. But \nalso in Uganda they know that does not always work. And they also \nsupport the use of condoms.\n  I commend the Senator from California for her amendment. This \namendment addresses one of the serious flaws in a bill that has much \nelse to recommend it.\n  This bill, assuming the President requests the funds to implement it, \nwill be a major step forward in the fight against HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria.\n  I have pressed for significantly more funding to combat AIDS ever \nsince I first traveled to Africa in 1990 and saw the ravages of AIDS in \nUganda, South Africa, and Kenya.\n  We have had amendments brought up here within the past year to \nappropriate emergency funds to combat AIDS, that were opposed by the \nWhite House. Now the majority party has its own bill, a House bill and \nthey want us to pass it without amendment. I understand that. But this \nis the Senate, not the House.\n  The amendment of the Senator from California would clarify several \nmatters.\n  First, we all support programs to promote abstinence among young \npeople who are not yet sexually active. We support that and her \namendment reaffirms that.\n  We also support programs to promote fidelity, because multiple \npartners is a major cause of HIV transmission. The Senator's amendment \npromotes fidelity.\n  But in many instances, and especially for women and girls in \ncountries like Uganda, Cambodia, India, or South Africa, abstinence is \nnot a realistic option. And fidelity may be an option for women, but it \nmakes no difference because they have no control over their male \npartners. And that also goes for married women.\n  In many developing countries, women and girls have no say over when \nor even with whom they have sexual relations. And for them, a condom is \ntheir only protection against HIV. It is a matter of life and death.\n  That is true in Uganda, where I have been. We have heard a lot said \nabout how Uganda's rate of HIV infection was reduced because of \nabstinence. That is not the whole story. In fact it is a distortion. \nPromoting abstinence has been very important there, but it has been no \nmore important than other interventions, like promoting the use of \ncondoms.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment supports abstinence. It supports \nfidelity. And it supports the use of condoms. Like the Uganda model, \nher amendment does not give one approach any more weight than the \nother.\n\n  Most importantly, it does not mandate a certain amount of funds for \nany one approach.\n  Whether 33 percent or 13 percent or 3 percent of the funds we make \navailable for AIDS prevention are used to promote abstinence is a \npublic health decision that should be made not by Congress, but by \nexperts working in the field.\n  The same goes for the amount spent on condoms. It is not for us to \ndecide that. It varies depending on the country and the target \npopulation.\n  Among younger populations abstinence may be the best approach. Among \nothers it may be irrelevant and condoms may be the only practical \nprotection. That is consistent with Uganda's experience. It is \nconsistent with the experience of exports everywhere who are working to \nstop the spread of AIDS. And it is consistent with what President Bush \nhimself has said.\n  It is also important to mandate that abstinence, fidelity, and \ncondoms are only three of the necessary approaches to AIDS prevention.\n  There is also counseling. There is voluntary testing. There is \ntreatment for sexually transmitted diseases. These are all essential to \nany AIDS prevention strategy. Again, this has been true in Uganda, and \nin many other countries.\n  So let us not earmark one approach--abstinence--when it is only one \nof several necessary approaches. Senator Feinstein's amendment leaves \nit to the Administration, and to the experts who implement these \nprograms, to decide. That is the only sensible and workable approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is late, but I cannot let the characterization of \nthe AIDS program in Uganda pass without suggesting that the \ncharacterization by the Senator from Kansas is an oversimplification of \nhow they reduced the AIDS incidence in Uganda.\n  Most importantly, what Uganda did is to destigmatize AIDS, to not \nmake people who have AIDS pariahs, and to talk about a range of \nalternatives, not simply abstinence.\n  The House approach to this does not characterize the way in which \nthey succeed in Uganda. In fact, I suggest it does just the opposite.\n  I object to the use of the Uganda example, which is one of the \nleading examples of the world. Without the ABC, all three of them, it \nwould not have succeeded. The House approach is too limited to save the \nlives we all want to save.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me clarify that if $2 billion is spent \nin the first year for bilateral HIV programs and if 20 percent is for \nprevention, only $132 million will be involved in the abstinence \nprograms. I simply say, it is a fairly small amount.\n  When the President addressed this issue at the White House, he \nspecifically said, there are three elements. There is abstinence, \nfaithfulness, and condoms. He said all three. There is a liberal amount \nof money for a lot of flexibility.\n  I don't argue with the distinguished Senator from California. I just \nsay essentially the language accomplishes that.\n  Once again, we are faced with the fact that if we are determined to \namend it, we are back into the problem with the House, which debated \nthis. This was an important part of the compromise that brought those \n375 votes in favor of the bill.\n  I yield back our time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 1 minute to Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Having been to Uganda and having seen the success of this \nprogram, the characterization on the floor is not correct. Secretary of \nState Powell has made it clear the United States approach involves all \nthree--abstinence, fidelity, and condoms. And in the country of Uganda, \nit has been successful.\n  Why in the world are we establishing a 33 percent requirement when it \ncomes to the abstinence programs? This afternoon we had tea with the \nFirst Lady of Uganda, and we had a conversation with her and asked, \nwouldn't you want to have the flexibility to apply these programs to \nthe communities and villages and situations in the most effective way \nto fight this disease? She said, of course we would.\n  This House bill, which is now so sacred that we cannot change one \nword, has put in 33 percent--not in the interest of global health but \nin the interest of an American political agenda. That is unfortunate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield the remaining balance of the \ntime and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is necessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessary absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote aye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

Mr. President, the majority leader and I have been \ndiscussing how we will continue. I know of no one who has asked for a \nrollcall vote on final passage. It would be our hope that we could \nvoice vote final passage.\n  I also encourage my colleagues, to the degree possible, to accept \nvoice votes on these amendments as well. The hour is late, and each \nvote takes at least 10 minutes. There will be a voice vote on final, \nassuming everyone has agreed. To the extent possible, I encourage voice \nvotes on amendments as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 681\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself \n     and Mr. Feingold, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 681.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the procurement of certain pharmaceuticals at \n       the lowest possible price for products of assured quality)\n\n       On page 54, strike lines 7 through 24, and insert the \n     following: ``medicines to treat opportunistic infections, at \n     the lowest possible price for products of assured quality (as \n     provided for in subparagraph (D)). Such procurement shall be \n     made anywhere in the world notwithstanding any provision of \n     law restricting procurement of goods to domestic sources.\n       ``(B) Mechanisms for quality control and sustainable \n     supply.--Mechanisms to ensure that such HIV/AIDS \n     pharmaceuticals, antiviral therapies, and other appropriate \n     medicines are quality-controlled and sustainably supplied.\n       ``(C) Distribution.--The distribution of such HIV/AIDS \n     pharmaceuticals, antiviral therapies, and other appropriate \n     medicines (including medicines to treat opportunistic \n     infections) to qualified national, regional, or local \n     organizations for the treatment of individuals with HIV/AIDS \n     in accordance with appropriate HIV/AIDS testing and \n     monitoring requirements and treatment protocols and for the \n     prevention of mother-to-child transmission of the HIV \n     infection.\n       ``(D) Lowest possible price and assured quality.--\n       ``(i) Lowest possible price.--With respect to an HIV/AIDS \n     pharmaceutical, an antiviral therapy, or any other \n     appropriate medicine, including a medicine to treat \n     opportunistic infections, the lowest possible price means the \n     lowest delivered duty unpaid price at which such medicine \n     (which includes all products of assured quality with the same \n     active ingredients) may be obtained in sufficient quantity in \n     either the United States or elsewhere on the world market.\n       ``(ii) Assured quality.--An HIV/AIDS pharmaceutical, an \n     antiviral therapy, or any other appropriate medicine, \n     including a medicine to treat opportunistic infections, shall \n     be considered a product of assured quality if it is--\n\n       ``(I)(aa) approved by the Food and Drug Administration;\n       ``(bb) authorized for marketing by the European Commission;\n       ``(cc) on the most recent edition of the list of HIV-\n     related medicines prequalified for procurement by the World \n     Health Organization's Pilot Procurement Quality and Sourcing \n     Project; or\n       ``(dd) during the period that begins on the date of \n     enactment of this section and ending on December 31, 2004, \n     authorized for use by the national regulatory authority of \n     the country where the product will be used unless the \n     President determines that the product does not meet \n     appropriate quality standards; and\n       ``(II) in compliance with--\n\n       ``(aa) the intellectual property laws of the country where \n     the product is manufactured;\n       ``(bb) the intellectual property laws of the country where \n     the product will be used; and\n       ``(cc) applicable international obligations in the field of \n     intellectual property, to the extent consistent with the \n     flexibilities provided in the Agreement on Trade-Related \n     Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), as \n     interpreted in the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and \n     Public Health, adopted by the World Trade Organization at the \n     Fourth Ministerial Conference at Doha, Qatar on November 14, \n     2001.\n       ``(iii) Prices publicly available.--Prices paid for \n     purchases of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals, antiviral therapies, \n     and other appropriate medicines, including medicines to treat \n     opportunistic infections, of assured quality shall be made \n     publicly available.\n       ``(iv) Application to appropriated funds.--Funds \n     appropriated under title IV of the United States Leadership \n     Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 that \n     are used for the procurement of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals, \n     antiviral therapies, and other appropriate medicines, \n     including medicines to treat opportunistic infections, shall \n     be used to procure products of assured quality at the lowest \n     possible price, as determined under this subparagraph.\n         (E) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall be construed to affect a decision regarding which \n     medicine is most medically appropriate for a specific disease \n     or condition.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we know that 30 million people in Africa \nare afflicted with HIV/AIDS, and millions more around the world are \nalso ill. Eight thousand people die in Africa each day from AIDS, and \nmany of them are children. Only 50,000--1 in every 600--receive the \ndrugs that we know can turn a deadly disease into a chronic one.\n  This legislation promises that funds will finally be available to buy \nthese lifesaving drugs. Our amendment is intended to see that these \ndrugs will help the largest number of people possible. It does that by \nrequiring that products be purchased at the lowest possible price. It \ndoes not add a penny to the cost of this bill. But it also means that \nwe will get the greatest value for this very urgently needed investment \nto stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n  President Bush emphasized in his State of the Union Address \n``antiretroviral drugs can extend life for many years. And the cost of \nthese drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to under $300 a year--which \nplaces a tremendous possibility within our grasp. Ladies and gentlemen, \nseldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so \nmany.''\n  The best way to take advantage of this opportunity as identified by \nthe President is to require the purchase of AIDS drugs of assured \nquality at the lowest possible price. That is now $300 a year--not \n$12,000.\n  It is important that we understand the significance of this \ndifference. If we use the funds in this bill to buy a year's supply of \ndrugs for $12,000 a person, we will help only 100,000 persons. But if \nwe buy the drugs for $300, we will help over 4 million.\n  This amendment is based on the successful program of the Global Fund \nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. This program is proven to \nwork in getting safe, high-quality drugs to people in need in the \ndeveloping world at the lowest price.\n  The essence of this amendment is simple. It fulfills the President's \npledge to treat AIDS patients with drugs costing $300 per case. It \nprotects America's\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\nintellectual property rights. It assures that drugs will be of the \nhighest quality. But, most of all, it means we will be able to save \nmillions of lives instead of thousands.\n  Let us put patients first--not the profits of the drug companies. Let \nus buy drugs at the lowest possible price to treat the maximum number \nof patients. Let us deliver the best medicine at the best price.\n  I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Senator \nKennedy's important amendment. The Senate should not be silent on this \nissue. Senator Kennedy's amendment requires that pharmaceuticals \nprocured by the United States for treatment initiatives authorized in \nthis bill be purchased at the lowest possible cost while maintaining \nhigh quality standards.\n  In the past, Congress has been reluctant to address treatment issues, \nshying away from the complexities associated with providing treatment \nand resources. But just because it has been difficult does not mean it \nis impossible. And recognizing and accepting complexity is no excuse \nfor ignoring urgent needs.\n  I have served on the African Affairs Subcommittee in the Senate now \nfor almost 11 years, and I am pleased to be able to say that it appears \nthat the tide is finally beginning to turn on this issue after so many \nyears with people cavalierly dismissing the notion of providing access \nto antiretroviral drugs in the developing world.\n  I often recall the very end of almost a marathon meeting with the \nSenegalese public health community. An extraordinary group of \nSenegalese doctors, nurses, and volunteers and religious leaders had \ncome out on a Saturday to spend hours talking with me and others about \ntheir coordinated campaign to fight AIDS. We were wrapping up when a \ngentleman who had been among those briefing me stood up, and speaking \nsoftly he told me that he was HIV positive. He wanted to know if there \nwould be any help for him, any assistance with the kind of treatment \nthat is out of reach for some in Africa.\n  There has to be an answer to his question. I heard the President of \nthe United States answer positively in the State of the Union that \nbasic human decency tells us that we cannot stand by while tens of \nmillions die and societies collapse.\n  Recently, in South Africa I met with pediatricians whose exhaustion \nshowed on their faces and their posture and in their tired, angry \nvoices. They were tired of watching children die when they know that \nthe treatment actually exists to save them.\n  There is much more to say about what we have seen in Africa. But what \nwe are talking about here is a tremendous commitment of U.S. resources \nin this bill and in this time of crises. I think we have to get the \nmost that we can for our money.\n  The amendment is about using taxpayer dollars wisely. It would be \nbeyond shameful and almost reprehensible for us to use the resources \nauthorized in this bill for what might end up being sweetheart deals \nwith big pharmaceutical companies for their products if we could get \nequally safe and effective products at a better price.\n  The amendment is in no way targeted to the pharmaceutical industry. \nIt does not prejudge anyone's intentions. It does not exclude any \nsingle provider of safe and effective drugs. It simply demands that the \nU.S. Government get the quality we need at the best available price.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, just as a matter of common sense, the U.S. \nGovernment will attempt to purchase pharmaceutical products of the \nhighest quality at the best price. But I would just simply urge my \ncolleagues to consider the fact that mandating this, while it appears \nreasonable, and has some reliance upon the World Health Organization's \npilot program, we ought to recognize that the World Health Organization \nactually dealing in countries with a high incidence of HIV/AIDS does \nnot guarantee the quality of the medicine. It is probably unable to do \nthat.\n  The facts are--and I respect the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and, likewise, the Senator from Wisconsin; they have \nexperience, I am sure, in the field looking at these programs--the \ntestimony of people I have visited with at Indiana University, who have \nbeen in the field, indicates that the whole idea of the treatment is a \nvery provisional situation.\n  We are grasping as a world at what works. And this is why flexibility \nhas been encouraged thus far. We also are simply up against the fact \nthat the problem is so overwhelming that attempting to obtain \npharmaceutical products from anybody around the world has been \nextremely difficult. And a good number of pharmaceutical companies have \nbeen prepared to make enormous price concessions. And most physicians \nthen point out, you need a physician to help the patient make certain \nthe doses are right, the combination of drugs is right, the discipline \nof dealing with this is correct.\n  It is not a matter of mandating the lowest cost drugs, and failing to \ndo that denying people treatment. The fact is, 80 percent of the people \nwith AIDS in the world are getting no treatment at all. That is why we \nare trying to pass a bill tonight as opposed to having several months \nmore discussion, attempting to perfect the bill. I have said from the \nbeginning, as Dr. Frist, that all of us could perfect this bill in a \nnumber of ways. Our problem is to get a bill through two Houses now so \nit might be of some benefit to our President in his diplomacy and \nadvocacy as he approaches the other wealthy countries of the world, \nstarting at least on the first of January, if not before.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I am hopeful that Members understand the \nimportance of getting drugs at the best price and mandating the highest \nquality and attempting to get as many companies all over the world \ninterested in this as we can. But the amendment, it seems to me, once \nagain, obstructs the fact of getting any bill at all, any relief for \nthe people we are talking about. Therefore, I ask Senators to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have just seen the World Health \nOrganization deal with one of the great challenges of modern times; and \nthat is with SARS. The World Health Organization has been commended all \nover the world for the way it has worked with countries all over the \nworld, and we have joined in that commendation.\n  We have been working with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria to ensure quality products are used to treat \npatients with HIV/AIDS. We are investing money in these quality \nproducts through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \nMalaria. All we are saying in this amendment is that you are going to \nhave the same assured product at the lowest possible price.\n  If the American Government is, through the Global Fund, buying these \nquality products, then you ought to be willing to accept this \namendment. All it does is make sure we have the best prices for these \nproducts of assured quality. We are not saying we have to buy the \nantiretroviral drugs for HIV for $300, but they do have to be purchased \nat the best available price, with the quality assured.\n  I do not understand how we can refuse to say, if we are going to \ninvest the taxpayers' money in this endeavor, then we should get the \nmaximum in terms of the results, in terms of the number of people \nhelped. We should make sure that helping the most people possible is \nthe policy of the United States.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I was wondering if the Senator from Massachusetts would be \nwilling to enter into a time agreement, say, 2 minutes on each side, \nand then have a vote?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We were trying to reach 10 minutes for ourselves. We \nprobably have 2 more minutes for the Senator to speak and then we are \nfinished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, one quick point to reinforce what \nSenator Kennedy said in response to what the Senator from Indiana said.\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\n  Obviously, the Senator from Massachusetts and I are not going to \noffer an amendment to provide unsafe treatments. In fact, the WHO \nguarantees the bioequivalency of a given product. And that just means \nthey actually verify that it is exactly the same as a product that has \nbeen thoroughly tested for safety by an institution such as the FDA.\n  So it is not a valid point that somehow this approach that we are \nsuggesting will lead to products that are not safe. They are as safe as \nthe ones we would use ourselves.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment, like this bill, addresses \na specific pandemic that demands our attention and our action. \nAccording to the most recent data available, at least 20 million people \nhave died of HIV/AIDS globally, orphaning 14 million children. On the \nAfrican continent, approximately 30 million people have the AIDS \nvirus--3 million of whom are children under the age of 15.\n  In the spirit of the underlying bill, I have joined my friend Senator \nKennedy in cosponsoring this amendment to ensure that this bill saves \nas many lives as possible. Our amendment will allow for the purchase of \nmany more drugs to treat those suffering from HIV/AIDS, stretching the \ntaxpayers' dollars as far and as effectively as possible.\n  This amendment allows U.S. taxpayer dollars to go towards the \npurchase of safe, but less expensive equivalent medications on the \nglobal market if they are available. It enables the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID) to use Federal funds to procure drugs \nat the lowest possible price on the global market to treat HIV/AIDS \npatients, provided that they are approved for treatment in the U.S.; \nthe EU; have been selected by the World Health Organization's, WHO, \nPilot Procurement Quality and Sourcing Project for HIV-related \nmedicines; or are authorized for use by the country where the product \nwill be used. These are the same qualifications used by the United \nNations Global Fund to procure drugs.\n  This amendment does not give preference to a particular treatment for \nHIV/AIDS. Patients will not be precluded from receiving the drug \ntreatments that are medically necessary; however, if there is a less \nexpensive equivalent drug included in that treatment, this amendment \nwill require the purchase of that lower-cost drug.\n  As a proponent of free trade and a staunch supporter of upholding our \nglobal trade obligations, I don't believe this amendment violates \ncarefully negotiated agreements on intellectual property rights at the \nWorld Trade Organization, WTO, nor does it weaken the position of our \ntrade representatives in future intellectual property negotiations. The \nlanguage of this amendment closely tracks the most recent intellectual \nproperty rights agreements at the WTO.\n  I urge my colleagues to choose to make treatments available to many \nmore people suffering from this terrible disease and vote for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have checked with both managers of the \nbill. I ask unanimous consent that the only amendments in order be the \nfollowing: Senator Feingold, who is going to offer his amendment; \nSenator Clinton; Senator Lautenberg; Senator Leahy; Senator Landrieu; \nSenator Dodd; Senator Boxer. And it is my understanding the manager of \nthe bill has an amendment to offer. Oh, I am sorry. There he is. And \nthe Boxer amendment will be 20 minutes, equally divided.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I don't need that much time.\n  Mr. REID. Five minutes equally divided.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. REID. That is what I said.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You said 20 minutes. I need 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. OK, Senator Boxer, 20 minutes, equally divided. Senator \nDodd, 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Senator Boxer, 10 minutes, evenly divided.\n  Mr. REID. I think we have been here 17 hours. What do you think?\n  Senator Clinton is going to speak for a short time. She will take a \nvoice vote. Senator Lautenberg is going to enter into a colloquy. \nSenator Leahy is going to offer and withdraw. Senator Landrieu is going \nto enter into a colloquy. Senator Feingold is going to offer and \nwithdraw.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the order of the amendments be: \nFeingold, Clinton, Lautenberg, Leahy, Landrieu, Dodd, and Boxer, and \nthe final vote be that of Senator Biden, and there be no second-degree \namendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I don't mind going last. I \nwill be happy going last.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No, Mr. President, I will go last.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 681.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), \nthe Senator from Hawaii, (Mr. Inouye) and the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 42, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 181 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--42\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Byrd\n     Domenici\n     Inouye\n     Kerry\n  The amendment (No. 681) was rejected.\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, we have two other amendments that require \nrollcalls. Very short time limits will be used to present the \namendments is my understanding. We have no other requests for \nrollcalls. Other Senators will be offering amendments requiring voice \nvotes. I think at that point Senators will be free to leave. I ask that \nthe Boxer amendment be the next in order.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask for information now on the time \nlimits on the two amendments.\n  Mr. REID. The Boxer amendment is 10 minutes. It is already an order.\n  Mr. LUGAR. On the Dodd amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no time limit established.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is my understanding that there was 20 minutes on the \nDodd amendment, 10 minutes on the Boxer amendment, evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no time limit--\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent for that.\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't want to belabor the point, but when \nI said we were in the 17th hour, we did ask for time on the Boxer \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Boxer amendment has a 10-minute time \nlimit.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Dodd has agreed to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin is \nwithdrawn.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 684\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know we are all exhausted and I am \nreally sorry to be here for an extra few minutes. I feel I don't \ndeserve to really be in the Senate because we are talking about global \nAIDS, which is turning into a weapon of mass destruction. I feel very \nbad about what we are doing here tonight.\n  First, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 684.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To require a specific plan to help AIDS orphans)\n\n       On Page 29, line 15, insert before the semicolon the \n     following: ``, including the development and implementation \n     of a specific plan to provide resources to households headed \n     by an individual who is caring for one or more AIDS \n     orphans''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I feel very badly about what we are doing \ntonight. We are passing an inferior bill that was passed by the other \nbody so that the President can hold in his hand a piece of AIDS \nlegislation. How better it would be if it were a fine piece of \nlegislation, if it were a more thoughtful piece of legislation, if it \nwere a more effective piece of legislation.\n  But the fix is in. All amendments are being voted down because of the \nPresident's schedule. Well, I didn't get elected from the largest State \nin the Union, that has been fighting the AIDS epidemic ever since \nSenator Feinstein was a mayor and I was on the county board of \nsupervisors, to rush through something like this. I think it is really \nvery sad that we are being governed by the schedule of the executive \nbranch.\n  I want to tell you very quickly what my amendment does. It restores a \nfocus on AIDS orphans. You cannot think of anything more tragic. AIDS \norphans were the focus of the bills that passed the Senate before. They \nare no longer the focus. More than 10 million children have been \norphaned by AIDS. It is estimated that, by the year 2010, there will be \nover 40 million children left orphaned by this horrendous disease. That \nis a population so large that it is more than California's 37 million \nresidents. It is 8 Wisconsins or 70 North Dakotas. You get the point. \nIn the vast majority of cases, single women and young girls, 16 years \nold, 17 years old, 15 years old, are taking responsibility for the care \nof these orphaned children. Just read about it. It is heartbreaking.\n  All my amendment says is that a specific plan will be developed by \nthe AIDS coordinator and implemented to provide resources, especially \nto households headed by an individual who is caring for one or more \nAIDS orphans.\n  This bill is silent on this point. We do nothing specific about this. \nThis bill is vague. Even though you have committed to vote against \neverything, it will take only 2 minutes for the President to call Tom \nDeLay and say: Help the orphans, vote for this amendment. I hope we \nwill all vote aye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am unfamiliar with the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from California. I have listened carefully to her \nargument, and obviously the bill before us addresses the needs of women \nand orphans in a great number of places. I must argue again, I suspect \nthat the best in this case should not be the enemy of the better.\n  We have a bill here that I believe is sound on these issues. As we \nhave admitted again and again, each one of us might perfect it in \nvarious ways. The distinguished Senator from California is attempting \nto do so now. But I encourage Senators to vote against the amendment \nfor the same reasons I have encouraged Senators to vote against each of \nthe perfecting amendments--realizing that each one of us, in the event \nwe were to write the bill, could do better. But we have two bodies \nworking on a procedure whereby we are on the threshold of having a \nsignificant breakthrough for the people we are attempting to assist and \nsave.\n  The Senator has made an eloquent case for why we ought to have action \nnow and ought to encourage other countries to join us. I ask Senators, \nonce again, to oppose the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. We yield back our time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 685\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 685.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To add CARICOM Countries and the Dominican Republic to \n                 Priority List of HIV/AIDS Coordinator)\n\n       On page 31, line 19, insert the following after the second \n     comma on that line:\n       ``Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, \n     Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica,\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\n     Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the \n     Grenadines, St. Lucia, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, \n     Dominican Republic,''\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues. I know it is \nnow after 1 in the morning. People are tired. It has been a long day. I \nhave great respect for this institution and do not normally like to \ntest the patience of my colleagues, but as tired as all of us are at \nthis very hour, there are some 250,000 orphans right now, 80,000 of \nwhom live in the Caribbean, who are orphaned because their families, \ntheir parents, contracted AIDS.\n  There are half a million people in the 14 CARICOM countries who will \nnot be included as a part of this bill, for reasons that have never \nbeen explained adequately to me, who are suffering a lot more than just \nfatigue tonight because they will not get the kinds of medicines and \nsupport they deserve.\n  I apologize for raising an amendment that is brought up at a late \nhour. I am sorry we are not going to be here tomorrow to debate some of \nthese issues. The decision to be here at this hour is certainly not \nthat of those who are offering these amendments.\n  This is a very important bill. I have great respect for the \nPresident, who has made this an important issue, who wants to bring it \nup and see to it that these issues can be debated when he goes to the \nG-8.\n  My amendment simply says that for the countries that suffer the \nsecond largest incidents of AIDS in the world, the Caribbean countries \nwhere 10 million American tourists go every year, ought to be included \nas part of this package.\n  I do not think our colleagues in the House of Representatives, \nDemocrats or Republicans, would reject this legislation because we add \n14 countries where 5 million people live, where half a million people \nare suffering from AIDS, second only to that of sub-Saharan Africa. If \nthey would object to the bill on that grounds, I do not understand \nthis. Yet we have excluded all but two countries from being recipients \nof this aid. So my amendment merely says we ought to include these \ncountries as part of this package.\n  The average age of death in the Caribbean countries is 45 years of \nage. Twenty-five percent of all hospital beds in these Caribbean \ncountries are now filled with people infected by AIDS. Few of these \npatients receive any treatment at all. The mother-to-child \ntransmissions are the highest in the Americas. The AIDS epidemic has \nalready left 80,000 orphans in these Caribbean countries. Globally, \nhalf of all infected are in children between the ages of 15 and 24, \nexcept in the Caribbean. There it is, 10 years of age.\n  I know it is late, but it is getting later for these kids. It is \ngetting a lot later for them. So I am asking my colleagues in the \nSenate to ask our colleagues in the House to accept an amendment that \nwould include people who live only a few minutes from our shores, who \ndeserve a little more than they are getting tonight. If you are a 10-\nyear-old child and you are suffering from AIDS, you are one of 80,000 \norphans in the Caribbean and you deserve better than being told that \nthis bill cannot be changed, not one dot, not one comma, not one word.\n  I know in fact this bill will be changed before we leave tonight. So \nthe argument somehow that we cannot do this is specious. We ought to be \ndoing better than that. We are the Senate. We are dealing with a \ncritically important global issue. It deserves more of our time, \nattention, and concern than the argument that we are fatigued and \ntired, that we do not have the patience to go back to our colleagues in \nthe House and say we can do better. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment. It is not asking too much to say to half a million \npeople who are a few miles from our shore that we want to include them \nas part of this effort to make this world a better and safer place. I \nurge its adoption.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I, quite frankly, not only agree with every \npoint the Senator has made, but, quite frankly, I have not heard a more \ncompelling case, a more logical case, and a more--how can I say it?--\nreasoned indictment of our failure to be willing to confront the House \nwith what I cannot believe, particularly if the President said he \nsupported this, that we would not be able to get it done.\n\n  It is true that I believe the House is willing to accept some changes \nin this bill. The fact is, as the Senator knows, the bill we had did \nexactly what he is talking about providing for these folks.\n  Even though everyone says there is no possibility of anything being \naccepted beyond this, I find it hard to believe, if this body, which \npassed this before, which unanimously said this made sense, and a \nPresident who says he is overwhelmingly concerned not only about AIDS \nworldwide but about our Latin American friends to our south--remember, \nhe started his whole initiative in foreign policy; he was looking in \nthis hemisphere south.\n  I realize everyone thinks this would not happen, many think this \nwould not occur, but it is clearly worth taking a chance. I am willing \nto bet, if it passes, it gets accepted. I cannot imagine it being \nturned down. I cannot imagine the President of the United States saying \nhe would not accept this amendment.\n  All these amendments have been important, but there is simply no \nlogic whatever--none--to refuse this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I am prepared to yield back my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I would like to add to your comments and those \nof Senator Biden that we have talked mainly this evening about the \nhumanitarian aspects of this issue.\n  If I could bring it a little closer to home, in large part because of \nthe health care conditions in the Caribbean, my State has suffered from \ntime to time outbreaks of tuberculosis and other serious diseases. We \nnow have a significant percentage infected with HIV. These are not \n5,000 miles away; they are just a few minutes away.\n  We have a very direct national interest in arresting this problem, \npreventing its outbreak in the future, and therefore protecting the \npeople of the United States. I hope this amendment will be adopted. It \nnot only is the right thing to do for the people involved, it is the \nright thing to do for our people involved.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will make a short comment and yield to my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  I point out, without for a moment arguing with the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut about the urgency of Latin America, our \nfriends right here in the Caribbean, that the language of the bill with \nregard to the United States coordinator does list 14 countries, but it \nalso then has these words: ``and other countries designated by the \nPresident.''\n  It appears to me this language is fairly flexible. It might have been \nbetter if all of the countries had been listed, but it does enumerate \nthe Latin American countries that the Senator from Connecticut has \npointed to and gives the power of the President to designate other \ncountries.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and then the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have not spoken on this bill. From my experience, I \nknow that few, if any minds, are changed by speeches. But I think it is \nimportant to note that we are not fatigued. We have almost 100 Senators \non the floor. We have been here since 9:15, but we are robust and we \nare able to take on the country's business and we are not fatigued. We \nwill give ample consideration to any amendments which anyone seeks to \noffer.\n  But it ought to be a point of focus that it is possible--barely, but \npossible--that somebody might be watching these proceedings on C-SPAN. \nAnd you might think those who are voting against these amendments are \nhard-hearted. But the fact is that unless we pass a bill, a clean bill, \na virtually clean bill, what is agreed to by the House, this bill is \nnot going to be ready when the President has to make a very important \ninternational trip. The President will be carrying a legislative \npackage of $15 billion. That is a hefty sum of money and can go a long \nway on this hideous disease. With that kind of a package, the President \nwill be in a position to leverage and get funds from other countries.\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\n  I certainly agree with the Senator from California who talked about \nprevention. I certainly agree it would be good to cover more children. \nIt would be good to have lower prices. It would be good to have an \nexplicit coverage to the Caribbean, although as the Senator from \nIndiana pointed out, there is flexibility to do that.\n  When we vote against these amendments, it is not because we do not \nthink they are good or that we are in a hurry or we are fatigued. We \nare focused. But the principal objective is to get it passed and get it \nsigned.\n  People ought to know, if they have not seen the beltway scene, that \nrelations between the Senate and the House are not too good. If we put \na lot of amendments on this bill, nothing will happen. We ought to get \non with it. Fifteen billion is significant. It will really go to the \nheart of the matter. And then it can be revisited at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the hour is late and I point out to my \ncolleagues, I am told this is the 36th vote of the day. According to \nsome, that is a record for this body in a 24-hour period. This appears \nto be the last one.\n  I appreciate the spirit in which this is being put forward by my \ncolleague from Connecticut who has a lot of interest and is focused on \nthis region a great deal. This is coming from his heart.\n  However, we can do this, and what he is asking for, under this bill \nas it is. What is in this bill would provide that opportunity to do it. \nReally, by his raising this, it will elevate the focus, the \npossibilities in the Caribbean.\n  I read directly from the bill, ``directly approving all activities of \nthe United States relating to combating HIV/AIDS,'' and it lists some \n14 countries. Then it says ``and other countries designated by the \nPresident.''\n  I hope the facts he has put forward tonight will be considered by the \nadministration. I believe they will be in combating this and we would \nuse the funds--this is a large portfolio of funds we put forward, $15 \nbillion--to focus and get results. We are on the edge of accomplishing \nsomething historic, of helping a lot, and we can do what our colleague \nfrom Connecticut says under the plain language of this bill.\n\n  I hope we can go ahead and vote on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we want to get this bill off to the \nPresident so he will have it when he goes abroad. I agree with that, \nalthough I don't think that was a reason for opposing the amendments \nthat were offered tonight. We could have passed those amendments, gone \nto conference with the House, and sent this bill to the President in \nplenty of time. But that was not what the majority wanted. They wanted \nto rubber stamp the House bill, despite its defects which were obvious \nto everyone.\n  Let's be realistic about what is going on here.\n  This is an authorization bill. It does not actually appropriate one \ndime. The President will be taking a promise when he goes abroad, \nnothing more. In fact, his budget request for 2004 does not include the \namount authorized in this bill that people have been talking about. Not \nonly that, while this bill authorizes $1 billion for the Global Fund to \nFight AIDS, TB and Malaria, the President's 2004 budget includes only \n$200 million for the Global Fund, a $150 million cut from last year.\n  And not only does this bill not appropriate any money, his 2004 \nbudget would cut many other global health programs. It would cut \nfunding for child survival and maternal health by 12 percent. It would \ncut funding for programs to protect vulnerable children by 63 percent. \nIt would cut programs to combat other infectious diseases--diseases \nwhich kill millions of children each year, by 32 percent. I wonder how \nmany Senators know this.\n  So I hope that soon after the President signs this bill he will send \nus a budget amendment for the rest of the $3 billion authorized here \nthat is missing from his 2004 budget request.\n  I hope he also asks for the funds to replace the cuts his budget \nmakes in other global health programs. Because those cuts are going to \nmean fewer children will be vaccinated against measles and polio, and \nfewer pregnant women will have access to medical care. Each year, over \nhalf a million women die needlessly from pregnancy related causes. \nThere are real consequences to cutting these programs.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back time on our \nside. Before doing so, may I clarify with the Chair that the only two \nremaining amendments are to be offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York, Senator Clinton, and the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, and that these will have voice votes at the \nconclusion of the two amendments, and then we will have final passage \non a voice vote. Is that interpretation correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There were other amendments authorized, \namendments by Senators Lautenberg, Leahy, and Landrieu.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the only two \nremaining amendments be amendments of Senator Clinton and Senator \nBiden, with voice votes to follow, and a voice vote on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, I will \nwithhold my amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the comments of the chairman of the committee \nabout the discretion of the President and, certainly, going on record \nas this being important, that additional countries are to be included \nas part of this package.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter signed by the Ambassadors of all \nthese countries asking these nations be included as part of this bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 14, 2003.\n     President George Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Addressing the AIDS pandemic in the \n     Caribbean has been a major concern of the Caribbean Community \n     of countries' (CARICOM), we therefore commend your efforts to \n     address the AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean through your \n     Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. We are writing however, \n     because we believe that a more inclusive approach to \n     addressing AIDS in the region is needed, which is why we are \n     requesting that you expand your initiative to include all \n     Caribbean countries in the region.\n       As you know, the number of HIV/AIDS infection rates in the \n     Caribbean is only surpassed by that of sub-Saharan Africa. In \n     fact, prevalence rates in the Caribbean region are similar to \n     what they were in sub-Saharan Africa prior to the explosion \n     of the virus in the general population.\n       Like you, were greatly concerned about the AIDS crisis in \n     the Caribbean and realize that aid from international donors \n     such as the U.S. is necessary if we are to address the \n     crisis. The slumping tourism industry has negatively affected \n     our already weakened economies, making it difficult for our \n     countries to provide resources that will adequately address \n     the AIDS epidemic. Inadequate funding is then increasingly \n     putting us at-risk for the further spread of the epidemic to \n     the general population commensurate with current prevalence \n     rates in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       We realize that high prevalence rates can overwhelm our \n     health care capacity, destabilize our economies, and increase \n     migration flow--which could pose a real security risk for the \n     U.S. due to its proximity to he Caribbean. It is for these \n     reasons that we are interested in supporting approaches to \n     fighting the AIDS epidemic that fully take into consideration \n     our special circumstances on the Caribbean.\n       Our AIDS epidemic is driven by heterosexual contact and a \n     mobile population. For example, over 10 million persons from \n     the U.S. visit the Caribbean annually. Population movements \n     between the U.S. and the Caribbean for business purposes and \n     tourism, including large numbers of U.S. and Caribbean \n     students moving back and forth for study and leisure \n     purposes, argue strongly for an inclusive approach to \n     combating AIDS in the Caribbean.\n       As such, our own AIDS initiatives have been developed in \n     response to the high mobility of the region. For example, the \n     Pan Caribbean AIDS Partnership, administered through CARICOM \n     is a collaboration between Caribbean countries, Caribbean \n     regional institutions, and international agencies that work \n     together to fight AIDS across the region. Similarly, programs \n     implemented by your government have also taken regional \n     approaches. USAID administers AIDS initiatives in the \n     Dominican Republic, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, and through the \n     Caribbean Regional Program, which is a Caribbean wide program \n     that targets countries where USAID does not have a presence.\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\n       Because a regional approach is crucial to addressing the \n     AIDS epidemic in our highly mobile population, we are \n     requesting that you expand under your Emergency AIDS \n     Initiative to the entire Caribbean region. Expansion of the \n     program would allow for your initiative to include countries \n     such as the Bahamas, which has an adult AIDS prevalence rate \n     of 3.5 percent, and Trinidad and Tobago and the Dominican \n     Republic who are suffering with prevalence rates of 2.5 \n     percent. Additionally, countries such as Barbados and Jamaica \n     with AIDS rates approaching 2 percent could receive funding \n     for prevention efforts.\n       Without a regional approach to the Caribbean AIDS crisis, \n     we fear that AIDS will lower life expectancy, increase the \n     number of AIDS orphans, further threaten our already fragile \n     economies, increase migration flow out of the region, and \n     increase the threat to the U.S.\n       We therefore hope that you will seriously consider our \n     request to include the entire Caribbean in your Emergency \n     AIDS Relief Initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n         Lionel Hurst, Ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda. Joshua \n           Sears, Ambassador of Bahamas. Michael King, Ambassador \n           of Barbados. Lisa M. Shoman, Ambassador of Belize. \n           Denis G. Antoine, Ambassador of Grenada.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on my own behalf, \nalong with Senators Boxer, Murray, and Leahy.\n  First, I commend the leadership as well as the President for bringing \nthis important issue of global HIV/AIDS to the floor this evening, \nalthough the hour is obviously very late.\n  While I am pleased with many aspects of this bill, and the commitment \nit represents, I do believe the bill is flawed in a very important and \nfundamental respect; and that is, with regard to the treatment of and \nconcern for girls and women.\n  As many of us know who have traveled in Africa, the Caribbean, and \nother places where the HIV/AIDS pandemic has ravaged so many people, \nyoung girls, girls barely in their teens, adolescents, young women, are \nall too often the victims of this disease because of the way they are \ntreated.\n  I believe in abstinence. I went to Uganda in 1997. I was impressed, \nas many of my colleagues have been, by what I saw with respect to the \nprogram that Uganda undertook and certainly the results.\n  But I am concerned that abstinence is not a prevention tool \nrealistically available to many girls and women throughout Africa. So \nmany of the prevention tools are controlled by men, and by customs and \nby traditions, in communities where the expectation may very well be \nfor a young girl to be married at a very young age.\n  In Africa, the seroprevalence for women ages 15 to 17 is five times \nthe rate it is for boys of the same age. Now, why does that happen? \nCertainly the leaders in Africa who are now undertaking their own \ncampaigns against HIV/AIDS are well aware of the uphill climb they \nface.\n  Two years ago, Mozambique's Prime Minister, after a comprehensive \nstudy, found that there was an explanation for the higher rates among \nyoung women, and it was--and I quote him--\n\n       Not because the girls are promiscuous, but because nearly \n     three out of five are married by age 18, [and] 40 percent of \n     them [are married] to much older, sexually experienced men, \n     who may expose their wives to HIV/AIDS. Abstinence is not an \n     option for these child brides. Those who try to negotiate \n     condom use commonly face violence or rejection.\n\n  That is why I have offered this amendment to specifically address not \njust women's health but also women's empowerment, because empowering \nwomen and girls is the clearest way to give them the tools to be able \nto not only say no but to actually implement that belief.\n  It is also imperative to reduce economic and other dependence, to \ncombat gender discrimination and stigma, to recognize that the \neffective prevention strategies for women, who now represent the \nmajority of people worldwide suffering from HIV/AIDS, must be addressed \nimmediately, urgently, and with resources.\n  Research shows that the most effective policies are those that \ninclude an understanding of the relevance and impact of the roles that \nculture and society assign men, women, boys, and girls. But the bill \nthat we are considering overlooks and neglects this important aspect of \nthe problem.\n  Our amendment would correct that neglect by providing assistance for \nprograms that increase women's access to female-controlled prevention \ntechnologies, including microbiocides when they become available; and \nby providing assistance for programs that improve the health education, \nand skills-building efforts for women and girls, increasing women's \nability to protect themselves from unwanted sex, safeguarding \nthemselves when they are sexually active, and reducing the stigma faced \nby women affected by HIV and AIDS.\n\n  One of the reasons the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among younger and \nyounger girls is occurring in Africa is for two interrelated causes: \nOne, because many of these young girls are available, they are healthy; \nand, secondly, because there is this myth that very young girls will \nnot transmit HIV. And because we do not have widespread testing, many \nof the men do not even know that they are infected.\n  Thirdly, we have to recognize that gender inequality is a part of \nthis epidemic. Women who lack access to education, or any kind of \nskills training, who are exposed to gender-based violence in their home \nor their larger community, who are sexually coerced or otherwise \nvulnerable, make up many of the victims that, unfortunately, suffer \nfrom HIV/AIDS.\n  We also should be boosting women's access to pre- and postnatal care, \nand increasing resources for female-headed households caring for \norphans and victims of AIDS, as my colleague from California, Senator \nBoxer, so eloquently argued.\n  In addition, we should increase focus on other women's health \nthreats, including cervical cancer, which can be caused by high-risk \nstrains of human papilloma virus.\n  I hope we can assure we pay particular attention to young people.\n  Much of the language that is included in this amendment has already \npassed the Senate unanimously last year in S. 2525. It is not \ncontroversial, at least in this body.\n  I understand the fast track we are on, and the fact that the majority \ndoes not wish to have any amendments, but I hope that when we revisit \nthis, as we must, in the appropriations process--when we take the bill \nand rid it of the contradictions and the conflicts that it inherently \nhas in its language--that this amendment will be accepted. It will help \nto guarantee that we address these very particular problems that affect \nwomen.\n  When we are talking about women's health and looking at all of the \nproblems women have, it is important that we not focus just on HIV/AIDS \nas though that is some separate, abstract problem that can be removed \nfrom cervical cancer and sexually transmitted diseases and other \nproblems that women suffer from so grievously, not only in Africa but \nin many countries around the world.\n  I ask the positive, affirmative support of those who remain in the \nChamber on a voice vote for this amendment that specifically stands up \nfor the girls and women of Africa in this important cause we are now \nundertaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Senator from New York has made a very \neloquent and important statement, and I appreciate it. My response has \nto be the one I have made throughout the evening, and that is that it \nis different, and it will cause conference. In my judgment, there is \nmerit in what she has to say. That has been true of many amendments \nthis evening. But it is something that I must oppose. I am hopeful \nSenators will vote no on the Clinton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 652.\n  The amendment (No. 652) was rejected.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand the regular order is that my \namendment on debt relief would be in order now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 686\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the hour is extremely late. The bottom line \nof this is that this provides for debt relief\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\nfor the very countries we are trying to help with AIDS. They are \nswamped by debt. It is legislation that we have been through before. My \nstaff and I sat with the White House, the National Security Agency. We \nsat down with the White House today, the National Security Agency \nrepresentative for hours. We negotiated the exact language.\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we consider legislation today on the \nglobal epidemic of HIV/AIDS, I urge my colleagues to think about this: \nWhile the poorest nations of the world lack the resources to provide \nthe most basic public health care and the most basic education, they \nstill send money to the international financial institutions \nestablished by the wealthiest nations of the world.\n  The 26 countries currently qualified to receive debt relief under the \nheavily indebted poor country--HIPC--program continue to pay more than \n$2 billion annually on debt service.\n  That money goes to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund \nhere in Washington, as well as other lenders, to pay the interest on \nloans they have received over the years.\n  Unless we act now on this HIV/AIDS bill to reduce that debt burden, \nwe run the real risk that the resources we are providing them today \nwill find their\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\nway back, not only to Washington, but to other lenders, such as France, \nGermany, and Japan.\n  Deeper debt relief for those poor countries is essential to make the \nwork we are doing on this HIV/AIDS legislation as effective as \npossible, and to make sure that funds do not leak out through the \nmandatory spending these countries must do to service their debts every \nyear.\n  Money is money and the problem of these debt payments is very real \nfor these poor countries. As long as they face these mandatory debt \npayments, the resources we are providing in this HIV/AIDS bill will be \nless effective.\n  But deeper debt relief is also needed because the current HIPC \nProgram is not working.\n  In fact, last year the Bank and the fund honestly admitted that under \nthe current formula, many countries will simply not reach a sustainable \nlevel of debt.\n  The amendment I am offering tonight aims to make the HIPC Program \nitself more likely to succeed.\n  It is essentially the legislation Senator Santorum and I introduced \nin the last congress, with the support of Senators Frist, Nickles, \nChafee, DeWine, and Specter on the majority side, along with Senators \nKerry and Sarbanes, Feingold, Murray, and others on this side of the \naisle.\n  Specifically, for the many countries facing a public health crisis--\nsuch as the HIV/AIDS epidemic--we say that no more than 5 percent of \ntheir revenues should go to service their debt to other nations and \ninternational institutions.\n  For those who do not face such a crisis, debt service should exceed \nno more than 10 percent of their budget.\n  Some debate remains about the most appropriate way to measure a \ncountry's ability to pay its debt and still provide basic public goods \nin the areas of health, education, and infrastructure.\n  So our amendment gives the administration the flexibility to find an \nalternative measure that would achieve an equivalent level of debt \nreduction--a level that these poor countries can sustain.\n  Only countries that quality for the existing HIPC Program--that sets \nstandards of economic reform and human rights--will participate.\n  The bottom line is that unless the U.S. and our G-7 partners reduce \ndebt service payment to manageable levels--no more than 10 percent of \nGovernment revenue, 5 percent if the country has a major health \ncrisis--these nations will be unable to devote the necessary resources \nto the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n  This amendment was part of the HIV/AIDS bill that passed the Senate \nlast year. It belongs on this legislation, too.\n  Although there is some confusion about how we got there, I believe in \nretrospect the chairman, quite frankly, unknown to me, was not brought \ninto the loop on this. I assure him the reason I agreed to a voice vote \nis because we had every Democrat, and I believe from personal \ndiscussion we had at least four Republicans supporting the amendment. I \nunderstand, without getting into all the detail, the bottom line is the \namendment has been signed off on by the White House in direct \ndiscussions with my staff this afternoon. I would move the adoption of \nthe amendment.\n  I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee if he knows--and I \nsee the majority leader here and I will ask him the same question--if \nthe House of Representatives has indicated they would accept this \namendment? I have been standing shoulder to shoulder with the chairman \nof the full committee all night, voting against every amendment on the \nbasis that the House would not accept an amendment.\n  Now, the ranking member, Senator Biden, has said the White House has \nindicated they would accept this amendment and that is very powerful \nmedicine for us. I do not want to abandon my chairman and the position \nhe has taken in support of the House bill, unless I can be assured that \non this amendment, unlike all of the others, the House leadership has \nindicated they are willing to accept it.\n  I ask the ranking member and the majority leader, if either one of \nthem could respond, would the House be willing, contrary to what we \nhave been told about all the other amendments, to accept this \namendment?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will respond to what I know firsthand. I \ncan only speak firsthand to the White House. It is my understanding, \nand it has been asserted to me, that there have been discussions with \nsenior Republicans--I assume that that was shared by everybody, with \nboth the speaker and with Mr. Delay, and that they had signed on to \nthis. But I will respectfully suggest that I yield to Senator Santorum, \nwho may be able to give you a more direct answer. I personally, for the \nrecord, have not spoken with anybody in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this amendment has been agreed to by the \nWhite House and has been agreed to by the speaker and the majority \nleader. This, in the amended form, has been changed substantially from \nthe proposal that the Senator from Delaware originally put forward. It \nis now not mandating the State Department to do anything; it is \nsuggesting that they should do this.\n  So it is a flexible amendment. It expresses the sentiments of this \nbody, and it will express the sentiment of the House when they agree to \nthis amendment as well as the underlying bill. This is an issue they \nshould take seriously and give due consideration to. Both the speaker \nand the majority leader, having talked to their people in their \nrespective committee jurisdictions, are comfortable with this \nlanguage--the ``should'' language as opposed to the ``shall'' language. \nThat was the main issue. Because of its advisory nature, as opposed to \na mandatory nature, they are willing to accept it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield. In addition, I agreed with the \nWhite House to further amend my amendment to change the effective date, \nwhich was a very important element to the White House. They wanted the \noriginal language we had in Lugar-Biden that we moved off of to go to \nthe House bill, and in previous language that we had in other bills, \nincluding the original bill which came out of the committee and passed \nout of here. It had language relating to the effective date when \ncountries could qualify to meet the test for this. The White House \nwanted it tighter, wanted it more stringent.\n  We took the better part of the afternoon, 3 or 4 hours, negotiating \nback and forth. We yielded on that point as well. That is the point at \nwhich the White House spokesperson from the National Security Agency \nsaid to us, ``We have a deal.'' That is when it then got scrubbed. That \nwas even more palatable, I am told, to the speaker and the majority \nleader. That is as much as I can say firsthand.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I had stayed here \nprepared to vote against the amendment, to vote against all amendments, \nnot knowing that the Senator from Delaware had these conversations with \npeople at the White House and the Senator from Pennsylvania had these \nconversations with the leadership of the House. Therefore, I feel \nreleased from my previous commitment to oppose all amendments when I \ndiscover that passage of this amendment will not only not impede \npassage of the bill--as was the case with the other amendments--it \nwould in fact enhance passage of the bill on the basis that both the \nHouse and the White House were willing.\n  So I appreciate knowing this new information. On the basis of this \ninformation, it will cause me to change my position. I thank the \nSenator for sharing this information with me.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have been listening to all of this \ninformation. Let me simply say that, throughout the evening, I have \nasked Senators to vote against amendments. That was based upon the \nfeelings of our colleagues in the House of Representatives, who passed \nthe bill--namely, my friends Henry Hyde, Tom Lantos, and likewise in \nthe course of this debate, I have mentioned conversations with the \nPresident himself, who wanted this bill unamended so there would not be \na need for a conference and for difficulty. I have not been apprised by \nanybody at the White House, or in the House leadership, of any other \nsituation.\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\n  I am perfectly willing to accept, on good faith, the assertions of my \ncolleagues who have had these conversations. But for the sake of the \nRecord, when the voice vote comes, I will vote no because I have asked \nmy colleagues to vote no on each amendment. I will continue in that \nframe of mind.\n  But I have listened carefully and I understand what, apparently, have \nbeen conversations and agreements and I appreciate that.\n  I know of no reason to extend the debate, unless the majority leader \nhas something.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 686) was agreed to.\n\n\n                microbicides: hiv prevention's new hope\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today we are considering landmark \nlegislation to provide $15 billion to expand prevention, treatment, and \ncare in the developing world to address the AIDS epidemic and other \ninfectious diseases.\n  We know that the heart of the global HIV epidemic is in Africa. We \nalso know that the center of the epidemic in Africa is among women. \nBiologically, women are four times more vulnerable to HIV infection \nthen men. And tragically, in Africa, and indeed throughout the \ndeveloping world, it is widely understood that a woman's single \ngreatest risk factor for contracting HIV is being married and \nmonogamous.\n  This astounding and tragic fact bears repeating: The typical woman \nwho gets infected with HIV has only one partner--her husband. Women's \nvulnerability increases due to their lack of economic and social power \nin many societies, where they often cannot control sexual encounters or \ninsist on protective measures such as abstinence or mutual monogamy. \nThis trend devastates families and puts children at risk.\n  If we pass legislation today that ignores this stark reality, we will \nbe back here a few years from now, scratching our heads and wondering \nwhat we can do to stem the tide of infections. If we want to contain \nthe epidemic, we have to help women.\n  Women need HIV-prevention tools that they can control to safeguard \ntheir health and that of their families and communities. One of the \nmost promising prevention tools is microbicides. Once developed, \nmicrobicides and vaccines would serve as complimentary prevention \ntechnologies, with microbicides giving women the power of prevention.\n  It is important to emphasize that microbicides are being designed \nfirst and foremost to protect against infections, not necessarily \nagainst pregnancy. This issue has nothing to do with birth control. It \nhas nothing to do with spermicide Nonoxynol-9, which prevents \npregnancy, but not disease. Microbocides are about preventing HIV. \nScientists are hopeful that they can develop microbicides that would \nallow women to protect themselves from this and other sexually \ntransmitted diseases--while also enabling them to conceive a child.\n  While the bill we are considering today acknowledges microbicides as \na promising prevention tool, it does not go nearly far enough in \nsupporting this area of research and development. I introduced \nlegislation last Congress and again this session to give greater \nFederal support to microbicides research and development.\n\n  While microbicides are not a magic bullet, once available, many \nresearchers believe that could prevent millions of infections. And with \nleading scientists concluding that a vaccine is likely to be more than \n10 years away, we need to make a strong commitment to developing \ncomplementary prevention tools such as microbicides. Even when we get a \nvaccine or vaccines to tackler this epidemic, complementary prevention \nstrategies such as microbicides will be needed for decades to come.\n  Let me take a minute to review the state of the science in this \nfield. Scientists are currently testing approximately 65 different \nmicrobicide compounds to determine whether they will help to protect \nagainst HIV and/or other STDs. Of these, I7 are in clinical trials that \nwill assess their safety for human use, and 4 are being readied for \nlarge trials that will assess their effectiveness. If one of these \nleads proves successful and investment is sufficient, a microbicide \ncould be publicly available in 5 to 7 years.\n  The cost of developing the existing pipeline of microbicide candidate \nproducts has been estimated at $775 million over 5 years. Currently, \nhowever, U.S. Federal funding for microbicides is only about $75 \nmillion annually. Microbicides are a public health good for which the \nsocial benefits are high but economic incentives to private investment \nare low. Despite the potential market size, neither pharmaceutical nor \nmajor biotech companies have made large investments in the field \nbecause many of the benefits of microbicides are public benefits for \nwhich manufacturers will not be directly compensated. Like other public \nhealth goods, such as vaccines, public funding must fill the gap left \nby market failure.\n  The National Institutes of Health, principally through the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, spends the \nmajority of Federal dollars in this area. However, microbicide research \nat NIH is currently conducted with no single line of administrative \naccountability or specific funding coordination. What is needed is for \nthe Director of NIAID to establish a branch dedicated explicitly to \nmicrobicide research and development, and to provide this new branch \nwith appropriate staff and funding.\n  In addition, other Federal agencies such as CDC and USAID undertake \nmicrobicides research and development activities. Because there is no \nFederal coordination, however, there is a risk of inefficiencies and \nduplication of effort. Through a variety of committees, Congress has \nrequested that NIH and its Office of AIDS Research provide Congress \nwith a ``Federal coordination plan'' for research and development in \nthis area, but formal submission of this plan has been repeatedly \ndelayed.\n  Will the Senate majority leader join me in urging NIH to consider \nestablishing a branch dedicated explicitly to microbicide research and \ndevelopment, and to provide this new branch with appropriate staff and \nfunding?\n  Mr. FRIST. I agree with the Senator from New Jersey about the \ncritical importance of research on microbicides, and I commend him for \nhis leadership on this important issue. I applaud his efforts to better \ncoordinate research conducted at USAID, CDC, and NIH, and to increase \nFederal funding. I urge the leadership at NIH to five his proposal \nprompt and careful consideration.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the distinguished majority leader for his \ncomments and for his support of this important initiative.\n\n\n  ASSISTANCE FOR ORPHANS AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN AFFECTED BY HIV/AIDS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, to date, approximately 14 million \nchildren have lost their parents to the AIDS virus. In many cases, this \ndevastating disease has robbed them of their parents, their aunts, \nuncles, cousins, brothers and sisters. At a time when they are most in \nneed of the care of loving adults, millions of children are left \nwithout anyone to call their own. Some of them are sick themselves, \ninfected often at birth. If we are serious about $1.5 billion for \nprograms aimed at assisting children orphaned by AIDS, then we must do \nall that we can to ensure that these programs reflect their many needs.\n  I would suggest that the language in the underlying bill is remiss in \nthat it does not address perhaps their most urgent need, the need for a \npermanent, loving home. I would like to commend the majority leader and \nthe committee chairman for their foresight in insisting that 10 percent \nof the funds allocated in the bill be used to serve the educational, \ndevelopment and health needs of these young people. Yet, if these \nprograms are not also focused on connecting children to at least one, \ncaring adult, these programs will undoubtedly fall short of their \npotential. Every child needs a home. A child whose family has been \ndevastated by disease is no exception. As a member of the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations subcommittee, I hope that we could address \nthis issue at some point. Again, I thank the majority leader for his \nleadership and look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. I commend the Senator from Louisiana for \nher leadership in the area of adoption. She is right to suggest that we \nfocus these programs on an orphan child's\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nneed to find a permanent, loving home. I would be happy to work with \nher toward this end.\n\n\n                       eligibility for assistance\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I see the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Frist, and wonder if I could ask him to address a \nconcern I and other Senators have about a provision entitled \n``Eligibility for Assistance'' which is located on page 61, line 18 of \nthe bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. This provision says that an organization that is \notherwise eligible to receive assistance authorized by this Act to \nprevent, treat, or monitor HIV/AIDS, shall not be required, as a \ncondition of receiving that assistance, to endorse or utilize a \nmultisectoral approach to combating HIV/AIDS, or to endorse, utilize, \nor participate in a prevention method or treatment program to which the \norganization has a religious or moral objection.\n  Again, I support this provision, because there are faith-based groups \nthat are playing a crucial role in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment \nwhich do not, for example want to distribute condoms. I understand \nthat. There are other ways that they can be effective, through \ncounseling, treatment, care and other services. They should not have to \ndistribute condoms if they have a religious or moral objection.\n  But there is a problem, which this provision fails to explicitly \naddress. Some of these same groups that object to distributing condoms, \nhave actively sought to discourage people from using condoms. They have \ntold people who have come to them for advice and counseling that \ncondoms are bad, that they should not use them, and, erroneously, that \ncondoms usually fail.\n  This is wrong. It is wrong from a medical point of view and it is \nwrong from an ethical point of view, because the consequence of \nproviding this type of inaccurate or misleading information can quite \npossibly be death. Yet this provision does not address this very real, \nand very serious, problem. I would ask the majority leader how we can \nbe sure that when these organizations, receive Federal funds, any \ninformation they provide about approaches to HIV/AIDS prevention is \ncomplete and medically accurate, including both the public health \nbenefits and failure rates of the approach involved.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his question. This \nis an important issue. I fully agree that it is essential that \ninformation about approaches to HIV/AIDS prevention be medically \naccurate, including both the public health benefits and failure rates \nof the approach involved. That is what is intended by this provision. \nIn fact, the provision uses the words ``an organization that is \notherwise eligible to receive assistance''. I believe that ``otherwise \neligible'' should be interpreted to require explicit assurances by such \norganization that when it provides information about HIV/AIDS \nprevention approaches it will meet this standard of accuracy.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the majority leader. I agree that these \nassurances are needed and that they should be routinely spelled out in \nany contract or grant agreement between the U.S. Government and such \norganization in order to clarify the intent of this provision.\n\n\n                    Global Epidemic of Tuberculosis\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to highlight one critical area of \nthis important legislation, and that is the global epidemic of \ntuberculosis. While I appreciate the language on TB that was included \nin this bill at my request, I am disappointed that there is not a \nspecific earmark for TB programs.\n  The Kerry-Frist bill that passed the Senate last year included \nspecific increases for funding for international tuberculosis programs. \nThat bill authorized $150 million bilaterally for international \ntuberculosis in fiscal 2003 and $200 million for 2004.\n  It is critically important that funding for tuberculosis remain a \npriority. There is a particular need to highlight the need for expanded \ntuberculosis funds given that the President's 2004 budget request calls \nfor a reduction in funding to combat TB. We must not only protect but \nsignificantly expand funds for programs that combat tuberculosis. Here \nis why:\n  TB is an immense global killer. Nine million people become sick with \nactive TB every year and 2 million people are killed by the disease. \nTuberculosis is medically linked with the global AIDS pandemic. TB is \nthe leading killer worldwide of people with HIV, because those who \ncontract HIV suffer from weakened immune systems and they develop \nactive TB. TB rates have increased five-fold in some African nations in \nconjunction with AIDS.\n  But there is hope. Basic TB treatment is incredibly effective and can \ncure over 90 percent of cases even in resource-poor settings, even in \npeople with HIV/AIDS. This treatment, called DOTS, which stands for \nDirectly Observed Therapy Short-course, uses drugs that cost just $10, \nfor a full 6 months of treatment. Few health interventions are so \neffective and affordable.\n  There is even a mechanism for getting high-quality drugs to poor \ncountries, called the Global TB Drug Facility. The TB Drug Facility is \na critical part of the global effort to combat TB. The TB Drug Facility \nneeds just $50 million per year in order to reach its goals of averting \n25 million TB deaths by 2020, but the U.S. has only contributed a \nlittle over $3 million to the Drug Facility so far. The U.S. must \ncontribute more to this important mechanism.\n  And, the U.S. must do more to help expand access to DOTS treatment \nfor those who are sick with TB. Currently, fewer than one in three \npeople who need basic TB treatment have access to it. And only a \nfraction of those with drug-resistant TB are receiving needed \ntreatment. The need is clear. We must do everything we can to ensure \nthat access to treatment for tuberculosis is expanded, before drug-\nresistance and TB's interaction with HIV make this into an unstoppable \nepidemic.\n  I want to thank my friend from Oregon, Senator Smith, who has been so \nhelpful in working with me over the past several years to make sure \nthat international TB programs remain a priority.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it has been my great pleasure to work with \nmy colleague, Senator Boxer, over the past years to put global \ntuberculosis control on the map as an important priority for U.S. \nfunding.\n  I share the Senator's concern that the United States continue to \nprotect and expand the funds we allocate to this important cause.\n  We must indeed not lose our focus on combating global TB even as we \nrespond efficiently and effectively to SARS. We must remember that \nfailing to protect and expand funds to combating TB means needless \ndeath for 2 million people in the developing world each year--people \nwho are teachers, doctors, civil servants, and people who are parents \nto young children who need their protection, financial support, and \nguidance. We must remember that the problem of tuberculosis is \ninextricably linked together with the growing problem of global HIV. TB \nis the biggest killer of those with HIV, and TB also accelerates the \ncourse of AIDS. Treating TB can save lives and slow the progression of \nAIDS.\n  We also must remember that treating tuberculosis works. We know what \nto do and that we have some of the key elements in place to \nsuccessfully control this disease. As Senator Boxer mentioned, we have \nthe Global TB Drug Facility in place. And we have a Global Plan to Stop \nTB. And the new Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria is adding to \nthe bilateral efforts of the U.S. and other nations.\n  So we must use these mechanisms and use our window of opportunity to \nexpand access to TB treatment before it is too late, before drug-\nresistant TB and HIV/AIDS turn TB into a disease that is nearly \nuntreatable and an epidemic that is at best very difficult to deal with \nand at worst perhaps uncontrollable.\n  Does the majority leader agree that global tuberculosis control ought \nto receive adequate increased funds from the U.S. in the next fiscal \nyear?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the points raised by Senator \nBoxer and Senator Smith and will work with them to ensure that adequate \nfunding is provided for U.S. bilateral TB programs.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this is an historic day. I am very pleased \nthat the Senate is moving forward with this AIDS relief bill--a bill \nthat represents an unprecedented commitment to\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\nfighting the global scourge of HIV and AIDS. It is a good bill. It is a \nbill that has both bicameral and bipartisan support. It is a place to \nstart--a beginning, not an end.\n  I would like to take just a moment to thank my colleagues both in the \nSenate and in the House who have been working tirelessly in this fight \nagainst AIDS. They have spent countless hours crafting a bill that is \ngoing to make a difference--a bill that is going to help save and \nprolong the lives of millions worldwide. I especially commend Majority \nLeader Frist for his leadership and vision and Senators Lugar, Durbin, \nSantorum, Biden, and Kerry for their dedication to this fight, as well \nas Representatives Hyde and Lantos for crafting a bill in the House \nthat recently passed by an overwhelming vote of 375 to 41.\n  I thank them all for their efforts, for their compassion, and for \ntheir commitment.\n  I also applaud the President and Secretary of State Powell for their \ndedication to easing the worldwide suffering caused by the HIV/AIDS \npandemic. They understand that we, as a nation, have an obligation to \nfight this disease. We have the ability to fight it. We have the tools. \nAnd, it is our duty--as a leader in the world--to move forward now and \ndo the right thing.\n  To be sure, there are a number of issues--very important public \npolicy issues--and differences that still need to be resolved as we \nmove ahead. However, while those issues are important, we must not lose \nsight of the urgent need to do something about AIDS now. This HIV/AIDS \nrelief package is a public health initiative of a magnitude never \nbefore undertaken in this country.\n  It is an enormous task that will require a coordinated effort among \nthe State Department, Department of Health and Human Services, and \nUSAID and multiple NGOs and faith-based organizations. Because of that, \nwe need to start putting the infrastructure in place--today.\n  We need to start coordinating efforts--today.\n  We need to get the programming started--today.\n  We need to do all of these things so we can be ready to go when the \nmoney gets appropriated--so that on ``Day One'' when the money is \navailable in the field, people in these impoverished nations who \ndesperately need anti-retroviral treatment drugs can start receiving \nthem and prolong their lives--so that pregnant, HIV-infected mothers \ncan get the drugs they need so they don't transfer the disease to their \nchildren.\n  Ultimately, Mr. President, this bill represents a starting point. \nEach one of us who has studied the HIV/AIDS issue would have changes to \nthe bill if we were writing it just ourselves, and frankly, no one \nknows the future and can see exactly the landscape of the new ground we \nare plowing here. So really, none of us here can be sure that the \nprecise approach we have taken or the precise figures and precise \npercentage allocation of dollar amounts for certain things is correct. \nBut, we have to start somewhere. The most important thing is that we \nstart--and this is the start. This is the beginning. It is a major \nfirst step.\n  This bill is different than anything we have done in the past. It is \na holistic approach to fighting global AIDS. It will have to be \nfollowed with appropriations money, and we will need to come back year \nafter year to get that funding, but this bill gives us a place to \nstart. It takes a balanced, comprehensive approach to combat the \nscourge of HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.\n  It will focus funds on education and prevention and treatment--\ntreatment in terms of mother-to-child transmission, treatment of \nmothers who already have children, and treatment of all infected adults \nand children who have AIDS. This type of comprehensive approach, Mr. \nPresident, can and will make a difference.\n  As I said, Mr. President, I believe this is a good bill--a good \nstarting place--a major first step. Underscoring all of the major \nprovisions of this bill is the moral imperative to fight this horrible, \ntragic disease. Over the last few months and years, we have heard \ncountless statistics about the devastation AIDS is causing. Those \nstatistics are troubling. They are disturbing. But, until there is a \nface and a name attached, those suffering from the disease remain \nstatistics. I would like to take a few minutes to talk to my colleagues \nabout the faces I have seen--the faces of children and babies with \nAIDS.\n  In February, my wife Fran and I traveled to Haiti--our 12th trip--and \nwe saw once again what this disease is doing to this nation and its \npeople.\n  In Haiti today, a nation of approximately 8 million people--300,000 \ncurrently live with AIDS. We have seen the devastation this is causing. \nWe have held dying babies in our arms--babies who could have been \nsaved--babies who could live and grow up if they only could get the \ntreatment drugs they need to stay alive.\n  We traveled to Guyana in February, as well, and saw the same \ndevastation--too many children and adults dying of this horrible \ndisease and too few drugs to go around to help treat them and keep them \nalive. Right now in Guyana--a nation of roughly 800,000 people, 35,000 \nhave been identified as HIV-positive or as having AIDS. Of those 35,000 \npeople, only 200--less than one percent--are getting anti-retroviral \ndrug treatment. And, of the many children in Guyana with AIDS, only one \nof those children--only one--is receiving anti-retroviral drugs!\n  In Haiti, we visited an orphanage that has an entire floor just for \nAIDS babies. What you see is truly tragic--row after row of steel cribs \nwith babies at various stages of the disease--none of whom are \nreceiving any sort of anti-retroviral drug treatment.\n  I remember seeing a little boy--he was about four or five years old--\nnamed Francois. He had AIDS and was very close to death. He was laid \nout on a makeshift bed on the cold, concrete floor. He had an I.V. \nattached to him, and he was getting some fluids. The wonderful people \nwho were caring for him explained that little Francois was no longer \nable to keep any food down. He was within days of death. There were no \ndrugs available to treat him. So, the people caring for him were loving \nhim, nurturing him, and were doing what they could to make him as \ncomfortable as possible in the little time he had remaining.\n  I will never forget that child--I will never forget little Francois. \nI will never forget him for the rest of my life.\n  Another little boy who I will never forget appeared the opposite of \nlittle Francois. This little boy was about 7 years old, and also has \nAIDS, but he seemed to be very healthy. He was lively and content and \nthriving. But, that won't last.\n  Very likely, unless something changes--unless he gets the treatment \ndrugs that he'll eventually need--this 7 year-old boy, whom I cannot \nget out of my mind, will also eventually die.\n  His death will be a needless one. It will be needless because these \ndrugs are available. It is just that the folks caring for this little \nboy do not have access to them. Money is not available. The drugs are \nnot available. That is an injustice. It is wrong. And, it is a great \nhuman tragedy.\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, by again thanking my colleagues for \ntheir efforts in getting this bill passed. We are telling the world \nthat the United States cares and that we will lead the fight against \nthis dreaded disease. We can make a difference, Mr. President--and we \nwill make a difference. There is hope. This bill gives us more hope.\n  We are moving ahead. We are moving in the right direction. We are \nfinally doing the right thing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senate passage of this bill authorizing \nthe expenditure of $15 billion over 5 years to combat HIV/AIDS sends an \nimportant message: that the United States is committed not only to \nmaking this a safer world, by ending threats posed by terrorists and \nrogue states, but also a better, more humane world, by helping people \nin need in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere cope with the ravages of the \nHIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  The spread of HIV/AIDS, and the efforts of the international \ncommunity to combat it, will be remembered by history as one of the \ndefining issues of our time. Until recently, we have been losing the \nbattle: the disease has infected 68 million people to date. It has \nalready brought disaster to Africa, where AIDS has taken over 20 \nmillion lives and has surpassed malaria as the leading cause of death. \nUNAIDS estimates that by 2020, an additional 55\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\nmillion Africans will lose their lives to the disease. There are \ncurrently 11 million AIDS orphans in Africa. Average life expectancy in \nSub-Saharan Africa is currently estimated at 47 years, but it would be \n62 years in the absence of AIDS.\n  These numbers are staggering. The ethical implications of not doing \neverything in our power to slow the spread of this disease are severe. \nThe most basic morality requires that we commit ourselves to combating \nHIV/AIDS everywhere. The social and political implications of allowing \nthis disease to claim its grim toll are grave: countries cannot survive \nthe death of a quarter or more of their populations without severe \nunrest, impoverishment, even radicalization and revolution. In Africa, \nmore women are infected with HIV/AIDS than men; their central role in \nfamily life means their deaths have disproportionate effect. Millions \nof children cannot lose their parents without lasting damage to \nthemselves and their societies. In many countries, the army has higher \ninfection rates than the general population. Mass death among uniformed \npersonnel will have profound implications for political stability and \nnational security in these countries, as armies literally become unable \nto fulfill their basic duties.\n  As the CIA assessed in 2000 for the 20-year period through 2020,\n\n       At least some of the hardest-hit countries, initially in \n     sub-Saharan Africa and later in other regions, will face a \n     demographic catastrophe as HIV/AIDS and associated diseases \n     reduce human life expectancy dramatically and kill up to a \n     quarter of their populations over the period of this \n     estimate. This will further impoverish the poor, and often \n     the middle class, and produce a huge and impoverished orphan \n     cohort unable to cope and vulnerable to exploitation and \n     radicalization.\n\n  As the World Bank and others have reported, AIDS affects the most \neconomically vibrant group within society, the working-age men and \nwomen who account for most national output. With one quarter of a \ncountry's population facing impending death, labor markets would be \nravaged, the benefits of education lost, and health-care spending \nrationed on what should be a society's most fit citizens. Resources \nthat would have been used for productive investments would instead be \napportioned for health care, orphan care, and funerals. Decades of \ngains in social welfare could be rolled back. National productivity and \neconomic growth would be set back for generations.\n  HIV/AIDS is decimating Africa, but its next frontier lies in Eurasia. \nMore than 7 million people in China, Russia, and India carry the \ndisease, but as we have seen in Africa, an infection rate of that \nmagnitude can jump into the tens of millions within a decade. As \nNicholas Eberstadt has written, ``The coming Eurasian pandemic \nthreatens to derail the economic prospects of billions and alter the \nglobal military balance.'' Africa's plight alone is reason enough to \npass this bill. Given the economic size and military stature of India, \nChina, and Russia, the world will simply not be able to ignore the \nconsequences of the coming AIDS crisis in Eurasia.\n  Given the scale of human disaster and socio-political turmoil we \nconfront from HIV/AIDS, enactment of the bill before us represents a \ncritical step in the direction of leading the world in a common \nresponse to a crisis that affects us all. This bill nearly triples the \nU.S. commitment for international AIDS assistance. It targets most \nassistance at the 14 most afflicted countries in Africa and the \nCaribbean, but can incorporate other afflicted countries if necessary. \nIt demonstrates the United States' commitment to leading a global \ncampaign against a disease that has already killed 25 million people.\n  As Uganda in particular has shown, AIDS can be managed and contained. \nOften the biggest challenges are political will, which has been sorely \nlacking in much of Africa, and government competence to effectively \ndiagnose and treat victims, backed by a decent health care \ninfrastructure. Afflicted nations with whom we partner to fight this \ndisease must know that we expect a level of governance, transparency, \nand effectiveness from them in order to make the fullest use of AIDS \nassistance.\n  The scale of the AIDS crisis, and the consequences of inaction in the \nface of a pandemic that threatens the global order, call for the type \nof bold leadership reflected in this bill. Our commitment must be \nsustained, and we must enjoy the partnership of other wealthy nations \nin this effort. We cannot afford to fail.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1298, the \nUnited States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \nAct of 2003. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill \nwithout amendment.\n  Why am I speaking on this subject? Why I am so committed to the swift \npassage of this bipartisan global AIDS bill? No one in my family and \nnone of my close friends has AIDS. Nor have I traveled to Africa to \ncare for people suffering from AIDS, as has our distinguished majority \nleader, Dr. Frist.\n  Well, I am speaking on this subject for one reason and one reason \nonly: I believe that passing this bill as soon as possible is the right \nthing to do. We have a responsibility to fulfill--and an opportunity we \ncannot squander.\n  Millions of people are dying needlessly. We have the ability to make \nan investment that will save millions of lives and give hope and \nsecurity to millions more. Doing nothing is not an option.\n  We live in a highly interconnected world. Today more than ever, \ncreating a more peaceful and secure environment for the people of one \nregion translates into more peace and security for people around the \nglobe. By increasing our commitment to fight AIDS in Africa and the \nCaribbean, we also will be helping our nation and the rest of the \ninternational community. The world awaits our response.\n  As the cries for help from Africa increase, and the world watches to \nsee what we will do, President Bush has challenged the Congress to \nprovide the assistance that would begin to rid the world of this deadly \nmenace.\n  If we pass this bill, we will provide the people of Africa with hope \nfor a better and more secure future. If we do not, history will not \nsoon forgive--or forget--that a nation blessed with all the resources \nwe have at our disposal failed to act when we heard the cries of the \npeople of Africa.\n  Let me remind my colleagues what the President has challenged us to \ndo. He asked us to send him a bill that would prevent 7 million new \ninfections--or 60 percent of the projected new infections in the target \ncountries. He asked for a bill that would treat 2 million HIV-infected \npeople in the target countries--as opposed to fewer than 100,000 \ntoday--using the latest advances in drug therapy. He also asked for a \nbill that would provide care and comfort for 10 million HIV-infected \npeople and AIDS orphans.\n  The bill before us today would do all of these things. It represents \nthe first global effort to provide advanced anti-retroviral treatment \non such a large scale in the poorest and most afflicted countries. This \nbill also would make the successful Ugandan model of prevention--in \nother words, putting abstinence first--the basis of our global \nprevention strategy.\n  The bill would require accountability and transparency from both the \nGlobal Fund and our bilateral efforts. The recent GAO report on the \nGlobal fund raises some legitimate concerns about how this 16-month-old \norganization manages its contributions and monitors its projects. The \nbill before us would mandate careful scrutiny of and accounting for how \nthe Global Fund spends the contributions it receives.\n  In short, this bill both reflects American values and recognizes that \nwe need the active involvement of all countries in the struggle against \nAIDS. It also reflects a bipartisan compromise. This bill passed the \nHouse 375 to 41, with only 1 Democrat in opposition.\n  Now I realize that no one is completely satisfied with this bill. I \nhave colleagues on both sides of the aisle who might prefer to change \none section or another to make it a better bill. However, we cannot \nafford to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n  We don't have time to let the legislative process drag on while \npeople around the world are dying--waiting for us to act. Time is not \non our side--or theirs!\n  I know many of my colleagues strongly support the Global Fund. \nPresident Bush supports the Global Fund too. In fact, his Secretary of\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\nHealth and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, is the fund's new chairman.\n  The President has pledged to continue our commitment to the Global \nFund even as he proposes expanding and targeting our bilateral country-\nto-country initiatives to fight AIDS. By providing both bilateral and \nmultilateral funding, this bill doesn't pin all of our hopes--or our \ntaxpayers' money--on any one approach to addressing this crisis.\n\n  If you support the Global Fund, you know that the Senate's delay \nwould mean a missed opportunity to increase the international \ncommitment to fighting AIDS globally.\n  The United States is the single largest donor to the Global Fund. As \nof April 1, the United States had pledged nearly half of the $3.37 \nbillion in total pledges to the Global Fund. We have already \nappropriated $650 million to the Global Fund, and we have pledged an \nadditional $1 billion over the next 5 years.\n  We are already doing more than our fair share for the Global Fund. \nWhat we need to do now is to encourage the rest of the international \ncommunity to step up to the plate.\n  President Bush is traveling to France next month for the G-8 Summit. \nThis summit is a meeting of the political leaders of the world's \nlargest economies. When would there be a better time to encourage other \ncountries to increase their own contributions to the Global Fund?\n  If you are concerned with the future viability of the Global Fund, \nyou also should be concerned about passing this bill now. Our swift \naction will demonstrate our commitment to seeing this battle through. \nIt will also give the President a great tool with which to leverage \nadditional funding from other nations.\n  On the other hand, amending this bill will result in a lengthy \nconference with the House. If we don't get this bill to the President \nuntil the summer, we will miss a golden opportunity to encourage more \nfinancial support for the Global Fund from the G-8 members. If we don't \nfinish action on this bill until the fall, then the State Department \nwill have lost the time it will need to get ready for the coming year's \nappropriations for our expanded bilateral AIDS initiatives.\n  Clearly, these are not artificial timelines. Even less artificial are \nthe timelines that AIDS places on a person's life and a family's \nfuture.\n  In the 3 months since President Bush announced his emergency plan, \nnearly 800,000 people have died from AIDS. In those 3 months, 1.2 \nmillion people have been infected with HIV, and more than 175,000 \nbabies have been born with the virus. Every day we spend debating this \nbill on the Senate floor or in a conference with the House means more \nlives lost--lives that could have been saved had we acted sooner.\n  Our Founding Fathers were never more inspirational than when they \nwrote that our Creator has endowed us with certain unalienable rights--\nand among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n  Swift passage of this bill will again show the world that these \naren't just words on a piece of paper. Swift passage will again show \nthat these words apply to every citizen of every country--not just our \nown.\n  In Africa and the Caribbean, the scourge of AIDS is robbing people of \ntheir natural rights. We know the thief is a virus. We also know how we \ncan stop this thief from stealing the lives of people--from stealing \nfathers and mothers from their children. But with this knowledge comes \nan obligation to use it.\n  For so long we could only treat the symptoms of AIDS and provide \ncomfort to the dying. Today, we have the ability to fight back against \nHIV itself. Today we have medicines that can effectively halt the \nevolution of HIV and help people live a normal life. In other words, we \nhave the technology and the know-how to stop AIDS from killing people, \ndestroying families, and destabilizing societies.\n  By sending this legislation to the President, we will save the lives \nof millions of people and liberate them from the tyranny of AIDS. And \nwe will demonstrate, once again, that we are a principled nation that \nleads through actions, not words.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this bipartisan bill and send it \nwithout amendment to the President.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the pending \nlegislation.\n  I think it is important for the Senate to endorse the work of the \nHouse on the issue of international AIDS funding.\n  As with many of our colleagues, I was absolutely thrilled to hear \nPresident Bush use the State of the Union Address as an occasion to \ndisplay his leadership on the critical issue of the pandemics of HIV, \ntuberculosis, and malaria in Africa, the Caribbean, and the developing \nworld.\n  We must give President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and Secretaries \nPowell and Thompson a lot of credit for urging the Congress and \nAmerican public to give a higher priority and more resources to these \ndeadly, intertwined epidemics. An estimated 30 million of our African \nneighbors are infected with HIV. About 11,000 Africans become infected \neach day.\n  Tragically, of the 25 million who have died due to HIV infection \nworldwide, about 20 million, or 80 percent, were Africans. \nUnfortunately, it is likely that many more millions will follow them to \nan early death unless significant efforts are made to turn the tide of \nthese epidemics. For example, about 40 percent of the citizens of \nBotswana are infected with HIV and the infection rate in many other \ncountries is in the 1-in-5 and 1-in-4 range.\n  The Bush administration deserves a lot of credit for making this \nissue a priority at a time when the Federal budget is once again facing \nsevere strains.\n  If our Nation takes a leadership role in helping nations in the \ndeveloping world address the problems associated with infectious \ndiseases such as HIV, TB, and malaria, these nations will remember us \nas an ally who helped them when they most needed aid.\n  Let me be frank. There are many citizens in the developing world who \nsometimes question the motives of the United States in international \naffairs. We saw this dynamic at play in the debates leading up to and \nin the aftermath of the recent war in Iraq.\n  It seems to me that in undertaking this important public health \ninitiative at this time when we are once again struggling to regain \ncontrol of the Federal budget--there can be no question that the motive \nof our country is nothing more than to try to help millions of people \nfrom perishing from a group of deadly infectious diseases that threaten \nto destabilize sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean for decades to \ncome. If such longtime NATO allies such as France and Germany do not \nsee eye to eye with us on certain aspects of Mideast policy, perhaps \nthey and the rest of the developed world can agree with us that now is \nthe time to roll up our sleeves and make the commitment of necessary \nresources to help those developing nations fight the interconnected \nscourge of HIV, TB, and malaria.\n  This is exactly the type of challenge that President Bush will issue \nat the upcoming G-8 meeting. I hope and trust that the leaders of these \ncountries will work together with us on reversing the course of these \nepidemics.\n  I have been active in developing legislation related to AIDS since \nthe onset of the epidemic. In my former capacity as a member--and \nchairman--of the Senate Labor Committee, I was a coauthor of the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act, the Terry Beirn AIDS Research Act, and worked to \nincrease appropriations for research and services related to AIDS.\n  I am a conservative. I share the concerns many have expressed that \nthis bill could fund activities with which we disagree. To be clear, I \nvery much disapprove of many of the behaviors by which HIV is \ntransmitted.\n  That being said, early on in this epidemic, I learned the wisdom of \nthe old adage, ``Hate the sin, but love the sinner.''\n  High-risk behaviors--for example, intravenous drug abuse--are hard to \nbreak. But, as a society, can we use behaviors with which many of us \nvigorously disagree as an excuse to abandon our responsibility to help \nindividuals who are trying to kick their dependency on drugs? I think \nnot.\n  It is important to employ proven public health strategies to prevent \nthe spread of HIV, even if some of these techniques and educational \nmessages can be viewed as controversial if taken\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\nout of context of a public health crisis. We must also recognize \ngeographic differences in what strategies are most proven and \nacceptable. Appropriate public health education prevention and \neducation tactics are often different in Salt Lake City and New York \nCity, or for that matter, Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n  There was a spirited debate in the House over the proper balance \nbetween abstinence and other risk reduction techniques such as the role \nof condoms. I don't want to replay the whole debate over the rule that \n33 percent of prevention funds must be devoted to reenforcing an \nabstinence message. I believe in abstinence. I also am mindful of the \nfact that in some geographic regions such an inflexible rule may not \nrepresent an optimum use of prevention dollars.\n  There are elements of the House bill that I do not like. But I must \nsalute the efforts of Chairman Hyde and Representative Lantos for \nworking so long and hard to find a consensus and get this legislation \nout of the House.\n  Let me just add that I have heard the frequent--and not unjustified \ncomplaints to my mind--of the House leaders who observe that they are \noften faced with the prospect of passing what they consider watered \ndown Senate versions of legislation after the House has taken action. \nIt is well known that the House majority leadership views the tax \nlegislation we just adopted earlier this evening to be a prime example \nof this dynamic.\n  When all is said and done, the Constitution set forth a bicameral \nlegislative body with different membership criteria and different \nelection cycles. It is not surprising that it is often the case that \nthe House and Senate come up with different legislative provisions. In \nthe normal case, these differences can be ironed out by the vehicle of \na conference committee.\n  However, sometimes the regular order of the conference report is in \ntension with outside events. The case of the upcoming G-8 meeting is \njust one of those circumstances. As my friend Chairman Hyde wrote in an \nop-ed piece earlier this week, the development of a Senate version of \nthe bill--normally a positive--may have a material adverse effect of \nthe very type of international cooperation that the bill seeks to \nkindle and redouble.\n  As Congressman Hyde noted, ``A new bill only delays the pressure on \nHouse and Senate appropriators to pony up the $15 billion requested by \nthe President over the next five years. . . .\n  `` . . . for the President in his meeting with G-8 leaders in June, a \nnew bill only delays an opportunity he will have at this meeting to use \nenactment of this legislation to leverage support for worldwide AIDS \nefforts from our wealthy partners.''\n  We need to take this view into account. I say this as one for whom \nthe version of the bill developed and introduced by Senators Lugar, \nKerry, and Biden is more attractive than what emerged from the House. \nAll in the Senate should commend Senators Lugar, Kerry, Biden, and \nFrist for their longstanding leadership in this area. From a purely \npublic health standpoint, I think their legislation has a number of \nadvantages over the House bill that we are taking up on the floor \ntoday.\n  I also have the utmost respect and praise for what the House \naccomplished by passing a bill that resolved a number of very difficult \nissues that lingered for many months. I want to associate myself with \nthe remarks made earlier today by Chairman Lugar and Senator Biden in \nwhich they took the position that, despite the Lugar-Kerry-Biden bill's \nmany virtues, the bottom line reality is that to go to conference with \na new Senate version of the bill is to risk losing a critical \nopportunity at the G-8 meeting.\n  Our majority leader, Dr. Frist, who has spent so much of his own time \nhelping the people of Africa, also noted that the bill he called up may \nnot be the perfect bill, but it represents a major step forward in \nadvancing the program that President Bush laid out in the State of the \nUnion Address.\n  As the great philosopher Mick Jagger once noted, you can't always get \nwhat you want, but sometimes you find you get what you need.\n  I think that the President's $15 billion proposal and the House bill \nare exactly what the people of Africa and the Caribbean need. Although \nI can think of some ways to refine the House language--as Senators \nLugar, Kerry, and Biden have suggested, my view is that we can not let \nthe perfect become the enemy of the very good.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1298. It is a good bill. The \nHouse worked for a long time and came up with a product of which we can \nall be proud and supportive. We will have ample opportunity in the \nmonths ahead and during the appropriations process to fine tune this \nlegislation. But I agree with Senator Frist, let's get this done job \ndone.\n  Now is the time to send the President to France with an enacted bill \nwith which he can attempt to leverage additional support from our \nclosest allies. Being able to put the $15 billion bill on the table as \na finished product will do much more benefit than a progress report on \nthe Conference Committee.\n  I believe that H.R. 1298 will be viewed as an important step forward \nwith respect to public health. I cannot help but think that many of the \ndeveloping world--the very same people we want to enlist with us to \nfight the battle against terrorism and to resist the entreaties of \nthose who seek to undermine the role of America in world affairs--will \ntake note of our action tonight. They will see that, even at a time \nwhen the domestic U.S. economy is struggling to recover, Americans \nfound both the will and wallet to launch a major humanitarian effort \nagainst diseases that are severely lowering the quality of life in the \ndeveloping world.\n  Mr. President, I support H.R. 1298 as a clean bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important measure.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1298.\n  Our world is in the midst of a crises. HIV/AIDS has taken hold of \nmany parts of the world and left death and destruction in its wake. \nMillions have been affected, wives have lost husbands, parents have \nlost sons and daughters, small children have been left alone, orphaned \nafter AIDS took the life of parents.\n  The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS reports that as of the \nyear 2002, there were 29.4 million people living with this disease. \nSadly, most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa. Estimates are that by \nthe year 2020, an additional 55 million Africans will lose their lives \nto the epidemic.\n  Women are particularly affected and make up 58 percent of the HIV-\npositive population in sub-Saharan Africa. Perhaps even more troubling, \n6 to 11 percent of women aged 15 to 24 were HIV positive in 2001, \ncompared to 3 to 6 percent of young men. Women are dwarfed by men in \neconomic and political affairs, and far too many of these women have no \nway to protect themselves. The political and cultural standards in many \ncountries have left them unable to defend themselves from unwanted \nsexual activity and advances and their reluctance to submit to male \ndomination. With this pandemic, these women are victimized yet again.\n  During my time as President of the American Red Cross, I saw \nfirsthand the poverty and countless other socio-economic factors that \nmake Africa particularly vulnerable to the spread of AIDS. Rwanda, for \ninstance, is one of the areas with a high rate of adults infected with \nHIV. And Mr. President, while there, and in Goma, Congo, where a \nmillion Rwandans had fled from the bloodshed in their country, I saw \n100s of children with no parents, no home, no food, no clothes, no \nhope. To this day, I can close my eyes and see a little boy sitting by \nhimself on a mound of dirt. He was probably 13 or 14 his face was \ncovered with dust and he was crying. The tears left little paths down \nhis cheeks. I sat beside him, and put my arm around him to try to \ncomfort him but there was no reaction. Nothing moved, not a muscle \nmoved, as the tears flowed. He was traumatized. This is the challenge \nwe face, ending the poverty and despair of that little boy, and \nreplacing them with hope and life.\n  Due to AIDS, the region is in a dangerous cycle that affects global \nhealth, the global economy and global security. Consider this: labor \nforces are decreasing because of the disease. Since there are fewer \nworkers to farm the land, harvests are depleted, and famine is running \nrampant. As hopelessness sinks in, people become vulnerable and \nsusceptible to evil terrorist predators.\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\nIt is an endless cycle of despair, a boiling pot that cannot go \nunchecked.\n  This Nation, the world's global leader, cannot sit idly by. We must \npass this bill today. An entire generation is in danger of being wiped \nout by HIV/AIDS.\n  This legislation takes a historic step in fighting this battle. It \ncommits $15 billion dollars over the next five years to fight AIDS, \ntuberculosis and malaria. It establishes within the Department of State \na coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS \nso that the U.S. can continue to lead on this issue. And it commits $1 \nbillion dollars for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \nMalaria.\n  The legislation is the important springboard to real changes in \nAfrica related to AIDS. It brings together many nations to participate \nin this effort, and through the conscience clause, allows for non-\ngovernmental and faith-based organizations to lend their efforts to \neradicating this epidemic. This clause and the participation of \ncommunity and faith-based organizations are vitally important.\n  The funding will work two-fold, through public private partnerships, \nto offer prevention and treatment.\n  At the Red Cross, I was also able to work firsthand on AIDS \nprevention education. Ours was the first nationwide effort, so I know \nthe benefits. The Red Cross has provided AIDS prevention education to \nmore than 18 million people across the United States since 1985. More \nthan 30,000 have been trained as HIV/AIDS education instructors. In the \ntime since, our nation has made great strides in battling AIDS. People \nare taking precautions and living longer.\n  But I also know firsthand that prevention efforts can sometimes get \nbogged down in controversy. There are so many different views and \nbeliefs. But this is not the time for the Senate to engage in partisan \nor ideological delays. America is needed in this crisis; we are needed \nnow, not next month, not next year. Lives are literally hanging in the \nbalance on this bill. Saving them should be our only focus. We must \nstep forward now to help our global neighbors, to offer a helping hand \nto those who need it, to end the death and destruction. We must pass \nthis bill.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to support the United \nStates Leadership against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and malaria Act of \n2003.\n  This legislation authorizes $15 billion over 5 years, $3 billion per \nyear through 2008. This bill also establishes an HIV/AIDS response \ncoordinator and advisory panel, and requires a 5-year comprehensive, \nintegrated, global strategy to fight this deadly disease. I am pleased \nto join a bipartisan group of Senators supporting this legislation.\n  According to the United Nations, more than 65 million people \nworldwide have been infected with HIV, more than 25 million have died \nof the disease, and more than 14 million children have been orphaned.\n  At the end of 2002, an estimated 42 million people were infected with \nHIV or were living with AIDS, of which more than 75 percent live in \nAfrica or the Caribbean. AIDS is the leading cause of death in sub-\nSaharan Africa, where more than 19.4 million have died.\n  Basic interventions to prevent new HIV infections and to bring care \nand treatment to people living with AIDS have achieved meaningful \nresults. Nonetheless, of the more than 30 million people in Africa with \nHIV, only 50,000 receive necessary medicines.\n  We must do everything to reverse this horrible trend and fight this \npandemic. But we can't do it on the cheap. Fighting this disease will \ntake a lot of money because the problem is so widespread.\n  The Global H.I.V. Prevention Working Group, funded jointly by the \nKaiser Family Foundation and the Gates Foundation, has issued a report \nstating that: ``Globally, fewer than one in five people have access to \nbasic HIV prevention programs--the information and services that can \nhelp save lives and reverse the AIDS epidemic.''\n  The Working Group's analysis of global HIV prevention funding finds \nthat annual spending from all sources in 2002 was $3.8 billion short of \nwhat will be needed by 2005.\n  The report also finds that access to proven prevention interventions \nis extremely limited, and highly variable, depending on region and the \nintervention.\n  As you can see, this problem is bigger than what our response will be \nhere today. We must view this legislation as the first step in an \nongoing battle to end the AIDS epidemic once and for all.\n  The bill before us is an important bill, but it is only an \nauthorization bill. Now, we must focus on the upcoming appropriations \nbills to make good on the promise of the bill before us today.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I support the global AIDS bill. I, like \nmany of my colleagues, do not believe the House version of this \nlegislation is perfect. I have reservations about the bill--in \nparticular more funding is needed to fight the spread of tuberculosis \nand malaria. Nevertheless, I enthusiastically support this legislation \nas a vital first step in the international response to the global AIDS \npandemic. Coupled with expanded--though still relatively small--\nbilateral resources to fight tuberculosis, the leading killer of people \ninfected with AIDS, this initiative will save many, many lives. I \ncommend the President for his leadership in this effort, and the \nHouse's overwhelming support of this important legislation and the \nglobal fund.\n  Today, there are an estimated 42 million people worldwide living with \nHIV. Of the 42 million people infected with the virus, 3.2 million are \nchildren and half women. These numbers will tragically increase. In \n2002, there were 14,000 new HIV infections each day, resulting in an \nestimated 5 million new cases worldwide.\n  The HIV/AIDS pandemic is devastating for millions of men, women, \nchildren, and families. Moreover, it threatens the economic and \npolitical stability of many developing countries. More than 95 percent \nof the new HIV/AIDS cases were contracted in developing countries. It \nis estimated that AIDS will diminish economic growth by up to 1 percent \nof GDP annually and consume more than half of health care budgets in \nthe hardest-hit countries. With ever fragile infrastructures and \ninadequate funding for health, this economic drain will further hamper \ndeveloping nations' prospects for a peaceful transition to democracy.\n  The ability of these developing countries to prevent the further \nspread of the AIDS virus is limited without our help. Accordingly, it \nis imperative that we join with the President and House and offer our \nassistance to those struggling countries. This bill will provide the \nmuch-needed support and financial assistance to foreign countries \nstruggling to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. \nAlong with a comprehensive 5-year plan to combat the global spread of \nHIV and AIDS, the bill authorizes funding and enables the U.S. to \nparticipate in the global fund through 2008.\n  While passage of this legislation is essential, it ought to be \nremembered that this effort has just begun. This initiative is just a \nfirst downpayment by the U.S. in our fight against the global spread of \nAIDS. We must fully fund this bill in 2004 and still do more. We must \ninvest wisely to protect and save as many lives as possible and as soon \nas possible. These funds are needed immediately, and if we do not \ninvest enough now, we will pay far more later--in money, in lives lost, \nand in the social, economic, and spiritual cost to the families, \ncommunities, nations, which are hardest hit. There are ten million \nchildren in sub-Saharan Africa alone--children who ought to be free to \nplay, to learn, to enjoy their young lives--who have lost one or both \nparents to AIDS. This represents a country the size of Belgium. In 10 \nyears, at current rates, this number will quadruple. But we have a \nchoice. Will we allow this to happen? Every year we delay, the greater \nthe cost. This epidemic is not waiting for us, it is here and \naccelerating. So, we too must accelerate our response.\n  I again salute President Bush for his compassionate leadership and \ncommitment to fighting HIV/AIDS at the global level. With passage of \nthis bill, the U.S. will demonstrate its unwavering belief in the \ndignity of life, and as a nation, that we take seriously our moral duty \nto bring an end to preventable human suffering. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider this just a first step in our response to fighting global HIV/\nAIDS, to invest our resources judiciously, and\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\nto act immediately. We must not wait another day to pass this \nlegislation, because we cannot afford to have another life needlessly \ntaken by AIDS. I look forward to ensuring that this legislation will be \nfull funded in this year's appropriations bills.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is legislation \nthat marks a major step forward in addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic. \nAlthough in my view we have been slow to come to terms with the \nenormity of the problem, we now have a broad bipartisan consensus on \nthe urgent need for increased funding to address the HIV/AIDS crisis, \nwhich is reflected in two proposals before the Senate: H.R. 1298, the \nUnited States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \nAct of 2003 and S. 1009, the United States Emergency Plan for AIDS \nRelief Act of 2003.\n  While they are broadly similar in their provisions, one, in my view, \nwill equip us better with the tools we need. That is S. 1009, which I \nam cosponsoring. Within its overall authorization figures of $2.8 \nbillion for fiscal year 2004 and $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2005 for \nHIV/AIDS initiatives, it obligates specified amounts for bilateral \nprograms, The Global Fund to Fight Aids Tuberculosis, TB, and Malaria, \nThe Vaccine Fund, The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, \ntuberculosis programs and the Malaria Vaccine Initiative. It promotes \nan integrated and balanced approach to fighting the disease, while at \nthe same time embracing a wide range of established HIV/AIDS treatment \nand prevention programs. Indeed, S. 1009 is designed to complement and \nsupport existing development and relief funds, which have already \nproved their value.\n  Today in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the globe we confront \nthe tragic consequences of ignorance about HIV/AIDS, indifference to \nits effects and delay in marshalling worldwide efforts to contain and \nultimately to eliminate it. First diagnosed in Los Angeles just over 20 \nyears ago, it rapidly spread worldwide, especially as major mechanisms \nof transmission, like blood transfusions and unsterilized needles, were \noverlooked. While concerted efforts of the medical community and the \npublic at large have helped control the number of new cases and reduced \nthe death rate, the disease continues to spread in some parts of the \nworld. According to the most recent report of the Joint United Nations \nProgramme on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS, on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic, 3.5 \nmillion people were infected last year in Africa alone.\n  If not effectively treated, HIV/AIDS takes a truly terrible toll. In \neconomic terms, the pandemic has turned back the clock on decades of \ndevelopment gains, creating a vicious cycle that exacerbates poverty \namong the already poor and reduces others to poverty. It displaces or \nmarginalizes populations, making them even more susceptible to HIV \ninfection. In South Africa, where the epidemic's grip has been \nespecially deadly, AIDS has caused major social and economic \ndisruption. What began as a health issue is now also a development \ncrisis.\n  In every country where HIV/AIDS rages out of control, all sectors are \naffected. Public health services have been particularly hard hit, \nbecause the demand from the services of public health workers has \nincreased. IMF indicators suggest that in the most afflicted countries \nhealth services have been overwhelmed by the epidemic, even as the \nnumber of patients is projected to double over the next few years.\n  HIV/AIDS has hit hardest in countries with limited budget resources. \nScarce funds have been allocated to rising health care costs, at the \nexpense of other critical public services. Additionally, because the \ndisease debilitates and incapacitates well before it kills, and because \nit crosses all socioeconomic lines, it has effectively deprived \nstruggling governments of a generation of civil servants--of urgently \nneeded leadership, experience and expertise. This loss of human \nresources constitutes a new and insidious form of brain drain that \ngovernments can ill afford as they work to promote economic growth, \nalleviate poverty and improve the quality of life for its citizens.\n  Education in the affected countries has been particularly hard hit. \nEven if the demand for education falls over time as fertility rates \ndecline, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to maintain pupil-\nteacher ratios at constant levels. IMF indicators suggest that by 2010 \nthe proportion of newly trained teachers replacing teachers who have \ndied of AIDS will reach a staggering 67 percent--two in every three. \nThe magnitude of this tragic epidemic further complicates the challenge \nof raising literacy rates in the developing world. The World Bank \nestimates that even absent the impact of HIV/AIDS, 55 of the world's \npoorest countries will be unable to achieve universal primary \nenrollment by 2015.\n  HIV/AIDS affects the private sector just as much as the public \nsector. As mortality rates rise and the working-age population declines \nin size, employers lose trained, experienced and productive workers. \nMedical care, death-related benefits and also absenteeism--a very \nimportant factor--all contribute to rising personnel costs.\n  The macroeconomic impacts are clear. When the HIV infection rate \nexceeds 5 percent in a country, HIV/AIDS begins to have significant \neconomy-wide impacts. At least 24 African nations, along with Haiti, \nnow fit into this category. The consequences are grim. UNAIDS estimates \na loss of more than 20 percent of GDP by 2020 in the worst affected \ncountries. The number of destitute families will rise as they face \nlower incomes, greater numbers of dependents and sharply higher \nhealthcare expenditures. The ripple effects of continued reductions in \nlabor, savings, and investment will mean lower economic output in the \naffected countries, inevitably slowing economic growth and causing \ntrade balances to deteriorate further.\n  The economic ramifications of HIV/AIDS are one aspect of the crisis; \nthe human dimension is another. According to UNAIDS, 42 million people \nworldwide are living with HIV. Of these cases, more than 28 million are \nin Africa alone. In 2002, 5 million people were newly infected with \nHIV; 28 million people have thus far died from the disease; 14 million \nchildren have been orphaned by AIDS without having contracted the \ndisease themselves. Given the high mortality rates among young adults, \nthe orphan population will inevitably increase; a recent report issued \njointly by UNICEF/UNAIDS/USAID estimates that by the end of this decade \nthe number of orphans will reach 25 million, an increase of nearly 80 \npercent. Social support systems in the affected countries are \ntragically inadequate in the face of the crisis. Children thus become \npart of a vicious cycle, with no one to care for them, still vulnerable \nto the disease, seeking to survive in a gang or militia--exacerbating \nsocial problems in these countries.\n  Available statistics tell only part of the story, since AIDS often \ngoes unreported. There is no system of accessible AIDS testing and many \ncases go undiagnosed, given the sensitivity and social stigma too often \nsurrounding AIDS. On the basis of what is available, however, experts \nagree that in Africa alone the disease threatens an entire generation \nthat will either be lost to HIV/AIDS or severely affected by plummeting \nlife expectancy, collapsing social institutions and decimated \nworkforces.\n  As we consider our approach to AIDS, our recent experience with SARS \nshould be instructive. With SARS we have learned in a few months what \nit took years to understand about HIV/AIDS: awareness, early \nintervention and international cooperation are critical factors in \nkeeping the disease from spreading and in saving lives. We must apply \nthe lessons we are learning from SARS to our efforts to treat and \ncontrol HIV/AIDS.\n  A person infected with the HIV/AIDS virus may appear to show signs of \nthe flu, or no symptoms at all for months or even years. Yet diagnosed \nin time, the disease is treatable. In the industrialized world, for \nexample, research and intervention have reduced mother-to-child \ntransmission of the HIV virus to less than 2 percent. Rigorous testing \nand surveillance can keep the blood supply safe. Effective, low-cost \ninterventions have been developed. In high-risk groups in \nindustrialized countries intensive education, vigorous political action \nand extensive drug therapy have been combined to bring the disease \nlargely under control. Now we must\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\napply these strategies in the developing world, where the disease is \nraging out of control. Of the total HIV population worldwide, 95 \npercent live in the developing world. While there is no cure, we know \nthat prompt intervention mitigates the terrible effects of the disease.\n  S. 1009 is not directed exclusively to HIV/AIDS; it includes \nimportant provisions addressed to tuberculosis and malaria. Unlike HIV/\nAIDS, which was first diagnosed less than a quarter-century ago, these \ntwo terrible diseases have been known and feared for centuries. \nTuberculosis claims nearly 3 million lives every year--more than all \nother infectious diseases combined. Among HIV/AIDS patients, it is the \nsingle most common cause of death. In fact, HIV patients are up to 50 \npercent more likely to convert the latent form of TB into the active, \ncontagious form. Unlike many other infectious diseases, tuberculosis is \nan airborne disease transmitted like the common cold. Nearly one-third \nof the world's population is already infected, and cases of multidrug \nresistant strains, which are far more difficult and expensive to treat, \nare rising. Overall, tuberculosis is responsible for 25 percent of all \npreventable deaths in the developing world. S. 1009 authorizes $150 \nmillion for fiscal year 2004 and $170 million for fiscal year 2005 for \nprograms devoted to tackling TB.\n  The developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa is also in the \ngrip of resurgent malaria, as resistance grows to traditionally \neffective antimalarial drugs. Resurgent malaria is estimated to cause 1 \nto 3 million deaths annually, and WHO projects between 300 to 500 new \ncases every year. S. 1009 authorizes $105 million for fiscal year 2004 \nand $125 million for fiscal year 2005 to malaria programs and to the \nMalaria Vaccine Initiative.\n  With the worst effects of the pandemic still to come, S. 1009 is \ntimely and urgent. It will help to stop the terrible downward spiral in \nliving standards in the countries it has ravaged, and the \ndestabilization that occurs when families and communities are torn \napart. It can save lives.\n  We can beat back this disease. In my view, S. 1009 provides us with \nthe tools most urgently needed by those on the front lines in the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS. It is vastly superior in its provisions to H.R. 1298. \nNonetheless, I will work with my colleagues to strengthen the \nunderlying bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue of \nhealth care transmissions of HIV/AIDS in Africa. I want to clarify some \nimportant provisions of the bill addressing the spread of HIV/AIDS and \nother infectious diseases in Africa and the developing world through \nthe health care setting and more specifically the reuse of syringes and \nneedles, in other words, injection devices.\n  The reuse of syringes and needles is a well-documented practice in \nthe developing world. Scientists from the WHO, Duke University and the \nGates Children Vaccine Program report that the percentage of unsafe \ninjections in sub-Saharan Africa vary from greater than 50 percent to \nas high as 90 percent in Burkina Faso. In some countries in the study, \n60 percent of centers reused syringes/needles. The Safe Injection \nGlobal Network, SIGN, an organization affiliated with the World Health \nOrganization, WHO, reports that, ``Transmission of bloodbourne \npathogens, including hepatitis B virus, HBV, Hepatitis C virus, HCV, \nand acquired immunodeficiency virus, HIV, through unsafe injections has \nlong been reported and causes a heavy burden of disease.''\n  A December, 2002 paper co-authored by physicians from WHO and CDC \nestimated that in the developing regions that were studied, almost 40 \npercent of injections were given with reused injection devices. The \nsame study found that unsafe injection practices in developing \ncountries in the year 2000 alone caused 22 million hepatitis B \ninfections, 2 million Hepatitis C infections and resulted in the \ntransmission of the HIV virus to 260,000 people.\n  The cumulative number of people with HIV, Hep B and Hep C over the \nyears is a significant number that cannot be ignored.\n  In response to the overwhelming evidence of diseases spread through \nneedle and syringe reuse, and the recognition of the effectiveness of \nneedles with technology features that prevent reuse to stop the spread \nof disease, Section 306 of this bill includes legislative language \n``promoting sterile injection practices and technologies.''\n  I want to make the point that sterile injection practices and \ntechnologies referred to in Section 306 include injection devices with \nreuse prevention features.\n  Furthermore, it is my understanding that ``sterile injection \npractices and technologies'' referred to in Section 306 should include \ninjection devices with reuse prevention features, especially since \nneedles or syringes that can be reused are only guaranteed to be \nsterile during their use. This section should not be interpreted to \nsupport needle exchange programs. It is also my understanding that \navailability and use of reuse prevention injection devices will limit \nnot only the spread of HIV/AIDS, but also have the additional benefit \nof reducing the incidence of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and other \ninfectious diseases such as the Ebola virus, through non-sterile and \nunsafe injection practices.\n  This clarification is important to ensure that the Coordinator of the \nHIV/AIDS Program at the State Department understands the importance of \nproviding injection devices with reuse prevention features to prevent \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.\n  Studies may vary as to exact percentage of infectious disease spread \nby various known causes. But all should agree that the use of sterile \ninjection devices with reuse prevention features is one effective, \neconomical, and immediately available step that can be taken to prevent \none of the most significant causes of the spread of infectious \ndiseases, especially among children who receive injections for \nimmunization and other health care.\n  It has been estimated that there are about 1.5 billion injections \nadministered in Africa each year. Since some injection devices with \nreuse prevention features can be obtained for as little as \napproximately 5 cents each, the entire continent of Africa could be \nsupplied with safe injection devices at a cost of less than $100 \nmillion dollars per year. Doing so could virtually eliminate the spread \nof HIV and other diseases in Africa from injection device re-use, in a \nmanner that is cost-effective and with measurable results.\n  During a March 27, 2003 hearing I chaired in the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee on the transmission of AIDS in \nAfrica, David Gisselquist, PhD, testified that, ``From the 16 available \nlarge studies in Africa with sufficient data on injections, an average \nof 28 percent of HIV infections is associated with medical \ninjections.''\n  In a December 2002 WHO report the authors list four studies with \nfindings of 8 percent, 15 percent, 41 percent and 45 percent \nattributable to contaminated injections resulting in HIV infections, \nthus suggesting that the WHO 2.5 percent model was conservative. Even \nthe WHO in its own report stated ``[i]n the year 2000, four decades \nafter the widespread availability of single-use injection equipment and \ntwo decades into the HIV pandemic, contaminated injections account for \nclose to a third of new HBV infections, 40 percent of new HCV \ninfections and 5 percent of new HIV infections. These infections \ntranslate to a substantial preventable burden of acute hepatitis, AIDS, \nhepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver disease.''\n  Even if the proportion of cases from injections is much lower than \nthat by heterosexual transmission, it is an important component of the \nproblem and we must act quickly. If healthcare procedures account for a \nhigh percentage of the cases of HIV infections in Africa, then we must \nimmediately and radically change our prevention procedures.\n  Therefore, I plan to work with the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to request an independent group to examine \nthe available studies on the number of HIV/AIDS cases that are caused \nby the unsafe re-use of needles. This study will help clarify and \nhighlight the dangerous impact of needle re-use in the spread of HIV/\nAIDS. I recommend that the independent organization draw a panel of \nexperts from different public health organizations to compile this \nstudy and make available their findings in 90 days.\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\n  I plan to request this study to help understand the true impact of \nhealth care transmission and especially unsafe needle re-use in the \nspread of HIV in Africa and to ensure that our policies reflect the \nbest science about the causes of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and \nother parts of the developing world.\n  I am glad this evening to join with my colleagues in support of the \nPresident's initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS and to deliver a bill \nprior to his departure for the G-8 summit in France which commences on \nJune 1, 2003. The bill authorizes $15 billion over 5 years for HIV/AIDS \nprograms and it is my desire that some of this money be used to \neliminate the transmission of HIV/AIDS in the health care setting and \nespecially by the re-use of injection devices.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this is an historic moment for us. The \nUnited States Senate is going to step up to the plate and declare in a \nbipartisan manner that we will meet our moral obligation and help those \ncountries most afflicted by HIV/AIDS.\n  The scourge of AIDS knows no borders; it is the greatest plague of \nour time. Over 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV/AIDS \ntoday. Thirty million of those are in Africa. Nearly half, or twenty \nmillion, of those infected are in the fourteen countries highlighted \nfor special attention in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \nRelief, which is authorized in the bill before us today.\n  Now is the time for the Senate to act. I support the bipartisan \nglobal AIDS bill that passed the House, and urge my colleagues to do \nthe same. The Bipartisan Global AIDS bill authorizes the President's 5-\nyear, $15 billion plan to combat HIV/AIDS, mirroring President Bush's \nemphasis on treatment and care. The bill provides funding to the Global \nFund to Fight AIDS--up to $1 billion per year--but it limits \ncontributions to be no more than one-third of those monies contributed \nby other sources. This limitation provides the President with leverage \nto encourage other countries to donate to the global fund.\n  The bill supports the approach that Uganda has had so much success \nwith called ``ABC,'' which stands for: abstain, be faithful, and use a \ncondom. When I met with the First Lady of Uganda Tuesday, she told me \nhow this approach of emphasizing abstinence was a return to traditional \nAfrican values that is working well. From 1991 to 2001, the prevalence \nof HIV/AIDS among pregnant women in Uganda has declined from 21 percent \nto 6 percent, thanks largely to ``ABC.'' In Botswana, by contrast, a \nnurse told me 97 percent of the pregnant patients she saw were HIV-\npositive, and the national rate was 43 percent among pregnant women in \n2000--seven times Uganda's rate. In fact, on Monday, I will be chairing \na hearing in the African Affairs Subcommittee to look more closely at \nthe Ugandan model and how it can be applied in other countries.\n  Thirteen million ``AIDS orphans'' around the world have lost their \nparents to AIDS--the bill authorizes funds to aid those children. Time \nis of the essence. Every moment we delay, more people are dying and \nbecoming infected.\n  I know many of us see imperfections in the bill, and want to amend \nit. I'm one of them. In fact, I've introduced an AIDS Corps bill that \nwould make a great amendment to this bill. I'm going to withhold that \namendment in the interest of getting a good bill quickly to the \nPresident's desk, but I want to take a moment to talk about it in hope \nthat we can adopt this proposal or something similar in the future.\n  The House bill includes language to establish a program where health \nprofessionals can volunteer their services to travel abroad to \ncountries most afflicted by HIV/AIDS and provide training and care. \nThis is a needed service. One exacerbating problem for poorer countries \nafflicted by HIV/AIDS Is the lack of a strong health care \ninfrastructure. In many African countries, traditional healers are more \nrelied upon than medical doctors--these traditional healers may have \nlittle or no knowledge about testing for HIV or providing advice on how \nto prevent or treat it.\n  Health professionals from countries like the United States can take a \ncouple of months away from their practice to travel to other countries \nin need and provide necessary training to allow in-country care-\nproviders to better respond to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  And American health professionals have shown an interest in answering \nthe call. A number of non-profit groups help doctors volunteer their \nservices, groups like Doctors Without Borders, US Doctors for Africa, \nand the International Medical Corps.\n  My amendment takes the language from the House bill and improves on \nit in three important ways:\n  No. 1, it names the volunteers the ``AIDS Corps'' to help increase \nthe profile of the group so as to better attract qualified medical \nprofessionals to give of their time and volunteer.\n  No. 2, it provides more flexibility for the length of time health \nprofessionals can serve--so that those who can only volunteer for a few \nmonths won't be excluded.\n  No. 3, it provides the same liability coverage to volunteering \ndoctors as is provided for federal employees who provide health care \nservices.\n  I hope that at some future date we can consider these changes that \nwill allow any new corps of medical volunteers established by the \nPresident under this act to function more effectively.\n  Now is not the time to put such an amendment forward.\n  We need to pass this bill quickly so the administration can begin its \nimplementation and President Bush can use it to encourage other \ncountries to join us in this effort at the upcoming G-8 summit.\n  I urge my colleagues, let us pass this bill without amendment tonight \nso that the President can sign it as early as tomorrow, and we will be \none step closer to reversing the trend of this growing menace and start \nreducing its impact around the world.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, no challenge is more daunting in scope or \nimmediate in need than the Global AIDS crisis. I rise today with the \nutmost urgency to speak of this modern-day plague and to urge my \ncolleagues to ensure that the legislation currently pending before the \nUnited States Senate is both swift in its passage and effective in its \nnature.\n  The global AIDS pandemic threatens to undermine all of our other \nefforts to bring stability and prosperity to the world. AIDS is an \nunparelled crisis, and it threatens to have a potentially irreversible \neffect. Every country around the globe will, in one way or another, \nfeel the devastating impact of this disease; no nation will be spared.\n  Certainly, I applaud the administration for its initiative on this \nimportant issue. We all do. And, the bill currently before this \nchamber--which closely reflects the Administration's requests--provides \na good framework for battling this crisis. However, it has some serious \nshortcomings--shortcomings that will greatly impact its chances of \nsuccess. That is why this chamber must ensure that any AIDS legislation \nit passes will be effective on the ground. In order to do this, we must \nlook carefully at the facts, and at the reality of the situation. This \nmust be our first priority.\n  Mr. President, there are well over 42 million people currently living \nwith HIV/AIDS. In 2001 alone, there were approximately five million new \ninfections. Even worse is that the number of infections continues to \ngrow at an alarming rate. There are 15,000 new infections every day, \nand half of these infections--half--are in children between 15 and 24 \nyears of age.\n  Without a doubt, the region hardest hit by this pandemic is sub-\nSaharan Africa. Approximately 70 percent of the worldwide total of \npeople with HIV/AIDS live in that part of the world, and well over 29 \nmillion people are currently infected. The overall rate of infection \namong adults in the region is close to nine percent, compared with 1.2 \npercent worldwide, and in seven countries, the infection rate is over \n20 percent.\n  Experts contend that the severity of the AIDS pandemic in that region \nis directly related to its wide-spread poverty, lack of education, ill-\nequipped and underfunded health systems, and local taboos that \nstigmatize and ostracize those who are infected. Even more devastating \nto the region is that the AIDS pandemic creates a vicious circle of \nevents that, despite international aid, increasingly hinders the \nability of affected societies to help themselves.\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\n  This vicious circle is pervasive throughout all sectors of society. \nSkilled workers, teachers, farmers, management executives, and \ngovernment officials alike are falling prey to AIDS. In fact, according \nto UNAIDS, by 2020, the most affected countries will experience a loss \nof more than 20 percent of their gross domestic product.\n  AIDS is also having a debilitating effect on our hemisphere. In \nGuyana, almost 3 percent of the adult population is infected, and in \nHaiti, a nation long-suffering from substantial economic and political \ninstability, more than 6 percent of its adult population are living \nwith the virus. Indeed, throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, \nover 1.9 million people are infected, and in some Caribbean countries, \nthe rates of prevalence are second only to sub-Saharan Africa.\n  Throughout the world, AIDS is killing millions of parents, and often \nleaves young children in the precarious position of having to supply \nfood, money, and medicine for their families. The World Bank estimates \nthat there are currently 15.6 million AIDS orphans, and this number is \nexpected to double by 2010. Many of these children, especially girls, \nquit school and become victims of sexual violence or commercial sex \nworkers. And, due to lack of resources and education, only a fraction \nof these children know that they are infected. Most do not even believe \nthat they are at risk or know how AIDS is spread.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully examine this situation. Many of \nthese children are not promiscuous because of childish recklessness. \nCertainly, children do not desire to become commercial sex workers. \nThey are children. Given the chance, they would play games and go to \nschool, as do most children. However, in many cases, their reality, as \nwell as the obligation to provide for their families, forces them into \nthis lifestyle.\n  I know that citing the successful efforts in the nation of Uganda, \nsome of my colleagues argue that United States AIDS assistance should \nfocus on the promotion of abstinence among children. Certainly, \nencouraging young, unmarried children to abstain is a worthy goal. We \ncan teach them to abstain, we can urge them to abstain, and we should. \nHowever, we can not ignore the multitude of factors with which we are \nfaced. We must remember that the Uganda plan worked because it \nencouraged abstinence, monogamy, and distributed condoms--the ``ABC'' \nmodel. Most of all, it worked because the President of that nation made \nit a national priority to educate his people about HIV/AIDS.\n  In my view, the most important distinction among regions of the world \nhas been the ability of affected nations to deal with the AIDS crisis \nand to educate their people about it, as well as the ability of \ninfected people to pay for a variety of life-saving or life-prolonging \ntreatments.\n  I know we can all remember a time in the United States when in \nschools, television advertisements, and billboards, we strove to \neducate Americans about HIV/AIDS. In fact, this effort continues, and \nwith much success. Coupled with access to state-of-the-art treatments, \nAmericans with HIV are able to live longer and healthier lives than \never before. But it is important to realize that the methods used to \nprogress in one area of the world will not necessarily be effective in \nanother. In many regions, AIDS infection stems from an intricate social \nreality--one with many contributing factors. In most of these \ncountries, poverty deprives the people of effective systems of health \ninformation, health education, and health care. AIDS counseling is \noften unavailable, and HIV testing is difficult for many to obtain. \nLack of resources to buy and distribute the expensive drugs that \nprolong life for those infected with HIV, as well as the rarity of sex \neducation and prevention methods, have compounded these problems.\n\n  Therefore, we must not ignore the widespread destitution caused by \nthis disease, which forces many people--children and adults--into a \nlifestyle that dramatically increases their risk of infection. Any \neffort to fight AIDS must be accompanied by an effort to fight poverty \nand build infrastructure; it must be focused on helping people to help \nthemselves. It is my hope that as the Senate addresses the issue of \nforeign aid in the coming year, it pays particular attention to the \nother myriad needs on the continent of Africa, as well as in other \npoverty-stricken regions throughout the world.\n  In addition, we must not ignore existing institutions, such as the \nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. While I strongly \nsupport the provision in this bill authorizing up to $1 billion for the \nGlobal Fund in fiscal year 2004, I am concerned that the Bush \nAdministration will instead choose to follow its fiscal year 2004 \nbudget request, and only allocate $200 million for this important \ninstitution. Indeed, such a decision would threaten the ability of the \nGlobal Fund to continue its important work; it would be a step \nbackwards in our fight against AIDS.\n  And lastly, although this bill will serve to combat HIV/AIDS in \ntwelve African countries, as well as Haiti and Guyana, it is absolutely \nessential that we focus our efforts not only on these countries, but on \nthe world at large. HIV/AIDS is a global problem and it needs a global \nresponse. My amendment designating Caribbean countries as priority \ncountries for United States support was an attempt to give additional \nattention where it is most needed.\n  To highlight the necessity of this global approach, I would like to \nbring to the attention of my colleagues a report on AIDS, which was \npublished in January 2000 by the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA. This \nreport states that by 2010, the focal point of infections will most \nlikely shift from sub-Saharan Africa to Nigeria, Ethiopia, India, \nRussia, and China. There will be approximately 50 to 75 million \ninfected people in these countries alone, and according to the CIA, the \nAIDS crisis will contribute to political instability and slow \ndemocratic development. These are dire predictions, and we have an \nobligation to address them.\n  Our intentions are noble and our conviction is real. But in order to \nachieve all of these vital goals, we must fully and sensibly commit \nourselves to the fight against AIDS. That means providing the necessary \nresources to prevent and treat this illness, sufficiently funding \nimportant organizations and vaccine research, educating people about \nAIDS, providing a truly global response, and ensuring that our efforts \nare effective and grounded on the realities of those in need. And, as \nwe consider this bill, it is crucial to remember that it is only a \nfirst step. In order to succeed, we must also change the reality in \nwhich this disease thrives.\n  If we don't act with urgency, sensibility, clarity, and deliberation, \nwe will be condemning to death countless men, women, and children \nthroughout the world. We must act now. We can not afford to fail.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the underlying bill provides too much \nmoney to the global fund. The administration requested $200 million \nnext year for the global fund. This bill funds the global fund to the \ntune of $1 billion.\n  Let me begin by saying I do not think we should be giving the global \nfund anything. They have not earned our trust. They have not proven \nthey can do a better job of fighting AIDS than the President can do \nthrough direct assistance.\n  Let me share an exchange I had with Sir Elton John at a hearing on \nthe AIDS issue.\n\n       Sessions. Thank you for that commitment. It has made a \n     difference. I talked to a businessman who does a lot of work \n     around the world, and he said that in developing nations, the \n     absolute key is not to give the money too high up the ladder. \n     If you are giving the money to the people doing the work, \n     they will work wonderfully, and things will happen \n     beautifully. If you give it too high up, it does not get to \n     the people who do the work in an effective way. Many of you \n     have foundations and are leading groups that are smaller, \n     where you can be more effective. We are talking about, if we \n     were to do what Ms. Thurman asked, tripling our contribution \n     to $2.5 billion. Do you have any suggestions as to how we can \n     make sure that that money actually reaches its greatest \n     potential?\n       Sir Elton John. I concur with you totally. What that money \n     has to go toward is training people to build an \n     infrastructure so that people can get the drugs they need in \n     remote parts of countries, and it needs to run on a \n     government level. But I know what you are saying. I do not \n     know how you do that, because I am just a singer. This is \n     something that the politicians have to make sure that when \n     the money goes to governments, the money is spent in the \n     right way. I have said before that we are a very small AIDS \n     organization; we can control where everything\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\n     goes, and we do. We know where every penny goes. But when you \n     get to these vast sums of money that we are talking about \n     there today, you are going to run into those kinds of \n     problems, and I do not personally know myself how you solve \n     them, but I do concur with you that that is a major problem.\n\n  Sir Elton John's statement is relevant to the issue of whether to \ntake massive amounts of money and give it to this global bureaucracy.\n  The General Accounting Office recently completed an exhaustive study \nof the global fund. I strongly recommend that my colleagues read this \nreport.\n  Here are some of the findings.\n  The Secretariat's office has 63 staff members who have an average \nsalary of $174,603. This is the average.\n  Compared to recipient countries' average annual salaries, or even to \nthe U.S.'s average annual salary, no country even comes close.\n  The average annual salary of the 73 recipient countries where such \nfigures are known is $3,020, over $171,000 less than the average global \nfund salary.\n  Even the average U.S. citizen only makes $36,300 a year. A job with \nthe global fund would give a U.S. worker a potential $138,000 payraise.\n  Americans work hard to pay their taxes. In times of economic trouble, \nthey have to work even harder. We have a fiduciary duty to the \ntaxpayers.\n  We owe it to them to make sure these precious resource are used as \nwisely as possible, especially when we are deciding how to address a \ndeadly epidemic.\n  Disease specialists within the United Nations estimate that it would \ncost $1,400 to $4,200 a year per patient to treat HIV/AIDS effectively \nin sub-Saharan Africa with antiretroviral drugs. That means that by \nsimply eliminating one average Secretariat employee's wages, between 42 \nand 125 AIDS patients could be helped to lead better lives.\n  I want these funds in the hands of someone I can trust. Do I have \nconcerns about giving money to the Federal bureaucracy? Of course. But \nthis is a judgment call. Who do you trust most with these dollars, the \nglobal fund, or President Bush?\n\n  I trust President Bush. I trust the United States of America.\n  Our of $862 million in funds received, the global fund has only \ndistributed $20 million to actual AIDS prevention grants. Meanwhile, \nthey are spending exorbitant amounts on salary and bureaucracy.\n  President Bush has a proven record. He gets results. I cannot say the \nsame for the global fund.\n  The Democratic Leader says he will offer an amendment to ``guarantee \na robust American commitment to the Global Fund to fight AIDS.''\n  This statement implies three things--\n  1. That America's current commitment to the global fund is not \nrobust. Not true.\n  2. That the bill we are considering does not provide a robust \ncommitment. Not true.\n  3. By voting for this amendment,you will guarantee a commitment to \nthe global fund that is more robust than you would by voting against \nit. Not true.\n  Let me take these one at a time. First, Is America's current \ncommitment to the global fund robust? Absolutely.\n  To date, we have contributed a total of $300 million out of a total \n$862 million, 32 percent. Our commitment next year is $350 million out \nof $832 million. The next highest nation is Italy at $100 million.\n  Does the bill we are considering represent a robust commitment to the \nglobal fund? I submit that $1 billion is an overly robust commitment.\n  The President stated that $200 million for the global fund is what is \nneeded next year. This bill authorizes $1 billion. This bill is five \ntimes what the President requested.\n  The bill is more than every nation's pledges combined. Last year, the \ntotal was $832 million. This bill provides $1 billion. I guess too much \nis never enough for the other side.\n  Third, the majority leader is implying that by voting for this \namendment, you will guarantee a commitment to the global fund that is \nmore robust than you would by voting against it.\n  The House is not going to spend more than $1 billion on the global \nfund. So you can vote to increase the funding, but that will just send \nthe bill to conference where the funding will be reduced to the House \namount, or preferably, lower.\n  Here is the real point. The President has indicated his determination \nin having Congress send him a final bill before he departs for the June \n1-3 G8 Summit in Evian, France.\n  At the G8 Summit, the President intends to use this bill as a \ncatalyst and leverage in requesting that the world's leading powers \nmake combating global HIV/AIDS a significant element in their foreign \nassistance programs.\n  If this amendment is adopted, the President will not have it for the \nG8 summit. He will not be able to use our $1 billion commitment to \nleverage other nations to make similarly generous commitments.\n  The other G8 countries contributions are paltry compared to ours. The \nnext highest country is Italy who contributed $100 million. The rest \nare half that amount. The Gates Foundation contributes more to the \nglobal fund than most G8 countries.\n  If my colleagues want to maximize the global contribution to the \nglobal fund, they should vote against this amendment so we can get this \nbill signed into law and President Bush can have the strongest possible \nhand at this summit.\n  In conclusion, there is a lot in this bill I do not like. There are \nprovisions I would change. I think there is way too much money in this \nbill for the global fund.\n  I have amendments I would like to offer. Some are pretty important. \nSome would be adopted overwhelmingly. But if it means we avoid a \nlengthy conference and allow the President to make the strongest \npossible case at the summit in June, I am willing to withhold. There \nwill be other chances to improve this bill. I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the United States Leadership \nAgainst HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.\n  For 20 years, HIV/AIDS has spread from the devastated region of sub-\nSaharan Africa to the entire world. It is the fourth leading cause of \ndeath in the world, killing over 22 million people.\n  But HIV/AIDS doesn't just kill people. It destroys economies. It \nruins nations. It menaces our children and stifles hope.\n  Forty-two million people worldwide have HIV/AIDS. Thirteen million \nchildren are now orphans because of its wrath. Three million children \nare infected. The vast majority of the afflicted live in Africa, but \nthe disease continues to spread at an alarming rate. The peoples of \nEastern Europe, China, India and Central Asia are under assault. The \nworld cannot afford a mediocre response to this disease's assault on \nhuman life.\n  While the experts know how this disease spreads, we can't afford to \nrely on one solution. Abstinence, being faithful and condoms is an \napproach that has been successful in Uganda. The ABC approach is now \nbeing followed in other countries as well. But this won't stop rape, \nsexual abuse and prostitution. We cannot expect women and children \nrefugees to overcome their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS by themselves. \nThey deserve real help--help with empowerment, help in fighting the sex \nand trafficking industries, and help in keeping their predators away.\n  We also need to help the families that are ruined by AIDS. The costs \nof caring for a family member afflicted with AIDS are severe, even \nworse if the person affected is the family's primary wage earner. \nAmerica must stand up and ensure that families can afford the treatment \nand care they need to dull the spread and impact of HIV/AIDS.\n  This disease affects whole societies and nations, not just the \ninfected individuals and their families. Economies suffer when labor \nforces can no longer survive, much less be productive. When the most \neducated and vital members of society get HIV, economies contract \nrather than grow. National security suffers when military forces \ncontract HIV, often at rates up to 5 times as high as civilians.\n  But the HIV/AIDS pandemic is not the only threat we need to fight. \nTuberculosis and malaria compound the problems of HIV/AIDS in \ndeveloping countries, where 6 million people died of HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis, or malaria in 2002.\n  The nations and peoples of the world must share the burden of \nresponding to the HIV/AIDs pandemic. Eliminating\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\nthe scourge of AIDS won't be easy and it won't be cheap.\n  That's why the U.S. needs to make a real contribution to the Global \nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The $500 million the \nU.S. has pledged to the fund falls far short of the $7 billion it will \nneed over the next two years to carry out its critical mission. We can \ndo better. We must.\n  America also needs to encourage concerted international action beyond \nthese important monetary contributions. HIV/AIDS is not a unilateral \nthreat. The world must make a sustained, comprehensive global effort to \nprovide a coordinated program of treatment, care and prevention. \nTogether, we must combine the best of our values, service, technology, \nexpertise and diplomacy to fight the great international menace of HIV/\nAIDS.\n  The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \nMalaria Act of 2003 is a good step toward this goal. I applaud \nPresident Bush for joining our cause by proposing an Emergency Plan for \nAIDS Relief, a new mission to help countries in Africa and the \nCaribbean region address the HIV/AIDS pandemic by providing money, \nexpertise and training. This measure recognizes the critical link \nbetween HIV/AIDS care, treatment, prevention, and education efforts. It \nalso responds to the need for health care systems that actually provide \nthe right treatment.\n  I'm proud to vote for this bill because I see as a culmination of our \nefforts here in the Senate to make this issue less about partisanship, \nand more about people. I've fought for so many years to provide a more \nadequate response to HIV/AIDS. I commend my colleagues for uniting in \nthis effort.\n  There are certainly provisions in this bill that concern me. I've \nvoted to try to change some of them. But I'm not going to let those \nconcerns stand in the way of my support for a stronger U.S. and \ninternational response to the AIDS pandemic. While this bill is not \nperfect, it is a good start that may save millions of lives.\n  By passing this bill, the United States is taking real action to live \nup to its responsibilities as the strongest country in the world. We \ncan show that we really do care about improving the lives and futures \nof people in the developing world. The American people should be proud \nof this American leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time, and passed, as follows:\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank all Senators for their diligence \nand faithfulness in working to this late hour. I thank our leader, \nSenator Frist; likewise, Senator Daschle. I always appreciate working \nwith my colleague, Senator Biden. We have a good relationship on the \ncommittee, and we are very appreciative that the Senate has given us \nthis bill this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator move to reconsider the vote?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, what we have just done is significant in \nmany ways. We have addressed for the first time in a comprehensive way \none of the greatest humanitarian, moral, and public health challenges \nthis country has ever seen, and, I would argue, the greatest \nhumanitarian challenge we have had to face in the last 100 years.\n  We addressed this health challenge in a comprehensive way. We \naddressed it with an authorization for $15 billion over 5 years. It was \njust a few years ago we were spending a total of $100 million a year, \nand now it is going to be approximately $3 billion a year.\n  As has been stated again and again over the course of the evening, \nthe afternoon, and around lunch when we first began talking on the \nbill, what we have done is shown that the United States is not just a \ngood nation but is indeed a great nation, that we will lead in the \nglobal fight against this destructive virus that has killed 23 million \npeople, that is affecting the lives of over 45 million people today, \nand that, as we have said today, will likely take the lives of 60 \nmillion others and will create probably another 40 million orphans over \nthe next two decades.\n  This is our first step. I congratulate the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee for bringing us to this point. Many of us have been \nworking for 3, 4, and 5 years even to bring us to this point. I thank \nhim for his tremendous leadership in accomplishing this goal.\n  I will be happy to yield to my colleague, Senator Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I congratulate everybody who was involved in \nthe bill. This was not easy work. There were a lot of different \npersonalities and opinions. It is a huge issue with a lot of detail. \nThere is a lot of room for error and misunderstandings and different \namendments.\n  I am so pleased that people on both sides of the aisle worked through \nall the difficulties, both ends of the building worked through all the \ndifficulties, and that we arrived at this position.\n  I particularly congratulate the majority leader for the outstanding \njob he has done through all the years he has worked on AIDS. This would \nnot have come to our attention and a vote tonight if it had not been \nfor the diligence of Senator Frist.\n  I also thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for all \nthe work he has done on the bill. He has been through more variations \nof this bill than almost anybody, except Senator Frist, and was willing \nto find a position that would get this bill passed. He did that in the \nbest kind of spirit and took some stands against a bill that had his \nname on it. That is very difficult work for a Senator to do, and he did \nit in the best spirit of making sure we were taking care of the work.\n  It is one of the more universal bills we have done since I have been \nin the Senate.\n  I congratulate everyone for coming together and finishing this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6500-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE RETURNED TO THE CALENDAR--S. 1054\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I \njust received, as President pro tempore, from the Prime Minister of \nTurkey be printed in the Record. The Prime Minister discusses the \nimportance of the Turkish-U.S. partnership and shares his views \nregarding the recent developments in Iraq. He calls upon ``the \ndistinguished members of the U.S. Congress to work hand-in-hand with \ntheir Turkish colleagues to further strengthen the cooperation and \nsolidarity between our two countries . . .''.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\n\n\n\n                                           Republic of Turkey,\n\n                                            Ankara, April 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     President pro tempore of the Senate, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       I take the liberty of writing you to share my views \n     concerning the recent developments in Iraq and the future of \n     the Turkish-U.S. partnership.\n       Turkey and the United States maintain a partnership. It is \n     a friendship that has withstood the test of time and events \n     for over half a century. This partnership is unique as it is \n     precious and has flourished on its own merits. It is firmly \n     rooted in the common values and interests, and a long history \n     of friendship.\n       When the United States called on our help in the defense of \n     freedom in Korea we were there. Indeed, our forces sustained \n     high casualties to help to liberate this country. We joined \n     forces in NATO since 1952. Turkey was in the frontline in \n     this successful struggle. More recently, we were again on the \n     same side in the Balkans, a region which now enjoys stability \n     and progress. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, Turkey \n     stood firm with the United States in confronting and \n     containing Iraq. When terror struck the United States, we \n     shared the deep grief of the American people and displayed \n     full solidarity. Our partnership has been global in reach, \n     covering the Middle East, Somalia, Bosnia Herzegovina, \n     Kosovo, Macedonia, Afghanistan, as well as the Caucasus and \n     Central Asia, where we are involved in contributing to \n     democracy, peace and stability. The solidarity between the \n     U.S. and Turkey, the only western democracy in the Muslim \n     world, has reassured the world that a global clash of \n     civilizations will remain an unfulfilled prophecy. Had there \n     been no such partnership between Turkey and the United \n     States, both our countries would now be striving to establish \n     it. Instead, we have a history of partnership that warrants \n     even better days.\n       This brings me to the current question of Iraq, which has \n     created certain sensitivity. I should stress two fundamental \n     points in a bid to set the record straight.\n       The first point refers to an injustice sometimes done in \n     assessing Turkey's support in the war. Turkey has a vibrant \n     democracy and the overwhelming majority of the Turkish people \n     is against war. Their reflexes are shaped by the fact that \n     the Iraqi people, including Arabs, Kurds, Turcomans and \n     others will continue to be our neighbors long after the end \n     of military operations. At the same time, the Turkish people \n     have paid untold social and economic costs on account of the \n     last Gulf War. We have suffered economic hardship and had to \n     face hundreds of thousands of refugees from northern Iraq. \n     PKK/KADEK terrorism, which claimed more than thirty thousand \n     lives, was able to breed in such an environment. We cannot \n     afford a replay of those.\n       It was precisely due to the expression of this public \n     anxiety over yet another war that the elected representatives \n     in our parliament could not muster the necessary votes to \n     approve the government decree involving the basing of U.S. \n     troops in Turkey. Nonetheless, in a subsequent vote our \n     parliament did approve extensive overflight rights for the \n     U.S. and coalition forces. Given that Turkey is bordering \n     Iraq, one has to accept that this is not an ordinary but a \n     substantive contribution. Furthermore, cooperation that did \n     not require parliamentary approval was underway even months \n     before the beginning of hostilities and continues to date, in \n     various forms. The relevant U.S. authorities are fully aware \n     of this. We have indeed provided whatever we could.\n       The second point concerns the role wrongly envisaged by \n     some, for Turkey, that is confined to providing a mere \n     geographical launching pad for military operations. Indeed, \n     Turkey's role and the essence of Turkish-U.S. partnership are \n     far more fundamental. Turkey is one of the leading partners \n     of the United States in winning the peace in Iraq and the \n     broader Middle East.\n       At the end of the military operations both Turkey and the \n     U.S. would want to see an Iraq that is whole and free. We \n     have been advocating a transition in Iraq towards a peaceful \n     state, disarmed of weapons of mass destruction, with its \n     territorial integrity intact, and in which all segments of \n     the populations take part in administering their common state \n     and enjoying equitably the benefits of their rich natural \n     resources. This is our joint vision and aspiration.\n       A couple of lessons also can be derived from the recent \n     event. We must exert even greater efforts together to promote \n     the Turkish-U.S. partnership. On her part, Turkey is \n     committed to working with U.S. to take our partnership to new \n     heights. The potential of our strategic partnership is \n     unlimited. From our bilateral political, military and \n     increasingly economic cooperation, to our solidarity in \n     shaping a peaceful and stable state of affairs in our \n     volatile region, and combating the scourge of terrorism, on \n     all these issues the partnership between Turkey and the \n     United States has much to offer.

It is increasingly \napparent that spam is more than a just a nuisance: It has become a \nserious and growing problem that threatens to undermine the vast \npotential of the Internet.\n  America's businesses and America's homes are flooded with millions of \nunwanted, unsolicited e-mails each day. A recent study by Ferris \nResearch estimates that spam costs U.S. firms $8.9 billion annually in \nlost productivity and the need to purchase ever more powerful servers \nand additional bandwidth to try to stay ahead of the spammers; to \nconfigure and run spam filters; and to provide helpdesk support for \nspam recipients. The costs of spam are significant to individuals as \nwell, including time spent identifying and deleting spam, inadvertently \nopening spam, installing and maintaining anti-spam filters, tracking \ndown legitimate messages mistakenly deleted by spam filters, deleting \nspam that is not caught by filters, and paying for Internet Service \nProviders' blocking efforts.\n  In my home state of Vermont, one legislator recently found that two-\nthirds of the 96 e-mails in his inbox were spam. And this occurred \nafter the legislature had installed new spam-blocking software on its \ncomputer system that seemed to be catching 80 percent of the spam. The \nAssistant Attorney General in Vermont was forced to suggest to computer \nusers the following means to avoid these unsolicited commercial e-\nmails: ``It's very bad to reply, even to say don't send anymore. It \ntells the spammer they have a live address. The best thing you can do \nis just keep deleting them. If it gets really bad, you may have to \nchange your address.'' This experience is echoed nationwide. The FTC's \nrecent spam forum underscored the magnitude and complexity of the \nproblem.\n  Twenty-nine States now have anti-spam laws, but the globe-hopping \nnature of e-mail makes these laws difficult to enforce. Technology will \nundoubtedly play a key role in fighting spam, but a technological \nsolution to the problem is not likely in the foreseeable future. ISPs \nblock billions of unwanted e-mails each day, but spammers are winning \nthe battle.\n  In addition, given the speed with which spammers adapt to anti-spam \ntechnologies, the development and dissemination of such technologies is \nnot cheap. Why should businesses and individuals be forced to invest \nlarge amounts of time and money in buying, installing, troubleshooting \nand maintaining new generations of anti-spam technologies?\n  The problems posed by junk e-mail are real, with substantial \nconsequences for Internet users and service providers alike. I am \nworking with other members of the Judiciary Committee, on both sides of \nthe aisle, to arrive at an appropriate solution.\n  I have often said that Congress must exercise great caution when \nregulating in cyberspace. Any legislative solution to spam must tread \ncarefully to ensure that we do not impede or stifle the free flow of \ninformation on the Internet. The United States is the birthplace of the \nInternet, and the whole world watches whenever we decide to regulate \nit. Whenever we choose to intervene in the Internet with government \naction, we must act carefully, prudently, and knowledgeably, keeping in \nmind the implications of what we do and how we do it. And we must not \nforget that spam, like more traditional forms of commercial speech, is \nprotected by the First Amendment.\n  At the same time, we must not allow spam to result in the ``virtual \ndeath''\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\nof the Internet, as one Vermont newspaper put it.\n  The Internet is a valuable asset to our nation, to our economy, and \nto the lives of Americans, and we should act prudently to secure its \ncontinued viability and vitality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6502-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on October 3, \n2001. In Noroco, California, and Arab-American businessman was badly \nbeaten by two men. As the man was closing his store for the evening, \nthe pair entered the store wearing ski masks and shoved the victim to \nthe back of the store. There they beat him and accosted him with racial \nepithets. The men then chained the victim to prevent him from fleeing, \nspray painted his face with black paint, and poured fire starter fluid \non him. The victim eventually lost consciousness after he was \nrepeatedly struck with liter bottles.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6502-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6502-S6503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOMINATION OF JUDGE CONSUELO CALLAHAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been disappointed that the \nRepublican leadership has not found time to proceed to the nomination \nof Judge Consuelo Callahan to the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit. This is another of the judicial nominees that Senate \nDemocrats have strongly supported and whose consideration we had \nexpedited through the Judiciary Committee last week.\n  We still do not know who on the Republican side delayed consideration \nof the consensus nomination of Judge Prado for a month. I thank the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus for its support of that nomination as \nwell as this nomination and for working with the Senate to bringing \nfair evaluation of these nominees and for adding their voice to the \ndiscussion of these lifetime appointments.\n  Just as Senate Democrats cleared the nomination of Judge Edward Prado \nto the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit without delay, so, \ntoo, the nomination of this Hispanic nominee to another circuit court \nwas cleared on the Democratic side last week. All Democratic Senators \nserving on the Judiciary Committee voted to report her nomination \nfavorably. All Democratic Senators indicated that they were eager to \nproceed with her nomination and, after a reasonable period of debate, \nwe voted on her nomination. I am confident this nomination will be \nconfirmed by an extraordinary majority--maybe unanimously.\n  It is most unfortunate that so many partisans in this administration \nand on the other side of the aisle insist on bogging down consensus \nmatters and consensus nominees in order to focus exclusively on the \nmost divisive and controversial of this President's nominees as he \ncontinues his efforts to pack the courts. Democratic Senators have \nworked very hard to cooperate with this administration in order to fill \njudicial vacancies. What the other side seeks to obscure is our effort, \nour fairness and the progress we have been able to achieve without much \nhelp from the other side or the administration.\n  The fact is that when Democrats became the Senate majority in the \nsummer of 2001, we inherited 110 judicial vacancies. Over the next 17 \nmonths, despite constant criticism from the administration, the Senate \nproceeded to confirm 100 of President Bush's nominees, including \nseveral who were divisive and controversial, several who had mixed peer \nreview ratings from the ABA and at least one who had been rated not \nqualified. Despite the additional 40 vacancies that arose, we reduced \njudicial vacancies to 60, a level below that termed ``full employment'' \nby Senator Hatch. Since the beginning of this year, in spite of the \nRepublican's fixation on the President's most controversial \nnominations, we have worked hard to reduce judicial vacancies even \nfurther. As of today, the number of judicial vacancies has been reduced \nto 47 and is the lowest it has been in 13 years. That is lower than at \nany time during the entire 8 years of the Clinton administration. We \nhave already reduced judicial vacancies from 110 to 47, in 2 years. We \nhave reduced the vacancy rate from 12.8 percent to 5.4 percent, the \nlowest it has been in the last two decades. With some cooperation from \nthe administration think of the additional progress we could be making.\n  Earlier this month, we were able to obtain Senate consideration of \nthe nomination of Judge Prado, and another distinguished Hispanic \nnominee who was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last \nmonth--Judge Cecilia Altonaga to be a Federal judge in Florida. We \nexpedited consideration of that nominee at the request of Senator \nGraham of Florida. I am told that she is the first Cuban-American woman \nto be confirmed to the Federal bench. Indeed, Democrats in the Senate \nhave worked to expedite fair consideration of every Latino nominee this \nPresident has made to the Federal trial courts in addition to the \nnominations of Judge Prado and Judge Callahan.\n  Today, I urge the leadership to allow us to consider the nomination \nof Judge Consuelo Maria Callahan to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nUnlike the divisive nomination of Carolyn Kuhl to the same court, both \nhome-State Senators support the nomination of Judge Callahan. Rather \nthan disregarding time-honored rules and Senate practices, I urge my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle to help us fill more judicial \nvacancies more quickly by bringing those nominations that have \nbipartisan support, like Judge Callahan, to the front of the line for \ncommittee hearings and floor votes.\n  As I have noted throughout the last 2 years, the Senate is able to \nmove expeditiously when we have consensus, mainstream nominees to \nconsider. In a recent column, David Broder noted that he asked Alberto \nGonzales if there was a lesson in Judge Prado's easy approval, but that \nMr. Gonzales missed the point. In Mr. Broder's mind: ``The lesson seems \nobvious. Conservatives can be confirmed for the courts when they are \nwell known in their communities and a broad range of their constituents \nhave reason to think them fair-minded.'' Judge Consuelo Callahan is \nanother such nominee.\n  To date the Senate has proceeded to confirm 124 of President Bush's \nnominees, 100 in the 17 months in which Democrats comprised the Senate \nmajority. The lesson that less controversial nominees are considered \nand confirmed more easily was the lesson of the last 2 years, but that \nlesson has been lost on this White House and the current Senate \nleadership.\n  Unfortunately, far too many of this President's nominees raise \nserious concerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties \non all issues. Those types of nominees should not be rushed through the \nprocess. I regret the administration's refusal to work with us to end \nthe impasse it has created in connection with the Estrada nomination. \nThe partisan politics of division that the administration is practicing \nwith respect to that nomination are not helpful and not respectful of \nthe damage done to the Hispanic community by insisting on so divisive a \nnominee.\n  I invite the President to work with us and to nominate more \nmainstream individuals like Judge Prado and Judge Callahan whose proven \nrecords and bipartisan support make it easier for us to uphold our \nconstitutional duty of advise and consent. I look forward to casting a \nvote in favor of her confirmation to the Circuit Court.\n  In connection with the unexplained Republican delay before \nconsideration of the nomination of Judge Prado, some suggested that \nJudge Prado had been delayed because Democratic Senators were likely to \nvote for him and thereby undercut the Republican's shameless charge \nthat opposition to\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\nMiguel Estrada is based on his ethnicity.\n  We all know that the White House could have cooperated with the \nSenate by producing Mr. Estrada's work papers. This would have enabled \nthe Senate to have voted on the Estrada nomination months ago. The \nrequest for his work papers was sent last May 15 and has been \noutstanding for a year. Rather than respond as every other \nadministration has over the last 20 years and provide access to those \npapers, this White House has stonewalled. Rather than follow the policy \nof openness outlined by Attorney General Robert Jackson in the 1940s, \nthis administration has stonewalled. And Republican Senators and other \npartisans could not wait to claim that the impasse created by the White \nHouse's change in policy and practice with respect to nominations was \nsomehow attributable to Democrats being anti-Hispanic. The charge would \nbe laughable if it were not so calculated to do political damage and to \ndivide the Hispanic community. That is what Republican partisans hope \nis the result. That is wrong.\n  Unfortunately, in the case of Mr. Estrada, the administration has \nmade no effort to work with us to resolve the impasse. Instead, there \nhas been a series of votes on cloture petitions in which the opposition \nhas grown and from time to time the support has waned. Recently, there \nhave been press reports indicating that Mr. Estrada asked the White \nHouse months ago to withdraw his nomination. I understand his \nfrustration. If this administration is not going to follow the practice \nof every other administration and share with the Senate the government \nwork papers of the nominee--the very practice this administration \nfollowed with an EPA nominee in 2001--then I can understand him not \nwanting to be used as a political pawn by the administration to score \npartisan, political points. That the administration has not acceded to \nhis reported request but has plowed ahead to force a succession of \nunsuccessful cloture votes and to foment division in our Hispanic \ncommunity for partisan gain is another example of how far this \nadministration is willing to go to politicize the process at the \nexpense of its own nominees.\n  Judge Callahan enjoys the full support of the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus. Not a single person or organization has submitted a letter of \nopposition or raised concerns about her. No controversy. No red flags. \nNo basis for concern. No opposition. This explains why her nomination \nwas voted out of the Judiciary Committee with a unanimous, bipartisan \nvote on an expedited basis.\n  During President Clinton's tenure, 10 of his more than 30 Latino \nnominees, including Judge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Christine \nArguello to the circuit courts, were delayed or blocked from receiving \nhearings or votes by the Republican leadership.\n  Republicans delayed consideration of Judge Richard Paez for over \n1,500 days, and 39 Republicans voted against him. The confirmations of \nLatina circuit nominees Rosemary Barkett and Sonia Sotomayor were also \ndelayed by Republicans. Judge Barkett was targeted for delay and defeat \nby Republicans based on claims about her judicial philosophy, but those \nefforts were not successful. After significant delays and an \nunsuccessful Republican filibuster, 36 Republicans voted against the \nconfirmation of Judge Barkett. Additionally, Judge Sotomayor, who had \nreceived the ABA's highest rating and had been appointed to district \ncourt by President George H.W. Bush, was targeted by Republicans for \ndelay or defeat when she was nominated to the Second Circuit. She was \neventually confirmed, although 29 Republicans voted against her.\n  The fact is that the Latino nominations that the Senate has received \nfrom this administration have been acted upon in a expeditious manner. \nThey have overwhelmingly enjoyed bipartisan support. Under the \nDemocratically-led Senate, we swiftly granted hearings for and \neventually confirmed Judge Christina Armijo of New Mexico, Judge \nPhillip Martinez and Randy Crane of Texas, Judge Jose Martinez of \nFlorida, U.S. Magistrate Judge Alia Ludlum, and Judge Jose Linares of \nNew Jersey to the district courts. This year, we also confirmed Judge \nJames Otero of California, and we would have held his confirmation \nhearing last year if his ABA peer rating had been delivered to us in \ntime for the scheduling of our last hearing. As I have noted, we also \nhave recently confirmed Judge Cecilia Altonaga and Judge Edward Prado \nwith unanimous Democratic support.\n  Judge Callahan's nomination has been delayed on the Senate executive \ncalendar unnecessarily in my view. I recall all too vividly when \nanonymous Republican holds delayed Senate action on the nomination of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit for 7 months. It is time to \nact on this widely supported, uncontroversial Latina nominee. I urge \nthe Senate leadership to bring her nomination up for a vote without \ndelay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6503-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KATIE GROGAN\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, today I recognize Sandy Jerstad \nfor her years of accomplishment as softball coach for the Augustana \nCollege Vikings in Sioux Falls, SD. Earlier this week, Sandy marked the \nend of an era, not only for that institution, but for an entire \ncommunity when she announced her retirement from a 27 year coaching \ncareer.\n  When I think of Sandy, I think of all that she has accomplished and \nhow her perseverance has carried her through both her career and her \npersonal life. That perseverance has been exhibited and intertwined \nbetween her personal and professional life.\n  This perseverance began when she joined the Augustana staff in 1977 \nas head softball coach, tennis coach, and women's administrator. She \nstarted a softball program from scratch. Her coaching career then \nmirrored the implementation of Title IX, a law whose purpose she \ncontinually advocates and represents on a daily basis. Sandy was \nAugustana's first and, until now, only softball coach. The program, and \nits successes, was created with the foundation she built. Augustana's \nsoftball triumphs are evident in the statistics that were earned on the \nfield and continue through the former players, who are now women that \nare leaders in communities all over the country.\n  During those early years Sandy was trying to build a program that \nequaled that of any men's sport with regards to budgets, equipment, \nscholarships, and opportunity for each girl that entered Augustana and \nwanted to participate in collegiate athletics. Her perseverance paid \noff and is evidenced in her teams' success and the increased \nopportunity for women athletes.\n  This season Sandy coached her 1,000th career win, only the second \nNCAA softball coach to achieve this. Following this win, sportswriter \nEric Bursch of the Argus Leader described it well, noting that \nlegendary University of North Carolina Men's Basketball Coach Dean \nSmith only had 879 wins and has the most wins of any coach in NCAA \nMen's Basketball history. This is an amazing feat for any coach, and it \ncame with not only athletic success but with personal success off the \nfield. She will end her coaching career with a 1,011-359-2 record. Her \n1991 team won the NCAA Division II National Championship, as well as a \nsecond place finish in 1993. She coached for 25 straight winning \nseasons. The Vikings have appeared in 16 regional tournaments under the \ndirection of Sandy. For her contributions to the sport of softball, \nSandy was inducted into the National Fastpitch Coaches Association Hall \nof Fame in December 2000. In 1998 she was the South Dakota \nSportswriters Association coach of the year.\n  Even with all of her career accomplishments her resolve has been \nquite evident in her personal life as well. It was exhibited again when \nher husband, Mark, was diagnosed with cancer. Mark fought bravely, but \nsadly, he succumbed to the disease. Sandy stood strongly by his side \nand helped him through his treatment. From her loss she has worked to \nkeep Mark's memory and his work alive not only by speaking of her \nfamily's experience, but also by donating her time and resources to \ncauses on Mark's behalf.\n  She has been an inspiration to her players throughout her tenure and \nthat legacy will continue to live on in each player and especially in \nthose who have chosen to follow in Sandy's coaching footsteps. The \nlegacy will live on with lessons that were learned from their time at \nAugustana.\n  It is an honor for me to share Sandy's accomplishments with my \ncolleagues and to publicly commend her for all she's done for softball, \nwomen's sports, Augustana, and the Sioux Falls Community, and I wish \nher all the best on her future challenges and opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6504-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6504-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6504-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:52 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 192.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1068. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \ngrant programs to provide for education and outreach on newborn \nscreening and coordinated followup care once newborn screening has been \nconducted, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my colleague \nSenator DeWine to introduce legislation to protect the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society: newborn infants. As a first-time dad of a 20-\nmonth old baby girl, I now know the joy of being able to experience \nevery pleasure that comes with being a father. What I also now share \nwith parents everywhere is a constant sense of worry about whether our \nkids are doing well, are feeling well, and are safe. Nothing is of \ngreater importance than the health and well-being of our children.\n  Thanks to incredible advances in medical technology, it is now \npossible to test newborns for more than 30 genetic and metabolic \ndisorders. Many of these disorders, if undetected, would lead to severe \ndisability or death. However, babies that are properly diagnosed and \ntreated can go on to live healthy lives. In the most direct sense, \nnewborn screening saves lives.\n  Frighteningly, the disorders that newborn screening tests for can \ncome without warning. For most of these disorders, there is no medical \nhistory of the condition in the family, no way to predict the health of \na baby based on the health of the parents. Although the disorders that \nare tested for are quite rare, there is a chance that any one newborn \nwill be affected--a sort of morbid lottery. In that sense, this is an \nissue that has a direct impact on the lives of every family.\n  Fortunately, screening has become common practice in every State. \nEach year, over four million infants have blood taken from their heel \nto detect these disorders that could threaten their life and long-term \nhealth. As a result, about one in 4,000 babies is diagnosed with one of \nthese disorders. That means that newborn screening could save \napproximately 1,000 lives each year. That is 1,000 tragedies that can \npossibly be averted--families left with the joy of a new infant rather \nthan absolute heartbreak.\n  That is the good news. However, there is so much more to be done. For \nevery baby saved, another two are estimated to be born with potentially \ndetectable disorders that go undetected because they are not screened. \nThese infants and their families face the prospect of disability or \ndeath from a preventable disorder. Let me repeat that--disability or \ndeath from a preventable disorder. The survival of a newborn may very \nwell come down to the State in which it is born. Only two States, \nincluding my home state of Connecticut thanks to recent legislation, \nwill test for all 30 disorders. While the number of genetic and \nmetabolic disorders screened for varies among different states, the \nvast majority test for eight or fewer.\n  The General Accounting Office, GAO, released a report in March \nhighlighting the need for this legislation. According to the report, \nmost States do not educate parents and health care providers about the \navailability of tests beyond what is mandated by the State. States also \nreported that they do not have the\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\nresources to purchase the technology and train the staff needed to \nexpand newborn screening programs. Finally, even when States do detect \nan abnormal screening result, the majority do not inform parents \ndirectly.\n  Last year, I chaired a hearing on this issue during which I related a \nstory that illustrates the impact of newborn screening, or the lack of \nnewborn screening, in a very personal sense. Jonathan Sweeney is a \nthree-year-old from Brookfield, CT. At the time of his birth, the State \nonly tested for eight disorders. He was considered a healthy baby, \nalthough he was a poor sleeper and needed to be fed quite frequently. \nOne morning in December of 2000, Jonathan's mother, Pamela, found \nJonathan with his eyes wide open but completely unresponsive. He was \nnot breathing and appeared to be having a seizure. Jonathan was rushed \nto the hospital where, fortunately, his life was saved. He was later \ndiagnosed with L-CHAD, a disorder that prevents Jonathan's body from \nturning fat into energy.\n  Despite this harrowing tale, Jonathan and his family are extremely \nfortunate. Jonathan is alive, and his disorder can be treated with a \nspecial diet. He has experienced developmental delays that most likely \ncould have been avoided had he been tested for L-CHAD at birth. This \nraises a question. Why was he not tested? Why do 47 States still not \ntest for L-CHAD?\n  The primary reason for this unfortunate reality is the lack of a \nconsensus on the Federal level about what should be screened for, and \nhow a screening program should be developed. Twenty disorders can only \nbe detected using a costly piece of equipment called a Tandem Mass \nSpectrometer. Currently, only 21 States have this resource.\n  Many health care professionals are unaware of the possibility of \nscreening for disorders beyond what their State requires. Parents, and \nI include myself, are even less well-informed. My daughter Grace was \nborn in Virginia, where they screen for nine disorders. I was extremely \nrelieved when all of those tests came out negative. However, at that \ntime I did not know that this screening was not as complete as it could \nhave been. My ignorance had nothing to do with my love for my daughter \nor my capability as a parent. The fact is that the majority of parents \ndo not realize that this screening occurs at all, nor are they familiar \nwith the disorders that are being screened for. In fact, only one out \nof four States inform parents that they have the option to obtain \ntesting for disorders that are not included on the State's screening \nprogram. For that reason, one of the most important first steps that we \ncan take to protect our children is to educate parents and health care \nprofessionals.\n\n  In the Children's Health Act of 2000, I supported the creation of an \nadvisory committee on newborn screening within the Department of Health \nand Human Services. The purpose of this committee would be to develop \nnational recommendations on screening, hopefully eliminating the \narbitrary disparities between states that currently exist. The \nChildren's Health Act also included a provision to provide funding to \nStates to expand their technological resources for newborn screening. \nUnfortunately, funds were not appropriated for either of these \nprovisions. Senator DeWine and I have led a campaign to secure $25 \nmillion in appropriations needed for this crucial initiative. It is \nunconscionable for us to not do all we can to help prevent children \nfrom dying of treatable disorders.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today, the Newborn Screening \nSaves Lives Act of 2003, seeks to address the shocking lack of \ninformation available to health care professionals and parents about \nnewborn screening. Every parent should have the knowledge necessary to \nprotect their child. The tragedy of a newborn's death is only \ncompounded by the frustration of learning that the death was \npreventable. This bill authorizes $10 million in fiscal year 2004, and \nsuch sums as are necessary through fiscal year 2008, to HRSA for grants \nto provide education and training to health care professionals, State \nlaboratory personnel, families and consumer advocates.\n  Our legislation will also provide States with the resources to \ndevelop programs of follow-up care for those children diagnosed by a \ndisorder detected through newborn screening. While these families are \nthe fortunate ones, in many cases they are still faced with the \nprospect of extended and complex treatment or major lifestyle changes. \nWe need to remember that care does not stop at diagnosis. For that \nreason, this bill authorizes $5 million in fiscal year 2004, and such \nsums as are necessary through FY 2008, to HRSA for grants to develop a \ncoordinated system of follow-up care for newborns and their families \nafter screening and diagnosis.\n  Finally, the bill directs HRSA to assess existing resources for \neducation, training, and follow-up care in the States, ensure \ncoordination, and minimize duplication; and also directs the Secretary \nto provide an evaluation report to Congress two and a half years after \nthe grants are first awarded and then after five years to assess impact \nand effectiveness and make recommendations about future efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important initiative so that \nevery newborn child will have the opportunity for a long, healthy and \nhappy life; and to spare thousands of families from an avoidable \ntragedy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1068\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Newborn Screening Saves \n     Lives Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Currently, it is possible to test for at least 30 \n     disorders through newborn screening.\n       (2) There is a lack of uniform newborn screening throughout \n     the United States. While a newborn with a debilitating \n     condition may receive screening, early detection, and \n     treatment in one location, in another location the condition \n     may go undetected and result in catastrophic consequences.\n       (3) Each year more than 4,000,000 babies are screened to \n     detect conditions that may threaten their long-term health.\n       (4) There are more than 2,000 babies born every year in the \n     United States with detectable and treatable disorders that go \n     unscreened through newborn screening.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       Part Q of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 280h et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 399AA.

Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, to introduce the Newborn Screening Saves \nLives Act of 2003, a bill designed to improve genetic newborn screening \nprograms in this country. Our legislation would provide education \ngrants for physicians and parents, as well as grants to states, to \nimprove follow-up and tracking of those children who receive a positive \nresult from a heelstick screening for metabolic, genetic, infectious, \nor other congenital conditions that threaten their health and well-\nbeing.\n  Each year, newborn screening identifies an estimated 3,000 babies \nwith conditions like sickle cell diseases and homocystinuria that, if \nleft undetected, would otherwise have had dire consequences. But, \ndespite their clear importance, our newborn screening systems are \nfragmented. Quite simply, all children do not have access to the same \ngenetic tests. Where a child is born determines the tests that he or \nshe receives. In my home state of Ohio, we test for 12 disorders, while \nright across the border in Kentucky, they test for only four, and in \nPennsylvania, only six. In Massachusetts, on the other hand, newborns \nare tested for 29 disorders.\n  Compounding this problem, parents often are not sufficiently informed \nof the number of tests available in their individual states and what \nthose tests can help accomplish. Physicians may not know to educate \nparents, or physicians may talk to parents too late in the birthing \nprocess for it to make a difference. Also, state health departments may \nnot follow up adequately with the parents of a child who receives a \npositive test result, and health departments may not have the capacity \nto effectively record or track a large number of positive results.\n  The bill we are introducing today would go a long way toward \nstreamlining the current newborn screening system by offering grants to \nstates to accomplish the following:\n  Build and expand existing procedures and systems to report test \nresults to individuals and families, primary care physicians, and \nspecialists;\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\n  Coordinate ongoing follow-up treatment with individuals, families, \nand primary care physicians after a newborn receives an indication of \nthe presence of a disorder on a screening test;\n  Ensure seamless integration of confirmatory testing, tertiary care, \ngenetic services, including counseling, and access to evolving \ntherapies by participation in approved clinical trials involving the \nprimary health care of the infant; and\n  Analyze collected data to identify populations at high risk, examine \nand respond to health concerns, and recognize and address relevant \nenvironmental, behavioral, socioeconomic, demographic, and other \nfactors.\n  Senator Dodd and I recently requested that the General Accounting \nOffice examine state newborn screening programs. The results of this \nstudy were troubling. The GAO found that many children are not \nreceiving critical, life-saving tests due, in part, to strained state \nbudgets that cannot fund newborn screening initiatives.\n  The grant program established by our bill seeks to help states \nmaintain and expand their newborn screening programs. Our legislation \nwould be a good start toward ensuring that all newborns receive equal \naccess to genetic tests and that their follow-up care, if needed, is \navailable and coordinated. The importance of these screenings cannot be \noverstated. It can mean the difference between life and death for a \nnewborn. And that, Mr. President, is something we must address.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important children's health \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1071. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, through \nthe Bureau of Reclamation, to conduct a feasibility study on a water \nconservation project within the Arch Hurley Conservancy District in the \nState of New Mexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill \nto authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study a proposed water \nconservation project in eastern New Mexico. This project, involving the \nArch Hurley Conservancy District near Tucumcari, NM, could play a \nsignificant role in helping to address the chronic water supply issues \nthat exist in the eastern part of the state.\n  The Conservancy District receives its water supply from Conchas Lake \non the Canadian River, and delivers it through an unlined canal to \nirrigate approximately 41,400 acres of farmland in the area. The \ndistrict has suggested that it might be possible to line its canal, \neliminate a large amount of seepage, and convey a portion of the saved \nwater to address water supply needs in the Pecos River basin. The non-\nconveyed portion of the conserved water would be available to shore up \nthe district's supply in times of drought.\n  While further investigation is warranted to test the feasibility of \nthe proposed project and any issues associated with its implementation, \nthe project does hold significant promise, making this legislation \ntimely. I appreciate the district's leadership in developing this \nproposal which represents a creative effort to improve water management \nand efficiency within New Mexico. If, in the 21st century, we are to \nmaintain the standard of life that we've grown accustomed to in the \narid West, creative solutions to our water supply problems are \nnecessary. This bill is a step in the right direction by encouraging \nefforts to develop, analyze, and ultimately implement those creative \nsolutions. I hope my colleagues will support this modest effort to \naddress New Mexico's water needs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1071\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STUDY AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--Pursuant to reclamation laws, the \n     Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Reclamation, \n     and in consultation and cooperation with the Arch Hurley \n     Conservancy District and the State Engineer in New Mexico, is \n     authorized to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of \n     implementing a water conservation project that will minimize \n     water losses from the irrigation conveyance works of the Arch \n     Hurley Conservancy District, and to consider--\n       (1) options for utilizing any saved water made available \n     from the conservation project including the possible \n     conveyance of such water, in accordance with State law, to \n     the Pecos River basin to address water supply issues in that \n     basin;\n       (2) the impacts that the conservation project could have on \n     the local water supply in and around the Arch Hurley \n     Conservancy District and any appropriate mitigation that may \n     be necessary if the project is implemented; and\n       (3) appropriate cost-sharing options for implementation of \n     the project based on the use and possible allocation of any \n     conserved water.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) Upon completion of the feasibility study authorized by \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall transmit to \n     Congress a report containing the results of the study.\n       (2) In developing the report, the Secretary shall utilize \n     reports or any other relevant information supplied by the \n     Arch Hurley Conservancy District or the State Engineer in New \n     Mexico.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Amount.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     $500,000 to carry out this Act.\n       (b) Cost Share.--\n       (1) The federal share of the costs of the feasibility study \n     shall not exceed 50 percent of the total, except that the \n     Secretary of the Interior is authorized to waive or limit the \n     required non-Federal cost share for the feasibility study if \n     the Secretary determines, based upon a demonstration of \n     financial hardship on the part of the Arch Hurley Conservancy \n     District, that the District is unable to contribute such \n     required share.\n       (2) The Secretary of the Interior may accept as part of the \n     non-Federal cost share the contribution of such in-kind \n     services by the Arch Hurley Conservancy District as the \n     Secretary determines will contribute substantially toward the \n     conduct and completion of the study.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Reid) \n        (by request):\n  S. 1072. A bill to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways, highway \nsafety programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environmental and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, by request, \nPresident Bush's proposed ``Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act of 2003,'' SAFETEA, which reauthorizes the \nFederal-aid surface transportation program. Joining me are Senators \nJeffords and Bond.\n  Although I am not in complete agreement with the President on this \nproposal, I believe the President deserves the courtesy of getting his \nproposal introduced.\n  I do agree with the President's desire to build upon the achievements \nof the Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century, TEA-21, of 1998 \nand the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, ISTEA, of \n1991. In the hearings conducted by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee over the last 12 months, we consistently heard that TEA-21 \nworks.\n  SAFETEA focuses on reducing highway fatalities and injuries, reducing \ncongestion, protecting the environment, increasing funding flexibility \nfor State and local governments, and providing economic stimulus to the \nNation's economy. All very worthy goals. Unfortunately, the funding \nproposed in the President's bill is woefully inadequate.\n  As Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am \nlooking forward to working with the President and my Congressional \ncolleagues to develop a Senate bill that strengthens the national \ntransportation system.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I join my colleagues from the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works in offering, by request, the \nAdministration's recommended legislation to reauthorize the Nation's \nsurface transportation program. I extend this courtesy, in large \nmeasure, out of respect for my long time friend and colleague, \nSecretary of Transportation Norman Mineta.\n  Norm and I served together, and worked together, for many years in \nthe House. Norm is a leader on transportation, an author of many key \naspects of our transportation law.\n  In the 107th Congress, as Chairman of the Committee, I reached out to \nNorm as we began our deliberations on reauthorization. He pledged then \nthat U.S.\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\nDOT would work closely with the Congress, and he kept his word. I \nappreciate his friendship and assistance.\n  The administration's proposal is a mixed bag. Its greatest strength \nis its continuity with its predecessors, ISTEA and TEA-21. These are \nlandmarks in public policy, due in no small measure to the efforts and \nwisdom of Norm, Senator John Chafee, Senator Pat Moynahan and \nCongressman Bud Shuster. The administration package carries that legacy \nforward.\n  Its greatest weakness is its funding levels. The bill sets the right \ntarget with its emphasis on safety, but comes up short on the funding \nto hit that target. It continues programs that have produced better \nroads and stronger bridges in this country, but then fails to provide \nthe dollars to continue this progress. It does less than is needed to \naddress congestion and not enough to expand freight capacity.\n  Under Chairman Inhofe's leadership, we have fought for higher funding \nlevels. We will continue that fight. I will not shortchange the Nation. \nI will not support any legislation that underfunds transportation.\n  The Administration's bill would modify our approach to environmental \nprotection. My record on clean air, clean water and sound planning is \nclear and consistent. I want to strengthen our efforts, and will oppose \nany measure that reduces our vigilance in these areas. Our \ntransportation investments should improve our environment, our air and \nwater quality, should strengthen local economies and enhance our \ncommunities.\n  We will have a robust debate on these matters over the next few \nmonths. I look forward to working with my EPW colleagues, with Chairman \nYoung and Mr. Oberstar in the House and with Secretary Mineta to renew \nour surface transportation program for a strong America.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues from the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee in introducing the \nadministration's bill by request. I do so largely because of my \nfriendship with and respect for Secretary of Transportation Norman \nMineta, whom I served with in my days in the House of Representatives.\n  I have always been a proponent of infrastructure spending and the \neconomic stimulus and jobs that it creates. For every billion dollars \nwe spend on our Nation's surface transportation infrastructure, we \ncreate over 47,000 well-paid skilled jobs. Reauthorizing our Nation's \nsurface transportation laws represents a tremendous opportunity for us \nto impact our economy in a meaningful, lasting way. Unfortunately, the \nadministration's reauthorization proposal does not take full advantage \nof this opportunity.\n  While the bill continues the spirit of its predecessors, ISTEA and \nTEA-21, the bill is woefully underfunded. The bill correctly places \nadded emphasis on important topics such as safety, but then lacks the \nfunding to make a real and substantial impact in these areas.\n  The administration's bill also would modify certain environmental \nprovisions and project permitting requirements. TEA-21 and its \npredecessor, ISTEA, proved we can advance our national transportation \ngoals while preserving our environment. I will not support any \nprovision that undermines essential environmental protections I have \nspent 20 years in public office trying to preserve. We can increase \ninvestment in and improve our Nation's surface transportation system in \na timely, thoughtful, and effective way without jeopardizing the \nenvironment.\n  I look forward to the coming reauthorization debate and to working \nwith my colleagues and Secretary Mineta on this most important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1074. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance \nburial benefits for veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I am introducing today to ensure that veterans across the \nNation have access to burial in national and State cemeteries. This \nlegislation will put in place a comprehensive strategy for addressing \nwhat has, and will continue to be, a national priority: providing \nlasting memorials to our veterans.\n  Four principles guide this legislation: First, areas with large \nveterans' populations merit a national cemetery. Second, State cemetery \ngrant funding should encourage the development of State cemeteries to \nserve areas with smaller veterans' populations. Third, State or \nnational cemeteries should be located within reasonable distances of \nwhere veterans lived before death and, presumably, where their families \nstill live. And finally, we need creative ways to finance the \nmaintenance, repair and operational needs of national cemeteries.\n  This bill sets out clear criteria, based on objective measures of \nneed, that will serve as a guide for future national cemetery \nconstruction. It encourages States to participate in the State cemetery \ngrant program by permitting State cemeteries to receive plot allowance \nmoney to defray burial expenses for all--not just poor, disabled and \nwartime--veterans. Lastly, the legislation authorizes VA's National \nCemetery Administration, NCA, to enter into lease agreements with \npublic or non-profit organizations who wish to use unused or \nunderutilized land and facilities, and permits proceeds from lease \nagreements to remain with NCA to augment its operational and cemetery \nmaintenance needs.\n  Burial in a national cemetery--a perpetual tribute to a veteran's \nservice to the country--is one of the most important benefits we, as a \nNation, can provide to veterans and their families. It must be \navailable to veterans, and their families, within reasonable distances \nto their homes. This legislation would require the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to establish a national cemetery at sites more than 50 \nmiles away from an open national or State veterans cemetery where \n170,000 or more veterans reside. The adoption of this criterion would \nassure adequate national access to national cemeteries and would \nrequire the opening of approximately five new national cemeteries.\n  Because it is not practical to build national cemeteries to meet the \nburial needs of every veteran--particularly veterans in more sparsely \npopulated areas--it is important that VA cooperate with the States \nthrough administration of its State cemetery grant program, to meet \nneeds in areas where there are smaller veterans' populations. These \ngrants provide up to 100 percent of the costs associated with building, \nmaking large repairs at, and expanding State veterans cemeteries. In \naddition, States are also provided a $300 plot allowance, payable by VA \nto assist in offsetting maintenance costs, for each poor, disabled, or \nwartime veteran who is interred in a State cemetery. If, as this \nlegislation would specify, the plot allowance were to be payable for \nburial of all veterans--not just poor, disabled and wartime veterans--\nStates would be provided with additional maintenance income and further \nincentive to establish additional State veterans' cemeteries. Clearly, \nencouraging the construction of additional State cemeteries is a good \nway to complement VA's National cemetery capacity within the context of \na nationwide, comprehensive strategy to meet veterans' burial needs.\n  Finally, my legislation proposes a creative way for NCA to fund \nadditional maintenance projects at national cemeteries. It would \nauthorize the Secretary to lease undeveloped, unused or underutilized \nacreage and buildings on NCA lands, and to retain the proceeds from the \nleases. VA has indicated that portions of many national cemeteries are \nnot suitable for burials due to, for example, rocky or hilly terrain. \nSuch sites, however, might have commercial uses. In addition, there are \nhistoric lodges and other buildings on VA lands that, if available for \nuse, could generate revenue. Allowing NCA to utilize these resources to \ngenerate revenue would provide VA with an opportunity to put a small \ndent in the $245 million worth of repairs it needs to undertake to \nbring the national cemeteries up to appropriate memorial standards. \nThis sort of leasing authority is already extended to VA's hospital \nsystem, and it has been successfully utilized on VA's medical campuses. \nAn extension of this authority to VA cemetery facilities is wholly \nreasonable.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support of this bill. I reiterate, \nmeeting the burial needs of veterans is a national\n\n[[Page S6514]]\n\npriority. It is a powerful reflection of the value we place on military \nservice. And it is an unmistakable message we send to all Americans \nthat service to our country will forever be remembered.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1074\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 144\n\n       Whereas paragraph 1 of Article 1 of the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the United \n     States is a party, recognizes that all peoples have the right \n     of self-determination;\n       Whereas Kosova was constitutionally defined as an \n     autonomous region in the First National Liberation Conference \n     for Kosova on January 2, 1944, this status was confirmed in \n     the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia adopted in 1946, and the autonomous status of \n     Kosova was preserved in the amended Yugoslav Constitution \n     adopted in 1974;\n       Whereas prior to the disintegration of the former \n     Yugoslavia, the autonomous region of Kosova constituted a \n     political and legal entity with its own distinct financial \n     institutions, police force, municipal government, school \n     system, judicial and legal system, hospitals, and other \n     organizations;\n       Whereas, in 1987, Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic rose \n     to power in Yugoslavia on a platform of ultranationalism and \n     anti-Albanian racism, advocating violence and hatred against \n     all non-Slavic peoples and specifically targeting the ethnic \n     Albanians of Kosova;\n       Whereas Slobodan Milosevic subsequently stripped Kosova of \n     its political autonomy without the consent of the people of \n     Kosova;\n       Whereas the elected Assembly of Kosova, faced with this \n     illegal act, adopted a Declaration of Independence on July 2, \n     1990, proclaimed a Republic of Kosova, and adopted a \n     constitution on September 7, 1990, based on the \n     internationally accepted principles of self-determination, \n     equality, and sovereignty;\n       Whereas in recognition of the de facto dissolution of the \n     Yugoslav federation, the European Community established \n     principles for the recognition of the independence and \n     sovereignty of the republics of the former Socialist Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas a popular referendum was held in Kosova from \n     September 26 to 30, 1991, in which 87 percent of all eligible \n     voters cast ballots and 99.87 percent voted in favor of \n     declaring Kosova independent of the Socialist Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas, during the occupation of Kosova, which began in \n     1989 and ended with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) military action against the regime of Slobodan \n     Milosevic in 1999, the ethnic Albanians of Kosova were \n     subjected to brutal treatment by the occupying forces, and \n     approximately 400,000 ethnic Albanians were forced to flee to \n     Western Europe and the United States;\n       Whereas in the spring of 1999 almost 1,000,000 ethnic \n     Albanians were driven out of Kosova and at least 10,000 were \n     murdered by Serbian paramilitary and military forces;\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\n       Whereas Slobodan Milosevic was indicted by the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and \n     extradited to The Hague in June 2001, to stand trial for war \n     crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in Kosova, \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia;\n       Whereas on June 10, 1999, United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1244 mandated an international civil presence in \n     Kosova, ending the decade-long Serbian occupation of Kosova \n     and Milosevic's genocidal war there;\n       Whereas the people of Kosova, including ethnic Albanians, \n     Serbs, Turks, Roma, Bosniaks, Goranis, and Ashkalis, held \n     free and fair municipal elections in 2000 and 2002 and a \n     general election in 2001 to elect a Parliament, which in turn \n     selected a President and Prime Minister in 2002;\n       Whereas, with 50 percent of the population in Kosova being \n     under the age of 25, and the unemployment rate currently \n     being between 60 and 70 percent, there is an increasing \n     likelihood of young people entering criminal networks, or \n     working abroad in order to survive unless massive job \n     creation is facilitated by guaranteeing the security of \n     foreign investments through the establishment of the rule of \n     law and functioning institutions in Kosova;\n       Whereas for the first time since the end of the conflict, \n     refugees from ethnic minority communities in Kosova have \n     started to return to their homes in substantial numbers, \n     although those refugees are still a small fraction of the \n     number of people that left in 1999;\n       Whereas most ethnic Albanian elected authorities in Kosova \n     recognize that substantial efforts toward reconciliation with \n     ethnic minorities are needed for the long-term security and \n     participation in government institutions of all citizens of \n     Kosova;\n       Whereas leaders of the Kosova Parliament have publicly \n     committed to developing a western-style democracy in which \n     all citizens, regardless of ethnicity, are granted full human \n     and civil rights and are committed to the return of all \n     refugees, whatever their ethnicity, who fled Kosova during \n     and after the conflict;\n       Whereas Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic of Serbia \n     called for the return of Serbian forces to Kosova and for \n     talks on the status of the province;\n       Whereas, on February 25, 2003, representatives of a Serbian \n     minority coalition in the Kosova Parliament called for the \n     establishment of a Serbian Union in northern Kosova;\n       Whereas the international community has made clear that it \n     will support neither monoethnic government institutions, nor \n     the partition of Kosova;\n       Whereas the tragic assassination in Belgrade of Serbian \n     Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic on March 12, 2003, underscored \n     that criminal nationalist elements remain a destabilizing \n     factor in the region and an obstacle to reform efforts;\n       Whereas the Special Representative of the United Nations \n     Secretary General in Kosova has initiated a dialogue between \n     the authorities in Belgrade and in Pristina on issues of \n     practical concern;\n       Whereas the Serbian Government on April 17, 2003, declared \n     as ``unacceptable'' the plan put forward by the Special \n     Representative to devolve powers to the elected officials in \n     Kosova;\n       Whereas following his address to the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe Permanent Council on May \n     8, 2003, the Special Representative of the United Nations \n     Secretary General stated that ``Kosovo Albanians are being \n     more assertive about competencies and status issues while at \n     the same time Kosovo Serbs are concentrating on developing \n     monoethnic structures'';\n       Whereas Deputy Prime Minister Covic on May 9, 2003, again \n     dismissed the assessment that the time has come to begin to \n     discuss the final status of Kosova;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 \n     stated that the main responsibilities of the international \n     civil presence in Kosova include facilitating a political \n     process designed to determine Kosova's future status and, in \n     the final stage, overseeing the transfer of authority from \n     Kosova's provisional institutions to institutions established \n     under a political settlement; and\n       Whereas the only viable option for the future of Kosova is \n     one that reflects both the needs and aspirations of its \n     entire population: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States should--\n       (1) recognize the danger that an unnecessary delay in the \n     resolution of Kosova's final status would pose for the \n     political and economic viability of Kosova and the stability \n     of Southeast Europe;\n       (2) publicly support the goal of a democratic government in \n     Kosova in which human rights, including the rights of ethnic \n     and religious minorities, are respected;\n       (3) to achieve that goal, call for holding a referendum, \n     under international supervision, on the future status of \n     Kosova, once Kosova has made further progress in developing \n     institutions of democratic self-government, establishing the \n     rule of law, facilitating the return and reintegration of \n     refugees into local communities, and protecting ethnic \n     minorities, in accordance with the benchmarks established by \n     the United Nations;\n       (4) work in conjunction with the United Nations, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and \n     other international organizations to assist Kosova to meet \n     the United Nations benchmarks that are the necessary \n     conditions for holding a referendum on the future status of \n     Kosova and to facilitate the implementation of the form of \n     government determined by the people of Kosova; and\n       (5) continue to provide assistance, trade, and other \n     programs to encourage the further development of democracy \n     and a free market economic system in Kosova.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a Resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the United States should \ndeclare its support for the right of the people of Kosova to determine \ntheir political future, once Kosova has made requisite progress, as \ndefined by United Nations benchmarks, in developing democratic \ninstitutions and human rights protections.\n  In order to put my Resolution into the proper context, I would like \nbriefly to discuss current conditions in the successor states of the \nformer Yugoslavia, an area which has consumed a great deal of my \nattention for the last decade.\n  Much progress has been made in this former region of conflict since \nthe fall of Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 2001 and the \nsubsequent final dissolution of the Yugoslav federation. Slovenia has \nbeen invited to join NATO, and last week this body unanimously ratified \nthe accession to NATO of Slovenia and six other candidate countries. \nSlovenia has also been invited to join the European Union next year.\n  Two other Yugoslav successor states--Croatia and the former Yugoslav \nRepublic of Macedonia--have joined Albania in signing the U.S.-Adriatic \nCharter to cooperatively advance their candidacies for NATO membership. \nBoth Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have also \nsigned EU Stabilization and Association agreements.\n  In Macedonia, although tensions that threatened full-scale conflict \njust two years ago remain, the newly elected coalition government is \nworking to implement fully the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001, and \nthe European Union assumed command of peacekeeping operations from NATO \non March 31, 2003.\n  SFOR, the NATO-led international force, continues to maintain \nstability in Bosnia and Herzegovina in significantly smaller numbers \nthan its original contingent. There is serious discussion about turning \nover command of the operation to the European Union, a move about which \nI have some reservations. The European Union Police Mission assumed \ninternational police monitoring duties in Bosnia and Herzegovina from \nthe UN on January 1, 2003. The High Representative in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, Paddy Ashdown, continues to oversee reform efforts and has \nthe rightly placed special emphasis on strengthening the rule of law.\n  Serbia and Montenegro, under pressure from the EU, agreed to a \nconstitutional charter that would keep them loosely united for the next \nthree years, formally ending the entity of the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia and setting them on a long-term path toward EU membership. \nNonetheless, last week Filip Vujanovic, an advocate of Montenegrin \nindependence, won a sweeping victory in the presidential elections. The \nrunner-up candidate also advocated independence, as does Montenegro's \nprime minister Milo Djukanovic.\n  Despite this considerable progress, as a distinguished task force \nassembled by the Council on Foreign Relations noted in its ``Balkans \n2010'' report of December 2002, the goal of regional stability and the \npromises of democratic transition are not yet fulfilled.\n  ``There is still a risk of backsliding in the region: the security \nsituation in Macedonia remains tenuous; the coalition government in \nSerbia is irretrievably splintered; and in Kosovo all the political \nparties are organized around ethnic objectives and pander to \nnationalist sentiment. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, meanwhile, the \nelections in October 2002--which resulted in presidential victories for \nthe three main nationalist parties at the expense of their moderate \ncompetitors--demonstrated that nationalist feelings remain potent. One \nreason for these trends is the increasing discontent of local \npopulations whose embrace of the West has failed to bring immediate \nimprovements in their standard of living\n\n[[Page S6516]]\n\n. . . Irredentist, criminal and anti-democratic forces will try to \nexploit people's frustration brought on by the difficulties inherent in \ntransitions.''\n  Following the tragic assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindic on \nMarch 12, 2003, the government of Serbia launched a major crackdown on \ncriminal elements and initiated much-needed defense reforms to enhance \ncivilian control over the military. Serbian officials took an important \nand overdue step by handing over to UN representative in Kosova the \nremains of 37 ethnic Albanians believed to have been killed during \nMilosevic's 1998-1999 campaign.\n  Serbia must continue to step up its cooperation with the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, ICTY. The \nsingle most significant move the Serbian government could make to prove \nits commitment to joining the West is to arrest former Bosnian Serb \nGeneral Ratko Mladic and send him to The Hague. But there are other \nimportant measures, such as opening archives and turning over requested \ndocuments to the prosecution, that Serbia must take in order to meet \nits international obligations.\n  Now, I would like to turn to Kosova, the subject of my resolution. \nSince the end of hostilities four years ago, the peace has been kept by \nKFOR, an international peacekeeping force in which United States forces \nplay a kept role and have responsibility for the southeastern sector of \nthe province.\n  Last year for the first time since the 1999 conflict, refugee returns \noutnumbered departures, with around 2,700 refugees returning to the \nprovince. UN officials predict that the numbers will increase in 2003, \nand the United States has committed more than $14 million this fiscal \nyear to that end. The Housing and Property Directorate has resolved \nnearly 2,000 property claims to date and estimates that it will have \nresolved 9,000 cases by the end of 2003--about one-third of all claims \nfiled.\n  The Kosovo Protection Corps, the local gendarmerie, is gradually \nbecoming more representative of the ethics diversity in Kosova and more \nskillful in its policing operations. Crime, and particularly inter-\nethnic crime, has been significant reduced, and murders decreased in \n2002 by 50 percent over the previous year. The province held elections \nthree times in the past three years, twice for municipal seats and once \nto select assembly representatives, and in each case OSCE monitors \ndeemed the elections generally free and fair.\n  Yet much remains to be done. The refugee returns of last year \nrepresent only a small fraction of the approximately 237,000 Kosova \nrefugees currently in Serbia, Macedonia, and Albania. Moreover, there \nare 22,500 internally displaced persons within Kosova who, for various \nreasons, including loss of property, economic shortage, and fear of \nretribution or persecution, have been unable or unwilling to return to \ntheir homes. Many who have returned also fear for their security, are \nunable to secure employment, and have little or no access to social and \neconomic opportunities. Formal unemployment hovers around 50 percent. \nWithout the ability to sustain themselves and provide for their \nfamilies, many young Kosovars have turned to criminal activity. And \nKosova continues to provide a haven for traffickers and other criminals \nactive throughout the Balkans.\n\n  The head of the UN administration, UNMIK, an experienced German \ndiplomat named Michael Steiner, has established ``benchmarks'' to focus \nthe agenda of Kosova's elected officials pursuant to fulfilling the \nmandate of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 for progress toward \nself-administration. These benchmarks include: the existence of \neffective, representative, and functioning institutions; the \nenforcement of the rule of law; freedom of movement; respect for the \nright of all Kosovars to remain and return; the development of a sound \nbasis for a market economy; clarity of property title; normalized \ndialogue with Belgrade; and reduction and transformation of the Kosovo \nProtection Corps in line with its mandate.\n  The UN policy of ``standards before status'' is conceptually sound. \nOf course, real progress requires resources, and, unfortunately, the \ninternational community has not met all of its pledge commitments, and \nprivate investment until now has been sparse.\n  Some argue that foreign capital is hesitant to invest in Kosova as \nlong as its future political status remains undefined. This line, \nhowever, confuses cause and effect. The reason that Kosova's final \nstatus remains in limbo is because conditions on the ground there do \nnot yet allow the international community to allow a final status to be \nchosen.\n  To be sure, there have been serious attempts to move the process \nalong. Mr. Steiner has initiated a dialogue between Pristina and \nBelgrade on technical issues and has begun the process of devolving \nmany responsibilities onto Kosova's elected Assembly.\n  Sad to say, both ethnic Albanians and Serbs have undercut these \nefforts by focusing on final status, rather than on practical progress. \nEthnic Albanian representatives in the Kosova Assembly have twice tried \nto pass a resolution calling for independence but were dissuaded by \nofficials from the UN and the international community who rightly fear \nthat such a move would only increase tensions in the region. Kosovar \nPresident Ibrahim Rugova has publicly ruled out any dialogue with \nBelgrade officials on future status.\n  The Serbs for their part, have been equally obdurate. Earlier this \nyear, leading Serbian officials made aggressive statements regarding \nKosova, including calling on the international community to take up the \nfinal status issue and demanding that Serb army forces be allowed to \nreturn there. I scarcely need comment that the latter demand is a total \nnon-starter.\n  The UN Secretary General's report of April 14, 2003, noted that \nBelgrade continues to support parallel administrative structures in \nvirtually all of municipalities that have a considerable Serb \npopulation in direct violation of UN Security Council 1244. Following a \nmeeting with Kosovar Serb leaders on April 16, 2003, Serbian Prime \nMinister Zivkovic and Deputy Prime Minister Covic issued a statement \ncalling the UN plan to devolve considerable powers to the \ndemocratically elected officials in Kosova ``unacceptable,'' and the \ngovernment in Belgrade is reportedly setting up a Serbian state council \nto deal with administrative issues in the ethnic Serb communities in \nKosova.\n  So what should we do? there are some who believe we should throw in \nthe towel and declare support for one side or the other. I believe that \nthose who would call for the United States to support either \nindependence for Kosova, or reintegration of Kosova with Serbia, are \nprescribing a cure worse that the disease, however noble their \nintentions.\n  When in doubt it is always wise to fall back upon basic principles. \nIn this case, the basic principle of democracy is self-determination. \nAnd self-determination can best be expressed through a referendum, but \nonly after the local Kosova authorities, with the help of the \ninternational community, fulfill the United Nations benchmarks.\n  Let me be perfectly clear about the practical side of the issue. The \ndemographics of Kosova, and the pro-independence stand of all the \nethnic Albanian political leaders and parties there, make a future vote \nfor independence nearly inevitable. If that is the will of the people \nof Kosova when conditions warrant their making a choice, then I will \nwholeheartedly support it.\n  But no rationale of catering to immediate economic expediency \noutweighs the damage a unilateral declaration of independence, or \nCongressional support thereof, would do to the international regime in \nKosova--especially to the credibility of the United Nations Mission \nthere--or to the promising, but fragile crackdown on criminal elements \nby the new Zivkovic government in Serbia.\n  The stakes of Balkan stability are simple too high to put the cart \nbefore the horse.\n  In order to meet the UN benchmarks, the leaders of Kosova from all \nethnic communities must accelerate the process of building a fully \nfunctioning democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law. \nAgreeing to a process for settling the status issue will give them the \npolitical incentive and procedural basis to do so.\n  The Sense of the Senate resolution I have proposed recognizes the \ndanger that an unnecessary delay in resolution of Kosova's final status \nwould pose. But it also recognizes that the\n\n[[Page S6517]]\n\nprecondition for resolving the final status issue through self-\ndetermination is a democratic government in Kosova in which human \nrights, including the rights of religious and ethnic minorities, are \nrespected.\n  Therefore, the Resolution calls for holding a referendum on final \nstatus, once requisite progress has been made toward meeting the UN \nbenchmarks, endorses continued cooperation with other international \norganizations, and supports continued U.S. economic assistance to \nencourage further development.\n  Rebuilding a society shattered by a vicious war is a frustrating, \ntime-consuming effort. There is an undeniable temptation to heed the \nsiren song of a declaration of independence. But short-term \ngratification usually leads to more severe long-term problems, and the \ncase of Kosova is no exception. The international cooperative efforts \nof KFOR, the UN, the OSCE, and various other governmental and non-\ngovernmental bodies are making slow but steady progress. We should \ncontinue down this path, which is precisely what my Resolution \nadvocates.\n  I hope other members will join me in supporting the people of Kosova \nin their efforts, through concrete political and social progress, to \nadvance a decision on their final political status.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/15/senate-section/article/S6517-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6517-S6518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 623.

POLICY TO INCREASE FUNDING TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS AND \n                   FOR OTHER INTERNATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--(1) The National Security Strategy of the \n     United States, dated September 17, 2002, states that ``[t]he \n     scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is \n     enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics . \n     . . growth and development will be threatened until these \n     scourges can be contained.''\n       (2) The United States Agency for International Development \n     concluded that ``Global health issues have global \n     consequences that not only affect the people of developing \n     nations but also directly affect the interests of American \n     citizens.''\n       (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     concluded that ``[i]n today's global environment, new \n     diseases have the potential to spread across the world in a \n     matter of days, or even hours, making early detection and \n     action more important than ever.''\n       (4) The President's Fiscal Year 2004 budget request for the \n     Child Survival and Health Programs Fund, which is the \n     principle source of funds for building public health capacity \n     in developing countries, would cut the Fund by $124,313,000 \n     (not including programs to combat HIV/AIDS which are cut by \n     an additional $86,030,000) below the Fiscal Year 2003 enacted \n     level.\n       (5) Within the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund, the \n     President's Fiscal Year 2004 budget request would cut funding \n     to protect vulnerable children by 63%; to combat infectious \n     diseases (other than HIV/AIDS) by 32%; to improve child \n     nutrition and maternal health by 12%; and to support family \n     planning and reproductive health by 5%.\n       (6) These programs save the lives of millions of women and \n     children each year, help prevent dangerous infectious \n     diseases from spreading to the United States, build goodwill \n     towards the United States, and alleviate conditions that can \n     contribute to international terrorism.\n       (7) Building public health capacity in developing countries \n     by improving children's health, material and reproductive \n     health, and combating other infectious diseases is an \n     essential component of an effective global strategy to \n     control the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n       (b) Policy.--For each of the Fiscal Years 2004 through \n     2008, the President should request and the Congress should \n     appropriate $3,000,000,000 to carry out this Act and an \n     amount that exceeds the amount appropriated in the previous \n     fiscal year for the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund, \n     including for programs to protect vulnerable children, to \n     combat other infectious diseases, to improve disease \n     surveillance and combat drug resistance, to improve child \n     nutrition and maternal health, and to support family planning \n     and reproductive health.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 678.

The Protocol of 1997, which would add Annex VI, Regulations \nfor the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships, to the International \nConvention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as \nModified by the Protocol of 1978 (hereinafter the ``MARPOL \nConvention''), was signed by the United States on December 22, 1998. I \nalso enclose, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State and its attached analysis of the Protocol of 1997, \nas well as Resolution 2 of the 1997 MARPOL Conference with its annexed \nTechnical Code on Control of Emission of Nitrogen Oxides from Marine \nDiesel Engines.\n  The MARPOL Convention is the global agreement to control pollution \nfrom ships. MARPOL Annex VI regulates the emission into the atmosphere \nof specified pollutants from ships. It complements the other annexes to \nthe MARPOL Convention, which relate to the transport of oil (Annex I), \nharmful substances carried in bulk (Annex II), harmful substances in \npackaged form (Annex III), ship-generated sewage (Annex IV) and garbage \n(Annex V). The United States is a party to all of these annexes with \nthe exception of Annex IV.\n  MARPOL Annex VI regulates the prevention of air pollution from ships \nby limiting the discharge of nitrogen oxides from large marine diesel \nengines, governing the sulfur content of marine diesel fuel, \nprohibiting the emission of ozone-depleting substances, regulating the \nemission of volatile organic compounds during the transfer of cargoes \nbetween tankers and terminals, setting standards for shipboard \nincinerators and fuel oil quality, and establishing requirements for \nplatforms and drilling rigs at sea.\n  MARPOL Annex VI is an important step toward controlling and \npreventing emissions of harmful air pollutants from ships. U.S. \nratification of the Protocol of 1997 will demonstrate U.S. commitment \nto an international solution and should hasten the entry into force of \nthe Protocol of 1997. Ratification will also enhance our ability to \nwork within the treaty framework to obtain subsequent amendments that \nwill require further reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides that \nare now achievable through the use of modern control technologies which \nthe United States strongly supports.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Protocol of 1997 and give its advice and consent to ratification, \nsubject to the declarations and understanding set out in the \naccompanying report of the Secretary of State.\n                                                        George W.
