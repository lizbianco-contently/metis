Mr. President, at the request of the majority leader, I \nhave been asked to announce that this afternoon there will be a period \nof morning business until 2 p.m. It had been the majority leader's \nhope, and the desire of many Members on this side of the aisle, to \nbegin consideration of the Healthy Forests issue during today's \nsession. Unfortunately, there is an objection on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle.\n  Given that objection, it had been the intent of the leader to begin \nconsideration of the class action fairness legislation. Again, there \nwas an objection to proceeding to that measure on Friday; and, \ntherefore, a motion to proceed was made by the majority leader.\n  Today, at 2 p.m., the Senate will resume debate on the motion to \nproceed to the class action bill. Members are expected to come to the \nfloor throughout the day to speak on this motion. If we are unable to \nproceed on the bill today, it may be necessary to file a cloture motion \non that pending motion to proceed.\n  Under a previous order, at 5:15 today, the Senate will vote on the \nconfirmation of Margaret Catharine Rodgers to be a U.S. district judge \nfor the Northern District of Florida.

Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in \nconsultation with the minority leader, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 1904, the Healthy Forests bill, under the \nfollowing limitations: that the following first-degree amendments be \nthe only amendments in order, and that any listed first-degree \namendments be subject to second-degree amendments which must be \nrelevant to the first degree to which offered: managers' amendment; \nLeahy-Boxer, buyback provisions; Bingaman-Leahy-Boxer, appeals process; \nBingaman-Leahy-Boxer, wildland-urban interface; Bingaman-Leahy-Boxer, \nNEPA; Boxer-Leahy-Cantwell-Murray, additional area exclusion; Campbell-\nInouye, tribal lands and hazardous fuels; Collins-Snowe, suburban \nsprawl; Kyl, wildfire research institutes; Kyl, wildland-urban \ninterface; Leahy-Boxer judicial review; Smith, land grant universities; \nand Ensign, animals.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of \nthese amendments, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate proceed \nto a vote on passage, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, this is \nbringing a bill up that has some problems in that this matter has not \ngone before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, at least as far \nas Senator Bingaman is concerned. I have spoken to him on a couple of \noccasions, and he has not been given any degree of consideration as to \nwhat this final piece of legislation is that is now coming before the \nSenate.\n  Additionally, a bill such as this should be brought to the Senate \nfloor and debated like all bills are debated. I do not have a position \non this piece of legislation at this time. Personally, I have not read \nit. I do not know if it is good or bad. But, for the reasons I have \nannounced, in addition to the fact that a number of Senators on this \nside have some problems, I object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on July 24, the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry reported to the Senate H.R. 1904, the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act.\n  This bill reflects a comprehensive effort to improve forest health on \nboth public and private lands. The bill provides Federal land managers \nthe tools\n\n[[Page S12860]]\n\nto implement scientifically supported management practices on Federal \nforests, in consultation with local communities, while establishing new \nconservation programs to improve water quality and regenerate declining \nforest ecosystem types on private lands.\n  The legislation will reduce the amount of time and expense required \nto conduct hazardous fuels projects. But it also will require rigorous \nenvironmental analysis of such projects.\n  Over the past few years, we have seen many communities destroyed and \nmany firefighters' lives lost due to forest fires that could have been \nprevented. Instead of managing our national forest treasures, the U.S. \nForest Service has been forced to spend great amounts of time and \nresources battling lawsuits. The result has been months and even years \nof delays in fuel reduction projects. Our forests have continued to \nsuffer, and they have continued to burn.\n  I have also introduced, with 13 cosponsors, an amendment to title I \nof the bill which contains several modifications to the House bill the \ncommittee reported. This amendment embodies recommendations made by a \nbipartisan group of Senators who are committed to getting this \nlegislation passed and signed by the President.\n  The amendment establishes a predecisional administrative review \nprocess. It allows an additional analysis under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to \ngive priority to communities and watersheds in hazardous fuel reduction \nprojects. It contains new language protecting old growth stands. And it \nencourages the courts to expedite the judicial review process.\n  The reported legislation contains a biomass title authorizing grant \nprograms to encourage utilization of certain forest waste materials. \nAnother title in the bill provides financial and technical assistance \nto private forest landowners to encourage better management techniques \nto protect water quality.\n  The pest and remote sensing titles would authorize funding for the \nU.S. Forest Service, land grant institutions, and 1890 institutions to \nplan, conduct, and promote the gathering of information about insects \nthat have caused severe damage to forest ecosystems.\n  Title V, the Healthy Forest Reserve Program, is a private forestland \nconservation initiative that would support the restoration of declining \nforest ecosystem types that are critical to the recovery of threatened, \nendangered, and other sensitive species.\n  Two additional titles were added to the House-passed bill by our \ncommittee. One would establish a public land corps to provide \nopportunities to young people for employment and at the same time \nprovide a cost-effective and efficient means to implement \nrehabilitation and enhancement projects in local communities. The other \nnew title will promote investment in forest-resource-dependent \ncommunities.\n\n  This legislation provides new legal authority to help us manage the \nNation's forests in a safe and effective manner. The bill will help us \ndo a better job of safeguarding these priceless national resources. I \nurge the Senate to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/20/senate-section/article/S12860-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

If I may be heard briefly, the Presiding Officer is \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee. I know the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and Senator Byrd have worked very hard to get \nappropriations bills through this soon.\n  I want to respond to my friend from Mississippi to indicate we may \nnot like what is proceeding--that is, the Healthy Forests initiative \nand the way it has been brought to the floor, and class-action \nlegislation. They are important pieces of legislation; we understand \nthat. But the most important business to be conducted in this body is \nto finish our appropriations bills. We simply are not doing that.\n  I am extremely concerned the House is out of session this week. They \nwill be in one week. They have conferences that cannot be completed \nbecause they are not here. They are AWOL. In addition to the conference \nreports--and there are a significant number of those: military \nconstruction, Energy and water, Interior, and Labor-HHS--there are six \nother bills people on the majority side are talking about lumping into \none big omnibus bill. That really doesn't work well. Those bills are so \nlarge and unwieldy, it is difficult to get the detail to find out what \nis in them. They become a mishmash of legislation.\n  I hope Members understand the best thing we can do is work to get \nthese appropriations bills passed. There is no reason we cannot pass \nthem. The bills that have come before the Senate have passed in a \nreasonably short period of time.\n\n  I hope in addition to the other things the majority leader wants to \ndo, he will focus on these appropriations bills. They are important. It \nis not good to have large, unwieldy omnibus bills, and it appears it is \nbeing done for reasons I don't fully understand. Part of it is simply \nthat the numbers are not there and there is some effort being made, \nespecially in light of the $87 billion and the attention focused on \nthat, the $21 billion spent on Iraq and very little being spent in \nAmerica--the American people are concerned. These bills being brought \nto the Senate would focus more direct attention on that.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The acting majority leader.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \nmorning business be extended to 2:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend, is there \nany way we could get a little more time on that?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am advised there are Senators who have been told they \ncould come over and talk on the motion to proceed to consider the class \naction at 2:15.\n  Mr. REID. That will be fine. I ask that the time between now and 2:15 \nbe equally divided, even though my friend gave a very fine speech and \ntook a long time. But we won't count that against morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/20/senate-section/article/S12860-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak for a moment on the Healthy \nForests bill which, as we just heard from previous discussion, will not \nbe brought up. I understand the points made by the Senator from Nevada \nwith regard to the importance of the appropriations bills. None of us \ndeny the fact that we have important work to do with regard to our \nbudget and the appropriations process. However, there are other \ncritical pieces of legislation this Senate must consider. Among the \nmost critical of those is the Healthy Forests bill. I serve as chairman \nof the subcommittee of the Agriculture Committee which handles forestry \nissues. It was that committee to which this legislation was referred \nwhen it came to the Senate. Our distinguished chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Cochran, has worked closely with me as \nwe have crafted bipartisan legislation to bring before the Senate. We \nhave also worked closely with the Energy Committee, Senator Domenici, \nand Senator Craig, my colleague from\n\n[[Page S12861]]\n\nIdaho, who happens by coincidence to chair the forestry subcommittee of \nthe Energy Committee, and other Senators on the Republican side of the \naisle as we worked to craft a meaningful piece of legislation.\n  We also reached out and worked closely in a bipartisan fashion with \nSenators from the Democratic side of the aisle because we knew this \nimportant legislation should not be stalled as a result of partisan \npolitics. The result of those efforts, the initial effort in committee \nand subcommittee, was bipartisan legislation which Democratic Senator \nBlanche Lambert Lincoln from Arkansas and I cosponsored to bring before \nthe full Committee on Agriculture. The Agriculture Committee then made \nseveral amendments to the legislation, working in a bipartisan fashion \nwith other Senators on the committee, and brought that legislation out \nto the floor. At that time there were still concerns being raised and, \ntherefore, our leader, Senator Cochran, brought together a group of \nRepublican and Democratic Senators with concerns about our forests and \nthe conditions they face, and for several months we negotiated--again, \non a bipartisan basis--to address the needs of our forests and the \nconcerns raised by those who wanted to be sure we had a bipartisan, \nbalanced bill.\n  We achieved that support. We came forward in a group of bipartisan \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats, with legislation that expanded the \nnumber of Democrats who would join with us on the legislation, \nincluding our minority leader and other leaders in the west from areas \nwhere serious forest fire problems are facing us.\n  Now after that long period and working in a bipartisan fashion, as we \nare prepared to bring the legislation forward, we are told it cannot be \nbrought forward because there is objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest. We don't want to have a filibuster fight. We don't want to \nhave a cloture vote. We have been working to build a balanced approach \nwhich can achieve support in the Senate.\n  It is my concern that what we see now is further delay, coming at a \nlate time in the session, when we will jeopardize the ability of the \nSenate to meet its time considerations to address critical issues.\n  Our forests need support and help now. All anyone has to do with \nregard to the threat of fire danger is look back at the last 3 or 4 or \n5 months to see the kind of threat our forests face. In addition, we \nexpanded the legislation to deal not simply with fire threats but also \nthreats from insect infestation--some of the most critical needs facing \nour forests in America today.\n  This legislation, as Senator Cochran indicated, is balanced. It is \nfair. It protects old-growth forests. It makes certain that public \nparticipation in the process of decisionmaking is preserved. It assures \nthat the implementation of management plans by experts on the forests \nhas a meaningful chance to proceed so we aren't tied up in litigation \nparalysis, and it gives us an opportunity to move forward and develop a \nplan that will help us achieve our objective, which is healthy forests.\n  I commend all Senators who have been working together on this issue, \nRepublicans and Democrats. I particularly thank my colleague from \nIdaho, Senator Craig, and our colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, as they have worked so closely with us at the Energy \nCommittee level; and especially my chairman, Senator Cochran, who also \nworked closely with us; Senator Lincoln, who has worked with us from \nthe start, Senators Wyden, Feinstein, Baucus, and others; Senator Kyl, \nSenator McCain. Many Senators have come together to work with us.\n  I am hopeful this critical, bipartisan, balanced legislation will not \nfall prey to the loss of time we face on the Senate floor at these late \ndays in the session as we are moving forward. I urge Senators to come \nforward and help us find a path by which we can bring this legislation \nbefore the Senate and achieve its early consideration.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, over 6 weeks ago, the Senate appointed \n13 conferees to the conference with the House on the Energy bill. Six \nof those conferees are Democrats. They were appointed to represent the \n49 Democrats who serve in this body.\n  The day after our appointment, there was one meeting of the \nconference to allow for opening statements. Since then, there has been \nno opportunity for Democratic conferees to actually act as conferees. \nSome of the proposed text for the conference report, which was written \nwithout our involvement, has been circulated to us for comment by our \nstaff.\n  On the most important issues before the conference--that being \nelectricity and ethanol--we have not yet seen a draft text. Our concern \nabout the way the conference has been conducted is not new information \nto this body. I have conveyed those concerns directly to the chairman \nof the conference. I have been joined publicly in expressing those \nconcerns by other Democratic conferees, both in the Senate and House.\n  The blackout on information about the conference became even more \ncomplete during this past weekend. We understand there are agreements \non most of the issues involved with the Energy bill. In fact, the \nsettled energy provisions probably represent well over 500 pages of \nlegislative text.\n  This text contains many details and it is important that we be able \nto view the text before we are called into a final conference meeting \nfor an up-or-down vote. Our staff was standing by all weekend in hopes \nof getting to see this text. We were not able to do so. I personally \ncannot think of any valid reason why the completed text--those portions \nthat have been completed by the Republican conferees--should not be \ndistributed to the rest of the conferees immediately.\n  There are numerous new sections on topics that have not been yet \ndealt with, as we understand it. We need to see those. Some of those \nmay be provisions that were neither in the House nor the Senate bill. \nOthers may entail spending of which we previously have not been \ninformed.\n  I have spoken to the chairman of the conference in the last few \nminutes. He has informed me that he and our majority leader are \ninsisting that this conference not be concluded until we are given the \nfull text of this bill and until we have at least 24 hours to review \nthe text and have a final meeting at which we can raise objections and \noffer amendments. I appreciate that courtesy.\n  This is far short of what I think would be required in an appropriate \nconference, but it is certainly some effort to accommodate, which I \nvery much appreciate.\n  I do believe the sections that have not yet been released--that being \nthe sections on electricity and ethanol--need to be released at the \nearliest possible moment, and hopefully today. These are very important \nsections. They are going to affect Americans in their pocketbook in \nvery real ways. It is very important we get the provisions out so we \ncan understand them, debate them, and consider them before we are \ncalled upon to finally pass on this conference.\n  The right thing to do is to make the documents--that is, the text of \nthis proposed Energy legislation--public as soon as possible. There is \nno doubt in anybody's mind that this is what the Democratic conferees \ncontinue to ask for. I hope this is the course of action that will be \ntaken by the leadership of the House and Senate at the earliest \npossible moment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho, Mr. Craig.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Bingaman spoke to an issue to which I would \nlike to respond.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico be granted 2 minutes, not to be taken from my time. I \nthink it is critical that he speak to the issue of the energy \nconference.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, whose time is it taken from?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority's time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Bingaman that I heard \nwhat he said. He and I have talked a number of times. I would like to \nshare with\n\n[[Page S12862]]\n\nhim the following so there is no misunderstanding. I have taken the \nposition--although I have not been able to tell him every day and I \nhave not issued a release about it every day--that the Senator must \nhave the bill for 24 full hours prior to markup. We have taken that \nposition with our leadership and with everyone who has to do with the \nhierarchy of this bill. That is where we are. That will be enforced. I \nnow have the support I need for that to happen.\n  Secondly, I will do my very best to get you the portion of the bill \nthat you would like to see on electricity even before that. I am \nworking very hard on seeing if I can do that. There are a whole lot of \npeople who want to look at that provision, and I want to get it to you \nas soon as possible.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments, and I understand his concern. I \nhope that, in the end, whatever your concerns are for that bill--let's \nhope you are for it, but I hope you will conclude that you have had a \nchance to review everything and offer amendments. I thank the Senator \nfor yielding.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I had hoped that today I would be on the \nfloor debating with my colleagues the issue of Healthy Forests and H.R. \n1904. When the chairman of the Agriculture Committee brought the bill \nto the floor today asking unanimous consent to move forward, there was \nan objection heard from the other side. I must tell you it is \nphenomenally frustrating to me that we have worked on this issue in a \ntotally bipartisan mode since the day it came from the House and, yet, \nthere is still objection from the other side on this issue.\n  The bill brought to the floor today, chaired and lead-sponsored by \nthe chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Cochran, has Senator \nDaschle, Senator Domenici, Senator Wyden, my colleague from Idaho, \nSenator Crapo, who chairs the Forestry Subcommittee on Agriculture, \nSenators Feinstein, Lincoln, Burns, Johnson, McCain, and Craig, who \nchairs the Forestry Subcommittee in the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, together on this issue.\n  Yet the other side is saying no. Is it because the fire season is \nover? Is it because of the rains starting to hit the forests of the \nGreat Basin West, and the smoke clouds that filled the air of the West \nthis summer are depleted? Is that why there is objection now to this \nlegislation?\n  I and others have been on this floor for the last 3 years pleading \nwith the Congress of the United States, and especially this body, to \ncraft a forest health bill that allows us to begin some active \nmanagement of our forests, to change the character of our forests, and \nto improve their health. The House acted this year. The bill came to \nthe Agriculture Committee. My colleague from Idaho, Senator Crapo, \nchaired the subcommittee, and the work began under the leadership of \nSenator Cochran. They produced a very good bill. We looked at it in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee. It is not that our committee \nhas not seen it. You darn right we have seen it; for 3 years, this \nissue has been before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and my \nforestry subcommittee. Now the ranking member, Senator Wyden of Oregon, \nand I--myself chairing--have agreed this is the bill that ought to come \nto the floor. Yet we are still being told that, no, somehow it hasn't \nbeen vetted enough and somehow there is no understanding of this issue.\n  There is a lot of understanding of this issue. There is a fundamental \ndisagreement between those who want the forests left alone to burn, to \nlet Mother Nature take her course, and those of us who have said the \neconomies of the West, the watersheds of the West, the wildlife of the \nWest, and of all of our public land forests deserve a policy of active \nmanagement so our forests can return to a state of good health, so our \nwatersheds can produce clear and valuable water for our urban \nenvironments, and so the wildlife can flourish; they deserve that. Yet \nit is being denied by a select few who would see it in an entirely \ndifferent way.\n  The President began to speak out on this issue a couple of years ago. \nHe stood in the ashes hip deep in Oregon, where fires ravaged nearly a \nmillion acres, and said that somehow this country has to change its \npolicy.\n  Guess what. Eighty-seven percent of Americans in a recent poll agree \nthat something is wrong in our national forests. It looks something \nlike this: 79 percent of the folks in the West say: Got to fix it. In \nthe Midwest, 82 percent say: Got a problem, ought to fix it. In the \nSouth, 84 percent say--and this is the area the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee is from--got a problem in our public forests, \nought to fix it. And the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator \nCochran, set out to do that, along with the Senator from Idaho, Mr. \nCrapo, and myself.\n  This is a national issue today. It is not an issue of the elitist or \nthe select few of the environmental community who say nothing should \nhappen on our public lands; that they should be a preserve only managed \nby Mother Nature. We have seen what Mother Nature has done in the last \n5 years. She has burned 3 million to 5 million acres a year. She has \ndestroyed watersheds. She has destroyed wildlife. In many instances, \nshe has destroyed thousands of homes, and she has cost Americans their \nlives. Many Americans have died in the last few years just trying to \nfight these unusually hot and devastatingly damaging wildfires that \nhave swept the West.\n  Here are the facts. The American public understands these fires are \ndestroying our forests. They understand that we need to do more \nthinning.\n  Eighty-three percent of the wildland firefighters have told this \nCongress and the public that the most important step we can take to \nincrease their safety--is to thin these forests.\n  Because the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society and other radical \nenvironmental groups want no timber harvesting in our Federal forests, \nwe are destroying 6 to 7 million acres of land each year--6 to 7 \nmillion acres of wildlife habitat are being destroyed each year.\n  The bipartisan amendment that was reached as a compromise with 13 of \nmy colleagues responds to the needs of the American public. It responds \nto those who are concerned about the loss of wildlife habitat. It \nresponds to the wildland firefighters who tell us we need to increase \nthe number of acres thinned each year. And, most importantly it \nresponds to the needs of our forests.\n  We have seen communities destroyed by fire and important wildlife \nhabitats destroyed. Yet we, in this Senate, fiddle.\n  I am tired of our fiddling around. We all know that this body must \naddress this issue. We all know the that the bipartisan amendment is a \ngood one that is fair and balanced and good for our forests.\n  Last year, all we asked for was an up-or-down vote on our amendment, \nbut the minority would not allow that.\n  This year, a few Members seem to be saying no debate, no vote, and \nyes to the destruction of or forests. This simply has to stop.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, that is the issue before us today. It is an \nissue that this Senate ought to debate. I plead with my colleagues on \nthe other side to work with us to get this bill to the floor for \npurposes of debate and passage.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time on this \nside to the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes 9 \nseconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues in talking about the \nproblems I guess particularly in the West, although not only in the \nWest. When I was in high school, I lived near the Shoshone Forest in \nCody, WY, and I would help the firefighters fight fires. I remember \nthat so very well, particularly one mountain close to home. It was very \nsteep. As the fire went up the rocks, it would loosen the rocks and \nthey rolled down. Since that time, it has become even more of a \nproblem.\n  I always think about those who say we ought to leave things the way \nthey are, and I think about the wild horses. If we would get too many \nwild horses, what would happen to them in the old days? They starved to \ndeath. We don't let that happen anymore. We have to keep the numbers \ndown. The same is true with the forests.\n  We are using the forests differently than we did in the past. More \npeople live closer to the forests. People are using the forests \ndifferently. We have more insect problems to manage. We are talking \nabout managing the resource.\n  There will be areas, of course, where we will not have forest \nprotection--on roadless areas and wilderness areas. But much of the \nforests are areas where there are many people all the time, where there \nare roads and buildings, and we have to do something different than we \nhave been doing.\n  Fires burn at naturally high temperatures and cause severe damage to \nthe soil, watersheds, and air quality, as well as, of course, to the \ntrees. Fires destroy habitat, including endangered species.\n  It is our responsibility to protect the health and safety of the \ncommunity in neighboring lands. There is a lot we must do to do a \nbetter job.\n  In Wyoming--and we have not had as much fire as some other States--in \nthe Shoshone Forest where I grew up, many of those trees are infected \nby insects. Yet only 1 percent of the corridor is available for any \nkind of treatment and care for these trees. In Big Horn National \nForest, a fire burned for 3 weeks causing evacuation of dozens of \ncabins and loss of other facilities.\n  Black Hills National Forest--interestingly enough, we had some \nagreements before that were limited to the Black Hills to do forest \nfighting, clearing, and so on. We ought to extend that to some of the \nother forests because we have had experience in that area. Grand Teton, \nof course.\n  It is clear we need to have a program. Firefighting is extremely \ncostly. It is expensive to suppress and control. It is much less \nexpensive to seek to avoid fires.\n  The Forest Service this year has already spent $1 billion in forest \nfighting. We passed nearly $700 million to cover the cost of the \nshortfall; otherwise, it had to come from other projects. We cannot \ncontinue to have these kinds of resources consumed by the fire.\n  It has already been mentioned that the House has a bill and we have a \nbill and we will be taking up the differences. There are differences in \nview as to how different parts should be handled.\n  Between the House and the Senate, there has been a compromise on \nalmost all the issues that are important: administrative appeals and \nall the suits that take place. We have an agreement to cut those down, \nso instead of having to do studies for a year before something can be \ndone, it can be done in 30 days. We have wildlife-urban interface, with \nhalf a mile around facilities in which more of this control will take \nplace.\n\n  We have the old-growth issues where there can be changes if old \ngrowth is in that interface close to buildings. There can be \nexemptions.\n  I am most disappointed that, having talked about this issues for \nyears, knowing the impact of not doing something, here we are with \nobjections to moving forward when we have an opportunity to create some \nsolutions to the problem that exists and will continue to exist.\n  I hope we can do something this week. This is our chance to come \ntogether and pass a bill that will be usable. I hope we do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the morning \nbusiness allocation for this side of the aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator has 5 \nminutes 51 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Mississippi \nMr. Cochran.\n  First, on the way to the floor, something very interesting happened \nto this bill. The Parliamentarian read it and said: Chairman Domenici--\nwho had been waiting anxiously to do this bill--you don't have \njurisdiction the way the bill is written and said the Agriculture \nCommittee did.\n  For a little while I had a sourpuss look on me until I found out \nthat, indeed, we were fortunate because Senator Thad Cochran and his \ncommittee, letting us help him, did a magnificent job. In fact, I can \nsay so there will be no doubt on the record that they did a better job \nthan we could have. So I am very pleased the bill came roundabout that \nway.\n  As always happens in a bill of this type, you cannot win on the floor \nwith just a bill produced by committee because there are Senators who \nare not on any of the committees of jurisdiction who have big interests \nin the bill. Guess what. Those Senators are now supporting this bill. \nWe must have somebody around here who is against this bill. Senator \nWyden is for it. He has had some of the biggest problems with forests \nand forest fires in his State of any Senator.\n  We met under Senator Cochran's leadership for weeks. And Senator \nWyden is for this bill. Surely, he is not for not bringing up this \nbill. Whoever is for not bringing it up--I don't understand.\n  California has so much of everything that we sometimes forget they \nhave huge forests and huge forest fires, and it burns a lot of things \ndown.\n  They need to fix the law. Guess what. She is not on the Agriculture \nCommittee. Right?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So she came in and said: Let me help. She went to \nmeeting after meeting. Of course, they invited me and my staff. I had \nmore than a few things to do, and I probably was there less than the \nSenators I just mentioned, but I came. I was one who pursued it and \npushed it.\n  On the Democrat side of the Agriculture Committee, the Senator from \nArkansas, Blanche Lincoln, was there all the time. She came to these \nmeetings and she is for it. Max Baucus, Democrat from Montana, a State \nwith huge problems, he was there. He is for it.\n  Everybody knows the Senator from New Mexico is for it. I have been \ntrying to do this for 10 or 12 years. I got one big bill through that \nnobody thought could happen in the midst of the forest fires. It passed \nin an amendment on the floor. We got $250 million times 2--that is $500 \nmillion--for each agency. We named that bill ``happy forests.'' We \nnamed it happy forests because we thought if it works, these forests \nthat cannot see sunlight may see sunlight and they might be happy when \nthey look up at the sun.\n  So I nicknamed the bill the happy forests, with the trees of America \nonce again being unclogged. The clogging makes the trees limp but also \nmakes them burn like wildfire. We got that one through and it did a lot \nof good, but we are stuck with the problem that this bill tries to \nsolve; namely, we cannot get anything done in a reasonable period of \ntime. That is the issue.\n  We do not have to talk about the fancy words, jurisdiction, courts, \nand\n\n[[Page S12864]]\n\nall of that. The truth is, for those who do not want things to happen, \nthey have an inordinate amount of time that they can make everybody \nwaste without doing anything. At least in this bill, for instance, if \nthere is an infested forest--and I do not know anyone that does not \nhave one around--they are ugly, they burn like tinder, and at least in \nthis bill that would be handled very expeditiously.\n  People wonder why that is not the case right now. In a few months, \nwhy can't there be a contract to cut those trees down? Well, those kind \nof things are getting fixed in this bill.\n  I am grateful to have these few minutes. I am thankful that this bill \nwent to the Agriculture Committee. The staff did most of the work, and \nI am very grateful the outsiders came in and helped. I do not want to \nfail to mention, on the Republican side, the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, John McCain, who was not on the committee of jurisdiction, \nalso came with his competent staff. They presented their views and some \nof the bill was adjusted their way.\n  So I say to the leadership, I hope when some Senators come and say \nlet's delay this bill, let's not take it up, I hope they would ask, \nwhat is this about? When are we going to do it? When are we going to \nstop destroying our forests or at least do some positive things that we \nall know are right?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Under the order, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the remaining time on this side to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/20/senate-section/article/S12864-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12864-S12866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OSAMA BIN LADEN AND SEPTEMBER 11\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, over the weekend, Osama bin Laden was \nagain seen vowing that al-Qaida would launch suicide attacks against \nAmericans and our allies. Frankly, it angered me to see these taped \nreports that again Osama bin Laden is threatening Americans.\n  It has now been 771 days since al-Qaida launched terrorist attacks on \nAmerican targets on September 11, 2001. For me, this report raised the \nquestion of why is Osama bin Laden still able to threaten this country? \nWhy have we not been able to find him and bring him to account?\n  I was reminded, in seeing these tapes, that just several weeks ago \nNewsweek magazine did a detailed analysis on where Osama bin Laden \nmight be. They narrowed it down to Kunar province on the border between \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. They had detailed reports in that article of \nOsama bin Laden being seen in this area.\n  It struck me at the time, if we have a pretty good idea of where \nOsama bin Laden is, why are we not flooding that area with American \nforces to take him out? Newsweek went on to report that:\n\n       . . . bin Laden appears to be not only alive, but thriving. \n     And with America distracted in Iraq and Pakistani President \n     Pervez Musharraf leery of stirring up an Islamist backlash, \n     there is no large-scale military force currently pursuing the \n     chief culprit in the 9/11 attacks, U.S. officials concede.\n\n  I find that alarming. Osama bin Laden led the attacks on this \ncountry. We know that. There is no doubt about it. If we are being \ndistracted by Iraq, in my view, that is a serious mistake. I must say \nit is one that I very much feared one year ago when we were considering \nwhether to attack Iraq. I voted against attacking Iraq at that time \nbecause I believed our top priority ought to be going after al-Qaida \nand Osama bin Laden.\n  There has just recently been a report in the Boston Globe that says: \nAs the hunt for Saddam Hussein grows more urgent, and the guerilla war \nin Iraq shows no signs of abating, the Bush administration is \ncontinuing to shift highly specialized intelligence officers from the \nhunt for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to the Iraq crisis.\n  I believe that is the wrong priority. I believe the priority ought to \nbe al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden, and we ought to be going into this \narea that has been identified in seeking to find him and holding him to \naccount.\n  When I reflect on the decision to go into Iraq, I am reminded that \nmany in the public believe that Iraqis were part of the 9/11 operation. \nIn fact, 69 percent of the American people believe Saddam was involved \nin the September 11 attacks. Half of Americans believe that Iraqis were \namong the 9/11 hijackers.\n  We know that is not the case. There were no Iraqis, none, zero, \ninvolved in the 19 who hijacked the planes in our country that turned \nthem into flying bombs that attacked the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon. Of the 19 hijackers, 15 were from Saudi Arabia, two were from \nthe United Arab Emirates, one was from Egypt, and one was from \nLebanon. Not a single one was from Iraq. Yet even now many Americans \nbelieve it was in fact Iraqis who attacked this country. In fact, more \nAmericans believe most of the hijackers were Iraqis--21 percent--than \nthe 17 percent who correctly stated none of the hijackers was Iraqi.\n\n  We are making decisions here, and the American people are supporting \ndecisions, and apparently they do not have the accurate information.\n  Unfortunately, it is not hard to figure out why. In speech after \nspeech, the President and his top officials have juxtaposed 9/11 with \nSaddam and Iraq, strongly implying there is a clear and direct link \nbetween Saddam and 9/11. To take only one of dozens of examples, as \nrecently as last month Vice President Cheney again linked 9/11 with \nIraq, describing Iraq as the geographic base of the terrorists who have \nhad us under assault for many years, but most especially on 9/11.\n  This is the Vice President of the United States suggesting that Iraq \nwas at the center of the attack on America on 9/11.\n  The President himself was forced to correct the record just a few \ndays later, when he said we have had no evidence Saddam Hussein was \ninvolved on September 11; no evidence.\n  The record is overwhelmingly clear. We know who attacked us on \nSeptember 11. It was not Iraq. There were no Iraqis. The people who \nattacked us on September 11 were al-Qaida, led by Osama bin Laden. In \n770 days, we have not yet held him to account. That has to be our \npriority.\n  The President and his top officials have sought to link Saddam not \njust with 9/11 specifically but with al-Qaida more generally. They have \ncited three pieces of evidence to back that claim.\n  First, the administration stated that one of the 9/11 hijackers, \nMohamed Atta, met with an Iraqi agent in Prague in the spring of 2001. \nFor example, last year the Vice President asserted:\n\n       We have reporting that places him [Atta] in Prague with a \n     senior Iraqi intelligence officer a few months before the \n     attacks on the World Trade Center.\n\n  That is what the Vice President said then. But what do we know now? \nThe fact is, the CIA and FBI have concluded this report was simply not \naccurate because Mohammed Atta was in this country, in Virginia Beach, \nVA, at the time the Vice President had asserted he was in Prague. As \nthe Washington Post reported on September 29:\n\n       In making the case for war against Iraq, Vice President \n     Cheney has continued to suggest that an Iraqi intelligence \n     agent met with a September 11, 2001, hijacker months before \n     the attacks, even as the story was falling apart under \n     scrutiny by the FBI, the CIA, and the foreign government that \n     first made the allegation.\n\n  Second, the administration has argued a senior al-Qaida operative, \nAl-Zarqawi, was seen in Baghdad. He may very well have been in Baghdad, \nbut that doesn't prove anything about a formal link between Iraq and \nal-Qaida. We know senior operatives spent months in our own country \nprior to 9/11. That doesn't make the United States an ally of al-Qaida \nany more than the presence of an al-Qaida operative in Baghdad makes \nSaddam Hussein an ally of Al-Qaida.\n  Third, the administration said al-Qaida maintained a training camp in \nnorthern Iraq. Again, this sounds convincing, but as the former \ndirector of the Strategic Proliferation and Military Affairs Office at \nthe State Department's intelligence bureau points out, one finds this \nis not a very honest explanation: `` . . . I mean, you had terrorist \nactivity described that was taking place in Iraq, without the mention \nthat it was taking place in an area under the control of the Kurds \nrather\n\n[[Page S12865]]\n\nthan an area under the control of Saddam Hussein.''\n  On this map, this is the camp they were talking about. This is the \nAnsar al-Islam area. There was a terrorist camp here.\n  This is a map of Iraq that shows very clearly that is an area \ncontrolled by the Kurds. The Kurds are our allies. This is an area that \nwas not under the control of Saddam Hussein.\n  If the American people are going to make sound judgments about who is \nresponsible for what, and who we ought to hold responsible, and who we \nought to prioritize for attack, it seems very clear to me the ones we \nought to be attacking are al-Qaida. The ones we ought to be going after \nfirst and foremost are Osama bin Laden and his allies. Over and over, I \nbelieve the American people have been led to believe there is this \nstrong link between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein. I do not think the \nfacts bear out that connection.\n\n  The President himself has now said Saddam Hussein has not been linked \nto September 11. Yet the majority of the American people believe that \nhe was. That mistaken understanding is right at the core of what has \nbeen to me a serious mistake in the strategy in fighting this war on \nterror. Our first priority, our top priority, one we should not be \ndistracted from, is going after Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. I don't \nthink we should be distracted, chasing the mirage of terrorism being \nfundamentally a product of Iraq. I don't think the record bears that \nout.\n  If there is not a strong connection between Iraq and al-Qaida, why \nhave we repeatedly had that linkage made? I think there has been very \nlittle credible evidence of a direct connection between al-Qaida and \nSaddam Hussein. As a former State Department intelligence official said \nin the same Front Line interview:\n\n       His [Secretary Powell's] own intelligence officials and \n     virtually everyone else in the terrorist community said there \n     is no significant connection between al-Qaida and Saddam \n     Hussein.\n\n  If there is not a strong connection, why have we heard so many \nreferences linking the two? That is a question we all need to ask and \ntry to answer.\n  In addition to the link to al-Qaida, the President and his \nadministration have also repeatedly indicated that Iraq had weapons of \nmass destruction. First the President suggested over and over there \nwere close links between Saddam and al-Qaida, implying Saddam had \nsomething to do with the September 11 terrorist attack on this country. \nWe now see that is a very weak case.\n  Is there better evidence to substantiate the second set of claims \nused to justify war with Iraq, that Saddam Hussein was about to acquire \nnuclear weapons, and was producing chemical and biological weapons, all \nof which could be used for an imminent attack against the United \nStates?\n  First, on nuclear weapons, the President and top officials repeatedly \nwarned of Saddam's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction. They \nbuttressed these general claims with two very specific assertions. \nFirst, the President and his top officials said there was direct \nevidence of Saddam Hussein trying to buy uranium in Africa. In his \nState of the Union Address last January, President Bush told Congress \nand the American people:\n\n       The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein \n     recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \n     Africa.\n\n  That is what the President said then. But what do we know now? We now \nknow that the CIA knew, months before the State of the Union Address, \nand months before the war on Iraq started, the allegation was simply \nnot accurate; it was based on a crude forgery that did not pass the \ncredibility test for CIA experts. Here is just one news story, ``Bush \nClaim on Iraq Had Flawed Origin, White House Says.''\n\n       The White House acknowledged for the first time today that \n     President Bush was relying on incomplete and perhaps \n     inaccurate information from American intelligence agencies \n     when he declared in his State of the Union speech that Saddam \n     Hussein had tried to purchase uranium from Africa.\n\n  Second, the President and his aides have repeatedly asserted Iraq had \ntried to purchase aluminum tubes that could be used to enrich uranium \nfor nuclear weapons.\n  The President said:\n\n       Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to \n     purchase high-strength aluminum tubes, suitable for nuclear \n     weapons production.\n\n  That's what the President said then.\n  But what do we know now?\n  The International Atomic Energy Agency's director concluded this \nspring, before the war on Iraq started, that the tubes were for \nconventional artillery rockets. As the Washington Post reported:\n\n       ElBaradei rejected a key Bush administration claim made \n     twice by the President in major speeches and repeated by the \n     Secretary of State that Iraq had tried to purchase high-\n     strength aluminum tubes to use in centrifuges for uranium \n     enrichment. . . . El Baradei's report yesterday all but ruled \n     out the use of the tubes in a nuclear program. . . . ``It was \n     highly unlikely Iraq could have achieved the considerable \n     redesign needed to use them in a centrifuge program,'' \n     ElBaradei said.\n\n  But the Bush administration did not stop with these specifics. It \nrepeatedly asserted there was an imminent danger of Saddam acquiring \nand using nuclear weapons.\n  In a speech 1 year ago, President Bush said:\n\n       The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its \n     nuclear weapons program.\n\n  The Vice President last March went even further, stating that ``we \nbelieve he has in fact reconstituted nuclear weapons.''\n  That is what they said then. But what do we know now? We have \noccupied Iraq for 5 months. We have full, unrestricted access to the \nwhole country and more than 1,000 investigators looking for illegal \nweapons. The Bush administration's chief investigator leading the \nsearch for weapons of mass destruction has found no evidence of any \nserious recent effort to build nuclear weapons. I think this quote from \nthe October 3 Washington Post sums up the most recent finding:\n\n       After searching for nearly six months, U.S. forces and CIA \n     experts have determined that Iraq's nuclear program was only \n     in the very most rudimentary state, the Bush Administration's \n     chief investigator formally told Congress yesterday.\n\n  On nuclear weapons, specific allegations underlying the \nadministration's claims had certainly been discredited before we went \nto war, and since the war we have found no evidence to support the more \ngeneral claims of Iraqi efforts to reconstitute its nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  What about chemical and biological weapons?\n  We all knew Iraq had possessed and had used chemical weapons in the \n1980s. We all knew intelligence had not conclusively demonstrated that \nall of these weapons had been destroyed. In fact, I must say I believed \nIraq was likely to have chemical and biological weapons because we knew \nthey did at one point. The United Nations investigators found them. But \nthose weapons have not been found since. We have searched high and low \nfor biological and chemical weapons. We may still find them. I think we \nhave to ask ourselves, would that have justified a preemptive attack on \nIraq? My own judgment is it would not. Why? The Soviet Union had \nweapons of mass destruction; we never launched a preemptive attack on \nthem. China has weapons of mass destruction; we never launched a \npreemptive attack on them. You can go through country after country \nwhere we have decided to use containment rather than military assault.\n  The President told us the Iraqi regime possesses and produces \nchemical and biological weapons. I believe he believed that, and there \nwas reason to believe that. I don't diminish that argument. But the \nfact is we were wrong, or at least so far it appears we were wrong. I \nmust say I believed--and I say it again--I believed they had chemical \nand biological weapons. But after searching for nearly 6 months, U.S. \nforces and the CIA experts have found no chemical or biological weapons \nin Iraq. We still may find them.\n  That still leaves us with the question: Did their mere possession of \nsuch weapons justify a preemptive attack? What did our own CIA tell us? \nI remember those briefings, elements of which have been made public. I \nam not revealing any secrets. The CIA told us there was a low \nlikelihood of an Iraqi attack on us or our allies unless we attacked \nthem first.\n  The point is simply this: We have not found biological and chemical \nweapons. We have not found evidence of a reconstituted nuclear program. \nWe have not\n\n[[Page S12866]]\n\nfound any serious links between al-Qaida and Iraq. Those were the \nfundamental reasons we went to war with Iraq. I believe it was a \nmistake to attack Iraq at the time we did. I believe it was a priority \nthat simply did not make sense given the threat to this country.\n  The imminent threat to this country is in the form of al-Qaida. The \nimminent threat to this country is the forces led by Osama bin Laden. \nIt has now been 771 days since they attacked this country. Newsweek \nmagazine reports they have a pretty good idea where Osama bin Laden \nis--right on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Yet there is \nno large-scale military operation underway to take out Osama bin Laden. \nI think the American people deserve to know why not. Why not? Why \naren't we launching massive forces into the area identified as the \nplace where Osama bin Laden is hiding? Have we been distracted by Iraq? \nI hope not. But the evidence I see is that the resources and the \nattention, which I believe should have been first directed at taking \nout Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, are going to Iraq.\n  I very much hope we will have answers to these questions in the \ncoming days.\n  The Senator in the Chair, whom I count as a friend in this body, is \nthe chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Obviously he has knowledge \nnone of the rest of us possess. As one Senator, I saw Osama bin Laden \non these tapes again over the weekend and read the stories in the news \nmagazines that said we have a pretty good idea where Osama bin Laden \nis. But we have not found him, leading to the suggestion that we have \nbeen distracted by Iraq. That disturbs me a great deal. I believe the \noverriding priority for this country and the national security of \nAmerica is in holding Osama bin Laden to account, finding him, and \nstopping him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the distinguished Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of speeches on the \nSenate floor about Osama bin Laden, about Iran, Iraq, and the Middle \nEast. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I can only talk \nbriefly about this matter, but I think it is important to note I was \nprobably the first Member of Congress--at least to my knowledge and I \nbelieve anybody's knowledge--to mention the Clinton administration had \nbetter get on top of Osama bin Laden, or he is going to kill \nAmericans. At one particular point in that period of time between that \nstatement and when President Clinton left office, there was one time \nthey could have captured Osama bin Laden, and he would have been turned \nover to them. They blew it, not realizing how important this matter \nwas.\n\n  As a matter of fact, we now know he is behind terrorist activities \nall over the world, especially in our country and especially in the \nMiddle East. We have had more than ample unclassified information, and \nperson after person, group after group has tried to infiltrate our \ncountry to cause terrorist activities within this country, in each case \ntied back to Osama bin Laden.\n  We also know he has escaped Afghanistan and with the help of certain \nfriends probably is residing somewhere in northeastern Pakistan but no \none really knows. To make a long story short, we do not just have the \nright to go into northeastern Pakistan and conduct a major warfare \nsearch for Osama bin Laden without the permission of the Pakistanis. \nEveryone knows that. That relationship is a very important \nrelationship.\n  We also know Osama bin Laden is not just dedicated against the United \nStates of America but against anyone that stands for freedom. \nParticularly, he is against his own fellow Arabs in Saudi Arabia and \nother parts of the Middle East. It is apparent that many claims are \nmade that some of the terrorism that happens in the Middle East is \ncaused by al-Qaida, inspired by none other than Osama bin Laden. There \nis also no question that there have been ties to Saddam Hussein.\n  But be that as it may, anyone who tries to make out the case that we \nshould not be in Iraq is ignoring decades of facts. Anyone who tries to \npin the Iraqi matter strictly on whether or not Osama bin Laden had \nweapons of mass destruction is ignoring an awful lot of matters that \nindicate that if the United States did not act, it would be only a \nmatter of time until it would be too late to act and there would be \nmany thousands of others killed, networks set up, deterioration \nthroughout the Middle East, which is, as a whole, strictly important to \nthe United States of America, as well as other countries in the world.\n  I get a little tired of hearing people in the Senate criticizing \nPresident Bush for stopping these people for letting it be known \nthroughout the world that we will not put up with acts of terrorism, \nthat we will hit them where it hurts for doing what has been done in \nIraq. Anyone with any brains has to realize there are so many facts \nthere you do not even need weapons of mass destruction today to show \nwhat we have done there has placed a huge dent in terrorism around the \nglobe and has rocked Osama bin Laden back on his heels. Yes, he is \nstill capable of making an occasional television announcement. He is \nstill capable of acting like he is more important than he is. But the \nfact is, we have put a big dent in his terrorist operations around the \nworld.\n  That is not to say we should not stay vigilant, that we should not do \neverything in our power to make sure that terrorism is fought not just \nin our land but all around the world. One has to look pretty far to \nlook beyond the terrorist incidents of Saddam Hussein, his sons, and \nthe Baathists in Iraq. All that is important in the Middle East as well \nas in other parts of the world. I will not take time to go through the \nfact that 10 years ago, the U.N. even verified he has the capacity to \nmake weapons of mass destruction, was making weapons of mass \ndestruction, used them against his own people, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n  It seems strange to me we have to go through this every day, with \npeople lambasting the President, who literally has stood up the way he \nshould stand up, ignoring the fact that many in the country of Iraq are \nthrilled we are there, bringing peace and stability, decency, honor, \nfreedom, education, health care, infrastructure, and other matters to \nbenefit that nation. Naturally, those who love terrorism, those who \nlove hatred, are not going to like him. Instead of condemning the \nPresident for crass political reasons at that, we ought to be thanking \nhim for having the guts to stand up and to take these actions that have \nlong been overdue.\n  I have a lot more to say, but I let it go at that today. It is \ndemoralizing to me to see a lack of support by some on the other side \nfor what has been necessary for foreign affairs action. It used to be \nthat offshore we supported whoever was President. I guess that was \nbecause most of the time the President was a Democrat. I guess it is \ndifferent when there is a Republican President. All we have had are \nattempts to undermine everything President Bush is trying to do with \nprobably the best foreign policy team I have seen in my 27 years in the \nSenate, composed of people who complement each other, who have cross-\ncurrents of belief, who basically come behind the President and support \nwhat is being done in ways that I don't think any other group of people \ncould have done, certainly not as well as they have done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/20/senate-section/article/S12866-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 2:35 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1751, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to consideration of S. 1751, a bill to \n     amend the procedures that apply to consideration of \n     interstate class actions to assure fairer outcomes of class \n     members and defendants, and for other purposes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I note that Senator Cornyn is here. I ask \nunanimous consent he be permitted to\n\n[[Page S12867]]\n\nspeak, and then I be granted the floor thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the Senator from Utah. It is because of his \nleadership on this issue, that of class action fairness, it has reached \nthis stage in the proceedings. He is a true gentleman in the finest \ntraditions of the Senate. He also happens to be the iron fist and the \nvelvet glove who helps make things happen in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, a place where, unfortunately, things do not always happen \nthe way they should, notwithstanding his heroic, Herculean efforts.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be added as a \ncosponsor to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2003.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this bill is important for so many \nreasons. I will generally lay out what I believe to be some of the \nimportant reasons the Senate should take up this bill that was voted \nout of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan basis, why the \nSenate should take this bill up, vote it out, and do everything in our \npower to see it is enacted into law.\n  My colleague, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, deserves a great \ndeal of credit for his hard work on this issue and for promoting this \nimportant legislation. I publicly acknowledge his leadership on the \nissue as well.\n\n  Like a number of the Members of this body, I have been a member of \nthe bar, a lawyer, for a number of years. I have seen the ways in which \nthe law and lawyers have contributed in a tremendous fashion both to \nthe public administration of justice and to that maxim, that saying, \nthat is engraved into the edifice of the U.S. Supreme Court, which is \nreally a national value and ideal: Equal justice under law.\n  That is indeed one of the fundamental values upon which this Nation \nwas founded. But I do not think it is news to anyone that that \naspiration, that value, that we all agree is important, has suffered in \nthe administration when it comes to class action lawsuits.\n  I wish to make clear, I believe class actions do have an important \nrole in the administration of justice. In other words, the class action \nwas created so that individuals with relatively small claims and who \nwould not be able to bring those claims forward in an economical way--\nindeed, the economics would discourage them from doing so--would not be \ndenied access to the courts and access to justice simply because their \nclaims were rather small because, indeed, if in fact that were the case \nand there were no mechanism to bring those small claims forward, there \nwould be those who would abuse individuals and who would know they \ncould continue in that posture because individuals would not be able to \neconomically bring those claims forward.\n  So the class action mechanism provides a means for aggregating or \ncollecting those claims so that it can be done in an economical \nfashion, in a way that will not deny those individuals who are \naggrieved access to the courts so they may have access to that justice \nthat I mentioned a moment ago.\n  So the intent of the class action mechanism was to provide consumers \nwith access to the courts. The problem is, today, the reality is that \nour system has turned into one that now benefits the few at the expense \nof the many. In other words, the people who benefit from class actions \ntoday, too often, are the lawyers who bring those lawsuits rather than \nthe consumers for whose benefit this whole procedure was first \nconceived.\n  I think it ought to be our goal in the policy of the U.S. Government \nand our courts to see that those with valid claims have a means to \nvindicate those claims, but it should not be a means by which the few \ncan be enriched at the expense of consumers who may not even know they \nare involved in a class action lawsuit, where they receive token \ncompensation whereas the class action lawyer receives millions, \nliterally, in attorney's fees.\n  Modern class action litigation has brought forward what we have now \ncome to recognize as the entrepreneurial lawyer. That is a lawyer who \nmay not have a client but if they are smart enough to try to figure out \na way to create a claim or find somebody who arguably has a claim, then \nthey can go out and seek a class representative; that is, somebody \nwhose claim is representative of perhaps hundreds or thousands or even \nmillions of other people who might be in a similar situation and, thus, \nseek certification of a class action and settle the case because, \nfrankly, class action lawsuits are almost never tried because the \nconsequences of a trial and the loss are so devastating that the person \nwho has been sued or the company that has been sued does not really \nwant to risk an adversarial proceeding in a court of law.\n  So class action lawsuits are filed to be settled and to use the \neconomic pressure that is created thereby because the number of claims \nthat are aggregated and the amount of money that is at stake is \nliterally a bet-the-ranch lawsuit or, I should say, bet-the-company or \nbet-your-life-savings lawsuit.\n  The problem is, our system of class action litigation is not just \nbroken; it is falling apart. That is not right, and that is not \njustice, and that cries out for reform. I believe this bill is an \nimportant step forward in providing that reform.\n  Now, the truth is, as great as I believe this bill is that has passed \nout of the Judiciary Committee, it, frankly, is not all we should \nstrive for when it comes to class action fairness.\n  For example, many people find out only after they receive a coupon or \nsomething in the mail that they were, indeed, a member of a class; in \nother words, they were a party to a lawsuit, and they did not know it \nuntil they received some token compensation, whether it be a coupon or \nperhaps a few pennies.\n  I think if we were to engage in the sort of class action reform that \nI think would genuinely address part of the problem, we would have a \nsystem not where people are asked to opt out of a class but literally \nwhere consumers are given an opportunity to opt in; that is, I do not \nthink we ought to presume somebody wants to be a party to a lawsuit \nunless they say: Count me in.\n  I do not think that is too much to ask. But that is not what this \nbill does yet. But that is where I think we need to go ultimately.\n  What this bill does is provide a means of access to a court and the \nkind of careful review of a legal claim that I think is important in \norder to preserve the goal of class action litigation; that is, to \nserve the interests of consumers and not the interests of \nentrepreneurial class lawyers.\n  I want to give just one or two examples from my own experience. As I \nsaid, like many in this body, I have been a practicing lawyer. I also \nhappen to have been a judge in my earlier life and exposed to some of \nthe abuses of class action litigation. And of one I will never forget, \nI want to just mention a few of those details.\n  Well, it seems that General Motors created a sidesaddle gasoline tank \npickup truck, one that was the subject of or involved in a rather \nspectacular explosion and terrible injury and death in Georgia, which \nwas obviously a personal injury and a wrongful death claim.\n  What happened in Texas, and elsewhere, was we saw that some lawyers \nrealized this was perhaps a product design over which consumers may \nhave a potential claim. So they brought a lawsuit, not for personal \ninjury or death but for the economic loss incurred by consumers who \nowned sidesaddle gasoline tank pickup trucks.\n  Of course, they had a couple of problems. One, they had the problem \nof being able to establish a true measure of loss as a result of merely \nowning them because, in fact, the evidence seemed to be that there was \nno actual loss in value just by driving a truck that had a sidesaddle \ngasoline tank. But, moreover, what ultimately happened in this case was \nthat the consumers got a coupon, redeemable upon the purchase of a new \nGeneral Motors pickup truck, and the lawyers who filed the lawsuit got \nnearly $10 million in cash.\n  As it turned out, the court on which I served, the Texas Supreme \nCourt, unanimously reversed that decision--\n\n[[Page S12868]]\n\nthat settlement really, the approval of that settlement, saying: Look, \nwe have gotten this exactly backward. Class action lawsuits are brought \nfor the benefit of consumers, not for the benefit of the lawyers who \nfile them.\n  So in order to correct this abuse represented by the settlement, we \nsaid: Look, the consumers have to get something of value, and it has to \nbe more than a coupon redeemable upon the purchase of a new General \nMotors pickup truck.\n  Now, frankly, what happened was, it looked as though the class \nlawyers, the class counsel, cut a deal that was good for them, and \nGeneral Motors agreed to a deal that was pretty good for them under the \ncircumstances, although I am sure they would have rather not been \nthere. But they were able to basically effectuate a marketing scheme \nfor the sale of more GM pickup trucks; in other words, make lemonade \nout of this lemon. The problem was, consumers in the process got \nnothing. Indeed, many consumers, because they were constrained by \nbidding requirements--for example, trucks owned in a motor pool by a \nmunicipality or otherwise constrained by those requirements--could not \neven take advantage of the coupon. Of course, others didn't have the \nmoney to buy a new pickup truck and so they couldn't use the coupon \nwhich gave them some money as against the purchase of another truck.\n\n  We can all testify, based on our own experience, how we have perhaps \nreceived a notice in the mail. I remember not too long ago when my wife \nand I went to a Blockbuster video rental store. We got an extra long \ntape when we rented our video that had a notification of a class action \nsettlement attached to it. Of course, after reading the fine print, we \nfound out that we had, unbeknownst to us, been involved in a lawsuit \nand had some nominal claim we could make to a few pennies, while the \nlawyers in the case received $9 million in cash. The consumers got a \ncoupon for about a buck, and the lawyers got $9 million in cash.\n  I don't want to take long today because the chairman of the committee \nhas graciously allowed me to say a few words now. I know we will be \ncontinuing to talk about this issue for some time this week, as well we \nshould. But there is another part of class actions that we need to be \ncareful about. It is not just the entrepreneurial lawyers who settle \nfor cash while consumers get a coupon. Class actions can also be used \nby defendants--that is, people being sued for various claims--to \npreempt or to stop future claims by those who have them because there \nis what we lawyers call res judicata. That is, no one else can bring \nanother claim if, in fact, they were notified they had a potential \nclaim and failed to object and thus were included in the class. So some \ndefendants will potentially go out and collude with an entrepreneurial \nlawyer in order to get a final class action settlement which meets \ntheir bottom line but which basically precludes future claims by others \nwho genuinely are aggrieved and harmed and whose rights are totally cut \noff.\n  This is not lawyer bashing, I assure you, as a lawyer myself. People \nneed to have access to the courts. Consumers need to have a means to \nvindicate their just claims. But it cannot be through a method which \nrewards entrepreneurial lawyers with millions in cash and consumers \nwith a coupon. It cries out for reform. I believe the class action \nliability reform bill Chairman Hatch has navigated through the \nJudiciary Committee, which enjoys bipartisan support in that committee, \nis a big step in the direction of reform.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from Utah for allowing me to say a few \nwords. I will relinquish the floor from whence it came.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Breaux \nbe recognized and then I be recognized immediately following his \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for yielding to me.\n  I will take a few moments to explain my position on this important \nlegislative effort and point to the fact that I have worked on a \nsubstitute amendment that has the ability to bring both sides together \nin a way we have not yet achieved.\n  It is clear that in all difficult legislative areas, when you have a \nvery closely divided Senate, the only way we will actually get \nlegislation adopted and passed and sent to the President for his \nsignature is if we aggressively work together to limit our differences \nand maximize the things we have in common in order to produce a \nlegislative package that can sustain the rules of the Senate and allow \na bill to actually pass and become law.\n  There is room for reform in class action litigation. I do not think \nit is as bad as some portray the situation to be, but it is probably a \nproblem that does need to be addressed. For those who think we should \ndo nothing in this area, I would say there are some things we can do \nthat improve the situation and, most importantly, get us a product that \ncan actually become law.\n  Many times we in the Senate are faced with the question of, do I want \nto try to do everything I would like to do and risk getting nothing \ndone, or would I like to try to reach a legitimate compromise and \nactually get something passed that may not be everything I would like \nbut would be far superior to doing nothing at all. That is the \nsituation we face with regard to the question of class action \nlitigation.\n  My substitute bill, which would be offered, hopefully, as an \namendment, does the following: It builds on the committee report in the \nsense that what we do is say to those plaintiffs who file a class \naction case in a particular State, where one-third or less of the \nplaintiffs, the people who are injured in a State, happen to be from \nthat State, that like the committee bill, that case would clearly be a \nmatter of Federal jurisdiction. Where two-thirds or more of the \nplaintiffs who are injured or alleged to be injured reside in a \nparticular State--say Louisiana--where the injuries were alleged to \nhave occurred, if two-thirds or more of those injured citizens who have \nfiled a case, two-thirds or more, happen to be from my State of \nLouisiana, then it is a State court in which the action should be \nbrought.\n  As the committee bill, my bill also says that when you have a \nsituation between one-third and two-thirds of the plaintiffs coming \nfrom a State, a particular State where the injury occurred, then the \nFederal judge would look at the circumstances, as the committee bill, \nand make a determination of whether that case more appropriately \nbelongs in the Federal court or belongs in the State court.\n  What is the difference between the two approaches? One big difference \nis that in the committee bill it says, that even if two-thirds or \nthree-fourths or 98 percent of the injured people reside in Louisiana, \nwhere the alleged injury occurred, if the defendant happens to be a \ncitizen of some other State, as so many corporations are, then the case \ngoes automatically to the Federal court to interpret as best they can \nthe State laws, such as my State of Louisiana.\n  That is incorrect. If the majority of the injuries are in the State \nof Louisiana--say it is a meatpacking company that has sales in \nLouisiana and it has caused injuries in my State of Louisiana by \nselling tainted products of meat that cause real injuries in \nLouisiana--and 75 percent of the injured people are in Louisiana but \nbecause the company may be domiciled or a citizen of the State of \nDelaware, that all of a sudden the Federal court is better situated to \nhandle that case. That defies logic. If the injured people are in my \nState, two-thirds or more, then logic says the case can best be handled \nand interpreted by the State courts and the State supreme court which \nwould be interpreting the State tort law that the State legislature \npassed.\n  Why should we say merely because one defendant's cause for alleged \ninjuries happened to be in Delaware, where so many companies are \nincorporated, that automatically means it should be in the Federal \ncourt? The Federal court does a great job of interpreting Federal law, \nbut I suggest when it comes to interpreting State law, on which these \nplaintiffs would be judged, the State court is better situated to make \nthose determinations. I will have more to say about that particular \naspect.\n\n[[Page S12869]]\n\n  Let me mention briefly when it comes to the so-called coupon \nsettlements the distinguished Senator from Texas mentioned, our \nlegislation addresses that, to the extent that we can, by saying where \ncoupons are issued to many plaintiffs who may have bought a defective \nproduct, the situation in the past has been many plaintiffs' attorneys \nwould have their fees set not on the number of coupons that were \nactually redeemed, but only on the number of coupons that were actually \nissued in terms of the settlement.\n  For instance, people buy a defective product and many times the \nresolution of the case is based on each plaintiff getting a coupon or \ndiscount on a future purchase. The problem was many attorneys were \ngetting paid on the total number of coupons issued rather than the ones \nredeemed. Our legislation says their fees would only be based on the \nnumber of coupons actually redeemed, and I think that makes a great \ndeal of sense as well. It also says you cannot run a merry-go-round and \ncontinue trying to take cases from one court to the next. Under our \nlegislation, we say defendants have a right to try to remove a case to \nthe Federal court, but they cannot do it an unlimited amount of times. \nOur legislation simply says such removal would occur in a timely \nfashion, and we suggest within 30 days after filing of the complaint. \nSurely the defendants know whether they want to be in Federal court or \nState court. They cannot wait up until the end of the case in the State \ncourt, after years of litigation, and say, oops, we want to move it to \nFederal court and have that as an absolute right. They ought to do it \nin a timely fashion. Our legislation addresses that as well.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude my remarks by saying the good Senator \nfrom Utah is a very respected chairman of the committee. I think he \nwants legislation to pass. My fear is, unless we sit down and work \ntogether, we are going to have a stalemate. Both sides will have an \nargument. Democrats will have one argument and Republicans will have \nanother argument, but the result will be nothing will pass.\n  My approach is simply that we can say don't proceed to this bill \nuntil we have had serious discussions between both sides, such as we \nhave done on asbestos. I think those asbestos cases have made progress. \nIt is not quite there yet, but they have made progress. Why? Because \nthey have been willing to sit and talk among all the parties. I think \nwe should do the same thing with the class action litigation. We can \nsay we are not going to proceed to this bill until we have had an \nopportunity to sit down and have good, legitimate discussions.\n  I think we can come to an agreement so that we will not have the bill \npassed by just one vote or lose by one vote, but rather have it pass by \n75 or more votes in this body. I think that is possible, but it is \ngoing to take, first of all, saying we are not going to proceed to the \nlegislation until we have had those discussions. We are going to share \nwhat we have just outlined with my good friend, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. Hopefully, they can look at it and see if there is \nroom for legitimate talks and legitimate compromise. I think there is. \nThe alternative is to do nothing. I think that is unacceptable.\n  I thank the chairman for yielding me a few moments to make some \ncomments. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks. \nWe will certainly look at whatever he has to offer in this matter. We \nwill keep an open mind and see if we can get together.\n  I rise in strong support of S. 1751, Class Action Fairness Act of \n2003. It used to be S. 274, but now it is renumbered to S. 1751. This \nbill represents a carefully balanced legislative solution in response \nto the widespread abuse of the class action lawsuits in our State \ncourts. Over the past decade, it has become painfully obvious that \nclass action abuses have reached epidemic proportions. What began as \noccasional outrageous class action settlements, drawing light humor, \nhas now become a routine occurrence that is just not funny anymore. It \nhas become equally clear that the true victims of this epidemic have \nbeen every-day consumers who represent the silent majority of unnamed \nclass members throughout the country.\n  It has become too common where plaintiff class members are not \nadequately informed of their rights or the terms and practical \nimplications of a proposed class action settlement. Making matters \nworse, judges too often approve settlements that primarily benefit \nclass counsel, the attorneys, rather than the class members or the \nvictims. That is turning the law on its head.\n  In the coming days, we will hear numerous examples of egregious State \ncourt settlements, where class members habitually receive little or \nnothing of value, while their attorneys receive millions of dollars in \nfees. The cases are numerous, but just too extensive to list.\n  To put these settlements in perspective, allow me to share a recent \nclass action settlement that one of my own staff members recently \nactually received in the mail. This settlement notice comes from a \nState court in Jefferson County, TX. It involves the settlement of a \nclass action lawsuit brought on behalf of purchasers of Bridgestone and \nFirestone tires. This technical legal document informs my staffer--an \napparent class member by virtue of owning a set of Firestone tires--of \na proposed class action lawsuit settlement that will award the lawyers \n$19 million in fees and costs. That is not a bad payday for lawyers \nwhen compared to what the clients get: a promise from defendants that \nthey will make safer tires and initiate a safety program.\n  It strikes me these class members are getting a so-called benefit \nthey should be getting, anyway. It seems to me they should try to have \nsafer tires and the benefit of a safety program.\n  But the laughable settlement terms don't end there. Unlike the \nunnamed class members who do not stand to gain a single penny, those \nlucky enough to be named plaintiffs get to walk away with a $2,500 cash \nbounty. This proposed settlement, which will likely be approved by the \nState court, represents everything wrong with the class action system \ntoday and underscores the importance of reform--$19 million, where no \none really gets any benefits except a few they choose to be named \nplaintiffs, who get $2,500. The attorneys walk off wealthy, happy, fat, \nand laughing.\n  The need to reform our class action system is not a new issue to the \nSenate. The Judiciary Committee conducted hearings in the 105th, 106th, \nand 107th Congresses, reporting a similar bill out of committee in the \n106th Congress on a bipartisan basis. We have received mountains of \nevidence demonstrating the drastically increasing injustices caused by \nclass action abuses.\n  After working extensively with numerous legislative proposals \nthroughout the various Congresses, the committee reported a bill--again \nwith bipartisan support--which I believe provides a measured response \nto the underlying class action problem.\n  This being said, I would not be surprised to hear somebody deny the \nexistence of any problem at all. Others will try to confuse the issue \nwith dubious claims that proposed reforms would somehow disadvantage \nvictims with legitimate claims or further worsen class action abuses. \nOthers may even contend past legislative reforms have contributed to \nrecent financial debacles and that the proposed reforms will encourage \nmore. Rest assured, Mr. President, such claims are nothing more than \nred herrings intended to divert the debate from the real issues.\n  In this regard, let me emphasize a few points regarding this bill. \nFirst, this bill doesn't eliminate all State court class action \nlitigation. Class action suits brought in State courts have proven in \nmany contexts to be an effective and desirable tool for protecting \nconsumer interests and rights. Nor do the reforms we will discuss today \nin any way diminish the rights or practical ability of victims to band \ntogether to pursue claims against large corporations. In fact, we have \nincluded several consumer protection provisions in our legislation that \nI believe will substantially improve plaintiffs' chances of achieving a \nfair result in any settlement proposal.\n  There are three key components to our legislation. First, the bill \nimplements consumer protections against abusive settlements by:\n\n[[Page S12870]]\n\n  No. 1, requiring simplified notices that explain to class members the \nterms of proposed class action settlements and their rights with \nrespect to the proposed settlement in ``plain English.''\n  No. 2, enhancing judicial scrutiny of the abhorrent coupon \nsettlements.\n  No. 3, providing a standard for judicial approval of settlements that \nwould result in a net monetary loss to plaintiffs.\n  No. 4, prohibiting bounties to class representatives.\n  No. 5, prohibiting settlements that favor class members based upon \ngeographic proximity to the courthouse.\n  And No. 6, requiring notice of class action settlements be sent to \nappropriate State and Federal authorities to provide them with \nsufficient information to determine whether the settlement is in the \nbest interest of the citizens they represent.\n  Second, the bill corrects a flaw in the current diversity \njurisdiction statute that now prevents most interstate class actions \nfrom being adjudicated in Federal courts. Specifically, the Class \nAction Fairness Act amends the diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction \nstatute to allow larger interstate class actions to be adjudicated in \nFederal court by granting original jurisdiction in class actions where \nthere is ``minimal diversity'' and the aggregate amount in controversy \namong all class members exceeds $5 million.\n  The bill balances the State's interest in local disputes by providing \nthat class actions filed in the home State of the primary defendants \nwould remain in State court subject to a triple-tiered formula that \nlooks at the composition of the plaintiffs' class membership. This \nformula has become known as the Feinstein Compromise.\n  To enforce the jurisdictional changes, the bill modifies the Federal \nremoval statutes to ensure that qualifying interstate class actions \ninitially brought in State courts may be heard by Federal courts if any \nof the real parties in interest so desire.\n  Although some critics have argued this amendment to diversity \njurisdiction somehow violates the principles of federalism or is \ninconsistent with the Constitution, I think their concerns miss wide of \ntheir mark. I fully agree with Mr. Walter Dellinger, former Solicitor \nGeneral, who previously testified at one of our Judiciary Committee \nhearings that it is ``difficult to understand any objection to the goal \nof bringing to the Federal court cases of genuine national importance \nthat fall clearly within the jurisdiction conferred on those courts by \narticle III of the Constitution.''\n  Finally, I wish to express my appreciation to the many individuals \nwho have shared with me the details of their experiences of class \naction litigation. In particular, I am grateful to those victims of \nvarious abuses of the current system who have come forward and told \ntheir stories in the hope that something positive might come out of \ntheir terrible experiences.\n  Among those who have come forward is Irene Taylor of Tyler, TX, who \nwas bilked out of approximately $20,000 in a telemarketing scam that \ndefrauded senior citizens out of more than $200 million. In a class \naction brought in Madison County, IL, a notorious county for these \ncases, a forum shop county where attorneys forum shop to get these big \nverdicts and these favorable court rulings, the attorneys purportedly \nrepresenting Mrs. Taylor negotiated a proposed settlement which will \nexclude her from any recovery whatsoever.\n  Martha Preston of Baraboo, WI, provides another excellent example. \nMs. Preston was involved in the famous BancBoston case brought in \nAlabama State court which involved the bank's alleged failure to post \ninterest to mortgage escrow accounts in a prompt manner.\n  Although Ms. Preston received a settlement of about $4, approximately \n$95 was deducted from her account to help pay the class action \ncounsel's legal fees of $8.5 million. Notably, Ms. Preston testified \nbefore my committee 5 years ago asking us to stop these abusive class \naction lawsuits, but it appears that at least thus far her plea has not \nbeen heard. So I urge my colleagues to support this modest effort to \nreform the abuses in the current system, abuses that are actually \nhurting those the system is supposed to help.\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a minute or two with some charts to \nshow how bad the system is. Under current law, in many State class \naction lawsuits, all of the money--every stinkin' dime--goes to the \nattorneys. I am not against attorneys. I am one myself. I think they \ndeserve to be paid reasonable fees, but in these class action suits \nevery bit of the money goes to attorneys.\n  In the BancBoston case, lawyers got $8.5 million. In the case I just \nmentioned, some of the plaintiffs had to pay the attorneys additional \nmoneys, getting nothing out of it, but the attorneys got $8.5 million.\n  I don't know, but that just smells to me a little bit. Maybe I am \njust too critical, but when the attorneys who represent the clients get \n$8.5 million and the clients have to again pay the attorneys even more, \nthere is something wrong with that.\n  Take the second one, the Blockbuster case. The lawyers got $9.25 \nmillion. What did the plaintiffs get? One dollar off their next movie. \nCome on. Doesn't that seem a little disproportionate to you, $9.25 \nmillion for attorneys and $1 for the client? Now, true, there are many \nclients, but it doesn't seem too right to me.\n  Take the frequent flier case. The lawyers got $25 million. The \nplaintiffs got a coupon worth $25 to $75. Again, now I understand in \nthat particular case--I may have it mixed up with another case--after \ngetting a huge settlement, they then turned around and sued the \nplaintiffs for more money.\n  Take the Coca Cola sweetener case. The lawyers got $1.5 million and \nthe plaintiffs get a 50-cent, a 50-penny coupon. I don't know about \nyou, but that also smells to me. Again, I am not against attorneys \ngetting reasonable fees, but it seems to me these are scams more than \nanything else. They will say they are correcting societal wrongs, but \nwhy then do they get all the money and the plaintiffs who have to put \ntheir names on the line get relatively nothing? Talk about class action \nabuse.\n  Let's go to that Blockbuster Video case. After being named in 23 \nclass action lawsuits, Blockbuster agreed to provide class members with \nonly $1-off coupons, ``buy one get one free'' coupons, and free \nBlockbuster favorites video rentals . . . while attorneys are reported \nto receive around $9.2 million in fees. That is according to the \nRockyMountainNews.com. It just does not seem right. But that is the way \nit is.\n  The class action abuse I mentioned in the BancBoston settlement over \ndisputed accounting practices produced $8.5 million in attorneys fees \nand actually cost class members around $80 each. Later plaintiffs' \nattorneys in this case also sued the class members--the individuals who \nthey brought the suit for--they sued them for an additional $25 \nmillion. There is something wrong with that. I don't care what anybody \nsays.\n  Take this one. This is a class action abuse, something this bill \nwould correct. There was a settlement with Cheerios over food additives \nthat produced $2 million in attorneys fees while class members only \nreceived coupons for more Cheerios, something they complained about to \nbegin with. I happen to like Cheerios. I have nothing against Cheerios. \nI eat them. But why would attorneys get $2 million while class members \nget a coupon for another box of Cheerios? It does not seem right to me.\n\n  As my colleagues can see, this is a policy that is being abused, and \nwe are only mentioning a few of the abuses. I have no problems with \nlegitimate, honest class action suits where attorneys are acting in the \nbest interests of their clients. But I do have problems with some of \nthese phony approaches that it seems to me are blatantly wrong on their \nface, where the attorneys get huge fees and the class members get \nvirtually nothing. That is what is happening in these particular cases.\n  This bill will correct some of those ills without taking away the \nright to pursue class actions, and in certain cases they will have to \nbe pursued in Federal court. I remember when I practiced law--that was \na long time ago, before I became a Senator--we would die to get into \nFederal court because everybody knew it was a more important case, that \nthe Federal courts handle more important cases, people thought, and \nstill do think that.\n\n[[Page S12871]]\n\n  For some reason, these class action lawyers do not want to go to \nFederal courts. Now, why is that? Because they can forum shop into \nMadison County, IL, where they get judges and jurors to hammer the \ndefendants with outrageous verdicts that benefit basically only the \nattorneys. Now, that is wrong.\n  There are at least five States in this Nation where they forum shop \nclass action cases. Grisham wrote a book about this. He is a great \nstoryteller, but I can almost name every fictionalized attorney in that \nbook.\n  Some of them are great lawyers. Some of them are leaders in bringing \nlitigation to correct societal wrongs. Some of them deserve credit for \ndoing that. But this is a system that is out of control. This bill will \nhelp to straighten it out, and I think resuscitate the respect for my \nprofession because attorneys who bring these actions will have to do so \npursuant to fairness and rules that make sense rather than forum shop \nto areas where they can get big verdicts and big legal fees but do \ninjustice.\n  Now I will speak about ``Let's Play Class Action Monopoly.'' Go. Come \nup with an idea for a lawsuit, it states on the top of the board. Find \na plaintiff to pay off, or a set of plaintiffs. Make allegations. You \ndo not need any proof to make allegations. Get out of rule 23 free. So \nyou get out of the rule. Convince your magnet State court judge to \ncertify the class, which is also another scam in some of these \njurisdictions where the judges do not seem to appreciate the law or \nabide by the law.\n  File copycat lawsuits in State courts all over the country. Sue as \nmany companies in as many States as possible even if they have no \nconnection to the State.\n  It states in the bottom right: Who gets the money? Go left on the \nbottom. Columbia House case, $5 million for lawyers, discount coupons \nfor plaintiffs; Blockbuster case, $9.25 million for lawyers, free movie \ncoupons for plaintiffs, and not too many of them; BancBoston case, $8.5 \nmillion for lawyers. Some plaintiffs pay more fees rather than get \nanything out of it.\n  So in the bottom left, what happens to me? Your employer takes a hit, \nmaybe lays you off. Next one, your health and car insurance premiums go \nup. The lawyers win. You lose.\n  I have tried cases on both sides of the table. I started out as a \ndefense lawyer, and I defended these types of cases. Then in the latter \nyears of my practice, I became primarily a plaintiff's lawyer where I \nbrought cases for and on behalf of individuals who were injured. I \nbrought cases for injured people and got them big verdicts they \ndeserved. They walked away with the bulk of the money, which is only \nright. Yes, they were happy to pay my fees because they always came out \nwell.\n  In some of these cases, this is a scam. Now, there are legitimate \nclass action cases, but there are many of them out there today that are \nnot. It is a disgrace to our profession. This bill will clarify and \nstraighten out some of the wrongs that are going on. It is high time we \ndo this. The only reason we might not do it is because there is a \nfilibuster on the motion to proceed. Normally, we never have a \nfilibuster on a motion to proceed. Normally, we just go to the bill, \nand then if somebody wants to filibuster, they filibuster the bill, \nespecially if they have the votes. Why not?\n\n  But a filibuster is happening even on the motion to proceed. Why is \nthat? Why a filibuster to begin with, on something that really makes \nsense? Because there are trial lawyers in this country who pay big \npremiums. That is why they make a lot of this money, so they can pay \nbig premium dollars to politicians who will vote for them no matter \nwhat the rules are.\n  I want to make it clear, not all class action lawyers are bad. Some \nof them do what is right, and they are not afraid to go to Federal \ncourt. They know they can get their big verdicts in Federal courts as \nwell because they have cases where they should get verdicts. When we \nhave these forum shop cases, something is wrong.\n  Why is it that we have to have a filibuster on the motion to proceed, \nor require a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to a bill? Why do \nthey not just let us bring the bill up, and then if they want to \nfilibuster, filibuster the bill? Because we are at the end of a session \nwhere every minute counts, every second counts, every hour counts, \nevery day counts. By delaying, those who do not want this bill can help \ntheir trial lawyer friends who are very involved in the political \nprocess because they have millions of dollars that, in many cases, they \ndo not deserve; that they can give for political purposes to keep these \ntypes of injustices going. That is why this bill is important. That is \nwhy there is a huge bipartisan vote for this bill.\n  The question is: Can we get 60 votes? I personally believe we can. I \nbelieve it would be a disgrace for this body to not overwhelmingly vote \nfor this bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It has been well thought out. \nWe have worked hard to accommodate various members on both sides of the \naisle. I think it will redeem our profession from those fly-by-nights \nwho are just in it for the money, without regard to helping their real \nclients.\n  I would like to see that happen because the law profession is a great \nprofession, but in recent years it has been steadily eroded by people \nwho are not doing what is right in the profession. These are just some \negregious cases that are all too often happening because some lawyers \ndo not do what is right.\n  I am for the good lawyers. But I am against those who are just in it \nfor the money and not really helping their clients. This bill will not \nstop them from bringing litigation, but it will even up the situation \nso at least there will not be the same amount of forum shopping, and \nbetter, more honest judges will be deciding these cases along with \nbetter and more honest juries.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have heard discussion of the so-called \nClass Action Fairness Act. I oppose the Class Action Fairness Act for \nthe simple reason that it is not fair. Actually, the legislation makes \nit more difficult for citizens to protect themselves against violations \nof State civil rights, consumer, health, and environmental protection \nlaws. The way it would hurt them is it would force these cases out of \nconvenient State courts, which have experience with the legal facts and \nissues involved in such cases; instead, it would push them into Federal \ncourts with new barriers to lawsuits, with new burdens on plaintiffs.\n  For the many Americans who are watching this debate, we have to at \nleast mention the first, basic question that scheduling this debate \nright now raises. Here we are, 3 weeks beyond October 1. October 1, of \ncourse, is the beginning of the new fiscal year. It is a deadline for \npassing the appropriations bills that fund the basic work of the \nFederal Government. It is the law that the House and the Senate must \npass the 14 appropriations bills that fund our Nation and do it by \nOctober 1. We have not done that. The Congress has not lived up to the \nresponsibility the law mandates. We are in the final few weeks, if not \ndays, of this congressional session, but here we are, 3 weeks past the \nlegal deadline to do what we are required to do, and what we are paid \nto do, and instead we are devoting these precious days not to acting on \nthe people's priorities, but we will spend several days debating a bill \nwhich is a priority of some special interests.\n  Over the past several weeks, I have received call after call from \nVermonters who are more and more anxious over Congress's ability--in \nfact, Congress's willingness--to finish appropriations for fiscal year \n2004. I know other Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, are \ngetting similar calls. I have told those Vermonters who call me to hang \nin there. I assure them that Congress will eventually get around to \ndoing its work.\n  Then the Republican leadership decides to have us consider \ncontroversial special interest legislation such as this bill. \nApparently the special interests can go to the front of the line. The \npeople's interests go to the back of the line. I suggest we have it the \nwrong way around. Do the people's legislation first; do the \nappropriations bills first;\n\n[[Page S12872]]\n\ndo the things we are required to do by law. Do the work that we go back \nhome and tell everybody we are going to do, and if there is time left \nover for the special interests, let them come up then; don't put them \nahead of the people.\n  My colleagues and I who serve on the Appropriations Committee worked \nlong and hard to get the fiscal year 2004 bills voted out of our \ncommittee. We got them all out. They could go anytime they wanted. The \nRepublican leadership has decided not to. The House has passed all 13 \nof the regular appropriations bills. They are waiting for the Senate to \nact. We are not acting. Instead, we are bringing up special interest \nlegislation.\n  The new fiscal year began 3 weeks ago, but the Senate has not even \nbothered to take up the appropriations bills that fund Agriculture or \nCommerce, Justice, State, and, our Federal law enforcement, the FBI, \nthe Department of Justice, the actions we take to counter terrorism.\n\n  As for Commerce, we might do that, so we might actually get us some \njobs in this country at a time when we are losing a million a year.\n  Foreign operations? That hasn't been brought up.\n  Transportation? We all know our roads and bridges and rail system are \nfalling apart. We ought at least to be voting. We may vote not to give \nany money to fix any of the problems of the Nation. We did vote, \nincidentally, to send $87 billion to Iraq and we will fix their roads; \nwe will fix their electrical system; we will fix their communication \nsystem; we will fix their postal system; we will even give them a new \nZIP Code. But maybe we could take a few minutes and bring up those \nthings that might actually pay for roads and transportation and \nelectrical grids and ZIP Codes in the United States.\n  Veterans Affairs is in there. The administration is cutting veterans \nbenefits all over the country. They are cutting our veterans hospitals. \nThey are cutting out what is available to our veterans. At the same \ntime we are asking our men and women to serve in Iraq, we are cutting \nout their money. We ought at least to bring that up. Let's vote on it.\n  We voted to send money to the veterans of the Iraqi army. We voted to \nsend money there. We ought to spend some time here voting on veterans \nin the United States.\n  We have the Housing and Urban Development appropriations bills. We \nhave a great housing shortage in this country. We just spent billions. \nWe had plenty of time to vote billions of dollars to build houses in \nIraq. We can't even bring up the housing bill for the United States, \nbut this special interest legislation we do make time to address.\n  What I would say is: OK, we voted to do all these things now for the \nIraqi people. Can we at least spend a day or two voting on the same \nbills that might help the American people at the national, State, and \nlocal levels?\n  Let me tell you about a few of these programs that are being pushed \naside so we can take up this special interest legislation.\n  In the area of agriculture, there is more than $1 billion in \nconservation assistance for farmers to help them improve water quality \nand stop sprawling development. Last year, the aid was delayed by more \nthan 4 months. Each month is critical. The men and women who farm in \nthis country are just barely getting by.\n  They stalled the Justice spending bill so we could get money as \nquickly as we possibly could to the police forces of Iraq. But because \nwe stalled it, there is no money for the Bulletproof Vests Partnership \nProgram which helps State and local police agencies buy armored vests \nto protect the lives of their officers. This is a good bipartisan \nprogram that Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and I put together.\n  I have had police officers come up to me all over the country, people \nI have never met, who want to shake hands and say, We really want to \nthank you and Senator Campbell and those who joined you to help us get \nthis money. Now I am going to have to tell them it is stalled. We had \nto wait to get the money for Iraq, that is fine, but now we have to \nstall again because we have special interest legislation that comes up.\n  Take the COPS Program; this puts new police officers on the community \nstreets and in our schools; the Violence Against Women Act programs \nthat provide services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault \nand stalking. Those were all set aside so we could bring up this \nspecial interest legislation.\n  All funding for transportation and critical infrastructure projects \nwas bottled up. In fact, the Senate has failed to pass the \ntransportation reauthorization bill. We don't have time to bring that \nup. We can bring up special interest legislation, we can bring up \nhighways in Iraq, but we can't bring up the highway transportation bill \nhere in the United States. And what is the cost to us? It is 90,000 \njobs here in America.\n  All foreign assistance to nations other than Iraq and Afghanistan are \non hold. In fact, all the funding to combat HIV/AIDS and other \ninfectious diseases is also on hold.\n  We have another group of Americans awaiting action by Congress. Those \nare our veterans. They need Congress to make basic decisions about \ntheir medical care and benefits, decisions that are being held in \nlimbo, and they have no idea where we are going to go.\n  These are priorities. American priorities are being set aside, and we \nwill take care of Iraq. We will take care of the special interest \nlegislation. In fact, the special interest legislation is going to do \nmore harm than help.\n  I think the American people are entitled to ask why we are bogged \ndown considering this controversial and unfair class action bill when \nthe Senate has yet to take up and debate five important appropriations \nbills amounting to $301 billion.\n  I hope the Senate gets down to the business of the people and carries \nout the responsibilities given to us by the Constitution: taking up, \ndebating, and passing the remaining appropriations bills. And we can \npass them. There will be a bipartisan majority of both Republicans and \nDemocrats working together to pass them, if we are even allowed to vote \non them. We were allowed to vote on Iraq and special interest \nlegislation. Can we take a little bit of time to vote on legislation \nthat actually helps the people of America?\n  The American people and the people around the world depend upon the \nfunds and services supplied through the spending measures that are now \nheld hostage. Let us do our job. Let us move these bills. Let us spend \na couple of weeks on the floor of the Senate legislating for the people \nof America. It would be a nice refreshing time. We could pass these \nbills.\n  Earlier this year, I joined with Senators Kennedy, Biden, Feingold, \nDurbin, and Edwards in requesting a hearing on class action litigation \nin order to help the Judiciary Committee develop consensus reforms--\nsomething that we could have done. Republicans and Democrats could have \njoined on it. But our request was ignored. Actually, our letter went \nunanswered.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Dirksen \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: We were surprised by your announcement \n     in last week's Executive Business Meeting of the Judiciary \n     Committee that S. 274, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2003, \n     would be marked up ``in the next couple of weeks.'' This \n     bill, and indeed the entire subject on the proper scope and \n     disposition of class actions cases, has been the topic of \n     intense and inconclusive debate for years. In fact, \n     legislation similar to S. 274 has failed repeatedly to pass \n     the Senate.\n       In light of this history and the far-reaching impact of \n     this legislation, we respectfully request that the Committee \n     hold a hearing on class action litigation to help the \n     Committee develop consensus reforms to better serve \n     defendants and plaintiffs before the Committee proceeds to a \n     markup on the Class Action Fairness Act, S. 274. We look \n     forward to working with you and other Members of the \n     Committee on this effort, and appreciate your consideration \n     of our request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patrick Leahy.\n     Joe Biden.\n     Dick Durbin.\n     Ted Kennedy.\n     John Edwards.\n     Russell D. Feingold.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I had hoped that the Judiciary Committee \nwould undertake a deliberate and careful review of information from \nparties\n\n[[Page S12873]]\n\nactually involved in class action litigation to provide a realistic \npicture of the benefits and problems with class actions. But instead of \ndoing the work for America, we are proceeding with a special interest \npiece of legislation which has repeatedly failed to pass the Senate in \nrecent years. Our Judiciary Committee did not carry out the kind of \nthorough and thoughtful legal analysis of this difficult issue it \nshould have. The committee did not provide our fellow Senators with the \nassistance that they may want and need in this complex area.\n  I acknowledge the hard work and dedication of my friend, the senior \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, who took on an enormous task, \nattempting with her amendment to rectify some of the harms created by \nthis bill. I appreciate the sincerity of her concern. I appreciate the \ngenuine effort she made. But her amendment touches on only a sliver of \nthe class action cases which this bill would affect--only when \nplaintiffs and primary defendants are from the same State--and even \nthen it could cause harm.\n  At its core, this bill deprives citizens of the right to sue on State \nlaw claims in their own State courts if the principal defendant is a \ncitizen of another State, even if that defendant has a substantial \npresence in the plaintiff's home State, and even if the harm done was \nin the plaintiff's home State. The amendment does not remedy that \nproblem. It burdens the plaintiff even more.\n  I also want to recognize the sincere efforts made by my friend from \nWisconsin, Senator Kohl. I may disagree with him about the nature of \nthe problem. I may disagree with the appropriate solution in this area. \nBut I do so respectfully. He has worked very hard, and I appreciate his \nefforts.\n  I would like to note the significant changes in the bill since it \npassed out of committee.\n  As originally drafted, this bill included mass tort claims along with \nclass actions. It actually treated them like they were class actions.\n  One improvement the Judiciary Committee did manage to make to the \nbill was to strike that provision. We struck it. We voted on that, and \nwe struck it. But somehow, mysteriously, after the bill left the \ncommittee with nobody voting, that was reversed. Now mass tort actions \nare again included in this bill.\n  Just in case anybody says this is what we voted out of committee, it \nis not. We changed that.\n  Now we find out how we actually get things changed in the committee \nbecause, apparently, our friends on the other side of the aisle could \ncare less about what we actually did in committee. They just change it \nin the draft on the way over here. It is fascinating. I have never seen \nthat in 29 years here. But I guess we live under new rules.\n  In the old days, we just lived under the Senator rules. But now we \nhave rules outside the Senate rules. In fact, this bill is not the bill \nreported by the Judiciary Committee, S. 274. It is another bill--S. \n1751--which was introduced last week. We didn't have hearings on that. \nWe didn't have votes on that. I guess the special interest says, OK, as \nsoon as you finish with the roads in Iraq, as soon as you finish the \nschools in Iraq, as soon as you finish giving the power grid to Iraq, \nas soon as you finish paying for the police officers in Iraq, as soon \nas you are finished with veterans' benefits for Iraq, before you do \nanything for American citizens, give us our special interest \nlegislation, and we can just drop it in and go forward.\n\n  The special interest legislation will be subjected to the same \nshunting to a Federal court, and plaintiffs will endure the same \nunnecessary difficulties in making their claims and pursuing their \nremedies. But these mass tort cases are not class actions. They have \nnot been analyzed under rule 23 standards or State law.\n  Mass tort actions have entirely different procedural vehicles to \nreach justice than class actions. They shouldn't be lumped in with \nclass actions in any kind of class action bill, either this misguided \nattempt or a better wrought piece of legislation.\n  Some special interest groups are distorting the state of class action \nlitigation by relying on a few anecdotes and an ends-oriented attempt \nto impede plaintiffs bringing class action cases. If we really want to \ncorrect things, we can and should take necessary steps to correct the \nproblems in class action litigation. But simply shoving most suits into \nFederal court with the new one-sided rules isn't going to correct the \nreal problems faced by plaintiffs and defendants. It will clog up the \nFederal courts, but it won't accomplish anything.\n  We forget that our State-based tort system remains one of the \ngreatest and post powerful vehicles for justice anywhere in the world--\nno doubt around the world--as a vehicle for justice. It lets ordinary \npeople ban together to take on powerful corporations--sometimes even \ntheir own government.\n  Defrauded investors, deceived consumers, victims of defective \nproducts, and environmental torts, and thousands of other ordinary \npeople have been able to rely on class action lawsuits in their State \ncourt systems to seek and receive justice.\n  I remember when the Soviet Union broke up. A group of legislators \nfrom the Duma came in to see me, as they did several other Senators. \nOne of them asked a question. They said: We have heard it is actually \npossible that citizens in your country can ban together and sue the \ngovernment. I said that is true.\n  They said: We have heard further that not only do they sometimes sue \nthe government, but there are times the government loses. They win.\n  I said: Oh, yes.\n  They said: You mean you don't fire the judge and make him do it over \nagain?\n  I said: You don't understand our system. It is not the Soviet Union. \nHere in the United States, we are able to ban together to take on the \ngovernment. If the government is wrong, the government is going to \nlose.\n  It was an eye-opener to them. Actually, it was a bit of an eye-opener \nto me because I realized those things we take for granted other \ncountries haven't had the opportunity to have.\n  I am old enough to remember the civil rights battles of the 1950s and \nthe 1960s and the impact of class actions in vindicating basic rights \nthrough our courts. When Congress sat back and did nothing, when \nPresidents sat back and did nothing, it was class action lawsuits that \nwon.\n  The landmark Supreme Court decision of Brown v. Board of Education \nwas a culmination of appeals from four class action cases, three from \nFederal court decisions in Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia, and \none from a decision of the Supreme Court of Delaware.\n  Only the Supreme Court of Delaware, the State court, got the case \nright by deciding for the African-American plaintiffs.\n  The State court justices understood they were constrained by the \nexisting Supreme Court law but nonetheless held that the segregated \nschools of Delaware violated the 14th amendment. The Federal courts did \nnot get it right; before any Federal court did so, a State court \nrejected separate and unequal schools. The U.S. Supreme Court, to their \ncredit, joined in a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education \nand closed down the highly discredited separate but equal idea, Plessie \nv. Ferguson. There was no separate but equal in the schools and they \nknew it--separate and unequal. The State courts realized that first in \na class action suit and then the U.S. Supreme Court followed.\n  Many civil rights advocates, including the Lawyers' Committee for \nCivil Rights Under Law, Leadership Council on Civil Rights, Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense and Education, and the National Asian Pacific \nLegal Consortium have written to Senators in opposition to this \nlegislation. The civil rights advocates conclude this legislation \n``would discourage civil rights class actions, impose substantial \nbarriers to settling class actions and render federal courts unable to \nprovide swift and effective administration of justice.''\n  I ask their letter, dated September 16, 2003, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12874]]\n\n\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                              on Civil Rights,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 2003.\n\n Oppose the Class Action Fairness Act of 2003: It Would Impose New and \n      Substantial Limitations on Access to Courts for Victims of \n                             Discrimination\n\n       Dear Senator: We, the 42 undersigned civil rights \n     organizations, write to express the opposition of the civil \n     rights community to S. 274, the Class Action Fairness Act to \n     2003, a bill that would substantially alter the \n     constitutional distribution of judicial power. If passed, \n     this bill would: remove most state law class actions into \n     federal court; clog the federal courts with state law cases \n     and make it more difficult to have federal civil rights cases \n     heard; deter people from bringing class actions; and impose \n     barriers and burdens on settlement of class actions.\n       Class actions are essential to the enforcement of our \n     nation's civil rights laws. They are often the only means by \n     which individuals can challenge and obtain relief from \n     systemic discrimination. Indeed, federal class actions were \n     designed to accommodate, and have served as a primary vehicle \n     for, civil rights litigation seeking broad equitable relief.\n       There are several reasons why the civil rights community is \n     troubled by this particular legislation:\n       This bill will overburden and create further unnecessary \n     delay in our federal courts. This bill will amend federal law \n     to extend federal jurisdiction to most state class actions, \n     overloading federal courts and inevitably delaying the \n     resolution of all cases in federal court, including many \n     civil rights claims. The effect of these provisions will be \n     particularly damaging in cases where civil rights plaintiffs \n     are seeking immediate injunctive relief to prohibit \n     discriminatory practices of a defendant.\n       The bill will burden the federal judiciary, rendering it a \n     less effectual mechanism by which plaintiffs may seek access \n     to justice. We strongly believe that S. 274 is an unnecessary \n     attempt to impose federal judicial regulation on matters of \n     law clearly committed to the states under our Constitution. \n     Indeed, the determination of state law tort, contract and \n     consumer cases is, unequivocally, not the responsibility of \n     the federal judiciary under the Constitution. The imposition \n     of such substantial new responsibilities on the federal \n     courts will further impair the ability of those courts to \n     carry out the essential functions they are intended to serve \n     under the  Constitution--the determination of matters \n     involving Federal interests, rights and responsibilities. \n     In short, true access to the Federal courts and to the \n     class action device to secure justice in matters where \n     Federal issues are at stake would be severely curtailed by \n     enactment of this legislation.\n       The bill could discourage people from bringing class \n     actions by prohibiting settlements that provide named \n     plaintiffs full relief for their claims. Now, for example, a \n     named plaintiff who sues an employer can receive a full award \n     of back pay, and in a proper case, obtain an order placing \n     him or her in the job denied because of discrimination, while \n     also affording all members of the class the opportunity to \n     share in available relief. However, under the guise of \n     protecting class members, the language of the proposed bill \n     prohibits courts from approving settlements that ``provide[] \n     for the payment of a greater share the award to a class \n     representative . . . than that awarded to the other class \n     members.'' This language is susceptible to the interpretation \n     that it prevents the award of positions or ``rightful place'' \n     seniority to class representatives where the number of \n     vacancies for which class members were prevented from \n     competing by discrimination is less than the total number of \n     class members. If the price of trying to protect others is \n     the loss of the full measure of individual relief, \n     individuals will be deterred from becoming a class \n     representative. Thus, this provision would hinder, rather \n     than reform, civil rights class actions.\n       The bill could impose new, burdensome, and unnecessary \n     requirements on litigants and the Federal courts. It seeks to \n     impose inordinately difficult and costly notice requirements, \n     which will needlessly complicate and delay the settlement of \n     class actions. Specifically, the proposed bill would require \n     notice to Federal and state officials based on the residence \n     of all class members and would require a 120-day waiting \n     period. These additional, substantial and costly notice \n     requirements and built-in delays are not a matter of due \n     process, but are overly burdensome and improperly assume that \n     Federal and state officials have both proper interest in, and \n     a capacity to respond to, each and every class action.\n       For the reasons stated above, the proposed Class Action \n     Fairness Act of 2003 could discourage civil rights class \n     actions, impose substantial barriers to settling class \n     actions, and render Federal courts unable to provide swift \n     and effective administration of justice. The bill also \n     compromises delicate Federal/State relations by questioning \n     the competency of the state judiciary and overburdening our \n     already overworked Federal courts. In short, we believe the \n     impact of this legislation would be profound, and would \n     result in new and substantial limitations on access to the \n     courts for victims of discrimination. We, therefore, urge you \n     to reject this harmful legislation.

We all know without consolidating procedures, such as \nclass action lawsuits, it might be impossible for plaintiffs to receive \neffective legal representation. Lawyers tend to be paid by the hour. \nThey are well paid. But lawyers usually hope they get a portion of the \nproceedings to take on either the governmental or culprit defendants. \nThey have to do so on a case-by-case individual basis. Sometimes that \nis what cheaters count on. That is how the cheaters get by on their \nschemes. If you cheat thousands of people just a little bit, you still \ncheat; if you only cheat them by $3 or $4, nobody will sue them. But if \nyou are cheating a million people of $3 or $4 each, it adds up.\n  Class actions allow the little guys to band together and get a \ncompetent lawyer and address wrongdoing. The best class action made it \npossible for individual tobacco victims to take on the powerful tobacco \nconglomerates in ways individuals could not. It allows stockholders and \nsmall investors to join together and go after investment scams.\n  Another example of a class action litigation serving the public \ninterest is the Firestone tire debacle. The national tire recall was \nstarted in part by the disclosure of internal corporate documents on \nconsumer complaints of tire defects and design errors that were \ndiscovered in the litigation against Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. Then \nthe plaintiff's attorneys turned this information over to the National \nHighway Safety Administration. That started a Government investigation.\n  Months later, because some people had banded together, Bridgestone/\nFirestone finally did what they should have done right from the \nbeginning: They recalled 6.5 million tires--but not until after there \nwere 101 fatalities, 400 injuries, and 2,026 consumer complaints.\n  As reported by Time magazine at the time, it is doubtful that the \ninternal corporate consumer complaint information would have ever seen \nthe light of day absent the civil rights justice discovery process.\n  The bill before the Senate creates unique risks and obstacles to \nplaintiffs that are not in the current system. A particularly troubling \naspect of S. 1751 is it allows the removal of a case at any time. \nAnybody who has ever practiced law, anybody who has ever litigated \ncases--and I, as many other Senators, have--knows the possibilities for \nabusing this provision are obvious.\n\n[[Page S12875]]\n\n  As more than 100 legal experts, law professors, noted in a letter to \nthe distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic \nleader, Senators Frist and Daschle, they said:\n\n       This would give a defendant the power to yank a case away \n     from a state-court judge who has properly issued pretrial \n     rulings the defendant does not like, and would encourage a \n     level of forum-shopping never before seen in this country. \n     Moreover, this provision would allow an unscrupulous \n     defendant, anxious to put off the day of judgment so that \n     more assets could be hidden, to remove a case on the eve of a \n     state-court trial, resulting in automatic delay of months or \n     even years before the case would be tried in Federal courts.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of the 100 law professors be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 3, 2003.\n     Hon. William Frist,\n     Majority Leader, Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: We are professors of \n     constitutional law, civil procedure, and other subjects, at \n     law schools across the nation. We are writing this letter \n     because of grave concerns over the so-called ``Class Action \n     Fairness Act'' (S. 274) and its House counterpart (H.R. \n     1115), specifically the effect these bills would have on the \n     administration of justice in the United States and on the \n     ability of American consumers, small businesses, and others \n     to obtain relief for injuries done to them. We also have \n     serious questions about the constitutionality of the Act. We \n     urge the Senate to reject this legislation.\n\n\n             practical effect of enacting the bill into law\n\n       As approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, S. 274 would \n     result in transferring to the federal courts jurisdiction \n     over most class actions filed in state courts, under state \n     law. The Federal courts do not have the resources to \n     administer justice to both their present dockets and the \n     large number of complex state-court cases that would be added \n     if S. 274 or its House counterpart were to become law. \n     Passage of the bill would lead to significant delays in all \n     the business of the federal courts, harming the ability of \n     the federal courts to decide cases that only they can decide, \n     or in which there is a strong federal interest.\n\n\n enactment of the bill would harm the ability of plaintiffs to obtain \n                                justice\n\n       We believe that several specific provisions in the bill \n     would be very unwise. The federal courts have responded to \n     claims of abuse in class-action procedures by studying the \n     claims, inviting comments from bar associations, attorneys \n     and others, carefully considering the comments, proposing \n     draft rules, receiving comments on the drafts, and fine-\n     tuning their proposals. If a reform is inadequate to meet the \n     need, they can propose refinements. A substantial set of \n     changes to Rule 23, the class action rule, are expected to go \n     into effect on December 1, 2003, in the event that Congress \n     does not direct otherwise. All of these changes were made \n     pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, the process Congress \n     created to try to keep politics out of the process of setting \n     rules for the judiciary. Sec. 3 of S. 274 would override some \n     of these changes, and elminate the ability of the Advisory \n     Committee on the Civil Rules to deal with others. If it is \n     enacted in its present form, the rulemaking process would \n     become politicized, and lobbyists' demands would replace \n     the careful consideration now given to these matters. In \n     the event that Congress deems it necessary to legislate as \n     to areas traditionally covered by court rules, we urge \n     that the legislation be as limited as possible, that this \n     part of the legislation be in the form of rules rather \n     than freestanding statutes, and that the legislation \n     expressly preserve the ability of the Advisory Committee \n     on the Federal Rules, the U.S. Judicial Conference, and \n     the Supreme Court to amend the new rules or procedures to \n     the extent necessary to accomplish their purposes more \n     effectively or to cure any unanticipated problems. \n     Congress would, as always, have the final say under the \n     Rules Enabling Act.\n       The administration of justice would also be harmed by \n     removing much of the ability of state courts to construe \n     their own laws. Many important questions are most likely to \n     arise when the stakes make it worthwhile to litigate them, \n     i.e., in class actions or other large cases. When the case is \n     removed to federal court, the federal court cannot give a \n     definitive interpretation of state law, but can only predict \n     what the state supreme court would find state law to be, if \n     the state supreme court had the same case. If there are other \n     cases from other parts of the country against the same \n     defendant, even without any overlapping classes, the Judicial \n     Panel on Multidistrict Litigation may assign the case--and \n     the task of interpreting state law--to a federal court \n     thousands of miles away. Not every state has adopted \n     procedures allowing a federal court to certify state-law \n     questions so there may be no practical means by which a \n     federal court in Topeka, for example, may be able to obtain \n     guidance as to the law of California.\n       A further unwarranted provision in S. 274 would allow a \n     defendant to remove state-law cases filed against it in the \n     courts of its own home state, where it chose to be \n     incorporated or chose to have its principal place of \n     business. This type of removal has long been considered an \n     abuse, and is forbidden by current law.\n       Equally troubling is a provision in S. 274 that allows \n     removal of a case at any time. This would give a defendant \n     the power to yank a case away from a state-court judge who \n     has properly issued pretrial rulings the defendant does not \n     like, and would encourage a level of forum-shopping never \n     before seen in this country. Moreover, this provision would \n     allow an unscrupulous defendant, anxious to put off the day \n     of judgment so that more assets can be hidden, to remove a \n     case on the eve of a state-court trial, resulting in an \n     automatic delay of months or even years before the case can \n     be tried in federal courts. The House bill creates an even \n     further opportunity for delay, by overruling Rule 23(f)'s \n     provision for obtaining permission from a court of appeals to \n     appeal a class certification ruling, and providing for a \n     right to trigger an automatic appeal and for an automatic \n     stay of discovery while the appeal is pending, even if there \n     is no legal basis for an appeal.\n\n\n            Lack of Justification for a Remedy This Sweeping\n\n       We understand that the supporters of the bill base its \n     justification on assertions that the courts in one or two \n     counties in the United States have too freely granted class \n     certifications in some cases. The bill is not limited to \n     curing claimed abuses in one or two counties, but applies \n     equally to the 3,066 counties in which there is not even a \n     claimed problem. In general, courts have been very responsive \n     to complaints of abuses, and have instituted corrective \n     measures, such as allowing petitions for interlocutory appeal \n     from orders granting or denying class certification. The \n     Federal courts have adopted Rule 23(f) of the Federal Rules \n     of Civil Procedure, and many State courts have followed suit.\n       The need for a state court to interpret the law of a \n     different state has never been seen as an adequate \n     justification for removal. Article III of the Constitution \n     does not recognize this as a basis for federal-court \n     jurisdiction and the Full Faith and Credit clause already \n     requires state courts to accord respect to the laws of their \n     sister states. As a practical matter, state courts frequently \n     have to interpret the law of different states even in \n     individual cases properly brought in state courts. This is \n     part of the normal business of the state courts, not a reason \n     for federal jurisdiction.\n\n\n                         Constitutional Issues\n\n       There is substantial cause to doubt the constitutionality \n     of a massive transfer of state-court cases to federal courts. \n     This transfer would effectively substitute federal-court Rule \n     23 class certification standards for the class certification \n     standards set forth in the statutes, court rules, and case \n     law of the various states. Unbelievably, such a substitution \n     would provide for dismissal of cases that do not meet the \n     federal standards even though they may meet the standards of \n     the states, and even though the standards of the states may \n     meet every requirement of due process. The Supreme Court has \n     not devoted nearly as much attention to construing the Tenth \n     Amendment to the Constitution as it has devoted to the \n     Eleventh Amendment, but passage of S. 274 or its House \n     counterpart may change that comparative lack of attention.\n       Similarly, the ``minimal diversity'' trigger for removal \n     under S. 274 and its House counterpart creates an untested \n     and unprecedented expansion of diversity jurisdiction under \n     Article III of the Constitution. Congress certainly has the \n     power to expand diversity jurisdiction to reach cases in \n     which one party on one side of a case is diverse from any \n     adverse party, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1335(a)(1) (the \n     interpleader statute). There is, however, substantial cause \n     to doubt the constitutionality of these bills' approach, in \n     which diversity is based on the citizenship of any potential \n     class members. We say ``potential'' because the bill allows \n     removal of a case before the state court has even decided \n     that the case should go forward as a class action, or what \n     the scope of the class should be. While class members are to \n     be protected by the court, and while their rights may be \n     determined by the class action, they are not full parties to \n     the action. Prior to the determination of liability and a \n     proceeding on class members' individual remedies, unless \n     they intervene and become parties, they do not \n     individually have the right to take discovery from the \n     defendants, to file motions in court, to question \n     witnesses, to introduce evidence, or even to take an \n     appeal from an adverse ruling. Yet, under this legislation \n     they would be allowed to remove a complex state law class \n     action into federal court.\n       At the very least, litigation over the constitutionality of \n     the bill is likely to embroil the courts for years and is yet \n     a further reason to oppose the enactment of this misguided \n     legislation. We urge you to consider our concerns about the \n     unwarranted changes this legislation mandates as well as the \n     very troubling aspects of the legislation that undermine fair \n     administration of justice in the federal and state judicial \n     systems in the United States.\n       Respectfully submitted.\n\n\n[[Page S12876]]\n\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Added to the ``removal-at-any-time'' problems in the \nlegislation are the hurdles established by Senator Feinstein's \namendment adopted in committee. I know it is well intentioned, but the \namendment does set up cumbersome requirements for determining whether \nan action is to be heard in State or Federal court. It provides that a \nFederal judge may use five factors in deciding jurisdiction of a class \naction where between one-third and two-thirds of the plaintiffs are \nfrom the same State as primary defendants; and if two-thirds of the \nplaintiffs are from the same State as the primary defendants, then the \ncase will stay in State court.\n  The bill fails to determine when this measurement takes place during \nthe litigation. It has been my experience that membership in class \nactions frequently changes. So the two-thirds provision or the middle-\nthird provision which is subject to judicial discretion could open up \neasily to judicial gamesmanship. The defendant could try to remove a \ncase from State court at the discovery stage. Someone takes a \ndeposition and finds, oops, this is going against us, let's get it out \nof here. Or the judge has made a ruling they do not like and they know \nthey can never win on appeal, let's get it out of here, even after all \nthe evidence is presented, or after closing arguments.\n  Actually, the way the bill is currently written, it could be done \nwhile the jury is deliberating. Considering the vast resources of \ndefendants in many class actions as compared to plaintiffs, it will \nmake it more difficult for class members to ever have a final ruling, \nwhere the bill will cause unnecessary and expensive litigation. It \nfavors corporate defendants.\n  I like to think the scale of justice is even. This tilts the scale of \njustice and it will bounce right off the stand.\n  If there were ever a time to think about protecting the consumers, \nthe investors, and the employees, think of Enron, WorldCom, and other \ncorporate scandals. Think of the employees who worked so hard and were \ntold to put their money in the corporate pension program. Look what has \nhappened. Look at the employee investors. I am not too concerned about \nsome of the leaders of a company like that. They might have to sell one \nof the $50 million homes or they no longer will have several billions \nof dollars but rather several hundred million, but I am worried about \nthe people who truly had their lifesavings or their pension destroyed \nor their company destroyed.\n  This bill does nothing to make the Enrons of the world more \naccountable for their actions. Actually, the bill undercuts Congress's \nother efforts to make the companies more responsible or accountable for \ntheir misdeeds or more susceptible to penalties when they do wrong. The \nlegislation makes it more difficult for the victims of corporate \nwrongdoing to join to make those companies accountable. It seems to me \nthat is the exact opposite to the approach we should be taking.\n  Now, not surprisingly, consumers and those representing consumers \nobject strongly to the enactment of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \nnumerous consumer advocates in opposition to this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, U.S. \n           Public Interest Research Group,\n                                                 February 5, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: we are writing to you as organizations \n     dedicated to working on behalf of the rights and interests of \n     consumers to express our opposition to S. 274, the ``Class \n     Action Fairness Act of 2003.'' This legislation will deny \n     consumers access to adequate redress against corporate \n     wrongdoers and will undermine the ability of state courts to \n     hear cases primarily concerned with their own citizens. While \n     class actions are an important and efficient legal tool for \n     consumers to use in order to obtain redress from wrong doing, \n     we are concerned about abuses of the class action process and \n     agree that these abuses should be curtailed. However, S. 274 \n     will not eliminate these abuses, but rather would create \n     barriers to a consumer's effort to obtain redress. S. 274 is \n     unfair to consumers and we urge you to oppose it.\n       Congress should work to prevent unjust enrichment by \n     lawyers at the expense of consumers in class action \n     settlements. This legislation however, will not solve this \n     problem. Instead, while purporting to curtail class action \n     abuses, S. 274 will virtually wipe out state class actions \n     and thus remove an important venue for redress of injury or \n     fraud for consumers. The bill will make it more difficult for \n     consumers to obtain effective and efficient judicial relief \n     for injuries caused by defective products, fraud in the \n     marketplace, or discrimination.\n       Congress should seek to hold negligent wrongdoers \n     accountable for their actions. Yet this bill does just the \n     opposite: it places obstacles to accountability by providing \n     fewer incentives for companies to keep their products safe \n     and their action fair.\n       S. 274 will create numerous barriers to participating in \n     class actions by permitting defendants to remove most state \n     class action suits to federal court. This removal from state \n     court to federal court would leave consumers shuttling back \n     and forth between state and federal court because while a \n     consumers' class could meet state law class certification \n     requirements, it could fail to meet the class certification \n     requirements set forth in federal law. This will result in \n     the federal courts' denial of class certification and \n     dismissal (not remand) of the case. A consumer would not have \n     two options, none of which would result in access to a court \n     proceeding. A consumer could bring the claim in state court \n     as an individual action. However, individual cases would be \n     impractical to litigate, would not have the same deterrent \n     effect, and would have the potential to overwhelm state \n     courts. In the alternative, consumers could re-file an \n     amended class certification in state court. This re-filing \n     again opens the door created by S. 274 for the defendant to \n     remove the case to federal court.\n       S. 274 will also clog an already overburdened and \n     understaffed federal judiciary and slow the pace of \n     certifying class action cases. This considerable delay will \n     likely result in the denial of justice to injured consumers. \n     In addition, this removal to federal court takes away an \n     important and traditional function of state courts and will \n     slow--and in some cases thwart--the continual interpretation \n     of state law. Federal court decisions on issues of state law \n     solve the narrow legal issue of the particular case without \n     providing legal precedent for future state court cases of the \n     particular state law in question. Further, class actions are \n     among the most resource-intensive cases before the federal \n     judiciary. U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist \n     has expressed concern that this bill will result in further \n     overloading an already-backlogged federal docket.\n       We agree that class actions can be made a more effective \n     means of consumer redress; we support changes to the class \n     action system that would prevent unjust enrichment and act as \n     a deterrent to future wrongdoing, including modification of \n     notice requirements and simplification of certification \n     procedures and standards; but the jurisdictional changes \n     mandated by S. 274 are designed to impede class actions, not \n     to make them fairer or more efficient.\n       This class action ``reform'' legislation is especially \n     inappropriate in light of recent events. Just last year in \n     the scandals of Enron, WorldCom and others, we saw how \n     corporations need to be held accountable for their actions. \n     Class actions effectively hold corporations accountable.\n       S. 274 does not provide the right solution to a class \n     action system in need of reform; rather it makes it more \n     difficult for consumers to obtain redress, to hold bad actors \n     accountable for the harms they caused, and to deter future \n     misconduct. The Class Action Fairness Act will substantially \n     reduce the effectiveness of one of the most important legal \n     tools consumers now have.\n       We strongly urge you to oppose S. 274. We urge you to do \n     the right thing for American consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sally Greenberg,\n       Senior Product Safety Counsel, Consumers Union.\n     Rachel Weintraub,\n       Assistant General Counsel, Consumers Federation of America.\n     Chris Peterson,\n       Consumer Attorney, U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Judicial Conference of\n\n\n                                            the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chair, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: I write to provide you with the \n     recently adopted views of the Judicial Conference of the \n     United States, the policymaking body for the Federal \n     judiciary, on class action legislation, including S. 274, the \n     ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2003,'' introduced by you and \n     other cosponsors.\n       On March 18, 2003, the Judicial Conference unanimously \n     adopted the following recommendation: ``That the Judicial \n     Conference recognize that the use of minimal diversity of \n     citizenship may be appropriate to the maintenance of \n     significant multi-State class action litigation in the \n     Federal courts, while continuing to oppose class action \n     legislation that contains jurisdictional provisions that are \n     similar to those in the bills introduced in the 106th and \n     107th Congresses. If Congress determines that certain class \n     actions should be brought within the original and removal \n     jurisdiction of the Federal\n\n[[Page S12877]]\n\n     courts on the basis of minimal diversity of citizenship and \n     an aggregation of claims, Congress should be encouraged to \n     include sufficient limitations and threshold requirements so \n     that Federal courts are not unduly burdened and States' \n     jurisdiction over in-State class actions is left undisturbed, \n     such as by employing provisions to raise the jurisdictional \n     threshold and to fashion exceptions to such jurisdiction that \n     would preserve a role for the State courts in the handling of \n     in-State class actions. Such exceptions for in-State class \n     actions may appropriately include such factors as whether \n     substantially all members of the class are citizens of a \n     single State, the relationship of the defendants to the forum \n     State, or whether the claims arise from death, personal \n     injury, or physical property damage within the State. \n     Further, the Conference should continue to explore additional \n     approaches to the consolidation and coordination of \n     overlapping or duplicative class actions that do not unduly \n     intrude on State courts or burden Federal courts.''\n       The Conference in 1999 opposed the class action provisions \n     in legislation then pending (S. 353; H.R. 1875, 106th Cong.). \n     That opposition was based on concerns that the provisions \n     would add substantially to the workload of the Federal courts \n     and are inconsistent with principles of Federalism. The March \n     2003 position makes clear that such opposition continues to \n     apply to similar jurisdictional provisions.\n       The Conference recognizes, however, that Congress may \n     decide to base a statutory approach to remedy current \n     problems with class action litigation by using minimal \n     diversity jurisdiction. The Conference position recognizes \n     that the use of minimal diversity may be appropriate to the \n     maintenance of significant multi-State class action \n     litigation in the Federal courts. The use of the term \n     ``significant multi-State class action litigation'' focuses \n     on the possibility of multi-State membership within the \n     plaintiff class. The actions to which this term applies are \n     nationwide class actions, as well as class actions whose \n     members include claimants from States within a smaller region \n     or section of the country. Minimal diversity in these cases \n     would facilitate the disposition of litigation that affects \n     the interest of citizens of many States and, through their \n     citizens, affects the many States themselves.\n       Parallel in-State class actions in which the plaintiff \n     class is defined as limited to the citizens of the forum \n     State are not included within the term ``significant multi-\n     State class action litigation.'' Parallel in-State class \n     action might share common questions of law and fact with \n     similar in-State actions in other States, but would not, as \n     suggested herein, typically seek relief in one State on \n     behalf of the citizens living in another State. Accordingly, \n     parallel in-State class actions would not present, on a broad \n     or national scale, the problems of State projections of law \n     beyond its borders and would present few of the choice of law \n     problems associated with nationwide class action litigation. \n     In addition, to the extent problems arise as a result of \n     overlapping and duplicative in-State class actions within a \n     particular State, the State legislative and judicial branches \n     could address the problem if they were to create or utilize \n     an entity similar to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict \n     Litigation, as some States have done.\n       Further, the position seeks to encourage Congress to \n     include sufficient limitations and threshold requirements so \n     as not to unduly burden the Federal courts and to fashion \n     exceptions to the minimal diversity regime that would \n     preserve a role for the State courts in the handling of in-\n     State class actions. The position identifies three such \n     factors that may be appropriately considered in crafting \n     exceptions to minimal diversity jurisdiction for class \n     actions. These factors are intended to identify those class \n     actions in which the forum State has a considerable interest, \n     and would not likely threaten the coordination of significant \n     multi-State class action litigation through minimal \n     diversity. (The factors do recognize certain situations where \n     plaintiffs from another State may be included in an otherwise \n     in-State action.)\n       The first factor would apply to class actions in which \n     citizens of the forum State make up substantially all of the \n     members of the plaintiff class. Such an in-State class action \n     exception could include consumer class action claims, such as \n     fraud and breach of warranty claims. The second factor would \n     apply to a class action in which plaintiff class members \n     suffered personal injury or physical property damage within \n     the State, as in the case of a serious environmental \n     disaster. It would apply to all individuals who suffered \n     personal injuries or losses to physical property, whether or \n     not they were citizens of the State in question. The third \n     factor recognizes that it may be appropriate to consider the \n     relationship of the defendants to the forum State. Such \n     consideration is not intended to embrace the term ``primary \n     defendants'' (or a similar term), which language has been \n     used in past and present class action bills as part of an \n     exception to minimal diversity. Such a reading could extend \n     minimal diversity jurisdiction to cases in which a single \n     important defendant lacked in-State citizenship. While the \n     relationship of the defendant to the forum may have some \n     bearing on State adjudicatory power, an insistence that all \n     primary defendants maintain formal in-State citizenship is \n     too limiting and may preclude in-State class actions where a \n     defendant has sufficient contacts with the forum State, \n     regardless of citizenship.\n       We would appreciate your consideration of these comments \n     and the position of the Judicial Conference. Should you or \n     your staff have any questions, please contact Michael W. \n     Blommer, Assistant Director, Office of Legislative Affairs, \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, at (202) 502-1700.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Last year a group of investors recovered millions of \ndollars in lost investments under State corporate fraud laws and a \nState class action case in Baptist Foundation of Arizona v. Arthur \nAndersen. These investors, mostly elderly, banded together to \nsuccessfully recoup $217 million from Arthur Andersen. Why? Because of \nquestionable accounting practices surrounding an investment trust. The \ncase is just one example of how a State-based class action litigation \nholds corporate wrongdoers accountable and helps defrauded investors \nrecoup their losses.\n  Like most Vermonters, I am a strong supporter of the environment. But \nI look at this bill and I think, what a green light for polluters and \nothers responsible for environmental damages to avoid accountability in \ncourt. So many polluters, who would fear class action suits if they \nwere to violate the law, now know they could get caught. With this \nlegislation, they might take the old idea of: Go ahead and pollute; \nnobody gives a hoot. They are going to get away with it.\n  This legislation removes almost all important environmental class \nactions from State to Federal court. Not only does this deny State \ncourts the opportunity to interpret their own State's environmental \nprotection laws, but it also hampers and deters plaintiffs in pursuing \nimportant environmental litigation. It means we Vermonters would not \nhave a say in our own courts--or those in Utah or in any other State.\n  Under this bill, environmental class action suits may not get \nlitigated, reducing the incentive to keep our environment clean. \nPlaintiffs' attorneys may not be willing to take these high-risk, high-\ncost, and time-consuming cases, particularly when what they are looking \nfor is injunctive relief. That is an injunction to stop the polluter \nfrom polluting. Intentionally or not, this bill protects polluters and \nignores innocent victims of their negligence.\n  Just a few months ago, as I recall, we read about a horrible toxic \ndumping situation in Alabama and a monumental settlement in State court \nto clean up an entire community. It was in State court, though--in \nState court.\n  In Anniston, AL, the Monsanto Company manufactured PCBs--\ncarcinogens--from 1929 to 1971. For more than 40 years, in arrogant--\narrogant--disgusting disregard of people's health and the environment, \nMonsanto dumped untreated, unfiltered waste from its PCB plant into the \nstreams and landfills of Anniston. They never let the residents--many \nof whom actually worked, and worked very hard, for Monsanto--they never \nlet them know of the horrific risk to their environment and their \nhealth.\n  When the undeniable truth of Monsanto's malfeasance became clear, \nseveral thousand residents of Anniston sued in State court. They \nrecently won a liability jury verdict. When the case moved into the \ndamages phase, Monsanto was not out there defending and saying: Well, \nwe did not do something bad. They knew they did something terrible. \nThey did not start arguing about: Well, people were not injured by it. \nThey knew they were injured by it.\n  So what did they do? They tried to get the judge removed. That is \nwhat they tried to do. Although the Alabama Supreme Court, a \nconservative supreme court, had already held that the trial judge was \nacting properly, Monsanto continued to oppose his participation. They \ntried everything they possibly could do to confuse people and escape \nfacing up to the issues. They then had to focus on the merits of the \ncase and settled with the local residents for $600 million and pledged \nto pay additional cleanup costs for the town.\n\n  The Alabama Supreme Court, the Alabama State court, did this very \nwell. Not under this bill. Under this bill, it would have been yanked \naway from those courts, yanked away from the Alabama State court, \nyanked away from the Alabama Supreme Court, and stuck into Federal \ncourt.\n  Why? More than 100 people lived in Anniston. Even though all the \npeople\n\n[[Page S12878]]\n\nsuffered, they lived just a block or a driveway from each other. We, \nthose of us who say we really care about States having their rights, \nwould reach down and yank it right out of the State and say: You are \nnot good enough to handle the case that involves your own people.\n  Cases such as this one would provide hard evidence that our State-\nbased civil justice system is working--it is working--to protect the \nenvironment and to protect victims of polluters, and there is no reason \nto prefer a Federal reform for resolution of their claims. State \ncourts, unlike the Federal courts, have a sound understanding of \nevolving local law and the open dockets to resolve conflicts in a \nmanner that would protect our society from polluters.\n  In fact, we ought to at least ask, Do the Federal courts want this? \nThe Judicial Conference, headed by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, \nwrote a letter in March of this year opposing this bill because its \n``provisions would add substantially to the workload of the federal \ncourts and are inconsistent with principles of federalism.''\n  They singled out serious environmental disasters as an example of \nclass actions that should remain in State courts.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Judicial Conference said: What are \nyou doing to us? Why are you sending these cases over there? State \ncourts can handle them better.\n  I would be a very wealthy person if I had a couple dollars for every \ntime I heard speeches or statements from my fellow Senators about how \nwe have to better respect our individual States. After all, that is why \nwe have a Senate. Each one of the 50 States has equal representation \nhere to make sure the States are not subsumed in the Federal system. \nThose who would support this bill are giving the back of their hand to \ntheir States and saying: You are not smart enough, you are not good \nenough to take care of the laws of your own State.\n  Numerous organizations devoted to the protection of the environment \noppose this bill, including Clean Water Action, Earthjustice, the \nEnvironmental Working Group, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the \nMineral Policy Center, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the \nSierra Club, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n  These advocates conclude, in a letter, this bill ``would benefit \npolluters at the expense of people and communities harmed by public \nhealth and environmental disasters.'' I ask unanimous consent their \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    April 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch, Chair,\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Leahy: We are \n     writing to express our opposition to S. 274, the so-called \n     ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2003.'' This legislation would \n     not be fair to citizens bringing class action cases based on \n     state environmental or public health protection laws who wish \n     to have their cases heard by their state's courts. The bill \n     would allow corporate defendants in pollution class actions \n     to remove virtually any type of state environmental law case \n     from state court to federal court, placing such cases in a \n     forum that could be more costly, less timely, and \n     disadvantageous to the citizen plaintiffs. We urge you to \n     oppose this anti-environmental legislation.\n       Class actions protect the public's health and the \n     environment by allowing people with similar injuries to join \n     together for more efficient and cost-effective adjudication \n     of their cases. All too often, hazardous spills or toxic \n     contamination from one source affects large numbers of \n     people, not all of whom may be citizens of the same state. In \n     such cases, a class action lawsuit based on state common law \n     doctrines of negligence or nuisance, or upon rights and \n     duties created by state statutes, is often the best way of \n     resolving the claims. Recent examples of such incidents \n     include the Asarco lead contamination in eastern Omaha, the \n     Nicor Gas mercury spills in suburban Chicago, and emissions \n     from an illegally operated rock quarry in San Rafael, \n     California--incidents that harmed thousands of people--as \n     well as many cases in which injured plaintiffs have sought \n     access to medical monitoring in the wake of a community's \n     toxic exposure.\n       S. 274 would benefit polluters in state environmental class \n     actions by allowing them to remove these claims from state \n     courts that may be better equipped to handle them to federal \n     courts where the judges are likely to be less familiar with \n     state law. This removal could occur even if the citizen \n     plaintiffs object.\n       The bill would even allow polluters to remove to federal \n     courts cases brought by more than one hundred plaintiffs even \n     if the citizens do not seek certification as a class. One \n     such case is underway now in Anniston, Alabama, where a state \n     court jury is currently deciding damages to be paid by \n     Monsanto and Solutia for injuring more than 3,500 people the \n     jury found were exposed, with the companies' knowledge, to \n     cancer-causing PCBs over many years. There is little doubt in \n     the Anniston case that, had S. 274 been law, the defendants \n     would have tried to remove the case from the state court \n     serving the community that suffered this devastating harm.\n       Allowing defendants to remove to cases such as these that \n     properly belong in state court--even cases based solely on \n     state law--is not only unfair to the injured parties in the \n     state law cases, it will needlessly delay justice for all in \n     the overburdened federal courts, creating delays for those \n     parties in environmental cases whose claims must be heard in \n     federal court, as well as for other parties who require a \n     federal forum.\n       Last month, the Judicial Conference of the United States \n     wrote to your committee stating the continued opposition of \n     the Judicial Conference to broadly written class action \n     removal legislation. Their letter states that, even if \n     Congress determines that some ``significant multistate class \n     actions'' should be brought within the removal jurisdiction \n     of the federal courts, Congress should include certain \n     limitations and exceptions, including for class actions ``in \n     which plaintiff class members suffered personal injury or \n     personal property damage within the state, as in the case of \n     a serious environmental disaster.'' The letter explains that \n     this ``environmental harm'' exception should apply ``to all \n     individuals who suffered personal injuries or losses to \n     physical property, whether or not they were citizens of the \n     state in question.'' S. 274 does not provide any exception \n     for environmental harm cases.\n       As U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Rehnquist has stated in \n     the past, ``Congress should commit itself to conserving the \n     federal courts as a distinctive judicial forum of limited \n     jurisdiction in our system of federalism. Civil and criminal \n     jurisdiction should be assigned to the federal courts only to \n     further clearly defined national interests, leaving to the \n     state courts the responsibility for adjudicating all other \n     matters.'' The so-called ``Class Action Fairness Act'' does \n     not conserve the federal forum but would allow corporate \n     polluters who harm the public's health and welfare to exploit \n     that forum whenever they perceive an advantage to defending \n     class actions in federal court, regardless of whether the \n     class action would be better adjudicated in a state court.\n       We urge you to oppose S. 274, legislation that would \n     benefit polluters at the expense of people and communities \n     harmed by public health and environmental disasters.\n           Sincerely,\n       Joan Mulhern, Senior Legislative Counsel, Earthjustice \n     Legal Defense Fund.\n       Debbie Sease, Legislative Director, Sierra Club.\n       Lexi Shultz, Legislative Director Mineral Policy Center.\n       Sara Zdeb, Legislative Director, Friends of the Earth.\n       Paul Schwartz, National Campaigns Director, Clean Water \n     Action.\n       Richard Wiles, Senior Vice President, Environmental Working \n     Group.\n       Erik Olson, Senior Attorney, Natural Resources Defense \n     Council.\n       Anna Aurilio, Legislative Director, U.S. Public Interest \n     Research Group.\n       Rick Hind, Legislative Director, Greenpeace.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as colleagues may have gathered, I am not \nin favor of this piece of legislation, the Class Action Fairness Act. \nMan, I have heard things. There ought to be a law against misleading \nlabels on legislation we pass because this would break the law. These \nmany injured parties who have valid claims would have no effective way \nto seek relief. Class action suits have helped win justice and expose \nwrongdoing by the polluters, the big tobacco companies, and the civil \nrights violators, and brought about Brown v. Board of Education, as I \nsaid earlier. It gives average Americans at least a chance for justice. \nWe should not take that chance for justice away from the American \npeople.\n  So I hope Senators will consider the harm this bill would do the \nAmerican people and to their constituents and join me in opposition.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, as I said, we found time to get highway money \nfor Iraq, but we do not have time to pass the highway bill for America. \nWe had time to get money to improve police departments and law \nenforcement in Iraq, but we do not have time to pass a bill to do the \nsame here for Americans.\n  We had time to pass legislation to help military veterans in Iraq, \nbut we can't find time to pass legislation for veterans in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course, I yield to my friend from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S12879]]\n\n  Mr. REID. As I am here in the Chamber today, there are four members \nof the Appropriations Committee: The Presiding Officer, the senior \nSenator from Vermont, the Senator from Nevada, and the Senator from \nIllinois. This morning I asked, Why aren't we able to do appropriations \nbills? The House has gone home. They are AWOL. So matters that we have \nto resolve in conference we can't do either. We have six that have not \npassed this body. The Senator from Vermont hit the nail on the head.\n  I commented this morning, we can think of a lot of reasons that the \nbills haven't passed. One is what the President has done with the \nmonetary functions of this country. The economy is in disastrous shape. \nIf we did these appropriations bills now, there would be a focus on \neach bill. The people of America would say: Well, they can't do that \nfor us. Look at what they have just done for Iraq with $21 billion.\n  So the Senator from Vermont hit the nail on the head. I compliment \nhim for recognizing the problem we have. What are we going to do? I \nthink the Senator from Vermont will agree, we are going to have an \nomnibus bill with as many as 10 appropriations bills jammed into it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Did the Senator say omnibus or ominous?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct. We are going to have an ominous \nomnibus bill. It is too bad we are going to do that because it will be \na massive document. It will be done at the last minute. There will be a \nlot of little things jammed in there by the leadership. And then, of \ncourse, as the Senator knows, conferences that we do have are just one-\nsided. They don't include us in them. It is a funny way to run the \ncountry. This decision has been made by a Republican President, a \nRepublican-controlled House and Senate.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate the comments of my friend from Nevada. I \ncan't think of any person who has worked harder to help get legislation \nthrough. The senior Senator from Nevada has a good reputation of \nworking with both Republicans and Democrats. There are two primary \nreasons. One is the fact that he knows legislation better than anybody \nelse around here. Secondly, he is totally honest and truthful to \neverybody.\n  It is frustrating because, again, there is legislation for highways \nin Iraq, but not in the United States, all these other things. We \npassed a transportation bill. That would mean 90,000 jobs right there \nthat we could put Americans back to work.\n  I thank him for saying that. I don't care if people want to spend \ntime on this bill. It is a terrible bill. If they want to spend time on \nit, let's at least get the appropriations bills done. Let's answer the \nquestions of our veterans, whether the benefits will be there or not; \nanswer the questions police officers have about benefits; answer the \nquestions those in education have, whether the money will be there.\n  I see my good friend, the senior Senator from Illinois. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking Democrat in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, as well as Senator Reid of Nevada, \nfor coming to the floor today to discuss the agenda of Congress. It is \nworthy of reflection.\n  Some of us went home last week after the vote dispirited because this \nadministration was afraid to offer the Iraq reconstruction package as \nan up-or-down vote. They believed--and I think they were right--they \ncouldn't pass it. So many Members of Congress had so many questions and \nreservations, the only way it could pass was to combine it with the \nmoney for our troops. Many of us, looking at this terrible Faustian \nbargain, had to vote for the bill to support the troops, believing \nthat, frankly, if it were my child, someone near or dear to my family, \nas it is for so many people in Illinois, I wouldn't want to shortchange \nthe troops one penny. So we ended up passing about $15 or $16 billion \nin reconstruction for Iraq.\n  Trust me, stories are already pouring in about some of the \nquestionable contracting that is going on over there. There is real \ndoubt among some as to whether this money will achieve the goal we are \nseeking. We want peace in Iraq. We want stability. We want our troops \nto come home. But we want to do it in the right way.\n  So far, this administration, since the declaration of the military \nvictory, has seen a long string of embarrassments and defeats and \nsetbacks. There have been pretty pictures painted by some on the other \nside who have gone there, but they can't overcome the reality of every \nmorning's newscast which tells about another soldier being killed or \nanother 10 soldiers being maimed.\n  I have visited with some of those soldiers who have returned from \nIraq. Their lives will never be the same. To say they got by because \nthey were simply wounded is to overlook the obvious. Many of them will \ncarry scars for the rest of their lives because of a policy of this \nadministration which, frankly, has not stood the test of time.\n  The reason I think it is important to reflect on that is to consider \nwhere we are today. Now that we have moved from the issue of Iraq, we \nare back on an issue which is near and dear to the Republican \nleadership in Congress as well as to the White House. Take a look at \nthe agenda of this Congress and particularly what we are discussing \ntoday. It is an agenda which attempts to slow down the legitimate \nresponsibilities of government directly through Executive orders and \nindirectly with historic deficits.\n  Yes, this fiscal conservative, compassionate Republican President has \nstood by and watched as we have reached record depths in terms of debt \nin America. Although he can point to a recession which he blames on the \nprevious President, which is fair game in Washington, he can point to a \nwar on terrorism, the fact is, most of this deficit is his own \ncreation.\n  President Bush's tax policy, his economic plan has been a failure for \nAmerica's economy. But it has been a dramatic success for those who \nwere praying for a bigger deficit. I don't know who that might be, but \nif you were looking for a President to deliver the biggest deficit in \nthe history of the United States, this President has done it. That \ndeficit, of course, shortchanges us when we need to really pursue the \nvaluable and vital functions of government.\n  There are some things which only government can do. I know my friends \nfrom the conservative side of the political spectrum hate to concede \nthis point, but there are certain things only government can do. \nCertainly military defense is one. Defense against terrorism is \nanother. But there are others, and they will come to our attention as \nwe consider the debate before us on a bill related to class action \nlawsuits.\n\n  The agenda of the Republicans in Congress and the President is one \nthat is guided by the naive belief that the balance of power within our \nGovernment is outdated. It is an agenda which would close the \ncourthouse doors to ordinary Americans in the name of penalizing trial \nlawyers but continue to protect the most politically powerful. This is \nnothing new in government. The people who have the power to line the \nHalls of Congress with their lobbyists in their three-piece suits and \nfancy shoes are well represented. They are the voices you hear when you \ncome to vote for a bill.\n  The voices that are not heard are those of consumers and families and \nworking people who are disadvantaged time and again by these special \ninterests. The Class Action Fairness Act is a special interest piece of \nlegislation designed exclusively to protect those who are wealthy and \npowerful from even being held accountable in court.\n  When you look at the options available to us, if you have a President \nwho really doesn't care to work for consumers and working families, and \na Government which is unresponsive because of that President or the \nlack of funds, and a Congress unwilling to address these same issues, \nthere is only one place for an American to turn. That is the court \nsystem. So what this Congress tries to do time and time again is to \nclose the doors of the courthouse so that that family, that consumer, \nthat small business, that individual doesn't have a chance to go into \nthe courthouse and ask for justice. They are doing that with this class \naction bill.\n  Whether the agenda is driven by the White House, the leadership of \nthe House of Representatives, the committees on the floor of the \nSenate, the not\n\n[[Page S12880]]\n\nso invisible hand of the right-wing agenda is busily at work. We see it \nin the nominees sent up for lifetime appointments to the Federal \njudiciary, men and women who are not even close to the center stripe of \npolitical thinking, in the hopes that if you cannot close the \ncourthouse door, make sure there is a judge on the bench who will rule \nconsistently on behalf of the wealthy and powerful in America.\n  Some will say what I am saying sounds a lot like class warfare. I can \nrecall what Warren Buffet, one of the wealthiest men in America, told \nus a few weeks ago. He came to a luncheon on Capitol Hill and spoke to \na group of Senators and talked about President Bush's tax cuts for the \nwealthy. This wealthy man from Omaha, NE, said, ``Some people say this \nis class warfare.'' He said, ``I want to tell you something. It is \ntrue, and my class is winning the war.''\n  That is a fact. They have won the war with the President's tax cuts. \nThey will continue to win the war when it comes to closing the \ncourthouse doors. The agenda is being driven by President Bush and his \ngang of compassionate conservatives. It is not just this issue of \nlitigation and tort reform. It stretches in so many directions. This is \nan administration that wants to drill for oil in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge rather than to demand that automobile manufacturers in \nDetroit make more fuel-efficient cars, which they can do. The \ntechnology is available. But this administration would much rather \ninvade a pristine wildlife refuge set aside by President Eisenhower 50 \nyears ago than pick up the phone and say to the Big Three in Detroit \nthat you have to do better. We need more fuel-efficient cars and we are \ngoing to support legislation to make it happen.\n  That shows you where they are coming from. They would much rather \ndrill in a wildlife refuge than to ask for more fuel efficiency from \nthe automobile manufacturers. This is an administration that cuts \neducation funding for schoolchildren to pay for tax benefits for the \nwealthiest people in America. It is an administration that would \nrestrict background checks on gun purchasers while protecting gun \nmanufacturers from liabilities. Rather than to make certain that we \nkeep guns out of the hands of people with criminal records or a history \nof mental illness, they say instead, in the name of a second amendment, \nwe cannot ask those questions and, if we do, we cannot keep the records \nlong enough for law enforcement to use them. It is a constitutional \nright as far as they are concerned under the second amendment.\n  Yet when it comes to gun manufacturers making defective products and \ndangerous products and selling them, this administration falls over \nbackward in an effort to protect them from any liability in court, this \nadministration which would cap the compensation of injured victims of \nmedical negligence, medical malpractice, and never question the \ninsurance companies that continually make mistakes and charge the most \noutrageous premiums. Now we are forced to debate a bill that divides \ninstead of unifies us.\n  It is especially troubling at a time when so many appropriations \nbills have not even been considered in the Senate and we are going to \nwork on this bill for special interest groups. The majority leader \nbrought this bill before us instead of an appropriations bill. Here we \nare after October 1, at a time when we should have passed all of our \nappropriations bills, but instead of addressing the immediate needs of \nGovernment, we are going to address the immediate needs of the special \ninterest groups.\n\n  I find it interesting that the bill before us is not the bill that \npassed the Judiciary Committee, which I served on a little earlier this \nyear. There is a provision back in the bill called a mass tort \nprovision. I will not go into all the details of it other than to tell \nyou the special interests have won again. There was a bipartisan motion \nin the Judiciary Committee--I am not sure there was debate--to delete a \nsection of the bill for so-called mass tort actions. It was a motion by \nSenator Specter, a Republican, and Senator Feinstein, a Democrat. It \nwas removed without controversy.\n  Guess what happened. That bill was thrown away. The bill before us \ntoday reinstates this prohibition against mass tort actions. That is \nfundamentally unfair, and we knew that. The special interest groups \nprevailed again.\n  How fair is the Class Action Fairness Act before us? It is not about \nfairness or justice. It is about protecting the powerful against legal \nchallenges from the little guy. Who wants this bill? Who wants this \nclass action bill? I will tell you those who line up on the side of \nthis bill. It is the major tobacco companies, including Philip Morris, \nwhich is sick and tired of being sued by those who have been damaged by \ntheir deadly tobacco products. They have come to the Republican \nCongress and prevailed on them to make it more difficult for the \nvictims of those tobacco products to come to court. So the tobacco \ncompanies want this bill to pass. Gun manufacturers, understanding \ntheir exposure to liability by selling defective guns, selling them in \nquantities where they knew or should have known they would fall in the \nhands of criminals, don't want to be sued in court anymore. Even though \nthe death rate in America--on the streets of Chicago, New York, and \nWashington--continues to climb from gun murders, this bill says the \nvictims are going to have a tougher time suing the gun manufacturers.\n  Those who pollute want this bill. Those involved in environmental \npollution are less likely to be sued because of this bill.\n  Others include the pharmaceutical companies, every insurance company \nin America that I know of, the National Association of Manufacturers, \nand Financial Services Roundtable. The list of special interest groups \nis very lengthy.\n  There is another group on the other side who oppose this bill--an \ninteresting coalition. Listen to those who have come out in opposition \nto the bill. The first name on the list may be the most curious. It is \nChief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, William Rehnquist. Why? \nBecause this bill shifts a lot of class action lawsuits from State \ncourts to Federal courts. Chief Justice Rehnquist understands that the \nFederal courts are not in a position to deal with these lawsuits. He \nsaid this is a bad bill; it is bad for the administration of justice in \nAmerica. He is not a bleeding heart when it comes to consumer cases. \nHis precedents and rulings will speak for themselves. But he says this \nbill is bad, and he is right.\n  Then the list of organizations--which I will not read--is two pages \nlong. These groups are a clear indication of why it should not be \npassed. I will say generically that many of the leading medical groups, \nincluding the American Cancer Society, the Heart and Lung Society, many \nleading environmental groups in America, and almost every one of the \nmajor consumer groups in America, say this is a bad bill. It will keep \nordinary Americans from having their day in court.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.\n\n   National Organizations Opposed to Federal Class Action Legislation\n\n       AARP.\n       AFL-CIO.\n       Alliance for Justice.\n       Alliance for Retired Americans.\n       American Association of People with Disabilities.\n       American Cancer Society.\n       American Heart Association.\n       American Lung Association.\n       Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United with the \n     Million Mom March.\n       Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids.\n       Center for Disability and Health.\n       Center for Responsible Lending.\n       Clean Water Action.\n       Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n       Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety.\n       Consumers Union.\n       Earthjustice.\n       Environmental Working Group.\n       Families USA.\n       Friends of the Earth.\n       Gray Panthers.\n       Greenpeace.\n       Homeowners Against Deficient Dwellings.\n       Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n       Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n       Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n       Mineral Policy Center.\n       National Asian Pacific Legal Consortium.\n       National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n       National Association of Consumer Advocates.\n       National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems.\n       National Campaign for Hearing Health.\n\n[[Page S12881]]\n\n       National Partnership for Women & Families.\n       Natural Resources Defense Council.\n       National Workrights Institute.\n       National Women's Health Network.\n       National Women's Law Center.\n       People for the American Way.\n       Public Citizen.\n       Service Employees Union International.\n       Sierra Club.\n       Tobacco Control Resource Center.\n       Tobacco Products Liability Project.\n       USAction.\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n       Violence Policy Center.\n       Women Employed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Government Organizations Opposed to Federal Class Action Legislation\n\n       Judicial Conference of the United States.\n       Conference of Chief Justices.\n       Attorney General of California, Bill Lockyer.\n       Attorney General of Illinois, Lisa Madigan.\n       Attorney General of Maryland, J.

This is a classic battle between the biggest companies in \nAmerica, that don't want to face legal responsibilities, and the most \nvulnerable people in America, who have no other recourse but the \ncourts. Consumers, environmentalists, gun control advocates, and civil \nrights champions often turn to the class action process of our civil \njustice system because the Government--beholden to the special interest \ngroups and the corporate agenda--simply is unwilling to take on these \nsame big corporations.\n  Unfortunately, when you pit these two sides together on Capitol Hill, \nconsumers don't have a chance. This bill is a clear indication of that.\n  The bill is fundamentally unfair and unnecessary. How can you be sure \nit is only the plaintiffs who are guilty of abusing forum shopping but \nnever the defendant? That is the argument being made. They say we have \nto restrict the people who can bring lawsuits in court.\n  The argument on the other side is that there are so many frivolous \nlawsuits. The honest answer is that there are some frivolous lawsuits, \nand there always will be in a system open for any individual to file a \nlawsuit. On the other hand, we know many of these lawsuits--and I will \nrecount several later on--give clear indications and evidence of the \nfact that many people who are sued in class action lawsuits have a real \nresponsibility to the consumers and the American people that they don't \nmeet.\n  I am concerned when they tell me the bill will restrict their ability \nto fight for rights of consumers and victims of corporate malfeasance, \nand I hope the sponsors can carry their burden in explaining to the \nAmerican people why they believe this bill will not tilt the advantage \nto the corporate defendants.\n  To the extent there are abuses in the class action process, it should \nbe addressed with a scalpel, not a sledgehammer, which this bill does. \nIf the problem is concentrated only in a handful of State courts, the \nsolution isn't to remove every case to Federal court. That is what this \nbill does.\n  The American Tort Reform Association, which represents all of the \nspecial interest groups that would close the courthouse doors, \nobviously championed this bill. They released a study recently which I \nfind amazing and, in a way, offensive.\n  In their report, entitled, ``Bringing Justice to Judicial Hellholes \n2002,'' this organization identified 13 counties or cities that they \ndefine as ``judicial hellholes,'' because they supposedly attract \nlawsuits from around the Nation to plaintiff-friendly courts.\n  What does that mean? If you are a lawyer in some part of the country \nand want to file a class action suit, this association argues that you \ncan shop around to find the friendliest judges who will certify your \nclass. That is the first step in a class action suit. The court has to \nbasically certify under State law whether you can gather together the \nindividuals you call your ``plaintiffs' class'' to sue a defendant. \nThey argue that in some parts of America it is more likely to be \ncertified than not. They characterize those as judicial hellholes. One \nof them is near and dear to me because it is in my home State, in \nMadison County, IL. I was born in St. Clair County, the adjoining \ncounty. I am familiar with Madison County and most of the people who \npractice law there and the judges on the bench.\n  Well, with all of their valiant and well-funded national research, \nthe American Tort Reform Association came up with about a dozen \n``hellhole'' counties, and a few more they call ``honorable mentions.''\n  That is about a total of 20 counties they have identified out of over \n3,000 counties in the United States and more than 18,000 cities, \nvillages, and towns--20 problem counties out of 21,000 cities and \ncounties. That is fewer than .0001 percent of all the counties and \ncities in the country.\n  Clearly, if that is where the problem lies, with 20 places, why would \nwe pass Federal legislation to affect every county and every city in \nAmerica? Yet the solution the sponsors seek is exactly that.\n  Let me speak for a moment about the real story of Madison County \nbecause it has been recounted over and over by the advocates of tort \nreform as an outrageous, out-of-control situation.\n  It is said there have been hundreds of consumer class action cases \nfiled in the last few years and rarely are any not certified for trial. \nThat is what the American Tort Reform Association says. Yet while the \nnumber of filings increased, the number of consumer class action \ncertifications in that county has actually declined over the last 2 \nyears.\n  State judges, including those in Madison County, are disposing of \nfrivolous consumer class action cases by refusing to certify them for \ntrial. Moving them to Federal court simply transfers the responsibility \nfor making that determination.\n  Let me give some numbers so we can get a feel for one of these \njudicial ``hellholes'' from the groups that advocate this legislation.\n  Madison County, IL: Consumer class actions filed--1999, 12; 2000, 39; \n2001, 60; 2002, 76; 2003, 44 as of July 2.\n  Let's go back for each of those years and find out how many were \nactually certified to go forward and be tried. In 1999, 12 were filed, \n6 were certified; in 2000, 39 filed, 14 certified; in 2001, 60 filed, 2 \ncertified; in 2002, 76 filed, 1 certified; in 2003 so far, 44 filed, \nnone certified.\n  Does this sound like a situation out of control? The sum total of all \nthe class action lawsuits for these 5 years so far is 23 over 5 years--\n23 class action lawsuits in Madison County, IL, the so-called judicial \n``hellhole.'' Frankly, the arguments made on the floor just are not \nborne by the facts.\n  Additionally, of 166 verdicts that were reached in all cases filed in \nMadison County, 55 resulted in no monetary verdicts to plaintiffs. Only \n11 verdicts in the 166 cases tried resulted in verdicts in excess of $1 \nmillion. The median verdict for all cases in Madison County, IL, is \n$28,649.\n  If there are problems in any jurisdiction or any State, they can be \nsolved there. In Alabama, for example, one of the favorite targets for \ncriticism by tort reformers, the State supreme court reprimanded a few \nState judges who had certified numerous classes.\n  In Mississippi, another jurisdiction frequently mentioned by \nsupporters of class action reform, the State legislature recently \nrepealed Mississippi's venue and joinder statutes, making it more \ndifficult to bring mass tort claims.\n  Removing these cases to Federal court does not solve the problem. In \nfact, it is going to heap more of a burden and demand for more \nspecialization and responsibility on our Federal courts, many of which \nare already overburdened.\n  I see my colleagues are on the floor. I am going to take a few \nminutes to point out the kinds of lawsuits about which we are talking.\n  When the average person hears ``class action lawsuit,'' they may not \nhave an idea of what it is about. I would like to give a few examples \nof class action lawsuits and understand, I hope, for a moment that \nthose who are coming to the floor trying to restrict the rights of \nplaintiffs to come into a class and file\n\n[[Page S12882]]\n\na lawsuit have to face the reality of the history of class action \nlegislation. We will find in these cases some recurring themes, but the \nmost recurring theme is this:\n\n  The plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit were usually damaged a very \nslight amount or in a very limited way individually or as families, but \nwhen you take together the sum total of all the damage done by the \ndefendant, it becomes substantial. If someone--Senator Leahy used this \nexample in committee--if someone overcharges a person 2 cents a gallon \nfor gasoline so that each time they fill up they lose 40 cents, there \nis not a great loss to an individual. But when you put that together in \nterms of the millions of people buying gasoline, one can understand \nthat if the defendant corporation has been guilty of fraud or wrong \ndealing, they have made millions of dollars at the expense of 40 cents \na fill-up of individual consumers. So class action lawsuits bring all \nthese consumers in one group against a corporation that may have harmed \nthem only a slight amount individually.\n  Let me give some examples. Foodmaker, Inc., the parent company of \nJack-in-the-Box restaurants, agreed to pay $14 million in a class \naction settlement in the State of Washington. The class included 500 \npeople, mostly children, who became sick in early 1993 after eating \nundercooked hamburgers tainted with E. coli. The victims suffered from \na wide range of illnesses, from more benign sicknesses to those that \nrequired kidney dialysis. Three children died. The settlement was \napproved in 1996. So 500 individual families, instead of suing Jack-in-\nthe-Box and its parent company Foodmaker, came together as a class \nbecause that corporation was selling products so tainted and \nadulterated that it led to death and serious illness--500 people, $14 \nmillion, but deaths were involved in the process.\n  Let me give another example. General Chemical of Richmond, CA. On \nJuly 26, 1993, the chemical oleum, a sulfuric acid compound, leaked \nfrom a railroad tank car. The leak caused a cloud to spread directly \nover North Richmond, CA, a heavily populated community. Over 24,000 \npeople sought medical treatment because of that leak. General Chemical \nentered into a $180 million settlement with 60,000 northern California \nresidents who were injured and sought treatment for the effects of that \npollution. Individual plaintiffs received up to $3,500.\n  What is the likelihood that if you personally or a member of your \nfamily ended up going to a hospital or a doctor and had $500 or $600 or \n$1,000 in medical bills that you would turn around and hire a lawyer \nand sue General Chemical responsible for that illness in your family? I \ndon't think the likelihood is very strong. But when they brought \ntogether the 60,000 people who were damaged because of this \nenvironmental leak of a sulfuric acid compound, the company agreed to \npay $180 million to some 60,000 people.\n  Let me give another example. Beech-Nut Corporation, and its parent \ncompany Nestle, were accused of deceptive business practices, guilty of \nselling--listen to this--Beech-Nut and Nestle were found guilty of \nselling sugar water labeled as pure apple juice for infants. After \npassing blame back and forth between companies and suppliers, they \neventually agreed to settlements of $3.5 million to reimburse consumers \nwho unknowingly fed their babies sugar water instead of apple juice. Is \nthat the kind of thing that merits a lawsuit? In an individual \nsituation you may ask, How sick is the baby?\n\n  The bottom line is, these companies were trying to make money by \ndeceiving parents into believing they were selling a nutritious product \nand ended up paying $3.5 million because of it.\n  Class action lawsuits by consumers who as individuals would never \nhave a day in court, but coming together finally found justice in their \nState courts, a justice which is threatened by the so-called class \naction fairness bill which is before us today.\n  There was a class action lawsuit brought against Ford Motor Company \nfor defective ignition systems in millions of cars that stalled on \nhighways, and Mobile Corporation paid a $14 million settlement because \nof a class of residents in New Orleans who, after a fire at a Mobile \nOil refinery and scattered debris sent volatile and hazardous compounds \nin the air, were forced to evacuate. The settlement was $13.4 million \nto those exposed to this pollution from the Mobil Oil refinery.\n  It was a class action lawsuit against a corporate giant. How many of \nthose individual families would stand together seeking justice? In this \ncase, they did stand together successfully. Individually would they \nhave gone to court? Highly unlikely.\n  Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa paid a $14.6 million settlement in \nthree class action lawsuits because of fraudulent billing practices. \nBlue Cross apparently negotiated secret discounts with hospital and \nproviders and failed to pass those along to those who should have \nreceived them--their customers. The list goes on and on.\n  I see several of my colleagues on the floor. I will close and say I \nam sure we are going to return to this issue in a short time. I ask my \ncolleagues in the Senate who may not have practiced law, who may not be \nfamiliar with class action lawsuits to please do the following: Read \nthese cases. Understand class action lawsuits are not always frivolous \nideas.\n  I can recall some that were. There was a lawsuit brought by a class, \nnot certified, for all the people who bought Milli Vanilli records, and \nthen came later to learn that those two people were not even singing on \nthe records. To me, that is a joke, a bad one. It is a fraud on the \npublic but certainly not deserving of a class action suit.\n  How can one compare that to companies that sell tainted and \nadulterated food, to companies that deceive parents about the \nnutritious value of the foods they sell, or companies that are engaged \nin pollution that endangers the lives of individuals? Those companies \nneed to be held accountable.\n  This bill tries to absolve them from liability, to move the cases to \nFederal court, to make it more difficult to push the classes together, \nand make it more difficult to recover. These are real live stories of \nordinary families and people who will ultimately lose if this bill \npasses.\n  I hope the Senate has the good sense to stop this in its tracks, \nstand up for consumers and working families who need a voice in this \nChamber even if they cannot afford a lobbyist in the hallway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nyielding the floor for a few moments. The Senator may wish to resume \ndebate following my remarks.\n  I want to present a counterpoint, I guess, to the opinions of my \ndistinguished colleague. I think he made a very eloquent case in favor \nof why we should have class action lawsuits in this country, and I \nwould simply point out to my colleagues that this bill does not in any \nway diminish our ability to have worthwhile class action lawsuits. In \nfact, I think the intent of the bill that is passed out of the \nJudiciary Committee and which Senator Hatch spoke about earlier this \nafternoon is, in fact, to make the process for class action suits \nbetter, fairer, and more beneficial to the plaintiffs.\n  One of the things the bill would do is create a consumer bill of \nrights to protect the class action plaintiffs, the actual clients of \nthe class action lawyers. We have all heard about cases in which a \nclass action lawsuit is filed, and in the end, the defendant \ncorporation settles for millions of dollars paid to the lawyer and all \nthe clients, or the plaintiffs get a coupon or something of \ninsignificant value. So contrary to the impression created by Senator \nDurbin, I want to make it clear to my colleagues that this bill does \nnot in any way seek to do away with class action lawsuits. In fact, we \nseek to make them better and more beneficial to the plaintiffs, the \nclients themselves, and cut down on some of the abuses.\n  I rise to support S. 1751, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2003, and \nI do so today with a special interest in the commonsense fairness of \nthis legislation. There is, in my State of Illinois, as mentioned by \nSenator Durbin, one of the infamous venues that have come to be \ncommonly described as ``judicial hellholes,'' State courts where \nplaintiffs' lawyers know they can file abusive, frivolous, and even \nextortionate class action lawsuits against defendant companies \noperating nationwide and\n\n[[Page S12883]]\n\nget results they could not get in the vast majority of fair \njurisdictions elsewhere in the United States.\n  It is an abuse that must stop. Under S. 1751, every person's right to \nfile a lawsuit is preserved. Every current legal theory for relief may \nstill be advanced. Under S. 1751, a class action lawsuit can be filed \njust as easily as it can be today. S. 1751 is a limited and commonsense \napproach to a widely recognized abuse in our judicial system. It simply \nmakes truly national lawsuits easier to hear in Federal court, and it \nsimply requires judges to take a close look before approving some of \nthe greedier and more abusive features of class action litigation, such \nas coupon settlements that I mentioned at the outset, where lawyers get \nmillions of dollars and class action members get virtually worthless \ncoupons.\n  My State has the dubious distinction of hosting one of the judicial \nhellholes to which Senator Durbin was referring. In fact, if anyone has \nbeen following the editorial page in the Wall Street Journal, they have \nwritten several editorials about this county. It is Madison County, IL. \nIt is in southwestern Illinois, across the Mississippi River from St. \nLouis. If my colleagues have never been to Madison County, it is a \nsuburban county with a surge in shuttered plants and steel mills and a \nnew cottage industry in abusive class action litigation.\n\n  Several recent studies have looked at class actions in the Madison \nCounty courts, and here is what they found: Over a 2-year period, the \nnumber of class actions in the county increased by 1,850 percent. In \n1998, there were only two class actions filed in Madison County, a \nnumber consistent with a community with Madison County's size and \neconomic base.\n  During 2000, the number rose to 39. During 2001, 43 new class action \nlawsuits were filed, another 10-percent increase, and the upward trend \nis increasing.\n  As of the middle of this year, Madison County was already up to 39--I \nthink Senator Durbin said 43 cases--as of July of this year. That puts \nit on pace to break its own record.\n  These findings suggest that Madison County has one of the highest \nclass action filing rates in the country. Indeed, according to an \narticle in the St. Louis Post Dispatch, Madison County has developed a \nnationwide reputation as the place to file nationwide class actions, \neven though it only has one-tenth of 1 percent of the U.S. population. \nIt has about 259,000 people.\n  Here is another troubling statistic: In recent years, only a few \nthousand class actions were filed annually in the entire Federal court \nsystem. That amounts to a per capita rate of about 7.6 class actions \nfor every million residents. In Madison County in 1999, the per capita \nrate of State court class actions was nearly 9 times higher, with about \n61 class actions filed per million people.\n  These are not local disputes. The vast majority of class actions in \nMadison County were brought on behalf of nationwide classes. The \npercentage seeking nationwide class action status is a whopping 81 \npercent. In Madison County, lawyers have sought to certify classes over \nthe last 3 years that included all Sprint customers nationwide who have \never been disconnected on a cell phone call--I am sure that has \nhappened to all of us--all RotoRooter customers nationwide whose drains \nwere repaired by allegedly unlicensed plumbers, and all consumers in \nthe Nation who purchased limited edition Barbie dolls that were later \nallegedly offered for a lower price elsewhere.\n  Why were all these suits filed in Madison County? Why were they not \nfiled in Utah, Idaho, Arizona, or State courts elsewhere in Illinois? \nWell, because a few lawyers have figured out that the judges in Madison \nCounty are very friendly to plaintiffs. It is no surprise that the same \nfive firms appeared as counsel in approximately 45 percent of the cases \nfiled during the 1999-to-2000 period, and that most of these firms are \nnot located in Madison County.\n  Of the 66 plaintiffs' firms that appeared in the Madison County cases \nfiled during 1999 and 2000, 56, or 85 percent, listed office addresses \noutside of Madison County.\n  These studies present a real mystery. Lawyers from all over the \ncountry are flocking to Madison County, IL, to file class actions on \nbehalf of people who do not live in Madison County, against companies \nthat do not reside in Madison County, concerning events that did not \noccur in Madison County.\n  What is wrong with this picture? Does anybody really think that it is \njust an accident that these lawyers from all over the country are \nflocking into Madison County with their cases?\n  As the Washington Post recently noted in an editorial criticizing \nclass action abuses, having invented a client, the lawyers also get to \nchoose a court. Under the current absurd rules, national class actions \ncan be filed in just about any court in the country.\n  Large, nationwide class actions should be in Federal court, not in \nsome small county court in some remote location that has nothing to do \nwith the parties or the case. This is an abuse of the system, plain and \nsimple. We are nowhere near the outer perimeter of tort reform here. \nThis is an easy one. This is common sense, a simple, honest, \nstraightforward reform narrowly tailored to achieve fairer results in \ncases of truly national significance.\n  I urge you, Mr. President, and all my colleagues, to support S. 1751.\n  I yield the floor.\n  If none of my other colleagues wishes to speak at this time, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it was my privilege to be in the chair \nduring the exchange of views between the two Senators from Illinois. I \ncould not resist the opportunity to take the floor now and add my \nexperience to that which has been referred to.\n  The senior Senator from Illinois spoke of those who did not have a \nlegal background, and I fit into that category. I have never been in \ncourt, except as a juror and occasionally as a witness. I have never \nbeen to law school. However, I would just share this one experience \nwith the Senate with respect to class action lawsuits and how they can \nbe abused.\n  When my father left the Senate, he was invited, as is often the case \nfor those who have senior experience in business, to serve on a number \nof boards of directors. He went on one particular board, thinking it \nwas a relatively safe kind of activity for him, only to be distressed \nat the beginning of the next calendar year when he was served with this \npile of papers. There was a lawsuit being filed on behalf of the \nshareholders of that particular company, and my father was named as the \nprincipal defendant.\n  Somewhat disturbed by this, he called the general counsel of the firm \nand asked what was going on.\n  Oh, said the general counsel, nothing to worry about. You are named \nbecause members of the board of directors are listed alphabetically and \nBennett comes ahead of any other name. So you are named: Bennett et al. \nDon't worry, we will take care of this.\n  He said: Of what am I being accused? Of what is the board being \naccused?\n  Well, said the general counsel, this happens every year. He said: The \nmembers of the board have a compensation plan that is tied to the \nprofitability of the company. Whenever the company increases its \nprofitability by formula, the directors' pay increases by a similar \nformula amount.\n\n  My father said: That's very clear. It's outlined. What is the cause \nof this class action lawsuit being brought on behalf of all of the \nshareholders of the company?\n  Well, said the general counsel, this lawyer every year files a \nlawsuit on behalf of the shareholders, claiming that the board of \ndirectors is looting the company for its own purposes. That is, members \nof the board are trying to enrich themselves on the basis of this \nincrease in compensation at the expense of the shareholders.\n  My father said: What do we do? Do you go to court and prove that this \nis a legitimate activity?\n  No, said the general counsel, that costs too much money. For us to go \nto court would cost us more in legal fees than the amount the lawyer \nwill settle for.\n  What amounts are we talking about, my father asked.\n  He was told by the general counsel: The lawyer who files this suit \nwill settle for $100,000. It would cost us more\n\n[[Page S12884]]\n\nthan $100,000 to defend our position, so every year when the formula \nkicks in and the directors' compensation is increased, the lawyer files \nhis lawsuit, we send him a check for $100,000, the lawsuit goes away, \nand we forget this until the next year.\n  That is extortion, plain and simple. Yet the general counsel would \nsay, with some accuracy, the shareholders are better served if we \nsimply pay him his $100,000 than if we go to court and defend \nourselves. Even though we would win, we would end up paying $200,000 or \n$250,000 or some number like that. So, he said, we have come to the \nconclusion the best thing to do for the shareholders is simply settle \nthis class action lawsuit every year for $100,000. The lawyer knows we \nwill do that. So every year he files the lawsuit, we send him the \ncheck, the plaintiffs in whose behalf he is suing get nothing because \nhis legal fee for filing the suit is $100,000, and we simply go through \nthis charade every year.\n  I am happy to report that this particular lawyer, as I understand it, \ndecided to do this in some other instances and Merrill Lynch, the large \nbrokerage firm, took him to court. They spent close to $1 million in \nlegal fees proving he was wrong and, furthermore, proving he had acted \nin a frivolous manner and ultimately put him out of business. The \nshareholders of Merrill Lynch were paying for an action that benefited \nthe shareholders of the company on whose board my father sat, and many \nothers.\n  We can be grateful that Merrill Lynch was willing to accept that \nfinancial burden in order to put a stop to this practice. But it \ndemonstrates that standing on the floor of the Senate and deciding how \nvaluable class action lawsuits are does not properly address the \nproblem that this, and similar legislation, has sought to solve.\n  I wanted to add that personal experience to the debate that has been \ngoing on here so anybody who is following the debate will understand \nthat it is not a question of whether one should allow class action \nlawsuits. It is not a question of whether plaintiffs are entitled to \nrelief as a result of joining a class. It is a question of cleaning up \nabuses that are carried on by lawyers who say, in the words of one of \nthem: I have a perfect law practice. I have no clients.\n  They file class action lawsuits on behalf of classes, but they are \nnot in fact real clients. The lawyers benefit, ultimately to the \ndetriment of the shareholders of the companies that are being sued. \nThese shareholders are individuals. We are not talking about companies \nas if they were abstract entities. They are individuals who are being \nhurt by improper practices. Those are the kinds of practices this \nlegislation seeks to resolve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/20/senate-section/article/S12884-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12884-S12885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF MARGARET CATHARINE RODGERS, OF FLORIDA, TO BE UNITED \n       STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nMargaret Catharine Rodgers, who has been confirmed to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Florida.\n  Judge Rodgers has had an impressive legal career. After graduating \nmagna cum laude from California Western School of Law, she clerked for \nJudge Lacey Collier on the U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Florida. She then entered private practice with the \nPensacola law firm of Clark, Partington & Hart as an associate. After 4 \nyears, she went to work for the West Florida Medical Center Clinic as \nits general counsel and director of human resources. She then returned \nto private practice, where her areas of expertise focused on medical \nliability and employment law. Last year she was appointed as a Federal \nmagistrate judge in the Northern District of Florida, which reflects \nthe high regard in which the judges of that court hold her.\n  I am confident that Judge Rodgers will continue to serve with \ncompassion, integrity, and fairness as a Federal district court judge.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the selection of Margaret Catharine Rodgers \nto be the nominee for the Northern District of Florida serves as an \nexample of how the judicial nominations process should work. Judge \nRodgers was interviewed and recommended by Florida's bipartisan \njudicial selection commission. This selection commission was created by \nSenators Graham and Nelson in negotiated agreement with the White House \nand it has produced a consistent stream of talented and well-respected \nattorneys for the lifetime appointments on the district courts in \nFlorida.\n\n[[Page S12885]]\n\n  Judge Rodgers currently serves the Northern District of Florida as a \nmagistrate judge. She received a ``well qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association, having proven her qualifications in the \ndistrict in which she will serve, on the bench, in private practice, \nand in her community. Prior to becoming a lawyer, Judge Rodgers served \nfor several years in the United States Army and received several \ncommendations for her service.\n  With tonight's vote on Judge Rodgers' nomination, the Senate will \nhave confirmed a total of 165 judicial nominations of President George \nW. Bush. Despite all of the false charges of obstruction leveled by the \nWhite House and Republican Senators, we have now reached a historic \nlevel of confirmations of judicial nominations.\n  In less than 3 years, President Bush has now equaled the total number \nof judges appointed by President Reagan in his first 4 full years in \noffice. Republicans tout President Reagan as the ``all-time champ'' in \njudicial appointments and yet he attained 165 confirmations at the \nconclusion of his first 4-year term in office, while President Bush has \nachieved the same benchmark in less than 3 years in office. President \nReagan's entire first term saw a Republican Senate majority enabling \nthe President to achieve that milestone. That Democrats in the Senate \nhave cooperated with President Bush to exceed it is extraordinary and \nreveals the truth about the confirmation process. Only a few of the \nmost extreme of President Bush's judicial nominees have been blocked.\n  Of course, you will not hear Republican Senators or the White House \ntell the public today that this historic level of appointments has been \nreached, that President Bush has matched President Reagan's first-term \njudicial appointments with 15 months remaining in his term. You will \nnot hear that truth from this administration. The Senate has opposed \nonly the most extreme nominees and has moved cooperatively and \nexpeditiously on less controversial nominees.\n  The record will reflect that Democrats have worked hard to balance \nthe need to fill vacancies on the Federal bench with the imperative \nthat the judges chosen will be fair to all people. With this \nconfirmation, there are now only 40 vacant seats in the Federal bench. \nUntil this year, this mark had not been reached in 13 years or during \nthe entire Clinton administration, when more than 50 judicial nominees \nwere blocked from receiving confirmation votes. Had we not authorized \nalmost 20 judgeships last year, the vacancies might be in the 20's.\n\n  President Bush is on pace to appoint judges far in excess of those of \nany other President in American history. In fact, this President has \nhad so many vacant seats to fill because Senate Republicans did such an \neffective job of blocking scores of Clinton nominees with impunity. \nWhen I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee in mid-2001, we \ninherited 110 vacancies. In a little more than 2 years since then \nDemocrats and Republicans have worked together to confirm 165 judicial \nnominees of President Bush. The White House and the Republicans in the \nSenate refuse to declare themselves victorious in their efforts to \nappoint a historic number of judges chosen by the President. They \ninsist on seeing the glass half empty, when it is nearly full to the \nbrim. They refuse to take any steps to address the fact that fully 20 \npercent of President Clinton's judicial nominees were blocked from \ngetting votes when Republicans controlled the Senate. In those 6 years, \nthey allowed only 248 judicial nominees to be confirmed and blocked \nanother 63. Today, in less than 3 years, President Bush has achieved \nwhat it took President Reagan four full years to achieve 165 judicial \nconfirmations.\n  Nominations from bipartisan selection commissions can proceed \nexpeditiously. Judge Rodgers received a committee hearing within weeks \nof her paperwork being completed and she will be confirmed less than a \nmonth after her hearing. Her confirmation could have occurred even \nsooner since she has been pending on the floor for several weeks but I \nam happy that the majority leader has decided to turn to her \nconfirmation this afternoon.\n  Judge Rodgers' appointment to the district court in the Northern \nDistrict of Florida will bring her legal career full circle since her \nfirst job out of law school was as a judicial clerk on this very court. \nI am pleased to cast a vote for her confirmation today and I \ncongratulate Judge Rodgers and her family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am pleased that the Senate is finally reaching the \npoint of moving ahead with this very important legislation. We call \nthis the Class Action Fairness Act of 2003 because, quite frankly, \neverything dealing with class action lawsuits--maybe I should not say \neverything because I admit there is a very important role in some \ninstances for class action lawsuits, but the way the regime is working \nout now is very unfair, particularly in instances where consumers get \npractically nothing and lawyers representing the class get millions.\n  That is not an occasional happening. That is happening quite \nregularly. So the current class action system is rife with problems \nwhich undermine the rights of both the plaintiffs and defendants alike; \nhence, our legislation. Class members are often in the dark about their \nrights, with class lawyers driving lawsuits and driving the settlement. \nClass members receive court and settlement notices in hard-to-\nunderstand legalese. Many class action settlements only benefit the \nlawyers, with little or nothing going to the class members. We are all \nfamiliar with class action settlements where the plaintiffs received \ncoupons of little value or no value, and the lawyers received all the \nmoney available in the settlement agreements.\n  More and more, we are seeing lawyers bringing frivolous lawsuits \nwhich are of no real interest to class members but are just a bonanza \nof quick and easy legal fees for the class lawyers because companies \nwant to settle those cases rather than expend lots of money in \nfrivolous litigation defense.\n  I have been invited into class action lawsuits. One gets a notice in \nthe mail, probably because they did business with a particular company. \nMaybe it is because I am in agriculture and a family farmer that I \nmight get some notices of this, but I can speak to the fact that--and \nobviously I hope people know I am not a lawyer, but the legalese that \ncomes in these notices informing you why you might possibly be a member \nof a class, or you might possibly benefit, quite frankly I do not give \nthose notices much consideration. Maybe I should. Maybe there is a \njackpot out there that I could get something out of. I do not know.\n  It really is not very inviting to the people who may have been \ninjured. Even if it is inviting, and they join it and they win, they \ncould get a coupon; whereas the lawyers are going to get millions of \ndollars.\n  In addition to current class action rules, the current ones are such \nthat a majority of the large nationwide class actions can only proceed \nin our State courts, when these are clearly the kinds of cases that \nshould, in fact, be heard in Federal courts. It makes sense that these \nclass action cases have the opportunity to be heard in Federal courts \nbecause these cases involve lots of money, citizens from all across the \ncountry, and issues of nationwide interest.\n  To further compound the problem, the present rules are easily gamed \nby\n\n[[Page S12886]]\n\nunscrupulous lawyers who steer class actions to certain preferred State \ncourts where judges are quick to certify a class and approve a \nsettlement with little regard to class member interest and the parties' \ndue process rights. For example, class lawyers manipulate pleadings to \navoid removal of the lawsuit to Federal court by claiming that their \nclient suffered under $75,000 in damages in order to avoid meeting a \nFederal threshold, even though their client may have suffered greater \ninjury. Class lawyers craft lawsuits to defeat the complete diversity \nrequirements by ensuring that at least one named class member is from \nthe same State as the defendant.\n\n  These are just a few of the games that are played and the \ngamesmanship tactics that we have heard of that lawyers like to utilize \nto bring down the entire class action legal system.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act that is before us will address some of \nthe most egregious problems with the class action system; yet \npreserving class action lawsuits is an important tool which brings \nrepresentation to the unrepresented.\n  I will briefly summarize what this bipartisan bill does. First, the \nact requires that notice of proposed settlements in all class actions, \nas well as all class notices, must be in clear, easily understood \nEnglish and must include all material settlements, including amounts \nand sources of attorney's fees.\n  When that happens, and I get one of those notices, I am going to read \nit and maybe I can make a decision that I ought to join that class. But \nI am not going to mess around with trying to have some lawyer interpret \nto me whether or not I ought to be in a class action lawsuit when I get \nthose notices.\n  These notices that most plaintiffs receive are written in small print \nand in confusing legal jargon. Since plaintiffs are giving up their \nright to sue, it is important that they understand what they are doing \nand the ramifications of their actions.\n  Second, this act requires that State attorneys general, or other \nresponsible State government officials, be notified of any proposed \nclass settlement that would affect the residents of their State. This \nprovision helps protect class members because such notice would provide \nthese State officials with an opportunity to object if the settlement \nterms are unfair for their citizens.\n  Third, this act disallows bounty payments to lead plaintiffs so \nlawyers looking for victims cannot promise them unwarranted payoffs to \nbe their excuse for filing a suit. The bill also prevents class action \nsettlements that discriminate on the basis of geography so that one \nplaintiff does not receive more money than other class members who have \nbeen equally injured just because that plaintiff lives near the \ncourthouse.\n  Fourth, the act requires that courts closely scrutinize settlements \nwhere the plaintiffs only receive coupons or noncash awards while the \nlawyers get the bulk of the money. The bill requires the judge to make \na written finding that the settlement is fair and reasonable for class \nmembers. A court will still be able to find that a noncash settlement, \nas in the case of injunctive relief banning some type of bad conduct, \nis fair and reasonable, but a court would also be able to throw out \nsham settlements where lawyers get big paychecks while the plaintiffs \nget nothing or, as I have said before, worthless or almost worthless \ncoupons.\n  The bill also requires the judicial conference to report back to \nCongress on best practices in class action cases and how to best ensure \nfairness of a class action settlement. Finally, the Class Action \nFairness Act allows more class action lawsuits to be removed from State \ncourt to Federal court, either by a defendant or even by an unnamed \nclass member. However, the bill is drafted to ensure that truly local \ndisputes would continue to be litigated in State court. Current law \nprovides that class lawyers can avoid removal of a class action to \nFederal court if the individual claims are $75,000 or less, even if \nhundreds of millions of dollars in total are at stake, or if just one \nclass member is from the same State as the defendant.\n\n  Our bill would eliminate the ``complete diversity'' rule but leave in \nState court class actions with fewer than 100 plaintiffs, class actions \nthat allow less than $5 million, class actions in which a State entity \nis a primary defendant, and class actions brought against a company in \nits home State if two-thirds or more of the class members are residents \nof that State.\n  We have been working on finding a fair solution to the class action \nproblem for several years. For the past four Congresses, Senator Kohl, \nSenator Hatch, and others have joined me, as the main sponsor of this \nbill, in studying the problems with the class action system and working \non a way to deal with such egregious abuses of our tort system.\n  Over the years, the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have \nconvened numerous hearings on these class action abuses, making very \nobvious the need for reform. The House has passed similar versions of \nthe class action bill in several Congresses, and they have done it with \nstrong bipartisan support, so frankly I don't understand why we are \nrunning up against opposition on the other side to even bringing this \nbill up for discussion.\n  In the Senate, in the 105th Congress, I held hearings in the \nJudiciary Committee's Administrative Oversight Subcommittee and then \nmarked up the first Grassley-Kohl class action bill. In the 106th \nCongress my subcommittee held another hearing on class actions and the \nJudiciary Committee marked up and reported out class action \nlegislation. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on class actions in \nthe 107th Congress, and in this Congress the Judiciary Committee marked \nup the language of the bill we are considering today.\n  Chairman Hatch, Senator Kohl, and I worked closely with Senator \nFeinstein of California to make sure that more in-State class actions \nstayed in State court. We also worked with Senator Specter to make sure \nhis concerns relative to class actions were also addressed.\n  The bill then was approved by the Judiciary Committee and it was \napproved on a solid, bipartisan vote. I wanted to elaborate on the \nhistory of this bill to show how much time Congress has spent on the \nproblems with our class action system and all the work and all the \ncompromises that have been put into this bipartisan bill.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act has garnered increasing support over \nthe years and I expect it will receive even greater support now with \nthe significant changes we have made in the Judiciary Committee several \nmonths ago. We need class action reform badly. Both plaintiffs and \ndefendants alike are calling for change in the area of tort and class \nactions. The Class Action Fairness Act is a good, modest bill that will \nhelp curb many problems that have plagued the class action system. The \nbill will help class members know what their rights are, increase their \nmembers' protection, and ensure the approval of fair settlements. It \nwill allow nationwide class actions to be heard in the proper forum, \nand that is the Federal courts, but keep primarily State class actions \nwhere they ought to be, in State court.\n\n  It will preserve the process, but put a stop to the more egregious \nabuses. It will also help to put a stop to the more frivolous lawsuits \nthat are very much a drag on the economy.\n  I hope we can proceed to this bill. We are very happy to consider \namendments. This bill is something that has had so much work on it over \nthe last four Congresses that it should move ahead. The situation has \nnot improved any during that period of time. In fact, TV magazine-type \nprograms are full of stories about continuous abuse of the tort class \naction system. We have situations where someone, a lowly county judge \nin some State, is making a decision that is applicable to all 50 States \nin a way that should not be done by one isolated judge. These are cases \nthat should be decided at the Federal level and have something that is \ngoing to be a Federal policy applying to all 50 States done by a \nFederal court as opposed to a county court system.\n  There are a lot of things we can say about this bill, but it is about \ntime. I would think there would be some embarrassment on the other side \nof the aisle, considering the fact of the bipartisan support of this \nbill in the House of Representatives and how it has come out of our \nSenate Judiciary Committee with solid, bipartisan support, considering \nmodifications that have been\n\n[[Page S12887]]\n\nmade for Democratic Senators who were not part of the original \nbipartisan coalition putting this bill together, that the legislative \nprocess is working, the Senate is working its will, and now we are up \nagainst what could be a stone wall of resistance that is unjustified.\n  I hope we can move forward. We will find out with votes very shortly.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. 1751, with all first-degree \namendments relevant to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is a \nvery important piece of legislation. A significant majority of Senators \non this side of the aisle want to do something about this legislation \nwhich is known as the class action legislation. But we are terribly \ndisappointed with the procedure that has been used to get us to where \nwe are. For example, Senator Breaux has been one of our point people on \nthis and has worked very hard to try to get the issues resolved. \nEveryone knows how fair he is and how he is the dealmaker here in the \nSenate.\n  For this and many other reasons, on behalf of many Senators on this \nside, we reluctantly object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I \nsend a cloture motion to the desk to the pending motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a group of \npeople who are giving their time and energy to make southern Nevada a \nbetter place to live.\n  Like every other city in the Nation, the city of Las Vegas faces the \nchallenge of providing essential services on a tight budget. And the \nmost essential service of all is public safety.\n  This challenge is particularly difficult in the Las Vegas area, which \nis adding more than 6,000 new residents a month. While the national \naverage is about 2.5 police officers for every thousand residents, we \nhave only 1.7 officers per thousand in Clark County.\n  Simply put, we need more police officers in Las Vegas and Clark \nCounty. There is no easy answer to this problem--but fortunately there \nare hundreds of people who have become part of the solution.\n  The Las Vegas police department sponsors a Metro Volunteer Program \nthat allows citizens to assist police officers in a variety of tasks, \nfrom assisting tourists to arranging for abandoned vehicles to be \ntowed.\n  Some of these volunteers visit schools to present programs on safety \nand crime prevention, while others compile databases that are used to \ntrack crimes and solve cases.\n  For every hour that a volunteer performs one of these tasks, that is \nanother hour that a sworn police officer is out on the street fighting \ncrime.\n  Over the past year, 318 volunteers contributed more than 42,000 hours \nof service to the Las Vegas Metro Police Department. That is the \nequivalent of 21 full-time police officers on the street, who would not \nbe there otherwise.\n  In this way, the Metro Volunteer Program is making our community \nsafer. So I salute the volunteers on behalf of all of the citizens of \nClark County. I also salute Sharon Harding, the coordinator of the \nMetro Volunteer Program, and Sheriff Bill Young, who is always looking \nfor ways to better protect and serve the citizens of Clark County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/20/senate-section/article/S12887-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12887-S12888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ELECTIONS IN AZERBAIJAN\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on October 15, citizens of Azerbaijan went \nto the polls to elect their next president. The months and days leading \nup to the election were characterized by extremely biased media \nattention for the pro-presidential Yeni Azerbaijan Party, YAP, and \ngovernment-sponsored intimidation and harassment of the opposition \nparties. The U.S. Government and the OSCE expressed serious concern \nabout the preelection environment to the highest levels of Azerbaijan's \nGovernment. Our advice went largely unheeded, and grave levels of \ngovernment interference and intimidation continued through election \nday.\n  I traveled to Azerbaijan just before the election to meet with \nAzerbaijani political leaders to discuss these concerns. I told then-\nPrime Minister Ilham Aliyev in the clearest possible terms that the \ninternational community was carefully watching his actions and expected \na democratic outcome. I also met with a range of opposition leaders and \nassured them that we shared their concerns and were working to \nencourage the government to hold elections consistent with \ninternationally recognized standards.\n  On election day, the OSCE and U.S. government brought in over 600 \ninternational election observers and deployed them nationwide. Although \na number of areas were peaceful and orderly, observers noted many \nviolations of the new Unified Election Code, UEC. Violations included \nballot stuffing, multiple voting, harassment at the polling station by \nauthorities, incomplete voter lists, and a lack of regard for the \nprocedural process of ballot tabulation.\n  The undemocratic and blatant disregard for the UEC in both the \npreelection period and on election day led to civil unrest in Baku as \nthe final ballot counts were being made public. The night of the \nelection and the following days showed citizens coming together in \nprotest in large numbers in response to the election's failure to meet \ninternational standards. Reports continue to come in of severe and \nsometimes fatal violence against journalists and political activists. \nNot only has the government has not met its obligation to uphold law \nand order, but the government's security forces are largely responsible \nfor the violence.\n  This presidential election was a chance for Azerbaijan to demonstrate \nits commitment to the democratic process. Despite the new election \ncode, the ruling party chose to retain power at all costs and to ensure \nthat its candidate received nothing short of an overwhelming victory. \nThe United States will have to review its interest in deepening \nstrategic relations with an Azerbaijani regime that does not enjoy the \nfull legitimacy a free and fair election confers. We should step up \nAmerican assistance to the democratic opposition in Azerbaijan and \ncontinue to work to deepen civil society as a bulwark against the \nstate. The government in Baku must know that the United States values \nour relations with\n\n[[Page S12888]]\n\nthe people of Azerbaijan but cannot turn a blind eye to an election \nthat demonstrated such shortcomings, including state-directed violence \nagainst political opponents. Improved U.S.-Azerbaijan relations require \na new commitment to political pluralism, and a rejection of political \nviolence, on the part of a government that has failed this important \ntest of democratic legitimacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/20/senate-section/article/S12888-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in my own \nbackyard in Portland, OR. Early in the morning on Sunday, September 21, \n2003, two men who identified themselves as skinheads, stabbed one \nAfrican-American man and threatened another with a gun. Sadly, these \ntwo racially motivated crimes were committed by young men--both in \ntheir early twenties--with hate in their hearts.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/20/senate-section/article/S12888-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF PHILIP BONGIORNO\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Philip \nBongiorno, a Pennsylvania native and church leader of the Assemblies of \nGod whose life work has been to serve the people of his state, of his \ncountry, and of the world.\n  Born in Erie, PA, on September 22, 1932, Reverend Bongiorno entered \nEastern Bible Institute in Green Lane, PA, in 1951 and subsequently \ngraduated in 1955. In 1952, Reverend Bongiorno married his wife of 51 \nyears and began his ministry as an Assemblies of God evangelist.\n  Numerous Pennsylvania communities have been the beneficiaries of \nReverend Bongiorno's dedicated service. From 1956 to 1978, he led \ncongregations in Milesburg, Punxsutawney, Sarver, and Harrisburg. In \n1961, colleagues recognized his leadership by electing Reverend \nBongiorno as Sectional Presbyter. He was elected to the Board of \nDirectors of Teen Challenge in 1971, where he continues to serve, and \nagain in 1976 to the Board of Trustees of Valley Forge Christian \nCollege, the successor college of his alma mater. It was there that he \nfaithfully served until 2002. In addition, Reverend Bongiorno, as \nDistrict Superintendent, was the denominational leader from 1978 to \n2002 for all English-speaking Assemblies of God congregations in \nPennsylvania and Delaware.\n  In his honor, the Penn-Del District of the Assemblies of God has \nnamed its Carlisle, PA--based conference center after him and in \nrecognition of his 26 years of service and leadership, the Valley Forge \nChristian College has affixed his name to the first new student \nresidence hall constructed on the campus grounds.\n  Philip Bongiorno is honored today in the U.S. Senate because he has \nbeen faithful to his calling, he has served selflessly and widely, and \nhe has led with distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/20/senate-section/article/S12888-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to analyze \nand report on the exchange rate policies of the People's Republic of \nChina, and to require that additional tariffs be imposed on products of \nthat country on the basis of the rate of manipulation by that country \nof the rate of exchange between the currency of that country and the \nUnited States dollar; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today Senator DeWine and I have \nintroduced legislation that will help level the playing field for \nAmerican manufacturers futilely struggling to keep pace with their \nChinese competitors. My legislation, the Currency Harmonization \nInitiative Through Neutralizing Action (CHINA) Act of 2003, would allow \nfor the use of tariffs to punish China for unfair trade practices that \nmakes Chinese exports cheaper, in effect subsidizing them, and U.S. \nexports more expensive. Representatives English, Ballenger, and Mark \nGreen, my colleagues on the other side of the Capitol, have already \nintroduced this legislation in that body.\n  I am deeply concerned with the harm that the People's Republic of \nChina (China) is doing to our economy by pegging the value of its \ncurrency, the renminbi, to the U.S. dollar because Ohio is a \nmanufacturing State. Manufacturing contributes to the quality of life \nin Ohio by providing more than one million jobs for Ohio workers, an \nannual payroll of more than $45 billion, the second highest weekly \nearnings of any economic sector, support for local communities and \nschools with more than $1 billion in corporate franchise and personal \nproperty taxes, and more than $26 billion in products to more than 196 \ncountries.\n  After a significant recession in 2001, the 2002-2003 manufacturing \nrecovery has been the slowest on record; during this time, roughly 2.7 \nmillion jobs have been lost. In Ohio, we have lost 170,000 \nmanufacturing jobs since July 2000--that's nearly 16 percent or one out \nof six. Over the past year, I have held numerous listening sessions \nthroughout the State of Ohio to hear from these manufacturers and see \nwhat they attribute this loss of jobs to. Overwhelming, I have heard \nthat China, and particularly its policy of pegging its currency to the \ndollar, is one of their top concerns and is costing Ohio manufacturing \njobs. It is these concerns which have led me to introduce this \nlegislation.\n  If the value of the renminbi is allowed to float freely, as the \ncurrencies of our other major trading partners do, it would reflect \nChina's enormous trade surplus and increase significantly in value. \nChina's systematic undervaluation of its currency makes its exports \nless expensive and puts U.S. workers at a severe disadvantage. This is \nboth unfair and unacceptable.\n  I have long advocated free trade, provided it is fair trade. China's \ncurrency policy clearly tilts the international playing field against \nworkers in Ohio and across the entire United states. This is \nunacceptable. As a major international trading nation, China's currency \nshould be allowed to float and to have its value reflect its net trade \npositions with other nations. This is only fair.\n  My bill will help level the playing field by requiring the Secretary \nof the Treasury, within sixty days of enactment, to analyze and report \nto Congress whether China is manipulating its currency to achieve an \nadvantage in trade. If the Secretary finds manipulation, the report to \nCongress will indicate the degree of manipulation against the dollar. \nWithin thirty days after reporting manipulation to Congress, the \nSecretary is required to levy tariffs equal to the percentage of \nmanipulation found. This is in addition to tariffs currently in place \non Chinese imports.\n  Furthermore, the Treasury Secretary is directed to report to Congress \nthereafter on a yearly basis from date of enactment. Finally, the \nlegislation expresses the sense of Congress that the Administration \nshould pursue all means available (WTO, IMF and Sections 301-310 of the \nTrade ACt of 1974) to remedy China's currency manipulation.\n  If we are to stop the hemorrhaging of American manufacturing jobs, we \nmust take strong measures to persuade China to abandon its peg policy \nand allow its currency to be set in the free and open marketplace. This \nis exactly what my legislation does.\n  I would ask that my colleagues, especially from those States that are \nfeeling the effects of this manufacturing crisis deeply, support this \nlegislation and consider cosponsoring it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 1760. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, with respect \nto patent fees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

A bill to provide guidelines for the release of Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program contingency funds; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) Emergency Reform Act, which \nwill put in place guidelines for the release of LIHEAP contingency \nfunds.\n  The LIHEAP program, created in 1981, is the primary vehicle by which \nthe Federal Government, through block grants to States, provides energy \nassistance to low-income families. I applaud the provisions contained \nin pending energy legislation that will raise the LIHEAP authorization \nfrom $2 billion to $3.4 billion for Fiscal Years 2004 through 2006. As \nin most parts of the country, demand for LIHEAP dollars far outpaces \nthe supply in my home State of Washington, where, even when fully \nfunded under the current authorization, only 19 percent of eligible \nfamilies receive home energy assistance.\n  The legislation I'm introducing today, however, deals not with the\n\n[[Page S12892]]\n\nblock-grant portion of the current program, in which allocations to \nStates are determined via formula. Rather, it applies to the \ncontingency fund, which was also authorized in 1981 ``to meet the \nadditional home energy assistance needs of one or more States arising \nfrom a natural disaster or other emergency.'' As my colleagues are \naware, this money is not released according to formula but solely at \nthe discretion of the Health and Human Services Secretary.\n  The LIHEAP Emergency Reform Act does four things, designed to provide \nclarity to States that are in the unfortunate position of suffering \nfrom an emergency, as defined in the LIHEAP statute. My legislation: \ngives Governors the explicit authority to apply to the HHS Secretary \nfor the release of LIHEAP contingency funds; adds transparency to the \nrelease of emergency money by directing HHS, in cooperation with the \nStates and Department of Energy, to put in place procedures for the \nequitable consideration of these applications; requires HHS to include \nin these procedures the consideration of regional differences in \nsources of energy supply for low-income households, relative energy \nprice trends and relevant weather-related factors such as drought; and \nfinally, directs HHS to grant States' applications within 30 days \nunless the Secretary certifies that an emergency, as defined in the \nstatute, has not been demonstrated.\n  Since 1990, a total of $2.67 billion in LIHEAP contingency funds have \nbeen distributed. And while there is no doubt in my mind that, in all \ncases, this money has helped meet the needs of low-income families \nacross this Nation, I believe there have also been widely varying \neligibility rules leading to instances in which HHS has overlooked very \nreal energy emergencies.\n  In the Pacific Northwest, for example, we have over the past two \nyears suffered from an unprecedented rise in retail energy rates, the \nburden of which has fallen disproportionately on low-income families. \nIn fact, today, Washington State families at or below the 50 percent \nFederal poverty level spend 34 percent or more of their annual income \non home energy bills. That is a huge burden, especially in view of our \nrising unemployment rate and the severe downturn in our economy.\n\n  Unfortunately, Northwest States have not received emergency LIHEAP \nfunds consistent with their needs. In part, I believe this is because \nof the perception that our rates will, notwithstanding any increases we \nmight suffer, always be lower, and because this money has traditionally \nbeen used to defray the costs of natural gas and home heating oil in \nthe Midwest and Northeast.\n  This legislation requires HHS to consider regional factors such as \nthe fact that home heating oil prices are not relevant to Washington \nState's low-income families, 77 percent of which have homes reliant on \nelectricity.\n  In addition, it directs HHS to consider regional rather than \nabsolute, price trends. This is a very important point, because, \nregardless of how low a State's prices might be compared to its \nneighbor's, a drastic run up in rates has devastating impacts when its \nmanufacturing base, residential homes and truly its entire economy are \nbuilt upon access to an affordable power supply.\n  In summary, LIHEAP Emergency Reform Act provides additional certainty \nto states across the country.\n  I understand that the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n(HELP) Committee will soon consider legislation to reauthorize the \nLIHEAP program. As my colleagues may recall, the provisions of the \nLIHEAP Emergency Reform Act were originally included in the Senate \nenergy bill, now the subject of conference committee deliberations. \nDuring floor debate on that bill, I was pleased that the distinguished \nChairman and Ranking Member of the HELP Committee, Senators Gregg and \nKennedy, agreed to examine the contingency fund issue during \nreauthorization of the LIHEAP program. I believe that clear rules for \nthe release of LIHEAP contingency funds will ensure that, in the \nunfortunate event of an energy emergency, low-income families will \nreceive much-needed assistance in keeping the lights and the heat \nturned on, which is precisely what Congress intends when it \nappropriates money to the LIHEAP contingency fund. I believe the LIHEAP \nEmergency Reform Act will help provide this additional certainty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/20/senate-section/article/S12892-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                       Special Committee on Aging\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

(a) \n     Purpose.--Recognizing and commending the members of the \n     United States Armed Forces and their leaders, and the allies \n     of the United States and their armed forces, who participated \n     in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and recognizing the continuing \n     dedication of military families and employers and defense \n     civilians and contractors and the countless communities and \n     patriotic organizations that lent their support to the Armed \n     Forces during those operations.\n       (b) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United \n     States, which killed thousands of people from the United \n     States and other countries in New York, Virginia, and \n     Pennsylvania, inaugurated the Global War on Terrorism;\n       (2) the intelligence community quickly identified Al Qaeda \n     as a terrorist organization with global reach and the \n     President determined that United States national security \n     required the elimination of the Al Qaeda terrorist \n     organization;\n       (3) the Taliban regime of Afghanistan had long harbored Al \n     Qaeda, providing members of that organization a safe haven \n     from which to attack the United States and its friends and \n     allies, and the refusal of that regime to discontinue its \n     support for international terrorism and surrender Al Qaeda's \n     leaders to the United States made it a threat to \n     international peace and security;\n       (4) Saddam Hussein and his regime's longstanding \n     sponsorship of international terrorism, active pursuit of \n     weapons of mass destruction, use of such weapons against \n     Iraq's own citizens and neighboring countries, aggression \n     against Iraq's neighbors, and brutal repression of Iraq's \n     population made Saddam Hussein and his regime a threat to \n     international peace and security;\n       (5) the United States pursued sustained diplomatic, \n     political, and economic efforts to remove those threats \n     peacefully;\n       (6) on October 7, 2001, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations \n     in Afghanistan, designated as Operation Enduring Freedom, \n     that quickly caused the collapse of the Taliban regime, the \n     elimination of Afghanistan's terrorist infrastructure, and \n     the capture of significant and numerous members of Al Qaeda;\n       (7) on March 19, 2003, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations, \n     designated as Operation Iraqi Freedom, that quickly caused \n     the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime, the elimination of \n     Iraq's terrorist infrastructure, the end of Iraq's illicit \n     and illegal programs to acquire weapons of mass destruction, \n     and the capture of significant international terrorists;\n       (8) in those two campaigns in the Global War on Terrorism, \n     as of September 27, 2003, nearly 165,000 members of the \n     United States Armed Forces, comprised of active, reserve, and \n     National Guard members and units, had mobilized for Operation \n     Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom;\n       (9) success in those two campaigns in the Global War on \n     Terrorism would not have been possible without the \n     dedication, courage, and service of the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces and the military and irregular forces of \n     the friends and allies of the United States;\n       (10) the support, love, and commitment from the families of \n     United States service personnel participating in those two \n     operations, as well as that of the communities and patriotic \n     organizations which provided support through the United \n     Services Organization (USO), Operation Dear Abby, and \n     Operation UpLink, helped to sustain those service personnel \n     and enabled them to eliminate significant threats to United \n     States national security while liberating oppressed peoples \n     from dictatorial regimes;\n       (11) the civilian employees of the Department of Defense, \n     through their hard work and dedication, enabled United States \n     military forces to quickly and effectively achieve the United \n     States military missions in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       (12) the commitment of companies making their employees \n     available for military service, the creativity and initiative \n     of contractors equipping the Nation's Armed Forces with the \n     best and most modern equipment, and the ingenuity of service \n     companies assisting with the global overseas deployment of \n     the Armed Forces demonstrates that the entrepreneurial spirit \n     of the United States is an extraordinarily valuable defense \n     asset; and\n       (13) the Nation should pause to recognize with appropriate \n     tributes and days of remembrance the sacrifice of those \n     members of the Armed Forces who died or were wounded in \n     Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, as \n     well as all who served in or supported either of those \n     operations.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate--\n       (1) conveys its deepest sympathy and condolences to the \n     families and friends of the members of United States and \n     coalition forces who have been injured, wounded, or killed \n     during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom;\n       (2) commends President George W. Bush, Secretary of Defense \n     Donald H. Rumsfeld, and United States Central Command \n     commander General Tommy Franks, United States Army, for their \n     planning and execution of enormously successful military \n     campaigns in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom;\n       (3) expresses its highest commendation and most sincere \n     appreciation to the members of the United States Armed Forces \n     who participated in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom;\n       (4) commends the Department of Defense civilian employees \n     and the defense contractor personnel whose skills made \n     possible the equipping of the greatest armed force in the \n     annals of modern military endeavor;\n       (5) supports the efforts of communities across the Nation--\n       (A) to prepare appropriate homecoming ceremonies to honor \n     and welcome home the members of the Armed Forces \n     participating in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom and to recognize their contributions to United \n     States homeland security and to the Global War on Terrorism; \n     and\n       (B) to prepare appropriate ceremonies to commemorate with \n     tributes and days of remembrance the service and sacrifice of \n     those service members killed or wounded during those \n     operations;\n       (6) expresses the deep gratitude of the Nation to the 21 \n     steadfast allies in Operation Enduring Freedom and to the 49 \n     coalition members in Operation Iraqi Freedom, especially the \n     United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, whose forces, support, \n     and contributions were invaluable and unforgettable; and\n       (7) recommits the United States to ensuring the safety of \n     the United States homeland, to preventing weapons of mass \n     destruction from reaching the hands of terrorists, and to \n     helping the people of Iraq and Afghanistan build free and \n     vibrant democratic societies.\n       Sec. 316. (a) In addition to other purposes for which funds \n     in the Iraq Freedom Fund are available, such funds shall also \n     be available for reimbursing a member of the Armed Forces for \n     the cost of air fare incurred by the member for any travel by \n     the member within the United States that is commenced during \n     fiscal year 2003 or fiscal year 2004 and is completed during \n     either such fiscal year while the member is on rest and \n     recuperation leave from deployment overseas in support of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, but \n     only for one round trip by air between two locations within \n     the United States.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the commercial airline \n     industry should, to the maximum extent practicable, charge \n     members of the Armed Forces on rest and recuperation leave as \n     described in subsection (a) and their families specially \n     discounted, lowest available fares for air travel in \n     connection with such leave and that any restrictions and \n     limitations imposed by the airlines in connection with the \n     air fares charged for such travel should be minimal.\n       Sec. 317. (a) Section 1074a of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(f)(1) At any time after the Secretary concerned notifies \n     members of the Ready Reserve that the members are to be \n     called or ordered to active duty, the administering \n     Secretaries may provide to each such member any medical and \n     dental screening and care that is necessary to ensure that \n     the member meets the applicable medical and dental standards \n     for deployment.\n       ``(2) The Secretary concerned shall promptly transmit to \n     each member of the Ready Reserve eligible for screening and \n     care under this subsection a notification of eligibility for \n     such screening and care.\n       ``(3) A member provided medical or dental screening or care \n     under paragraph (1) may not be charged for the screening or \n     care.\n       ``(4) Screening and care may not be provided under this \n     section after September 30, 2004.''.\n       (b) The benefits provided under the amendment made by \n     subsection (a) shall be provided only within funds available \n     under this Act.\n       Sec. 318.

And the mixed \n     Arab, Turkish, Kurdish north has also been remarkably stable, \n     again, contrary to fears that many of us had that we might \n     face large-scale ethnic conflict.''.\n       (3) On September 14, Secretary of State Colin Powell \n     stated, ``We see attacks against our coalition on a daily \n     basis . . . but in many parts of the country things are quite \n     secure and stable.''.\n       (4) The Coalition Provisional Authority states that a major \n     focus of its security efforts has been to increase Iraqi \n     participation in and responsibility for a safe and secure \n     Iraq.\n       (5) On September 14, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld \n     stated, ``90 percent of the people in Iraq are now living in \n     an area that's governed by a city council, or a village \n     council.''.\n       (6) The Coalition Provisional Authority reports that 60,000 \n     Iraqis are now assisting in security, including 46,000 Iraqi \n     police nationwide.\n       (7) Of the 160,000 coalition military personnel serving in \n     Iraq, 20,000 are comprised of non-United States forces.\n       (b) Report.--Beginning 30 days after the enactment of this \n     Act, the President or his designee shall submit a monthly \n     report to Congress detailing--\n       (1) the areas of Iraq determined to be largely secure and \n     stable; and\n       (2) the extent to which United States troops have been \n     replaced by non-United States coalition forces, United Nation \n     forces, or Iraqi forces in the areas determined to be largely \n     secure and stable under this subsection.\n       Sec. 325. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert \n     Storm (in this section, collectively referred to as the \n     ``First Gulf War''), the regime of Saddam Hussein committed \n     grave human rights abuses and acts of terrorism against the \n     people of Iraq and citizens of the United States.\n       (2) United States citizens who were taken prisoner by the \n     regime of Saddam Hussein during the First Gulf War were \n     brutally tortured and forced to endure severe physical trauma \n     and emotional abuse.\n       (3) The regime of Saddam Hussein used civilian citizens of \n     the United States who were working in the Persian Gulf region \n     before and during the First Gulf War as so-called human \n     shields, threatening the personal safety and emotional well-\n     being of such civilians.\n       (4) Congress has recognized and authorized the right of \n     United States citizens, including prisoners of war, to hold \n     terrorist states, such as Iraq during the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein, liable for injuries caused by such states.\n       (5) The United States district courts are authorized to \n     adjudicate cases brought by individuals injured by terrorist \n     states.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) notwithstanding section 1503 of the Emergency Wartime \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11; 117 \n     Stat. 579) and any other provision of law, a citizen of the \n     United States who was a prisoner of war or who was used by \n     the regime of Saddam Hussein and by Iraq as a so-called human \n     shield during the First Gulf War should have the opportunity \n     to have any claim for damages caused by the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein and by Iraq incurred by such citizen fully \n     adjudicated in the appropriate United States district court;\n       (2) any judgment for such damages awarded to such citizen, \n     or the family of such citizen, should be fully enforced; and\n       (3) the Attorney General should enter into negotiations \n     with each such citizen, or the family of each such citizen, \n     to develop a fair and reasonable method of providing \n     compensation for the damages each such citizen incurred, \n     including using assets of the regime of Saddam Hussein held \n     by the Government of the United States or any other \n     appropriate sources to provide such compensation.\n       Sec. 326. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The National Guard and Reserves have served the Nation \n     in times of national crises for more than 200 years. The \n     National Guard and Reserves are a critical component of \n     homeland security and national defense.\n       (2) The current deployments of many members of the National \n     Guard and Reserve have made them absent from their \n     communities for an abnormally long time. This has diminished \n     the ability of the National Guard to conduct its State \n     missions.\n       (3) Many members of the National Guard and Reserves have \n     been on active duty for more than a year, and many more have \n     had their tours of active duty involuntarily extended while \n     overseas.\n       (b) Report on Utilization of National Guard and Reserves.--\n     (1) Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and\n\n[[Page S12898]]\n\n     House of Representatives a report on the utilization of the \n     National Guard and Reserves in support of contingency \n     operations during fiscal year 2004.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) Information on each National Guard and Reserve unit \n     currently deployed, including--\n       (i) the unit name or designation;\n       (ii) the number of personnel deployed;\n       (iii) the projected return date to home station; and\n       (iv) the schedule, if any, for the replacement of the unit \n     with a Regular or multinational unit.\n       (B) Information on current operations tempo, including--\n       (i) the length of deployment of each National Guard and \n     Reserve unit currently deployed, organized by unit and by \n     State;\n       (ii) in the case of each National Guard and Reserve unit on \n     active duty during the two-year period ending on the date of \n     the report, the aggregate amount of time on active duty \n     during such two-year period; and\n       (iii) the percentage of National Guard and Reserve forces \n     in the total deployed force in each current domestic and \n     overseas contingency operation.\n       (C) Information on current recruitment and retention of \n     National Guard and Reserve personnel, including--\n       (i) any shortfalls in recruitment and retention;\n       (ii) any plans to address such shortfalls or otherwise to \n     improve recruitment or retention; and\n       (iii) the effects on recruitment and retention over the \n     long term of extended periods of activation of National Guard \n     or Reserve personnel.\n       (3) The report under this subsection shall be organized in \n     a format that permits a ready assessment of the deployment of \n     the National Guard and Reserves by State, by various \n     geographic regions of the United States, and by Armed Force.\n       (c) Report on Effects of Utilization of National Guard and \n     Reserves on Law Enforcement and Homeland Security.--(1) Not \n     later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in \n     consultation with the chief executive officers of the States, \n     submit to Congress a report on the effects of the deployment \n     of the National Guard and Reserves on law enforcement and \n     homeland security in the United States.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) The number of civilian first responders on active duty \n     with the National Guard or Reserves who are currently \n     deployed overseas.\n       (B) The number of first responder personnel of the National \n     Guard or Reserves who are currently deployed overseas.\n       (C) An assessment by State of the ability of the States to \n     respond to emergencies without currently deployed National \n     Guard personnel.\n       Sec. 327.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) That on October 7, 2001, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations \n     in Afghanistan, designated as Operation Enduring Freedom, \n     that quickly caused the collapse of the Taliban regime, the \n     elimination of Afghanistan's terrorist infrastructure and the \n     capture of significant and numerous members of Al Qaeda.\n       (2) That on March 19, 2003, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations, \n     designated as Operation Iraqi Freedom, that quickly caused \n     the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime, the elimination of \n     Iraq's terrorist infrastructure, the end of Iraq's illicit \n     and illegal programs to acquire weapons of mass destruction, \n     and the capture of significant international terrorists.\n       (3) That success in those two campaigns in the Global War \n     on Terrorism would not have been possible without the \n     dedication, courage, and service of the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces and their coalition partners.\n       (4) That throughout the proud military history of our \n     Nation, we have recognized our brave men and women of the \n     Armed Forces by awarding them service medals for personal \n     bravery and other leadership actions and for their service in \n     military operations abroad and for support operations at home \n     and abroad.\n       (5) That historically the President has relied on senior \n     military officers to recommend the personal and theater \n     campaign medals and that, in keeping with these longstanding \n     traditions, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the combatant \n     commanders, including General Tommy Franks, United States \n     Army, former Commander of the United States Central Command, \n     recommended the awards described below in recognition of the \n     worldwide nature of the current conflict.\n       (6) That following the advice of his senior military and \n     civilian defense leaders, President Bush, by Executive Order \n     13289 on March 12, 2003, established the Global War on \n     Terrorism Expeditionary Medal to be awarded to service \n     members who serve in military operations to combat terrorism \n     on or after September 11, 2001, including, but not limited to \n     actions in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom, in such locations as Afghanistan, Iraq, the Republic \n     of the Philippines, and elsewhere in Southwest Asia, in \n     recognition of the sacrifice and contributions military \n     members make in the global war on terrorism.\n       (7) That eligibility for the Global War on Terrorism \n     Expeditionary Medal is predicated on deployment abroad for 30 \n     days or more in support of Global War on Terrorism operations \n     on or after September 11, 2001.\n       (8) That by the same Executive Order, the President \n     established the Global War on Terrorism Service Medical \n     recognizing duty in Operation Noble Eagle and the homeland \n     defense mission against further terrorist attacks, and which \n     recognizes duty in support of military operations performed \n     in areas that do not qualify for the Global War on Terrorism \n     Expeditionary Medal.\n       (9) That implementing regulations for eligibility have not \n     been issued by the Secretary of Defense.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate on the Award of Campaign Medal.--It \n     is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense \n     should, on an expedited basis, issue the necessary \n     regulations to implement these awards and ensure that any \n     person who renders qualifying service with the Armed Forces \n     in those phases of the Global War on Terrorism including \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom and \n     Operation Noble Eagle should promptly receive these awards.\n       Sec. 334.

(a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) Israel is a strategic ally of the United States in the \n     Middle East;\n       (2) Israel recognizes the benefits of a democratic form of \n     government;\n       (3) the policies and activities of the Government of Iraq \n     under the Saddam Hussein regime contributed to security \n     concerns in the Middle East, especially for Israel;\n       (4) the Arab Liberation Front was established by Iraqi \n     Baathists, and supported by Saddam Hussein;\n       (5) the Government of Iraq under the Saddam Hussein regime \n     assisted the Arab Liberation Front in distributing grants to \n     the families of suicide bombers;\n       (6) the Government of Iraq under the Saddam Hussein regime \n     aided Abu Abass, leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front, \n     who was a mastermind of the hijacking of the Achille Lauro, \n     an Italian cruise ship, and is responsible for the death of \n     an American tourist aboard that ship; and\n       (7) Saddam Hussein attacked Israel during the 1990-1991 \n     Persian Gulf War by launching 39 Scud missiles into that \n     country and thereby causing multiple casualties.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the removal of the \n     Government of Iraq under Saddam Hussein enhanced the security \n     of Israel and other United States allies.\n       Sec. 5005. (a) The Comptroller General shall conduct \n     studies on the effectiveness and efficiency of the \n     administration and performance of contracts in excess of \n     $40,000,000 that are performed or are to be performed in, or \n     relating to, Iraq and are paid out of funds made available \n     under this Act or the Emergency Wartime Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11). The studies \n     shall specifically examine the profits, administrative \n     overhead, management fees, and related expenditures for the \n     management of subcontracts (and further subcontracting) under \n     any such contract. In conducting studies under this section, \n     the Comptroller General shall have access to any information \n     and records created or maintained by the United States, or by \n     any entity receiving funds for contracts studied under this \n     section that the Comptroller General considers appropriate.\n       (b) Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act and again 4 months thereafter, the Comptroller \n     Government shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations \n     of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report that \n     includes--\n       (1) an evaluation of the studies conducted under this \n     section; and\n       (2) any recommendations for the improvement of the \n     contracting process for contracts performed or to be \n     performed in Iraq and for contracts generally, including the \n     selection process, contract content, and oversight of the \n     administration and performance of contracts.\n       Sec. 5006. Section 1605 of title 28, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding a new subsection (h) as follows:\n       ``(h) Notwithstanding any provision of the Algiers Accords, \n     or any other international agreement, any United States \n     citizen held hostage during the period between 1979 and 1981, \n     and their spouses and children at the time, shall have a \n     claim for money damages against a foreign state for personal \n     injury that was caused by the foreign state's act of torture \n     or hostage taking. Any provision in an international \n     agreement, including the Algiers Accords that purports to bar \n     such suit is abrogated. This subsection shall apply \n     retroactively to any cause of action cited in section \n     1605(a)(7)(A) of title 28, United States Code.''.\n       Sec. 5007. (a) The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) When Saddam Hussein came to power in the 1970's Iraq \n     was a prosperous county with no foreign debt and significant \n     foreign cash reserves.\n       (2) Iraq's reserves were exhausted during the Iran-Iraq War \n     in the 1980's and Iraq became a debtor nation.\n       (3) Today, the debts incurred by Saddam Hussein's regime \n     are estimated to be as much as $150,000,000,000.\n       (4) A process has been put in place that will establish a \n     new representative Iraqi government based on a democratic \n     political system with a free market economy. The goal is a \n     prosperous Iraq that is not a threat to its neighbors.\n       (5) For Iraq to be prosperous it must rebuild. In the near \n     term the United States and other donor countries will provide \n     grants to begin the process. In the longer term Iraq must be \n     able to fully participate in the international financial \n     system.\n       (6) It is impossible for Iraq to borrow funds in \n     international financial markets based on its existing debt. \n     Eliminating that debt will make possible Iraq's continued \n     rebuilding toward a prosperous and stable nation. A \n     prosperous nation is less likely to be a threat to its \n     neighbors and to be a breeding ground for terrorists. A \n     prosperous Iraq is more likely to be a positive force in the \n     region and participant in the world economy.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that all countries that \n     hold debt from loans to the former Iraqi regime of Saddam \n     Hussein should be urged to forgive their debt.\n       Sec. 5008. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in May 2002, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \n     issued a warning to law enforcement personnel to be alert to \n     the potential use of shoulder-fired missiles against United \n     States aircraft;\n       (2) in May 2002, Al Qaeda was suspected of firing a \n     shoulder-fired missile at United States military aircraft \n     near Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia;\n       (3) in November 2002, an Israeli commercial jetliner was \n     fired upon by a shoulder-fired missile shortly after take-off \n     in Mombasa, Kenya;\n       (4) in August 2003, a weapons smuggler was arrested after \n     agreeing to sell a Russian SA-18 to an undercover FBI agent \n     posing as a Muslim extremist;\n\n[[Page S12905]]\n\n       (5) during recent operations in Iraq, United States \n     commercial airlines--as part of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet \n     (CRAF)--flew nearly 2,000 flights carrying United States \n     troops and supplies into Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United \n     Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Bahrain;\n       (6) no United States commercial airliners are currently \n     equipped with defenses against shoulder-fired missiles.\n       (b) Prioritization.--When counter measures against the \n     threat of shoulder-fired missiles are deployed, the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of \n     Defense and the Secretary of Transportation, shall make it a \n     priority to equip the aircraft enrolled in the Civil Reserve \n     Air Fleet.\n       Sec. 5009. Paragraph (1) of section 1314 of Public Law 108-\n     11 is amended by inserting ``without fiscal year limitation'' \n     after ``available'' the first place it appears.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan Security and \n     Reconstruction Act, 2004''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/20/senate-section/article/S12905-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2003\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
