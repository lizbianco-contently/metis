We have so \nmuch to be thankful for. We bless You for the privilege of living in \nthis land of freedom.

Mr. President, I take a moment to welcome our Chaplain \nfor the day.\n  Frank and Krista Cirone, with their four children: Andrew, Benjamin, \nIsaak, and Anikka, live and minister at Ravencrest Chalet of the \nTorchbearer International Missionary Fellowship. Ravencrest Chalet is a \nBible school and Christian conference center in Estes Park, CO. The \nCirones enjoy hiking, mountain biking, and snowboarding in the Colorado \nRockies.\n  Frank graduated from Philadelphia Biblical University in 1989 prior \nto joining the staff at Ravencrest Chalet. Frank is pursuing his \nmaster's degree in leadership from Denver Seminary. At Ravencrest, he \nserves as principal of the Bible school, resident instructor and \ncoordinator of the second year leadership program.\n  Besides his responsibilities at Ravencrest, Frank spends time \ntraveling and speaking at various conferences and retreats both in \nNorth America and overseas. He very much enjoys motivating people to a \ndeeper love for Christ that influences all aspects of daily living \nthrough dynamic communication and interaction.

Mr. President, I have a short statement to make on our \ntroops.\n  Very briefly, we have taken a period of time each morning to comment \non the wonderful work and tremendous commitment and dedication our \ntroops are displaying overseas for us, and we have had the opportunity \nto comment on the families at home, offering prayers and support for \ntheir children, and in many cases for their spouses and their parents \nas well. They know the men and women are fighting for liberty, \ndemocracy, and peace.\n  This morning, my thoughts and prayers are with the family of the \nsoldier who died during Operation Iraqi Freedom, SP Brandon J. Rowe, \nCompany C, 1-502nd Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, Air Assault, Fort \nCampbell, KY.\n  Two sentences caught my eye from the Army news release:\n\n       Specialist Rowe epitomizes the best of our country--a brave \n     soldier--who exhibited courage, selfless service, and honor \n     in abundance. His ultimate sacrifice has contributed \n     immeasurably to the freedom and security of both Iraq and the \n     world.\n\n  While liberating Najaf, the 101st Airborne has been met over the last \n48 hours by grateful people waving and clapping hands and saying, \n``Good job.''\n  Quoted yesterday in the Washington Post, LTC Chris Hughes, a \nbattalion commander in the 1st Brigade:\n\n       We waited about an hour and a half, and the hair on the \n     back of my neck began to stand up. The crowd got bigger and \n     bigger, so we pulled back out. But it was like the liberation \n     of Paris.\n\n  Our newspaper in Nashville, the Tennessean, reported yesterday that a \nsoldier in the 101st will soon learn he is a new father--again showing \nthe many dimensions of this war and its impact on families and the \nfeelings families are expressing and sharing among themselves. SGT \nChris Schornak's wife Robyn gave birth to Tristan James Schornak at \n2:01 p.m. on Tuesday. He was born at NorthCrest Medical Center in \nSpringfield. The mom and young Tristan are doing well and will soon be \nliving with relatives in Franklin, KY.\n  Again, these are faces of our families and our troops, and to all of \nthem our thoughts and prayers continue to go out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4734-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Members of the Congress have been \nreceiving reports on a daily basis on the conflict in Iraq. At these \nbriefings, I report back to Members of the Congress and America that \nthings have been going well, much better than many expected, in the war \nin Iraq.\n  What we have been getting out of these briefings is just how highly \ntrained are our men and women in the Armed Forces and how the \ntechnological developments of this country have helped make their job \neasier on the battlefield. We have learned to appreciate their courage \nand commitment to protecting America's freedom.\n  Today marks the 14th day of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the fight \nfor freedom continues in the Middle East. Our brave members of the U.S. \nmilitary have shown the entire world how truly committed the United \nStates is to ending the dangerous regime in Iraq. By sacrificing their \nlives so those in Iraq can finally be allowed peace, coalition forces \ncontinue to courageously march toward Baghdad.\n  During the last 2 weeks, I, along with many of my colleagues, have \ncontinued to come down to the Senate floor daily to honor our troops \nand praise their valor. While we stand in the safety of the Capitol \nBuilding, our words will not be heard by those who are directly in \nharm's way, but the words are still needed.\n  It is important for us to continue to honor these men and women, some \nof whom will not come home, who fight for freedom and the safety and \nsecurity of the United States of America. I would like at this time to \nhonor some of those brave men and women from my home State of Colorado \nwho this very day are being moved into the Persian Gulf.\n  The 3rd Armored Calvary Regiment as well as the 3rd Brigade Combat \nTeam have been deployed from Fort Carson over the 3 weeks and continue \nto do so today. Many of these individuals have been waiting for the \nchance to stand shoulder to shoulder with their comrades already \nparticipating in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I salute them for their \nbravery.\n  It is clear that after all of the deployments from Fort Carson are \ncompleted, it will mark the biggest mobilization from the base since \nWorld War II. I sincerely hoped that the course of events that have led \nto the mobilization of soldiers not only from Colorado but those \nstationed all over the world would not have happened. But it was \napparent from the beginning that our Armed Forces would need to be \ninvolved in the manner that they are now. And they have performed \nadmirably. I pray for a safe return for our troops and that this \nconflict can end as soon as possible.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention the names of our military \npersonnel who will not be returning home. I offer my condolences to \nthose families whose sons and daughters have already been lost. To the \nfamilies of LCpl Thomas Slocum and Cpl Randal Kent, I give my deepest \nand most sincere sympathies for the loss of their sons. In their \npassing, they have continued the valued Marine Corps tradition of \nesprit de corps, and I will continue to pray for you as you mourn your \nloss.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with our Armed Forces both at home and \noverseas. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends. \nGod bless America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time is \nequally divided this morning; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. We have a lot of speakers here. How much time does the \nminority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And how long does the majority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We have a problem right here to begin with.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I can just assure that we are \ncovered.\n  Mr. REID. OK.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. We have Senator Dayton and Senator Cornyn, and if \nthere is any time left I will take it.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield whatever time needed to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise also to pay tribute today to the \nheroic men and women of our Armed Forces who are performing so well on \nbehalf of our country in Iraq. Their courage, their patriotism, and \ntheir valor represent the finest traditions and the best values of the \nAmerican military and of the country which they serve. They have fought \nbrilliantly, they have fought bravely, and they have fought \nsuccessfully. They have now advanced to within 10 miles of Baghdad. \nThey have been victorious thus far. They will be victorious from now \non. And they will be victorious in the end.\n  To the brave women and men who gave their lives in the service of \ntheir Nation, to their families and friends, the people they love and \nthe people who love them, we express our heartfelt gratitude and our \ndeepest sorrow and condolences. We are in awe of your courage, your \nheroism. As the families and friends of those fallen heroes who are \nyour friends and neighbors, your coworkers and church members, we know \nthat you have suffered the most grievous losses and must be suffering \ninestimable pain. Our hearts go out to\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\nyou. Our prayers are with you. We stand beside you ready to help in any \nway we can.\n  We say also to the families and friends of American soldiers wounded \nor captured or missing or still fighting or still deployed in Iraq, \nplease let us know how we can support you and assist you during these \ndifficult times. Our prayers are with you also for the swift recovery \nand safe return of all of our troops back to their country, their \nfellow citizens who are so proud and so grateful of them.\n  I also want to pay my respects to the military command responsible \nfor the planning and execution of this engagement. Secretary Rumsfeld, \nChairman Myers, the Chiefs, you have served our country and you \ncontinue to serve our country with great honor and distinction in \ncarrying out your duties, your oaths of office to the best of your \nabilities. You are succeeding. You are winning this war. Some may not \nagree with everything you are doing. I don't agree myself on \neverything. But you have earned my utmost respect and admiration for \nyour dedication and patriotic service to our country. You do not \ndeserve the backstabbing, the second guessing, the carping, the Monday \nmorning quarterbacking which has dogged your every decision. Former \nPresident Dwight Eisenhower once said:\n\n       Any high school kid can do better with a presidential \n     decision with 20/20 hindsight than a president can at the \n     time when he only has partial information and is operating by \n     his wits.\n\n  It is all too easy for someone with a military background to sit in \njudgment in hindsight. I do not disagree with their constitutional \nright to do so. I dispute their judgment in doing so. I question their \nmotives for doing so, as some appear to be vying to become the next \nnetwork analyst or the next Geraldo.\n  As the saying goes, actions speak louder than words, and the actions \nof these brave men and women fighting on our behalf, winning on our \nbehalf, speak loudly. They drown out, they overwhelm any naysayers of \ntheir conduct and decisions they are carrying out, which, as I say, \nwill be victorious for our Nation and we owe them our inestimable \ngratitude.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my friend and \ndistinguished colleague from Minnesota, on behalf of the people of \nMinnesota, to express our support for the courage and skill of our \ntroops fighting at this hour in Iraq. As the majority leader noted when \nwe began this session this morning, my prayers also are with those who \nhave died and their families. May God watch over them. Folks who are \nout there should know, and their families should know, there are a lot \nof prayers in the Senate and a lot of prayers in America now for our \nfighting men and women and those who have fallen.\n  I had a chance to talk to the family of PVT David Mahlke, a 19-year-\nold kid from Winona, MN. He graduated Winona High School in 2001. He \nwas wounded, with the 3rd Infantry Division. He is recuperating, doing \nwell. I was talking with his mom. She was waiting for a call from him. \nShe said: If the call comes through, I am going to cut you off. And I \nsaid: Go right ahead, ma'am.\n  I want the Mahlkes and all the other families in Minnesota to know we \nare praying for them, we are behind them. As my distinguished colleague \nfrom Minnesota noted, this is not a partisan thing anymore. We are \nthere. We are with them and so thankful they are there.\n  Over 100 years ago, Alexis de Toqueville said:\n\n       The strength of America is not in its government or even \n     its economy, but the quality of its average citizens.\n\n  Never has this been more true than for the struggle for the freedom \nof Iraq. Every single American soldier, sailor, airman or woman in this \nconflict is a volunteer. How astounding that is. They stepped forward \nto risk their lives on behalf of the ideals and safety of the American \npeople, and they are willingly, enthusiastically, and boldly laying \ndown their lives for us.\n  In that we are grateful. They are not just willing to die for their \nprinciples and our principles, they are living for them. The skill and \ncompassion and care being demonstrated by the troops in the field is \nAmerica at its best. It is far from the scenario we all feared: that \nwar would demonize America in the eyes of many.\n  I, too, have been frustrated and angered by the second-guessing and \nsniping by some members of the news media. I am reminded of the story \nof President Lincoln, who received a series of letters from a God-\nfearing woman who told him: Mr. President, God has told me we should \nmove troops here and there, during the Civil War, and hire this general \nand fire this one.\n  Lincoln responded very briefly saying: Ma'am, I find it amazing, \nindeed, that the Lord Almighty has given you all the answers but has \ngiven me the job.\n  There is a time for legitimate debate in public and among our \nNation's leaders. We had that. Resolutions approving the use of force \nwere approved by decisive, bipartisan margins in the House and Senate. \nLegitimate protests in favor of diplomatic solutions continued. But in \nmy mind, that all changed when the Commander in Chief sent young \nAmerican men and women into battle.\n  I want to say a word to the rest of our citizens. In a previous war, \nthere was the expression, ``They also serve who only stand and wait.'' \nIn my view, that does not apply now to those who simply sit and watch. \nIt is good to be informed but we have to do our jobs as Americans. \nLet's at times shut off the TV; let's go out there, roll up our \nsleeves, and make this a greater nation for the troops to come home to.\n\n  Ordinary citizens are winning this war and ordinary citizens in towns \nacross Minnesota and America need to sacrifice and work hard, to use \nall their skills to get things done for America, right now, today.\n  I am also hopeful these events will have an effect on our work here \nin the Senate. We don't have Democrat units and we don't have \nRepublican units. We don't have conservative or liberal generals. The \npolitical labels would seem silly and irrelevant in comparison to the \nimportance of the task.\n  Maybe we could catch some of that spirit around here. The American \npeople want solutions, not a partisan rugby match, and we should give \nthem what they want.\n  Finally, let me close on a different note. Those of us in our \nNation's Capitol these days are experiencing a stark irony. On one \nhand, there is a somber mood about the war, as we receive the reports \nof danger and sacrifice. But at the same time, the city of Washington \nis bursting with the beauty and hopefulness of spring. The cherry \nblossoms are in full bloom. They are famous all over the world. But \nthese cherry blossoms have a tale of hope for us all in these times, \nand I will tell it very quickly.\n  The Washington cherry trees were a gift to the American people from \nthe Emperor of Japan in the 1890s as an expression of friendship. In \nWorld War II, allied bombing of Tokyo resulted in the death of most of \nthe cherry trees around the Emperor's palace. After the war ended, a \ngroup of Washingtonians took a set of cuttings from our trees here and \nbrought them back to Japan to restore their trees. If you travel to \nJapan, you will see the trees which grew from Washington's tree which \ncame here as a gift.\n  We are not fighting in Iraq for oil or territorial ambition. We are \nfighting to protect our own people in a world that has brought threats \nto our doorstep. We are fighting as the only hope for the freedom of \nthe people of Iraq against their tyrant. Justice is being done. But \nwhat the world is about to see will have an even greater impact.\n  As we move to rebuild Iraq, the people of the world will see American \ngenerosity and ingenuity and values at their best. A dark cloud on the \nfuture is being removed and a new light is about to shine.\n  Let's do our part, my fellow Americans, and make this a better \ncountry today before we go to bed tonight, as a tribute to our brave \nmen and women who are fighting for us around the clock. Our prayers are \nwith them. Our support is with them. May God bless them all.\n  May God bless the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S4736]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The time on the majority side \nhas expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield time to the distinguished Senator from \nMontana, who represents, among other things, the Marine Corps.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my good friend from Nevada. I am having a little \ntrouble getting organized today. I will try to pick it up a little bit \nto the likings of the assistant minority leader.\n  I am glad my good friend from Minnesota, who is newly elected to this \nbody--and, I will tell you right now, he is a contributor, and I think \nhe has a great future here--did bring us back to reality. The city of \nWashington does have quite a lot of beauty. As the cherry blossoms are \nout and the blossoms start to open here, I always think: Every spring, \nno matter what the conditions are in the world, or the problems and \ntrials of serving in a legislative body, or an economy that continues \nto struggle and is on the minds of all of us as is this situation we \nfind ourselves in, in Iraq--every spring, as we look around this city, \nI just think it is God's picturesque way of reminding us of the Earth's \nrenewal. It comes every spring just as a reminder that that is one \ninstitution that we haven't been able to change.\n  I have a resident of Montana who is at Walter Reed Army Hospital, \nArmy SGT Charles Horgan. I haven't been able to get out and visit him \nyet. He is from Helena, MT. He is recovering out there from wounds \nreceived in Iraq. I am sure the hearts of everybody who shares our \nconcerns about one life, one human, go out to him and his folks today.\n  Back in 1991 I had a chance to visit a Marine unit out in the desert. \nIt was my old Marine outfit in which I served, F-212, 3rd Marine \nDivision. But I served back in the stone age. These are the new \nwarriors with new equipment, new technologies. I did that back in 1991.\n  The mindset and the American institution of the military and their \nenormous ability to withstand hardships for a principle and a way of \nlife is almost above human imagination. As we were flying out in that \ndesert, the commanding officer, Walt Boomer, General Boomer, called me. \nHe said: Senator, they may complain a little bit that they are not \ngetting mail.\n  I said: We will try and handle that. But if you figure we had 400,000 \nto 500,000 people in the Middle East, if everybody wrote a letter to \nevery soldier, sailor, marine, coastguardsman, or airman over there, \nthat is a lot of mail to handle per day, to try to get it out to the \nright people in a timely fashion.\n  But I found out that was not what their complaint was. They were out \nof tobacco. We finally helped that situation.\n  There is a long tradition of writing letters and sending care \npackages to the troops stationed away from home, but the general public \nis urged not to send unsolicited mail, care packages, or donations to \nthe service members now deployed in Iraq. The Department of Defense has \nset a strict policy of only family members sending mail and packages to \ntheir service members. So if you want to write to a person over there \nand he is not in your immediate family, we ask that not be done.\n  So this leaves many people at a loss when they want to help support \nthe troops, to say thank you, but have no direct point of contact. We \nsee that they are finding ways, through American imagination, to take \ncare of that. Even without those care packages, there are many other \nefforts that can be made to support our troops in the field and also \ntheir families at home.\n  I have put together an information pamphlet, which is available in \nall my offices in the State of Montana, that includes national programs \nand local Montana programs set up to allow people to extend a helping \nhand to our soldiers but, more importantly, I think to provide support \nfor their families at home. I call it Operation: Homefront. It is a \nprogram I have set up to easily and efficiently inform people about how \nthey can help or contribute to this operation.\n  There is nothing better for the morale of our troops. We understand \nthe sacrifices they are making. We understand where they find \nthemselves. And they also understand us who are trying to support them \nand their families any way that we can.\n  It is also comforting for those in the field to know their loved ones \nback home are being taken care of when push comes to shove.\n  I think Operation: Homefront will be an excellent tool for getting \ninformation out to people. Supporting our troops is something we think \nabout every day. We appreciate their risks and the sacrifices they are \nmaking.\n  There is also one other reminder to my colleagues. If you are \nconcerned about what the war is going to cost, and you want to \nparticipate and help us out in just a little way, there is a way. Back \nin 1991, we offered a brand new bond on the market. We called it the \nPatriot Bond. And if you want to buy a bond for your child or your \ngrandchild, or whomever, I think you can go to wherever they sell these \nbonds--I don't know where they sell them; I have a couple of them--and \nbuy your grandchild a bond and help us out.\n  Just because there is combat today, the mission will not be over \nuntil the Iraqi people are liberated and an interim government is set \nup so freedom can be established to allow the Iraqi people to grow and \nto taste the fruits of freedom and to improve their quality of life. \nEvery life in the world is deserving of that.\n  So if you are inclined to do so, go inquire about a Patriot Bond. I \nthink it would sure help us out, and it also would, I think, maybe help \nyou out also.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to honor two Virginia \nMarines: Staff Sgt. Donald C. May of Richmond and Sgt. Michael Vernon \nLalush of Troutville, who were among the first of our servicemen killed \nin action in Operation Iraqi Freedom; and to express gratitude, on \nbehalf of the Senate, for their service to our Nation. The American \npeople, I am certain, join in expressing their prayers and compassion \nto the families they leave behind.\n  The media in Virginia have given the following important coverage:\n  Staff Sergeant Donald C. May, Jr. was so inspired by the military \nservice given in past years by his father and mother that he followed \nin their footsteps and began to chart a course for himself with \nmilitary training. He was fulfilling that dream when he was tragically \nkilled on Tuesday when his tank went off a bridge into the Euphrates \nRiver.\n  He leaves behind: his mother, Brenda May; his wife, Deborah; son, \nJack; stepdaughter, Mariah; and another son yet to be born.\n  He was a member of the U.S. Naval Sea Cadets from age 12 to 18 and \nwas also a police explorer.\n  Upon graduation from Meadowbrook High School in 1990, he joined the \nUnited States Marine Corps, and served 4 years in the military police. \nHe finished boot camp just in time to serve in the last few months of \nthe first Gulf War in 1991, involving security over Iraqi prisoners.\n  After the first Gulf War, Staff Sergeant May left the Marines for 2 \nyears, serving as a reservist, after which time he returned to active \nduty as a tank commander, just like his dad, who is now deceased.\n  During his second deployment to Iraq, Staff Sergeant May was in the \n1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division, based at Marine Corps Air-\nGround Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, CA.\n  Sergeant Michael Lalush always seemed to have a knack for fixing \nthings. He always worked with his hands on equipment, tinkering with \nlawnmowers and cars. As a teenager, he brought home to his own garage a \npink 1965 Volkswagen Beetle, rebuilt it and in no time was driving it \naround the neighborhood.\n  Sergeant Lalush was challenged in the military and had a great \nlonging to serve his country. After graduating from Lord Botetourt High \nSchool, he left for boot camp.\n  Tragically, Sgt. Lalush's short military career ended on Sunday when \nhe was killed in a Huey helicopter crash while serving in a Marine \nLight Attack Helicopter Squadron in southern Iraq. He had been deployed \nfrom the Marine Corps Air Station at Camp Pendleton, CA.\n  Reportedly, in his final e-mail message that the family received last \nWednesday, Sergeant Lalush said he\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\nwas finally discovering his dream in Iraq. He told his parents that he \nwas finally using his skills to help people.\n  Sgt. Michael Lalush leaves behind his parents, David and Rebecca \nLalush.\n   Mr. President, we have lost two exceptional sons of Virginia. Their \ncourage and unwavering service to our great country will not be \nforgotten. As we think of their families in mourning, let us not forget \nthat these fine young men gave the ultimate sacrifice so that every \nAmerican could continue to live in freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4737-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 472\n\n   (Purpose: To set aside $30,000,000 for the Department of Homeland \n Security for research and development and deployment of technology to \n protect commercial aircraft from the threat posed by man-portable air \n                            defense systems)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 472:\n       In chapter 6 of title I, add at the end the following:\n\n                    GENERAL PROVISIONS, THIS CHAPTER\n\n       Sec. 601. Of the amounts appropriated by this chapter under \n     the heading ``Departmental Management'' under the heading \n     ``counterterrorism fund'', $30,000,000 shall be available for \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration, \n     for research and development on, and for the initial \n     deployment of, technology to protect commercial aircraft from \n     the threat posed by man-portable air defense systems in order \n     to reduce the costs of such technology and to provide for the \n     adaptation of military countermeasure systems to commercial \n     aircraft.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank the clerk.\n  If my colleague would like to make a statement at this time, I would \nbe happy to yield, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California. My \nonly reason for standing right now is to inquire of the Senator from \nCalifornia if it is possible to have a time limit on her amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I absolutely will agree. I am waiting for my coauthor, \nChuck Schumer. As soon as we get word as to how much time he would \nneed, yes, we would definitely want to do that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I do thank the Senator from California. \nIt is our hope that we will be able to get all of the amendments that \nare in line now completed in time to start voting by 11:50, following \nthe Democratic caucus. So I appreciate her courtesy. And whatever is \npossible to enter into a time agreement, I would like to explore that. \nI thank her for her courtesy.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. And, yes, as soon as we get word, I \nwill ask for a quorum call, and then we will make an agreement on the \ntime.\n  Whether we speak about this for a half hour or 2 days, this is a very \nimportant amendment. I think one of the things we learned after 9/11, \ntragically, is that we have to take warnings very seriously--our \nintelligence agencies, we, as a Congress, the administration, all of us \nworking together.\n  We know now that there is a threat out there that is very real. We \nhave constructed an amendment that does not add any money to this bill \nbut merely says that out of the funds that have been allotted for \nhomeland defense, that $30 million be made available immediately for \nresearch and development of countermeasures that could be taken should \na shoulder-fired missile be aimed at a commercial aircraft.\n  I want to read to you the latest statement of the FBI. This is the \nFBI warning, which really must not go unheeded if we are to do our job:\n\n       . . . given al-Qaeda's demonstrated objective to target the \n     U.S. airline industry, its access to U.S. and Russian-made \n     MANPAD systems--\n\n  MANPAD stands for shoulder fired missiles--\n\n     and recent apparent targeting of U.S.-led military forces in \n     Saudi Arabia, law enforcement agencies in the United States \n     should remain alert to the potential use of MANPADs against \n     U.S. aircraft.\n\n  How clear could this be? If this body turns its back on a threat that \nour commercial aircraft are facing right now, it would be a very sad \nday, indeed.\n  I see Senator Schumer has approached the floor. What I will do is ask \nthat a quorum call be put in place so I might discuss with him a \ntimeframe he will need on this amendment we have worked so hard on \ntogether.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. After conferring with the Senator from California, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from California control the time \nuntil 10 minutes of 11 and that I control the time thereafter until 5 \nminutes after 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take it from the top because this is such a \ncrucial amendment. The amendment I am offering with Senator Schumer \nwill provide $30 million that is already in the bill--we are not adding \nnew money--for the Department of Homeland Security to research and \ndevelop and to initially deploy countermeasure systems for commercial \naircraft to combat the threat of manned portable shoulder-launched \nmissile systems.\n  I have held one of these missiles. I am a little person. They are \nvery lightweight. They can be easily used. They have been used in the \npast. As I say, this $30 million is not new money. I hope, therefore, \nit will not be opposed on the other side of the aisle.\n  The chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee, a Republican, said \njust yesterday that the threat of these shoulder-fired missiles being \naimed at a commercial aircraft in the United States or one of our \nassets abroad ``keeps me up at night.'' This is a Republican chairman \nof the House Aviation Subcommittee who came into this debate, in his \nown words, not convinced that we needed to move on this threat. But \nafter a secret briefing--and I was there--said this threat ``keeps me \nup at night.''\n  Shoulder-fired missiles, such as the SA-7 and stinger missile, are \navailable on the black market for $25,000 to $80,000 each. Most can be \nused with very little training and they take just minutes to fire. As I \nsaid, I have held one of these missiles in my hand. Almost anybody \ncould do the same and fire one.\n  Nearly 30 guerrilla and terrorist groups are in possession of these \nweapons, including al-Qaida. We will show a chart of the terrorist \ngroups, the guerrilla groups we believe have these\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\nweapons or have access to these weapons: al-Qaida, Hezbollah, Kurdistan \nWorkers Party, the Palestinian Authority, the Popular Front for the \nLiberation of Palestine, the Taliban. It goes all the way down the \nline. These are the groups that have these missiles and could use them \nagainst a commercial aircraft.\n\n  Al-Qaida has shown it is willing to use these weapons as weapons of \nterror. They are suspected of targeting U.S. military aircraft in Saudi \nArabia last May with an SA-7 missile.\n  Mr. BAYH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. BAYH. Is the Senator aware many of these countermeasures are made \nin the State of Indiana at Crane Naval Depot? I thought the Senator \nmight be interested. I had occasion to be there several weeks ago. They \nreported to me that these countermeasures the Senator quite rightly \nhopes to fund in this supplemental have been used in Afghanistan, and \nthere have been more than 200 incidents of attacks on our military \naircraft, but not one successful attack because the countermeasures are \nso effective in preventing the downing of our aircraft. The point the \nSenator makes is a good one since we have been so successful in \nprotecting our military men and women. We have the technology. Why not \nmake it available to the civil aviation sector as well.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am so pleased my friend would come over and engage in a \ncolloquy with me. I was not aware of where these countermeasures were \nmade. I know there are corporations working on them.\n  He is right. Our military planes are protected--thank God--because \nthese are heat-seeking missiles. They are attracted to these engines. \nOur military aircraft are protected. It is interesting because if you \nlook at El Al, although they will not confirm or deny that their planes \nare so equipped, we believe they are. We don't have any specific \ninformation, but we believe they are.\n  The point is, we need to now take this technology that is used on \nmilitary aircraft and do a little more work so these technologies can \nwork on commercial aircraft. That is what the amendment does.\n  I say to the Senator, who I know is a fiscally responsible Member, we \ndon't add any new funds because the first stage, $30 million, we can \ntake out of existing money for research and development and begin to \ndeploy a few airplanes with this system so we can make sure it works \nbefore we make a bigger investment.\n  Mr. BAYH. My colleague is quite right. I compliment her for this \namendment. The technology is more than theoretical. It exists in large \npart today. We are talking about saving lives with this kind of \ninvestment. I can't think of a better use of our tax dollars. I make \nthe point not only as a matter of State pride but that the technology \nis there. We are saving lives. Another way to put it, we are saving \nlives in Afghanistan today using these pyrotechnic technologies. Why \nnot arm our civil aviation aircraft to save lives domestically as well. \nI strongly support her amendment. It is a very wise investment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before my friend leaves the floor, I want to put up the \nFBI warning we have been given. It is not as if we haven't been warned. \nThat is why I want to make the case to my friends on both sides of the \naisle as to how important they are.\n\n       Given al-Qaida's demonstrated objective to target the U.S. \n     airline industry, its access to U.S. and Russian-made systems \n     and recent apparent targeting of U.S.-led military forces in \n     Saudi Arabia, law enforcement agencies in the U.S. should \n     remain alert to the potential use of the MANPAD'S against \n     U.S. aircraft.\n\n  When you put that together with the list of terrorist groups that \nhave the weapons, you are so right. The Taliban is at the top. That is \nwhy now in Afghanistan we face threats from these shoulder-fired \nmissiles, because they have them.\n  Mr. BAYH. In addition, my colleague is aware that I serve on the \nIntelligence Committee. Without getting into detail on the floor, which \nwould be inappropriate, this is a growing concern in the intelligence \nworld, particularly following the attack in Kenya on the Israeli \nairlines. These attacks have been carried out on civil aviation \naircraft. These missiles are widely available, as you pointed out, and \nit is a matter of growing concern to our law enforcement and \nintelligence officials that this is perhaps a future area for threat--\nthe civil aviation in the United States.\n  We have the ability to protect the aircraft, so why not take the step \nbefore it is too late? We should not wait until after a tragedy has \noccurred. We have been down that road before.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is so much on point. It is true that the \nattempt to down an Israel airliner in Kenya failed. However, it is \nestimated that over the last 25 years, more than 550 people have been \nkilled in incidents involving shoulder-fired missiles and commercial \naircraft.\n  I want to show my friend a statement made by a member of the travel \nindustry, as we look at more funding for the airlines, which I think is \nessential right now given what they have gone through, because we have \na war and we had terrorism and we have a recession. This is what Ed \nAdams, chairman of a big tourism industry group, said:\n\n       The travel industry is painfully aware of what a successful \n     attack of using a shoulder-fired missile on a commercial \n     airliner could do to the confidence of the traveling public. \n     It is a situation we would prefer not to even imagine, but we \n     must understand the reality of such an event if we intend to \n     prevent it. The blow to the economy, in general, and the \n     travel and tourism sector, in particular, combined with the \n     loss of human lives would be staggering. These costs would \n     certainly outweigh the expense of the precautionary measures \n     you are recommending today to make sure our commercial planes \n     are safe from such a terrorist attack.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. My colleague pointed out that I pride myself as being \nfiscally responsible. I view her amendment in that spirit. We are in \nthe process of appropriating, I believe, $3 billion for the civil \naviation industry in this supplemental. Previously, following the 9/11 \nattacks, there were other billions of dollars. If that industry is \ngoing to recover and be viable economically again, it is going to have \nto be in part because people feel safe getting on planes and traveling \nacross the country. So the Senator's efforts to secure the traveling \npublic are very much in the spirit of stabilizing an industry and, in \nfact, being fiscally responsible so that further efforts to provide \nlargess from the Federal Treasury won't be necessary.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is right. We know that, right now--before we \nhave even seen research and development in a robust fashion to bring \ndown the cost of these countermeasures--they are about a million \ndollars per plane. I say to my friend that $1 million on a $120 million \naircraft is not too much to ask.\n  We had a big breakthrough because Chairman Mica on the House side, \nyesterday, came on board on this amendment and is working on the other \nside. I have spoken to the leadership. I think if the Senate today can \ncome together--I know we are voting so much on party lines now, and I \ncan see that, but if we can come together on this amendment, which \ndoesn't add any money at all, but simply says this is a priority--by \nthe way, it is not only the Senator from Indiana, or the Senator from \nCalifornia, or the Senator from New York saying it is a priority; it is \nthe FBI saying it is a priority. Who knows better what threats we face \nthan the FBI?\n  The TSA is saying it is a priority, too. On Sunday, there was a \nreport in the New York Times saying that the Bush administration has \nordered major security improvements at several of the Nation's largest \nairports after inspections showed that passenger planes taking off or \nlanding at those airports could be vulnerable to attack by a terrorist \nusing a shoulder-fired missile.\n  So the fact is we see--I know at Los Angeles Airport dozens of \nNational Guard troops are deployed. It is a good thing to patrol the \nperimeter and at road checkpoints, in part, because of concerns about \nshoulder-fired missiles.\n  So the administration now takes this very seriously. We all know that \nwhile the National Guard is going to be very helpful in this regard, \nand more troops are going to help in this regard--and I support these \nmeasures--we know these missiles can reach commercial aircraft up to \n12,000 feet. We know that stepped-up patrols of the perimeters are only \npart of the solution because you can have one of these shoulder-fired \nmissiles pretty far away from the\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\nairport--in an apartment building, or anywhere else, or in the middle \nof a park, and it would be very difficult.\n  Mr. BAYH. Or possibly from the sunroof of an SUV. It is difficult to \nsecure the perimeter around an airport to the extent that we need it. \nThese countermeasures would be very warranted. I apologize for \ninterrupting the Senator's remarks. But this threat is real. We have \ndone a great deal of good work in the military sphere combating just \nthis kind of threat.\n  Why not make it available to the civil population as well? We are \nspending billions of dollars to bail out an industry, but if people \ndon't feel safe flying in planes, the industry will never recover. I am \nin support of my colleague's amendment. Again, I apologize for \ninterrupting the flow of her argument.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator hasn't interrupted my argument; he has made \nit stronger and better. Also, we know that military transport and \nrefueling aircraft--and you have mentioned this--such as the C-17, C-\n130, KC-135, and the KC-10 are some of the models that employ these \ncountermeasure systems that we believe can be and must be used for \ncommercial aircraft.\n  Just going to the Senator's point about the military, they are \nconducting thousands of hours of training on countermeasures. So to \nunderscore what my friend has stated, we know these systems work. We \nalso know there is a threat.\n  I think if you look at this amendment and all the parts of it, No. 1, \nit is a modest step because we are not adding new funding; we are \nsimply taking out--there is more than a billion dollars in that \nparticular section--it is $1.135 billion--and we are saying $30 million \nof that should go to support the research and development and getting \nthese prototypes ready, so we know they can be put on aircraft.\n  Chairman Mica and I have spent time talking about this, as well as \nSenator Schumer. We have come to understand that as we do this research \nand development, and the price comes down, when the airlines in the \nfuture order new commercial aircraft--and they are spending up to $150 \nmillion a copy--to spend an extra million dollars on that is not going \nto be very much.\n  So we think this is a very responsible amendment. We think it would \nbe foolish and foolhardy not to begin this work right now, because I \ncan tell you, God forbid, if a terrorist were successful, or even \nunsuccessful but came close to hitting one of our commercial aircraft, \neverybody in this body would say: Oh, my God, we had our chance and we \nblew it. We didn't do what we should have done.\n  Whether you look at the fact that these technologies are working on \nmilitary planes, whether you look at the fact that we have enormous \nwarning from the FBI, and we have seen this administration begin to \nmove forward, if you put this all together, it speaks loudly and \nclearly in favor of this amendment.\n  This is a chart of recent incidents of attacks. In November 2002, an \nIsraeli jetliner was fired upon seconds after takeoff in Mombasa, \nKenya, and al-Qaida is suspected.\n  In May of 2002, an empty shoulder-launched missile tube was found \noutside Prince Sultan airbase in Saudi Arabia, and our military thinks \nthat was from a shoulder-fired missile.\n  In October 1998, we had rebels down a civilian Boeing 727 over the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in which 40 were killed. This is just \nrecent incidents, but if we go back 25 years, we see this occurred.\n  I expect Senator Schumer is going to be coming to the Chamber. Until \nhe does, I am going to continue to go over these charts. If we look at \nany of these charts, we get the picture.\n  This chart shows the groups we believe have access to shoulder-fired \nmissiles. This would make anybody shudder because we know these groups \nare well funded and active, and we know many of them view the United \nStates of America as their target:\n  Al-Qaida, Hezbollah, Kurdistan Workers Party, Palestinian Authority, \nPopular Front for Liberation of Palestine, Taliban, Armed Islamic \nGroup, Huta Militiamen, UNITA, Oromo Liberation Front, Somali National \nAlliance, United Somali Congress, Hark at ull-Ansar, Hizbul Majahideen, \nKhmer Rouge, Liberation Tigers of Tamil, United State Wa Army, Kosovo \nLiberation Army, National Liberation Army, and the IRA. We know these \ngroups have access to shoulder-fired missiles. We know some groups, \nparticularly some on the top part of this chart, would like to go after \nUnited States interests, given the past and given the present \nsituation.\n  I want to read what Chairman Mica said after he came out of an \nintelligence briefing on this issue:\n\n       I went into the meeting somewhat skeptical. I came out \n     convinced that this is probably one of the most serious \n     challenges we face in combating terrorism. I think that's \n     important.\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       Since that hearing, I've lost some sleep and have great \n     concern.\n\n  We are saying this is very important.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n  Madam President, until Senator Schumer comes to speak on my \namendment, I wish to pay tribute to five additional young Americans who \nwere killed in the Iraqi war who were either from California or based \nin California. Sadly, these numbers are growing, and I have tried in \nevery case to read their names on the floor.\n  LCpl Patrick T. O'Day, age 20, was from Sonoma, CA, which is not very \nfar from where I live. He was assigned to the 1st Tank Battalion, 1st \nMarine Division, Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center, Twenty-nine \nPalms, CA. He was killed in a tank accident in Iraq on March 25.\n  His family moved to the United States from Scotland in 1987. He was \ncaptain of the wrestling team at Santa Rosa Middle School. He enlisted \nin the Marines after graduating from Santa Rosa High School in 2001. He \nis survived by his wife, his parents, his three brothers, and his wife \nis expecting their first child in September.\n\n  PFC Francisco A. Martinez Flores, age 21, from Los Angeles, CA, was \nassigned to the 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division, Marine Corps \nAir-Ground Combat Center, Twenty-nine Palms, CA. He was killed in a \ntank accident in Iraq on March 25. He moved to California with his \nfamily when he was 3 years old. He was expecting to become a U.S. \ncitizen in 2 weeks.\n  CPT Aaron J. Contreras was assigned to the Marine Light Attack \nHelicopter Squadron, Marine Aircraft Group-39, Marine Corps Air Station \nin Camp Pendleton, CA. He was 31 years old. He was killed on March 30 \nin a helicopter crash in southern Iraq.\n  He was born on the Fourth of July in 1971. His family moved from San \nJose, CA, to Sherwood, OR, in the late seventies, and he was a graduate \nof Sherwood High School. He joined the Marines in 1997. He is survived \nby his wife and three children, his parents, and four brothers.\n  SSgt Donald C. May was assigned to the 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine \nDivision, Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center, Twenty-nine Palms, CA. \nHe was from Richmond, VA. He was 31 years old. He died March 25 in a \ntank accident in Iraq. He is survived by his wife and two children.\n  Cpl Robert M. Rodriguez, age 21, was assigned to the 1st Tank \nBattalion, 1st Marine Division, Air-Ground Combat Center, Twenty-nine \nPalms, CA. He was killed in a tank accident in Iraq on March 25. He was \nfrom Queens, NY. He was born in Brooklyn and grew up in the Maspeth \nsection of Queens. He was known to treasure his Puerto Rican heritage. \nHe is survived by his parents, four siblings, and 17 nieces and \nnephews.\n  I have come to this Chamber to honor our fallen military personnel \nbefore. We now have 20 men who have died in the Iraqi war who were \neither from California or who were based in my home State. My State \nmourns their loss. May these beautiful young Americans rest in peace. \nMay we have a short war. And may we also pray for the wisdom of those \nwho sent our young men and women into their mission.\n  When we speak about the realities of war and how families will never \nbe the same, as we take this bill up to make sure we have the best \nequipped military in the world and they have everything they need to \nprotect them from harm, we also need to protect civilians from harm, \nwhich gets me back to the amendment that is before the body today.\n  We have been warned by the FBI that the chance of a shoulder-fired \nmissile being fired at one of our civilian aircraft is real. We have \nbeen warned by\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\nthe Transportation Security Agency that the threat is real. The \nadministration has deployed National Guard to various airports in our \ncountry to try to spot one of these individuals with a shoulder-fired \nmissile. We know there are skeptics who have now come to the conclusion \nthat this is, in fact, a very real threat to our people. We have heard \nfrom the travel industry that such an attack would be more than \ncatastrophic, and as we vote more and more funding for our airline \nindustry because we do not want to lose our airline industry, we need \nto take steps to protect it from further harm as well.\n  We have an amendment that ought to get bipartisan support. We have an \namendment that is fiscally responsible. We are not adding more money. \nWe are saying this is a high priority and it ought to happen because if \nwe can get the cost of these systems down below $1 million--right now \nthey are about $1 million a plane. Even that is a small amount when one \nconsiders an aircraft costs $100 million to $150 million a copy. If we \ncan get it even lower than that, it becomes less and less of a burden \nto both retrofit the older planes, the 6,800 planes we have flying now, \nand make this a mandated safety measure on all future commercial \naircraft.\n  There is a lot of support for this amendment. I just hope the Senate \nwill put it in place. I think all of us will be able to sleep a little \nbit better at night because there are folks out there who want to hurt \nus. We know that. They look at civilians in a way we have never seen \nbefore. On 9/11 we saw that just because you are a civilian does not \nprotect you from terrorists. It is our job to make sure we protect our \npeople from terrorists.\n  I am hopeful Senator Schumer will join us shortly. I yield the floor \nand suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, Senator Schumer is working hard on a \nmajor amendment dealing with first responders. I thank the Senator from \nthe bottom of my heart for all his work on this issue and this \namendment. Senator Schumer and Senator Clinton had an experience that \nno other Senator had. Yes, we had horrific pain in this area with the \nPentagon being hit. The Senators from this region dealt with the pain \nand suffering and grief, but Senators Schumer and Clinton saw something \nthey will never forget--none of us will, they particularly--and they \ndeal with the fallout of this every day.\n  When we talked about trying to get ahead of terrorists and listening \nto the FBI warnings, the TSA warnings, Senator Schumer said: I want to \nwork closely with you on this. God forbid something like this should \nhappen and a shoulder-fired missile would bring down a commercial \naircraft. We would all say, my God, why didn't we do something? We have \nthe technology.\n  I yield to my friend for as much time as he has remaining before \nSenator Stevens takes time to respond.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that I be given an additional 5 \nminutes, or 3\\1/2\\ minutes, so I may speak for 10 minutes, with the \nconsent of the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object--I would not object--I \nconsent that Senator Boxer control the time until 5 minutes of 11 a.m., \nand if we extend that time, we would then control the time until 11:15.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object--because I understand my \nfriend just came from the Judiciary Committee and some of us want to \nget over to the Judiciary Committee, and I understand Senator Bayh was \nset to go on at 11:05--now we are asking consent to move Senator Bayh's \namendment to a later time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We do not have a time agreement on Senator Bayh's \namendment. He is next in order. The Senator asked to extend the time by \n5 minutes, and I asked to extend by 5 minutes. That does extend the \ntime when another amendment would be taken up until 11:15; that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nit is not Senator Stevens asking for additional time, it is Senator \nSchumer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be brief. I withdraw my request to accommodate my \ncolleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withdraw the request?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I commend my colleague from California. We all know she \nis a fighter. She finds issues, focuses on them with passion, is able \nto persuade so many others. The American people are lucky that Senator \nBoxer has taken such a leadership role in defending the homeland. I \nknow the citizens of California thank her, but so do the Senators of \nNew York. This is a real danger.\n  If we had to make a list of how terrorists would go after us, \nunfortunately, shoulder-held missiles would be at the top of the list. \nAs my colleague from California has demonstrated, we know they have \nthem. We know al-Qaida, the most sinister right now of the terrorist \norganizations, has tried to use them. And there is an FBI statement \nthat says just that.\n  God forbid this should happen. God forbid the loss of life, the \nanguished families. Would anyone fly for 3 months, 6 months, 9 months? \nThe economy is squishy now. If one of these shoulder-held missiles were \nused by terrorists to bring down one of our commercial airliners, it \nwould send the economy due south; we would have huge problems.\n  The good news is we can stop this. Yes, it will cost some dollars. \nBut I cannot understand the attitude that we should not spend dollars \nto deal with something such as this. The Senator from California is not \nasking for much. I, for one, would like to see more money. I know if we \ndo this, it will eventually cost more money, but she is being extremely \nmodest in the amendment.\n  To say, against one of the greatest dangers held for our wonderful \npeople in America, that we should not do anything defies imagination, \ndefies belief. We have the technology on our military planes, on Air \nForce One, El Al Airlines. I have dealt with the former top of security \nof El Al Airlines. They have them. They unfortunately know what \nterrorists can do. Yet we are saying we should fiddle while terrorism \nburns. I don't get it.\n  The Senator from California and I carefully crafted this amendment, \nalong with Congressman Mica from Florida, a Republican Member, to make \nit as modest as possible. I hope we accept this amendment. No one wants \nthis to be a partisan amendment. Obviously, it is not. However, one of \nour jobs is to defend the troops. We are doing that by supporting the \nPresident's request. One of our jobs is to protect this homeland from \nthe new scourge of terrorism.\n  I mourn every day for the families lost on September 11. I wear this \nflag on my lapel every day in their memory; God willing, I will wear it \nevery day for the rest of my life. I don't want it to happen again in \nany way. Spend a few dollars to make sure that does not happen.\n  If we ask the American people to line up the priorities of all \nFederal spending, does anyone think this is at the bottom?\n  They say there is no more money or maybe it will come out of some \nexisting funds. We know what that means around here. That means forget \nit. If you cannot earmark it, it does not happen. I cannot believe we \nare not going to do this. I can't believe there is opposition to this. \nI can't believe, on something so vital to our security, where we have \nspent billions of dollars to protect our military planes, that we would \nnot apply it to commercial airliners because in the post-September 11 \nworld, those commercial airliners are just as much targets as our F-18s \nand F-16s and B-1s and B-2s.\n  Please, colleagues, let's not be in the ``what if'' situation.\n  Let's not wake up one morning after this has occurred and say, What \nif we had done this? I would plead with my colleagues to support this \nvery important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded the Senator from California \nhas expired. The Senator from Alaska controls the next 15 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Alaska controls time at 5 minutes of \n11.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Has the time for \nthe Senator from California been exhausted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it has.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise to oppose this amendment because \nit is premature. The amendment is premature not only in my view but in \nthe view that was held by the Senator from California on March 13 in \nthe Commerce Committee when we marked up the cargo security bill. At \nthat time, the Senator from California said, and I quote from the \nrecord of the hearing of the markup:\n\n       I have a bill which I am not moving today because I think \n     that would require a hearing. But what I thought would be \n     good is that since the TSA has said they are studying the \n     best way to combat this--\n\n  Speaking of protection of the airliners from missile attack--\n\n       but yet we haven't seen the study, what I would say in this \n     amendment is to ask them to please give us a report on their \n     study to this committee within 90 days on the best way to \n     defend turbo and jet passenger aircraft from these shoulder-\n     fired missiles.\n\n  So we adopted the amendment of the Senator from California on the \ncargo security bill that is before the Senate which will be passed by \nthe Senate without any doubt whatsoever.\n  I do not know of any living American who does not want to protect our \nairliners. I do not know of any living American who does not want to \nprotect all of America, including our borders.\n  The fact is that it is proposed to spend $30 million on R and \ndeployment of technology on commercial airliners. I can assure my \ncolleagues that it is not that easy. It is not that easy to transfer \ntechnology which is adopted for military aircraft and then immediately \ntransfer it to civilian aircraft. Obviously, we need some time for the \nTSA to look at the threat and put the threat in the scale of the \nthreats that we face in an order of priority, and the best way may not \nbe installing this equipment on airliners. It probably is. But we do \nnot know for sure. All we know is that there is a threat, as there are \nmyriad threats out there to our lives and our security, whether they be \nat reservoirs or nuclear powerplants or along our borders, or wherever \nthey may be. And we do have the ability perhaps to adopt military \ntechnology. But that has to be studied, as the amendment of hers on the \nbill after discussion in the markup.\n  What type of technology is it? How can we deploy technology \nimmediately when we do not know what technology it is that is best \nexecuted if we believe that airliners needed this protection \nimmediately.\n  I am not going to take the entire 8 minutes the Senator from----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That the Senator from Alaska yielded, but I just say this \nis a premature amendment. This is an amendment that is going to spend \n$30 million for deployment of technology when we do not even know if \nthat technology exists, and if it does, if that is the best technology. \nSo that is why I am in opposition to the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to respond to a question from the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. I think the Senator makes a very \nimportant point that I absolutely supported a study in the committee. \nSince that has occurred, however, two things have happened. Chairman \nMica on the other side invited me to a secret meeting.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator have a question or does she want to use \nher own time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was hoping--I don't have any time left.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator has a question, I would be glad to \nrespond. Otherwise, I do not want to use the time of the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do have a question. I was just going to let the Senator \nknow what had happened and then I was going to ask the question.\n  What happened at that time was this threat had been rising and the \nadministration took action since the time of the study that said to all \nthe big airports around the country, national guardsmen will protect \nagainst this threat. Chairman Mica changed his mind after those \nhearings and I became more concerned. That is the reason why I drafted \nthis to be both a study and a deployment on just a couple of planes.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Regular order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just wanted to know if my rationale made any sense.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator for her question, and I appreciate \nthe Senator from Alaska allowing that time. It is still premature and I \nthink that to order a study of the background within a period of a \ncouple months would be most appropriate.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I say to the Senate that as a pilot, \nalmost every pilot I know shudders over the thought of weapons that are \nheat-seeking missiles. I commend the Senator from Arizona for what he \nhas done already on the commitment of trying to get a study. I do not \nwant to leave the impression here--it is classified, but there are some \ncommercial planes that are outfitted for some defenses against some \nweapons. But all you have to do is think of ``Blackhawk Down'' to know \nit is not that simple.\n  The Air Force has been working in research and development on a \nsystem. It is being tested on one plane so far. As a matter of fact, it \nis too large for most of our commercial aircraft. We don't know how \nsoon it will be before we can get technology that can be fielded for \ncivil aviation. There are several systems available that can detect the \nshoulder-fired weapons. However, they are not effective on all of them, \nand the problem is, if we are going to say that our civilian airlines \nare safe, to find a system that is safe.\n  Currently, we have some. As I said, one of these systems is deployed \non commercial aircraft to try to see how effective it might be. These \nsystems currently that are being deployed cost about a million dollars \na plane. I just do not see many commercial airlines that are ready to \nput out $1.5 million for each plane to try to defend it with a system \nthat is not deemed to be effective by the Air Force so far.\n  The Boxer amendment earmarks $30 million from within the \ncounterterrorism fund for this project to equip our commercial airlines \nwith a system to defeat heat-seeking missiles.\n  This will reduce the fund; the counterterrorism fund has been assumed \nto provide additional dollars for agencies within that department. One \nhundred and twenty million dollars is assumed in this bill to pay for \nthe passenger screeners and other costs incurred at additionally \nsecured airports.\n  We have tried to be very discrete about this fund. This is not a bill \nto deal with the problems of commercial airliners. This is a bill to \ndeal with funding the war. Again, I want to say we have three wars \ngoing on, and this is not part of the war. We already have taken this \nup in Commerce. We have a study coming because of it. I hope that bill \nwill pass.\n  I share the absolute fear that Senator Boxer reflects in terms of the \nproblem of passenger aircraft having some defense against shoulder-\nfired missiles. Again, I wish we could all take a look at ``Blackhawk \nDown.'' There is no question they are out there and they are very much \na fear in terms of terrorism. But that is what the Department of \nHomeland Security is for and that is why the research and development \nmoney that is in the defense bill that has already been passed this \nyear, and that research is going on.\n  Madam President, I regret deeply that this is not the way to solve \nthe problem. The problem is going to be solved with a study that we \nhave asked for of what can be done and the funding that would follow \nthat study. I hope it gets here in time to deal with it on the 2004 \nbill.\n  Again, I do not know anyone else who fears these as much as pilots. \nPassengers to a great extent understand the problem but you have to be \na pilot to understand total consequences of having something that you \ncannot control from within the cockpit.\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\n  It is true we have these systems on high-performance airplanes. They \nare extremely heavy. As I said, they cost more than $1.5 million \napiece.\n  Madam President, $1.5 million added to the cost of a high-performance \nairplane we are buying for war purposes, that is one thing. This does \nnot affect that. Those systems have already been perfected under the \nDepartment of Defense, and they are adequate for our needs in defense.\n  I point out in the 12 years we have flown over Iraq on the so-called \nCAPs Program, we have not lost one plane to a heat-seeking missile to \nmy knowledge.\n  That is military. We are trying to say can we put them into civilian \nairlines? Can we put them into commuters? What size do we need?\n  It is a research program. I don't know how long it would take. I was \ntold at one time it would take up to 2 years to develop this system. \nBut we should approach this action from the point of view of research \nand development first and not a mandate, and particularly not take \nmoney out of the bill as it is right now.\n  We do have, by the way, some of them that are applicable to the \ncommercial system. It is dealing with a laser system. That system will \nbe available for installation in commercial airlines by fiscal year \n2006, under the current system. As I said, we are trying to accelerate \nresearch and development and ability to defend small aircraft and \nhelicopters. There just is none available today that can do that, that \nare affordable.\n  I reluctantly agree with the chairman of our committee. I believe the \nlanguage in the Cargo Security Act that was the product of Senator \nBoxer's efforts on the Commerce Committee should be allowed to go \nforward. We should study this important issue. But we should not be \ntaking money from other homeland security efforts and directing it be \nspent on pilot projects for systems that have not yet been demonstrated \nto be effective.\n  We are monitoring this. I say in all sincerity, I think the Commerce \nCommittee has Senators on both sides of the aisle who are committed to \nfollowing this through, to finding the best way to defend passenger \naircraft from shoulder-fired missiles.\n  This is not the way to do it. Reluctantly, I do move to table the \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Boxer amendment, amendment No. 472, be \nset aside until the hour of 1:50, and at that time the Senate proceed \nto a vote in relation to the amendment with no second-degree amendments \nin order to the amendment prior to the vote. I further ask unanimous \nconsent there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided immediately prior \nto that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to announce that will be the first vote in a \nsequence that will start at 1:50 p.m. this afternoon.\n  I now ask, if it is appropriate, and I believe it is, unanimous \nconsent with regard to the amendment Senator Bayh will offer, that \nthere be 20 minutes of debate under the control of the proponent, 10 \nminutes under control of myself, and no second-degree amendments in \norder prior to the vote. I further ask this amendment, when we are \nfinished, and I shall make--I may not make a motion to table this--but \na vote in relation to this amendment to be taken, if required, at the \nhour of 1:50, following the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I failed to tell the manager of the bill \nthat Senator Kennedy wants 10 minutes. So it would be 30 minutes and \nwhatever time you want to respond to that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection. The Senator has been waiting to \nspeak. I am pleased to amend my request that there be 30 minutes under \nthe control of the proponents and 10 minutes under my control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest? Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 474\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh], for himself, Mr. \n     Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Clinton, \n     and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 474.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide funding for grants to States for smallpox and \n               other bioterrorism inoculation activities)\n\n       On page 38, after line 24 add the following:\n\n\n         Smallpox and other Bioterrorism Inoculation Activities\n\n       For additional expenses necessary to support grants to \n     States for smallpox and other bioterrorism inoculation \n     activities, $340,000,000, to remain available until September \n     30, 2004: Provided, That this amount is transferred to the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Nelson of Nebraska, Senator Schumer, Senator Stabenow, and my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Mikulski.\n  I offer this amendment because of my conviction that just as we spare \nno expense ensuring our military men and women in the field have the \ntools with which to defend themselves, have the tools with which to \ndisarm rogue regimes that possess weapons of mass destruction so we can \nprotect the American people, we also need to give those tools to the \nbrave men and women working here at home who will defend the American \npeople against biological attack. That is because it is the same fight. \nIt is the same war.\n  Disarming rogue regimes of weapons of mass death, protecting American \ncitizens who might be killed by those weapons of mass death, is the \nsame fight. We need to make sure that both overseas in the military and \nhere at home, in terms of civilian defense, we do what it takes to \ndefend America's national security interests.\n  Simply put, in the war we are fighting today, the war against global \nterrorism, rogue regimes, and failed states, the distance between the \nfront lines and the home front is not that great. We must recognize \nthis fact and aggressively defend both; otherwise, the American people \nmay suffer.\n  We are now involved in a great conflict in Iraq. This conflict has, \nas its genesis, our desire to avoid another tragedy like September 11, \nonly this time involving weapons of mass destruction and casualties and \nloss that could be far greater.\n  We suffered 3,000 fatalities on September 11, worse than the attack \non Pearl Harbor, the greatest loss of life in our country since the \nCivil War.\n  But I rise today to say that, unfortunately, much worse can happen. \nWeapons of mass death--let us call them what they are because they seek \nto destroy not buildings or physical property but people--weapons of \nmass death capable of inflicting losses of catastrophic, even Biblical \nproportion, now roam the international landscape. Biological weapons in \nparticular can unleash pathogens capable of slaughtering millions, \nrending civil society itself and spreading terror and fear, and perhaps \nstarting a new Dark Age.\n  I do not overstate the case. Not so long ago, I tell my colleagues, \nthere was something called Operation Dark Winter that was conducted by \na variety of entities, including the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies. Operation Dark Winter sought to anticipate what \nmight happen if smallpox were introduced into the ventilation systems \nof three shopping malls in different States across our country.\n  Within 13 days, the disease had spread to 25 States. After 60 days, 3 \nmillion cases of smallpox had been diagnosed and more than 1 million \nAmerican citizens--1 million were anticipated to die from the outbreak. \nThat is just how bad it can get.\n  Colleagues, the threat is not theoretical. As we saw in this very \nChamber with the anthrax outbreak of a year ago, the threat of \nbiological weapons is all too real, all too tangible. Our intelligence \nservices estimate the chances of a nation such as Iraq possessing \nsmallpox are about 50-50. Other nations have it, too.\n  Terrorist groups such as al-Qaida and Ansal al-Islam and others are \nworking feverishly to obtain chemical and biological weapons. Since \nsmallpox is the worst case scenario when it comes to a\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\nbiological outbreak, we have to assume that smallpox would be near the \ntop of their list when it comes to obtaining a biological capability to \nattack the United States here at home or abroad.\n  The administration itself has recognized the threat. The President \nhimself was inoculated against smallpox to great fanfare. The \nrecommendation last December by the administration was to inoculate up \nto 10 million first responders--10 million--to ensure that our country \nwas in a position to minimize this threat, God forbid, should it reach \nour shores. Unfortunately, while the rhetoric has been right on, the \nresources and the actual response have been left wanting.\n  The response to date ignores the fact that there are many other \npressing needs when it comes to protecting the American people against \na biological attack. Smallpox is only one of the potential risks. \nInoculating our people against smallpox is only one of the steps that \nmust be taken. We simultaneously must move forward with expanding our \nlab capacity so we can analyze the cases as they come in so we know \nwhat we are dealing with. Is it a plague? Is it smallpox? Is it \nbotulism? What is the pathogen that is killing Americans? How do we \ntreat it? What should be our next steps?\n  Having a lab capacity is critically important. We have to improve the \ncommunications systems between the Federal level, the CDC, State \nlaboratories, and local hospitals because if there is not an effective \ncommunication system, the response will break down and people will die \nas a result.\n  Finally, we need better health monitoring at the local level so we \ncan judge the ebb and flow of systems and analyze exactly what it is we \nare dealing with so we know how to respond and save people's lives.\n  The response to date ignores all these other pressing needs competing \nfor scarce resources, leaving the very real possibility that either \nprotecting the Nation against smallpox will be left wanting or that \nthese other critical needs will be left wanting. That is a choice we \nshould not be forced to make.\n  The response also ignores the very language of the emergency \nsupplemental, which states explicitly that the funds can only be used \nfor equipment and training, that they cannot be used for inoculation--\nthey cannot be used for inoculation. So even if enough money had been \nprovided to help defend against smallpox, by the very wording of the \nsupplemental, the funds cannot be used for the most pressing need, to \nensure that first responders, who might be infected, are inoculated \nagainst smallpox, protecting both them and others with whom they might \nhave contact.\n  Third, the response to date ignores the very real, pressing fiscal \ncrises confronting our States. I just came from a meeting with my own \nGovernor. Indiana, as other States, is facing a deficit. It is strapped \nfor money. So States simply are not in a position to step in and \nprovide resources to fill in the gaps.\n  If this need is going to be met, if this threat is going to be met, \nif our people are going to be protected at this hour of national \ncrisis, at this hour of State fiscal crisis, it is the Federal \nGovernment that must step up and protect the national security \ninterests, the health and well-being of the American people, because we \nare the only level of government that is in a position to do so.\n  Next, the response proposed by the administration falls short of past \nresponses in similar cases. My colleagues might be interested to know \nthat in 1947, responding to a single outbreak of smallpox in New York \nCity, 6,350,000 citizens were inoculated, including 500,000 in a single \nday--in a single day. Yet there is nothing for smallpox inoculation in \nthis bill. Clearly, based upon past response, the current steps are \ninadequate and, hence, the amendment is necessary to supplement our \nefforts.\n  Finally, along these lines, the House of Representatives--not known \nfor responding overzealously to concerns such as this, known to want to \nkeep a firm grip on the purse strings--has recognized that the \nemergency supplemental is inadequate and has proposed an additional $94 \nmillion to help address this need. While $94 million is itself \ninadequate--the $340 million we propose in our amendment is the correct \nresponse to inoculate 4 million people who the States have said are \nnecessary to inoculate--at least the House of Representatives has taken \na tentative initial step in recognizing the very real need.\n\n  If we are going to meet this threat, the response to date proposed by \nthe administration, however well intended, is simply inadequate to \nmeeting the very real potential threat, the disastrous potential threat \nfacing the American people. That is why we have proposed action.\n  I will spend a couple of moments addressing what the potential \narguments against our amendment might be. I know some might suggest \nthis is simply more social spending. That is simply not the case. This \nmoney will save lives. We have been attacked, as we all know. As we all \nknow, terrorists are planning further attacks. We know they are \ndesperately seeking weapons of mass death, including biological \nweapons. We know that smallpox is the worst case scenario, and that in \nall likelihood they are attempting to get it.\n  This money is needed. It is not simply just more social spending. It \nis needed to save lives, and to save lives now. It would be \nirresponsible not to ensure that we are protecting against this threat \nbecause we know how real it can be.\n  Secondly, the argument that enough resources have already been \nprovided is simply not accurate. Enough resources have not been \nprovided to meet this threat, as the House of Representatives has \nrecognized, as the Governors of the 50 States have recognized in their \nState plans, saying that inoculating 4 million first responders is what \nis necessary to truly protect the American people.\n  The administration has done precious little along these lines. Not \nenough in the way of resources has been provided. Regrettably, \nresponding to this need is not inexpensive. The National Association of \nCounty & City Health Officials estimates that, at a bare minimum, it \ntakes $85--and, in fact, recent experience suggests far more--it takes \n$85 per case to screen, inoculate, and monitor the results of the \ninoculation per individual inoculated. That is the least case scenario. \nSo taking the lowest cost estimate, multiplying by the 4 million first \nresponders that the Governors and States, regardless of party, \nindicated need to be inoculated, that is how we reached our estimate of \n$340 million being the bare minimum needed to help protect the American \npeople against this threat.\n  Finally, 58 percent of local officials indicate that smallpox \ninoculations are now hurting their other bioterrorism efforts. I would \nask my colleagues, What do we leave the American people vulnerable to? \nIf we emphasize smallpox, do we choose to leave them vulnerable to \nanthrax? Do we choose to leave them vulnerable to another pathogen that \nis capable of killing millions of people? That is simply not the \nresponsible course of action. Yet it is the course we are on if we do \nnot adopt this amendment.\n  In closing, let me say that my position in this amendment, offered by \nmyself, Senator Mikulski, and others, is not a partisan position. I \nhave with me an article from the Washington Post of 2 days ago, \nindicating the very pressing needs that States face in this arena.\n  It quotes several Governors, including Governor Pataki of New York, \nGovernor Huckabee of Arkansas, and others, to the effect that States \nand cities are simply not being provided with the resources they need \nfrom the Federal Government. I quote:\n\n       [G]overnors and mayors of both parties declared [the \n     funding is] inadequate.\n\n  Our States and cities deserve better from us than that.\n  Finally, I have letters that I will have printed in the Record from \ncity and local health officials, including the American Nurses \nAssociation, who indicate that our exposure to the West Nile virus and \nthe recently discovered SARS respiratory problem will be much, much \nworse because of their efforts to fight smallpox, if we don't provide \nthe additional funding so they don't have to confront the dilemma they \nare confronting: Do they protect against smallpox or some other cause \nof death? We should not leave them in that lurch.\n  In conclusion, this is a pressing problem. It is a single war: The \nwar abroad\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\nto disarm rogue nations, to protect us from weapons of mass death, and \nthe war here to protect America from those same sources of threats. \nThey both deserve our attention and funding. That is the purpose of \nthis amendment. I am pleased to offer it on behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have relevant material \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                               County & City Health Officials,\n\n                                     Washington DC, April 2, 2003.\n     Refunding for smallpox vaccination.\n\n     Hon. Evan Bayh\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bayh: The National Association of County and \n     City Health Officials (NACCHO) is committed to preparing the \n     nation to respond to an outbreak of smallpox, should such a \n     terrible event ever occur. Therefore, we strongly support \n     additional funding for the large, unanticipated costs that \n     state and local public health agencies are incurring to \n     implement the President's smallpox vaccination program. \n     Nearly 80% of local public health agencies already report \n     that they are diverting resources from overall bioterrorism \n     preparedness to work on smallpox vaccination. This situation \n     is unsustainable and threatens to undermine our nation's \n     ability to improve public health preparedness for other acts \n     of biological, chemical, or nuclear terrorism.\n       Existing federal funds for bioterrorism preparedness are \n     neither available nor sufficient to pay for both smallpox \n     vaccination and other bioterrorism planning and preparedness \n     work that is already underway. Congress appropriated $940 \n     million in FY2002 and $940 for FY2003 to help states and \n     localities improve their capacities to respond to public \n     health threats and emergencies. The Department of Health and \n     Human Services made the first $918 million available to the \n     states in June 2002. This disbursement of federal funds \n     occurred in a timely and responsible fashion and states were \n     directed to spend these funds in five different areas of \n     public health preparedness. Neither HHS nor states and \n     localities contemplated undertaking smallpox vaccination at \n     that time and funds have been programmed and obligated to \n     improve overall preparedness in multiple ways, pursuant to \n     HHS' guidance to the states.\n       The Administration announced a smallpox vaccination program \n     six months later and has expected states and localities to \n     pay the costs of this program from the FY 2002 bioterrorism \n     funds they had received. This expectation is unrealistic for \n     two reasons. First, as is the case with any federal program, \n     the sums that states have spent according to HHS records do \n     not reflect plans and obligations that have already been \n     undertaken and cannot be reversed either for legal or \n     practical reasons. Second, the costs of smallpox vaccination \n     are proving to be far greater than had been anticipated. \n     Smallpox vaccination is not like giving flu shots in the \n     local mall. Extensive advance planning, training, and \n     consultation in the community are necessary. Delivering the \n     vaccine requires careful screening and counseling. Follow-up \n     to assure a proper ``take'' and to prevent secondary \n     transmission of vaccinia is essential, as are design and \n     implementation of systems to track adverse reactions. NACCHO \n     has found that costs for smallpox vaccination being incurred \n     now by local public health agencies smallpox vaccination \n     range from $154 to $284 per person, with an average of $204 \n     per person. These do not include costs to states or to other \n     entities, such as hospitals or police or fire departments.\n       NACCHO is deeply concerned that it is dangerously short-\n     sighted to devote our resources for public health \n     preparedness to a single potential agent. We cannot \n     anticipate what agents might be used by a bioterrorist. \n     Moreover, we remain highly vulnerable to natural disease \n     outbreaks, including West Nile virus and the newly-discovered \n     Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, that have a potential to \n     cause more illness and death than would occur in many \n     bioterrorism scenarios. We believe that we must build our \n     public health systems so that they are well-staffed, \n     effective and adaptable. We should avoid building separate \n     systems for specific diseases; they will tax our resources, \n     and unless we use them day in and day out, they won't work \n     well when they are really needed. We must also achieve \n     preparedness specifically for smallpox, which has the unique \n     feature of requiring vaccination of a number of public health \n     and medical personnel, but we cannot afford to sacrifice \n     other improvement in that process.\n       We appreciate your leadership and concern for public health \n     protection and look forward to working with you to ensure \n     that the public health system is able to improve preparedness \n     for all public health threats and emergencies, in addition to \n     smallpox.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Patrick M. Libbey,\n     Exeuctive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                                                    April 2, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the American Nurses Association \n     (ANA), I am writing to urge you to support the amendment \n     offered by Senator Bayh to the supplemental appropriations \n     bill. This amendment will provide resources so that state and \n     local health departments can safely implement the smallpox \n     vaccination program.\n       The ANA is the only full-service association representing \n     the nation's RNs through our 54 state and territorial \n     constituent member associations. Our members are well \n     represented in the Administration's plan to vaccinate 10.5 \n     million health care workers and first responders.\n       Sufficient funds must be appropriated to the states to \n     support robust education, prescreening and surveillance of \n     the potential recipients of the vaccine. The recent death of \n     a Maryland nurse, a Florida nurse aide and a National \n     Guardsman only underscore the need for aggressive medical \n     screening, monitoring and treatment. Nurses and other first \n     responders will continue to feel uncomfortable about the \n     vaccine until they receive the reliable information needed to \n     make an informed decision.\n       Members of the armed services have received personalized \n     education and free and confidential prescreening prior to the \n     administration of the vaccine. This process properly screened \n     out one-third of the potential recipients. Unfortunately, \n     existing Federal funds for states to conduct a proper \n     vaccination program have been exhausted. The National \n     Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) \n     estimates that state and local health offices are incurring a \n     cost of $204 per person vaccinated. These expenditures are \n     diverting needed health resources away from other important \n     bioterrorism and public health activities.\n       Once again, the ANA urges you to support the Bayh amendment \n     to the supplemental appropriations bill. These funds are \n     critical to ensure state and local officials can actually \n     implement the crucial education, prescreening and \n     surveillance programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Rose Gonzalez, MPS, RN,\n     Director, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n           Employees, AFL-CIO,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.3 million members of the \n     American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \n     (AFSCME), I am willing to urge you to support amendments to \n     the supplemental appropriations bill that will increase \n     funding for homeland security. In particular, we urge you to \n     support an amendment to add $4.3 billion for funding the \n     ``first responders'' that will be offered by Senators \n     Schumer, Clinton and Mikulski. We also urge you to support an \n     amendment for $340 million for combating bioterrorism to be \n     offered by Senator Bayh.\n       The cost of shoring up the nation's security needs has \n     placed an enormous burden on state and local governments, \n     particularly New York City, Los Angeles and other \n     jurisdictions that face the greatest security threat. Reduced \n     revenues from a slow economy, increased human needs and \n     increased security needs have stretched state and local \n     governments beyond their capacity. Today, states face their \n     gravest fiscal crisis since World War II. If the nation is to \n     be secure, it is imperative that the Congress help state and \n     local governments improve security by providing more federal \n     resources for first responders.\n       The amendment to be offered by Senator Bayh will provide \n     resources so that state and local health departments can \n     implement the President's smallpox vaccination program \n     safely. Public health officials have estimated that the cost \n     of each vaccination will average $204. New resources are \n     needed to carry out the smallpox program without diverting \n     resources away from other bioterrorism preparedness and core \n     public health activities.\n       Since September 11, the nation has come to realize that it \n     has numerous vulnerabilities to terrorist attack. These \n     vulnerabilities must be addressed through a national \n     commitment to improve homeland security. Accordingly, we urge \n     you to support amendments to increase funding for homeland \n     security, and in particular the two amendments to be offered \n     by Senators Schumer, Clinton and Mikulski and by Senator \n     Bayh.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles M. Loveless,\n                                          Director of Legislation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sixteen and a half minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that \ndivided between myself and the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to retain a minute of my \ntime, if the Chair would inform me.\n  This country has given focus to the battle on the war on terrorism in \na variety of different ways, but one area which is enormously important \nis the threat we are facing from bioterrorism.\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\n  We enacted legislation even prior to 9/11 that was very helpful and \nimportant at that time. We have enacted legislation subsequently, and \nnext week we are going to be enacting legislation which will support \nthe President's commitment for some $6 billion that will be used to \ndevelop vaccinations in anticipation of the threat we will be having \noverseas by these very dangerous pathogens that are being developed.\n  Now we have smallpox and anthrax that are dangerous to this country. \nPeople in this city have certainly witnessed the dangers. Families have \nbeen impacted and affected because loved ones have lost their lives \nbecause of the dangers of anthrax.\n  This amendment is meant to provide help to local communities to make \nsure they have an effective vaccination program, period. There are a \nnumber of different features in the war dealing with bioterrorism. One \nis to make sure we have the people on the ground who are trained, \nsupported, who have the ability to screen, have the vaccines, and will \ndo the followup work if we expect this program to take off.\n  Secondly, we have to have a compensation program that will be \navailable to provide help to these individuals if there is an adverse \nreaction. Why this is so important is these first responders, when they \nsigned up for their job, didn't think they were taking on the \nadditional responsibility of dealing with terrorism. Now we are asking \nthem to do that. We are asking them to do something in addition.\n  In some instances, with some vaccines, they will be risking their \nlives, because we know a certain number of them are going to die and a \ncertain amount of them will have serious disabilities as a result of \ntaking the vaccine. That is the vaccination compensation program. That \nis not on this bill.\n  What we are talking about here is making sure individuals in local \ncommunities are going to have the resources to resist any bioterrorism \nthat comes their way in the form of anthrax and smallpox. To do it, you \nhave to give support to local communities. This legislation before us \ndoes not do it. There is no funding whatsoever. There are billions for \nour soldiers and our sailors, and all of us are for that, but it does \nnot provide any resources.\n  I say that against this following background. Last year we cut \nsupport for our hospitals by $1.9 billion. Those were cuts in the \nMedicaid program and also in what we call graduate medical education. \nWe provided $500 million for them under the battle of bioterrorism, but \nthey still lost $1.4 billion in cuts to the hospitals. We say we have \nalready provided sufficient funding for these hospitals. I will not \ntake the time now, because it is short, to read into the record what \nthe hospitals are saying, not just in my State but all over the \ncountry, the pressure they are under to try to get the programs \nstarted.\n  My friend and colleague from Indiana has indicated it costs about \n$80. Actually, according to better estimates, it is about $200. I will \nput that in the Record. I thank him for offering this amendment. The \nPresident's program is asking 10 million people in phase 2 of the \nimmunization program, 10 million people. Under the Bayh program you get \ncoverage for about 4 million. It is a very modest program. That is $85. \nIt is done cheaper in the military because they have the trained \npersonnel to do it.\n  By and large, public health officials believe if we are going to have \na monitoring program--and we have seen in this past week how important \nthat monitoring program can be, because if you have these kinds of \nvaccinations going to individuals who have some kind of heart \ncomplication and difficulty, it can cause death. That is why the \nmonitoring is so important. We want to make sure we have a program that \nwill be put in place.\n  Today it is suspended by 10 States. Ten States are not doing it \nbecause they don't think the program itself has been set up in a way \nwhich can provide adequate protection to the individuals who need it.\n  I hope our friend and colleague on the Appropriations Committee will \nbe willing to accept this amendment. It is a bare-bones amendment. I \nremind the Senate what happened yesterday in the Human Resources \nCommittee when we were dealing with the compensation program. Our \nfriend and colleague, Senator Mikulski, made an impassioned statement \nabout what happened to a particular individual in her State with this \nvaccination program. It was accepted unanimously, by Republican and \nDemocrat, that there should be additional resources to make sure if we \ngo ahead with this immunization program--I am strongly committed that \nwe do--it is done wisely and right.\n\n  The amendment offered by Senator Bayh and Senator Mikulski and \nothers--I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor, if I am \nnot--is an absolutely essential part on the war on terrorism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fighting against the dangers of bioterrorism is a key \naspect on the war on terrorism. To do that, you need to have two \ncomponents: One, you need a compensation program; secondly, you need to \nbe able to get that program of vaccinations out there. It is not \ngetting out there now. It is putting too great a strain on local public \nhealth officials. We should give them assistance to make sure we have \nthe very best. We want the best for our service men and women fighting \nin Iraq, and we want the best for our first responders whose lives are \nat risk. This amendment will ensure they will receive the best in terms \nof support in local communities.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a proud cosponsor of this \namendment that would provide $340 million to State governments to do \nimportant education, screening, and monitoring in the delivery of the \nsmallpox vaccine program.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues a story. One of my \nconstituents, who lives on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, died last \nweek from a heart attack 5 days after she received the smallpox \nvaccine. I am not drawing a conclusion that the two are linked. We will \nleave that to the appropriate medical and public health officials to \ndecide. But let me tell you the story. She was 55 years old. She just \ngot her nursing degree after having another degree. She wanted to get \nher nursing degree because the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland is an \nunderserved health community in terms of doctors and nurses.\n  She is a Native American. She is a proud descendant of the Assateague \ntribe. Her name is Andrea Deerheart Cornitcher. She wanted to volunteer \nfor the smallpox vaccine so she could serve her community, serve her \ncountry in the event of a smallpox attack. She was ready to do anything \nshe needed to when she was called.\n  When I spoke to her husband, filled with grief and melancholy, I \nasked him what he wanted to tell me and, if he could come to the floor \nof the Senate, what would he tell us. He said: Senator, tell your \ncolleagues, and if you have a chance to talk to the President, tell \nhim, people are ready to volunteer, but they have to have a right to \nknow what they are getting into. They have the right to know how safe \nthe vaccine is. They have to know how safe they will be if they get the \nvaccine. We need education. We need screening. I might add, we need \nmonitoring and surveillance, so that if you sign up to be part of the \nbioshield warriors, you will have ongoing monitoring and \nbiosurveillance to make sure there are no physical or other \nrepercussions from this.\n  That is what Mr. Glenn Standing Bear Mayo asked. He said, the way I \nwant to honor my wife, the way we ought to protect America, is to make \nsure we protect the volunteers. The way to protect the volunteers is \nthrough education, better and more amplified screening, and ongoing \nmonitoring and surveillance.\n  You cannot do this on the cheap. Public health departments are \nalready stretched to the breaking point.\n  They are now foraging for funds to be able to meet a Federal mandate \nto recruit, screen, and do smallpox vaccinations for our first \nresponders who are volunteering. This takes $85 per screening. They \ndon't have it. They are taking money from other funds--from maternal \nand child health, West Nile virus, or being prepared in case SARS comes \nto the United States.\n  This is a very modest amount to put into the Federal checkbook. It \ndoesn't\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\neven deal with the larger issue of compensation that we will debate at \nanother time, an appropriate time.\n  I salute the Senator from Indiana for advocating this. I advocated it \nin the authorizing committee just yesterday. It was accepted by the \ncommittee. The committee knows this is important. Now is the time to \nmake it a reality by putting screening, testing, and monitoring into \nthe Federal checkbook.\n  So I really ask my colleagues: If the volunteers are going to have \nenough confidence to participate in the program, they need to know what \nthey are getting into, and they need to be properly screened. They need \nto know that they will be monitored and that there will be surveillance \nto protect them as they line up to protect America. They also need to \nknow that there is a safety net for an adequate and responsible \ncompensation program. This amendment does not deal with compensation, \nbut it deals with funding the usual and customary public health \nprotections. It says that people have a right to know, they have a \nright to be heard about their concerns, and they have a right to be \nprotected.\n  On behalf of Andrea Deerheart Cornitcher, I offer this amendment with \nmy colleagues to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment of my good friend from Indiana that will help State and local \nhealth departments pay for the cost of administering the smallpox \nvaccine.\n  The threat of terrorism, both foreign and domestic, is real and \nshould not be taken lightly. We prepare for these threats by preparing \nour first responders--including our health care professionals. Whenever \nand wherever disasters have struck, health care professionals have \nresponded selflessly by lending their skills, time, and expertise to \nhelp victims and their families. Now we are asking them to safeguard \nthe health care infrastructure by being vaccinated against smallpox. \nThe least we can do is make sure that the funds are available to \nprovide the vaccinations.\n  The vaccinations are more expensive than anticipated. Vaccinating \nagainst smallpox is not like giving flu shots. Preparation and training \nis needed to administer the vaccine by trained professionals who must \nbe able to carefully screen vaccine recipients for potential adverse \nreactions. Followup is also needed to check on health status. All of \nthis takes time and resources. My State of Nebraska has already \nvaccinated 2500 workers at a cost of about $140 per person for a total \nof $350,000.\n  The resources to pay for and administer these vaccinations have been \ndiverted from other important bioterrorism preparedness activities. The \nfinancial assistance provided in this amendment will allow States to \ndually safeguard against smallpox without diverting funds ``from other \nimportant bioterrorism preparation efforts. Without this additional \nfunding, vaccinating against smallpox is essentially an unfunded \nmandate to the States.\n  As any biological attack would certainly be a Federal priority, it is \nboth unfair and ineffective not to provide Federal funds to prepare for \nthe possibility. A virus will not stop at State lines. Our efforts to \nprevent the spread of a devastating illness should be national in \nscope, as should be the funding to pay for it.\n  I commend the Senator from Indiana for introducing the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? There are 3 minutes 45 \nseconds remaining on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I want to make two or three brief points in \nconclusion. The emergency supplemental contains funding for fatalities \nthat might result from vaccination. But there is no funding \nspecifically targeted to preventing those fatalities through screening. \nIt seems to me this is an irony we should address and do address in \nthis amendment--money for fatalities from vaccinations but not \nresources to prevent those fatalities.\n  Secondly, as my colleagues pointed out, money is being literally \ntaken away from working against the West Nile virus, against SARS, and \nagainst other potential causes of fatalities. We could leave America \nvulnerable to other sources of sickness and death if this amendment is \nnot adopted.\n  The goal here is to prevent fatalities abroad in our fighting men and \nwomen and here at home, directly or indirectly. Without the adoption of \nthis amendment, fatalities will result either from smallpox or from \nother potential pathogens left wanting--West Nile, SARS, and others--\nbecause resources are being taken away from those for inoculations \nagainst smallpox because the resources are not available. That is why \nthere is a pressing case for adopting this amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support, and I urge its immediate \nadoption.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will reserve our time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I can yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts or proceed now, at his request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the Senator prepared to yield back, or is the Senator \ngoing to talk? I would like to respond.\n  Mr. STEVENS. All right. I yield myself such time as I may use. I \ndon't think I have a request from anybody else on this side.\n  I compliment the Senator from Indiana on this amendment. The House \nhas $94 million in a smallpox vaccine fund. I have a little conflict of \ninterest here because I am one of the few Members of the Senate who has \ntaken the smallpox vaccination again. I have had it many times in my \nlife. Going back, as a 19-year-old, I first got it when I was admitted \nto the Army.\n  There are some 4 million responders who could be vaccinated under \nthis amendment, as I understand it. The figure that has been used by \nSenator Bayh is $85 per person. The current costs range somewhere from \n$20 to $284 a person, depending on who does the estimates. The \nadministration's current estimate is that it would cost $13 per person \nto deal with 4 million responders. There are already funds allocated to \nhealth departments, and I believe we should take this up in the regular \nbill when we go to the 2004 bill.\n  I remind the Senate that this bill is for the period from now until \nSeptember 30. We are not going to appropriate moneys beyond September \n30 unless, on a bipartisan basis, we find it is necessary. So far, it \nhas not been necessary. There are other health needs, such as TB, West \nNile virus, and HIV. Now we have this terrible situation coming out of \nChina.\n  There is no question that many people are interested in this subject, \nand I can state without any question that our leader, Dr. Frist--\nSenator Frist--is very interested in that subject. So I merely state \nthat I wish to discuss the amount of this amendment with the Senator \nfrom Indiana. I do not believe we should put up more money than is \nnecessary for this fiscal year. We should process the moneys for beyond \nthis fiscal year in the normal bill. I will be very pleased to discuss \nthat with him.\n  I have no request for Senators to speak on this side. I hope we will \nhave a portion, at least, of Senator Bayh's amendment in this bill for \nfiscal year 2003, and I reserve a sufficient time to make a motion on \nor in relation to this amendment, if that is necessary. I hope it will \nnot be necessary.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time and listen to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 40 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have been briefed by the Department of \nDefense. The cost for the military is about $28 or $29. They have done \na very effective program. The National Association of State and County \nOfficials estimates it is $150 to $284. Senator Bayh is down to $85. \nThere is zero in the bill at the present time.\n  The first responders we are talking about are at the cutting edge of \ndefending the country against a bioterror attack. I don't believe we \nought to make the case in Washington, DC, when we have seen Americans \ndie as a result of anthrax. If you are going to have an effective \nprogram, you are going to have to support local communities to be\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\nable to implement that program. That is what this amendment provides. \nIt is a very modest amendment.\n  The President of the United States says he wants, initially, 400,000 \nimmunized, and then he wants 10 million. There is zero money to \naccomplish that in the supplemental. We believe there is a sense of \nurgency and we ought to do it now. That is what the Bayh amendment \ndoes. That is why a very modest downpayment is called for in this \namendment. I hope this will be accepted.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for fiscal year 2004, this provides $3.7 \nbillion for biodefense, and $940 million is included for grants to \nStates and local health departments. Those departments already have \nfunds to implement a vaccination strategy. There is no need to add more \nmoney here for State and local health departments.\n  I am willing to discuss the amounts necessary for the vaccine. Again, \nI reserve my right to reserve sufficient time that I might make a \nmotion on or in relation to the amendment, if necessary, when the \nvoting starts at 1:50.\n  I yield back the remainder of whatever time I have. I believe the \nSenator from Florida is here to offer the next amendment, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Florida takes the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding on this amendment there will be 30 \nminutes--20 minutes to the Senator from Florida and 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Alaska; is that right? Does Senator Stevens want to look \nat the amendment first?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I agree to the time, but I have not seen \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. REID. We will withhold the request until the Senator reviews the \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do not think there will be a problem.\n  Mr. REID. We can renew that request after Senator Stevens has had a \nchance to look at the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator is prepared to renew his request, I am \nprepared to agree.\n  Mr. REID. I renew that request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the vote on or in relation to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Florida occur third in line; that \nis, Boxer, Bayh, and Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. As per the other agreements, there will be no second-degree \namendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 459\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I call up amendment No. 459.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Biden, Mr. Edwards, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Nelson of Florida, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 459.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To appropriate an additional $375,000,000 for the Department \n  of Veterans Affairs for Medical Care for costs of medical care for \n           certain veterans of the current conflict in Iraq)\n\n         At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n                     Veterans Health Administration\n\n                              MEDICAL CARE\n\n         For necessary expenses for the maintenance and operation \n     of hospitals, nursing homes, and domiciliary facilities; for \n     furnishing, as authorized by law, inpatient and outpatient \n     care and treatment to beneficiaries of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, including care and treatment in facilities \n     not under the jurisdiction of the department; and for \n     furnishing recreational facilities, supplies, and equipment \n     incident to the provision of hospital care, medical services, \n     and nursing home care authorized by section 1710(e)(1)(D) of \n     title 38, United States Code, $375,000,000; Provided, That \n     such amount shall remain available until expended.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, on behalf of a large number of \nour colleagues--Senators Kerry, Mikulski, Murray, Dorgan, Dayton, \nDaschle, Johnson, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Bingaman, Clinton, Biden, \nEdwards, Rockefeller, Akaka, and my colleague Senator Nelson of \nFlorida--I offer an amendment today to address the cost of providing \nhealth care to troops serving in the war in Iraq.\n  This amendment would provide to the Veterans' Administration the \nadditional funds it will require to meet the needs of returning service \nmen and women.\n  There is a history behind this amendment. Following the 1991 gulf \nwar, returning servicemembers began to report unexplained illnesses and \nailments that many linked to their service. Under the law that existed \nand controlled at that time, only those who had been granted a claim \nfor a service-connected disability or demonstrated financial need could \nturn to the VA for health care services. The effect was to leave many \nof the returning veterans without medical coverage. Reservists were \nparticularly vulnerable as they lost their military health care \nbenefits shortly after returning. In 1998, Congress acted to ensure \nthat no combat veteran endures such a delay again.\n  This chart indicates the evolution of this process with the gaps that \nwere identified after the first gulf war being filled by Public Law \n105-368 which assured that combat veterans are eligible for VA care for \n2 years after discharge or separation from active duty, and it also \nextended this coverage to include reservists and National Guard \npersonnel, so that today any servicemember who participates in a \ntheater of combat is eligible for free VA health care for 2 years after \nseparation or release from active duty.\n  I emphasize, this is not discretionary. We are not talking about an \nitem that we can decide to omit. These veterans have a congressionally \nsanctioned right, an entitlement to these VA health services.\n  On March 19, 2003, the United States committed itself and our sons \nand daughters to a second gulf war, this time in the country of Iraq. \nThe Senate supported this second war. Now the Senate must provide \nsupport for them. We owe it to them to make certain they have the \nproper equipment to win the war, and we also must take care of these \nmen and women when they have completed their duty to our Nation.\n  This is why I rise today to offer an amendment to provide to the \nVeterans' Administration $375 million in funding to provide for the \ncare that we are obligated through the VA to make available to \nreturning troops. This is a downpayment on the cost of paying for these \nreturning servicemembers, a cost of war that has thus far been \noverlooked.\n  The estimated cost of $375 million is based on the percentage of \nveterans who sought VA health care and benefits following the 1991 gulf \nwar multiplied by the current VA average per patient cost of care.\n  Briefly, to look at the math, in the 1991 gulf war, there were \n582,136 persons who were subsequently separated from the military. That \nrepresents 82 percent of the force that was committed in the first gulf \nwar. Of that number, 166,717 were able to establish that they had a \nservice-connected disability, or 29 percent of the total of now \nveteran, former combat personnel in the first gulf war. In addition to \nthat, 287,848, or half of those veterans who were combat service \npersonnel in the first gulf war, used the VA for outpatient health care \nservices.\n  We use these numbers times the $3,300 of estimated annual cost as the \nbasis for the amendment we are offering. We assumed that the blend \nbetween those who had a service-connected disability and those who used \nthe VA for nonservice disability would equal one-third of those who \nwere deployed into the field. That would result in a number of 340,000 \ntroops who would be eligible, including reservists and National Guard, \ntimes $3,300, or $375 million to meet this mandate and obligation of \nthe VA.\n  No provision has been made for this responsibility of the VA in \nlegislation today. Nearly one-third of the 582,000 veterans in the \nfirst gulf war have already been granted service-connected\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\ndisability claims, and we can assume there will be a minimum of a \nsimilar number of veterans who will come from this second gulf war.\n  I indicate to my colleagues that this is a downpayment because as \nadditional service personnel, including reservists and National Guard, \neither by the end of their term or other voluntary action, are \nseparated from service, they will become eligible for this 2 years of \nVA health care.\n  There is an issue raised: Can the VA absorb this cost within its \ncurrent budget? It has been stated that it could because on January 17, \n2003, the VA cut off the future enrollment into the VA Health Care \nSystem for moderate and higher income veterans. At that time, the VA \ncited rising costs, long waiting times, and focusing on core \nconstituencies as the rationale for limiting services. There was no \nreference in January of 2003 that the Veterans Administration was doing \nthis in order to prepare itself financially to meet the obligation it \nwas going to have on returning troops.\n\n  In a press release on January 17, Secretary of the VA Principi said:\n\n       VA is maintaining its focus on the health care needs of its \n     core group of veterans, those with service-connected \n     disabilities, the indigent, and those with special health \n     care needs.\n\n  Again, no reference to the new obligation the VA was going to have as \na result of a war which was still almost 2 months prior to \ncommencement.\n  In the article in the Gainesville Sun on March 30, Secretary Principi \ntried to justify ending access to VA health care services for moderate \nand higher income veterans because of the war. He said at that time:\n\n       It's very important at this time, when you've got men and \n     women in combat, that we assure we have the capability to \n     treat them, that we're not trying to care for everybody at \n     the expense of those who take a bullet.\n\n  Some 10 weeks later, the rationale for the cutoff of moderate and \nhigh-income veterans was because of the war, whereas at the time it was \ndone it was because the VA needed to be able to maintain its focus on \nits current responsibility.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Gainesville \nSun article and the VA press release.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      [Department of Veterans Affairs News Release, Jan. 17, 2003]\n\n            VA Announces Record Budget, Health Care Changes\n\n       Washington.--Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony J. \n     Principi today announced a record increase in the budget for \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical care, the annual \n     decision required by law (PL 104-262) on health care \n     enrollment and a new plan between VA and the Department of \n     Health and Human Services for a program that will allow \n     eligible veterans to use their Medicare benefits for VA care.\n       The President's FY 2004 Budget includes a total of $63.6 \n     billion for VA--$30.2 billion in discretionary funding \n     (mostly for health care) and $33.4 billion for VA-\n     administered entitlement programs (mostly disability \n     compensation and pensions). The budget includes $225 million \n     in new construction funding for VA's nationwide \n     infrastructure initiative (CARES) to ensure that VA can put \n     services where veterans live.\n       ``VA is maintaining its focus on the health care needs of \n     its core group of veterans--those with service-connected \n     disabilities, the indigent and those with special health care \n     needs,'' Principi said.\n       ``We're able to do so because of the generous budget \n     proposed by President Bush for fiscal year 2004 beginning \n     Oct. 1, 2003. It will be 7.7 percent more for health care \n     than the expected FY 2003 budget. This would be the largest \n     requested increase in VA history,'' he said.\n       In order to ensure VA has capacity to care for veterans for \n     whom our Nation has the greatest obligation--military-related \n     disabilities, lower-income veterans or those needing \n     specialized care like veterans who are blind or have spinal \n     cord injuries--Principi has suspended additional enrollments \n     for veterans with the lowest statutory priority. This \n     category includes veterans who are not being compensated for \n     a military-related disability and who have higher incomes.\n       The suspension of enrollment affects only veterans in \n     Priority Group 8, the lowest group in VA's eight-level system \n     for setting health care priorities, who have not enrolled in \n     VA's health care system by January 17. Priority Group 8 \n     veterans already enrolled will be ``grandfathered'' and \n     allowed to continue in VA's health care system.\n       Work is underway with the Department of Health and Human \n     Services to determine how to give Priority Group 8 veterans \n     aged 65 or older who cannot enroll in VA's health care system \n     access to the ``VA+Choice Medicare'' plan. The plan calls for \n     VA to participate as a Medicare+Choice provider. Eligible \n     veterans would be able to use their Medicare benefits to \n     obtain care from VA.\n       In return, VA would receive payments from a private health \n     plan contracting with Medicare that would cover costs. The \n     ``VA+Choice Medicare'' plan would become effective later this \n     year as details are finalized between VA and the Department \n     of Health and Human Services.\n       ``HHS is happy to join the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     in developing this new option for veterans who might \n     otherwise be unable to obtain health care through the VA,'' \n     said HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson. ``This is a creative \n     marriage of our federal health programs to serve our veterans \n     efficiently and effectively.''\n       VA has been unable to provide all enrolled veterans with \n     timely access to health care services because of the \n     tremendous growth in the number of veterans seeking VA health \n     care. More than half of all new enrollees have been in \n     Priority Group 8. This demand for VA health care is expected \n     to continue in the future.\n       Between October 2001 and September 2002, VA enrolled \n     830,000 additional veterans. Since 1996, VA enrollment has \n     increased from 2.9 million to 6.8 million today. Non-service \n     disabled, higher income veterans accounted for the majority \n     of the rapid enrollment growth, hindering the ability of VA \n     to care for the service-disabled, the indigent and those with \n     special needs. Even with the suspension of new enrollments \n     for Priority Group 8 veterans, another 380,000 veterans in \n     Priority Groups 1 through 7 are projected to enroll by the \n     end of FY 2003.\n       ``Last year, VA treated 1.4 million more veterans with \n     20,000 fewer employees than in 1996,'' said Principi. \n     ``Nonetheless, VA leads the nation in many important areas \n     like patient safety, computerized patient records, \n     telemedicine, rehabilitation and research. I not only want to \n     see this standard continue, I intend to see it get even \n     better.''\n       Congress mandated in 1996 that VA established an enrollment \n     system to manage hospital and outpatient care within \n     budgetary limits and to provide quality care to those \n     enrolled. By law, the VA secretary must decide annually \n     whether to maintain enrollment for all veterans.\n       ``With this record budget increase, I expect access to \n     medical facilities for severely disabled veterans to improve, \n     along with a reduction in waiting times for all veterans,'' \n     Principi said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Gainesville Sun, Mar. 30, 2003]\n\n         VA: Iraq War Veterans Will Need Care Denied to Others\n\n       Washington.-- As the world watched U.S. soldiers hunker \n     down in sandstorms last week, Veterans Affairs Secretary \n     Anthony Principi saw respiratory problems in the making.\n       Add lung damage from sand to the list of threats--including \n     bombs, bullets and possibly poison gas--that could haunt \n     soldiers now fighting in Iraq.\n       When soldiers return, many are likely to seek treatment and \n     benefits from a strained VA system. Principi said recent \n     decisions to exclude some veterans from health care will help \n     his department cope.\n       ``It's very important at this time, when you've got men and \n     women in combat, that we ensure we have the capability to \n     treat them, that we're not trying to care for everybody at \n     the expense of those who take a bullet,'' Principi said last \n     week.\n       The VA excluded from health care this year hundreds of \n     thousands of higher income veterans who don't have service-\n     connected disabilities. It also proposes new fees and higher \n     drug co-payments designed to force 1.25 million others out of \n     the system. Principi, who had argued the moves were intended \n     to end long waiting lists at VA hospitals and clinics, said \n     last week they also will make room for new combat veterans.\n       He told House members in a hearing last week that \n     refocusing the VA's mission on low-income and combat veterans \n     is especially important now. The new spin on a series of \n     decisions that began in January tangles the politics of the \n     Iraq war with recent disputes about the administration's \n     treatment of veterans.\n       ``If we have enough casualties that that's going to be the \n     rationale for withholding services, this is going to be a \n     hell of war,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, a presidential candidate \n     from Florida who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate \n     Veterans Affairs Committee. ``If there are, then there has \n     really been an underestimate of the degree of resistance.''\n       Graham is a critic of Principi's plans to exclude veterans \n     and of the administration's predictions of a quick victory in \n     Iraq.\n       The debate is timely. The VA needs to tally its cost of the \n     Iraq war. Tens of thousands of veterans of the 1991 Gulf War \n     joined the VA health care system and sought disability \n     benefits for everything from bullet wounds to chronic \n     backaches.\n       Apart from Principi's proposals for rollbacks, that concern \n     isn't reflected in the president's 2004 budget. Nor, several \n     lawmakers complained, was it a factor in President Bush's \n     request for an initial $75 billion to cover war costs.\n       If the 1991 Gulf War is any guide, the VA can expect \n     soldiers to seek care. Indeed, Congress in 1998 authorized \n     the VA to treat all combat veterans free for two years after \n     they leave active duty. That alone could\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\n     prompt waves of new patients as active military, reservists \n     and members of the National Guard return home..\n       The possibility that Saddam Hussein might use weapons of \n     mass destruction has many people hedging their predictions.\n       ``We don't know yet whether there's going to be chemical or \n     biological warfare,'' said Rep. Cliff Stearns, a Florida \n     Republican on the House Veterans Affairs Committee.\n       The VA so far has granted disability claims to about \n     164,000 of the 581,000 troops who fought in the first Persian \n     Gulf War and have since left the services, or nearly 30 \n     percent. About 250,000 Gulf War veterans received treatment \n     at VA hospitals last year, part of an upward trend in which \n     10,000 to 20,000 more Persian Gulf veterans sought health \n     care each year since 1993, according to VA data.\n       The force deployed to Iraq is smaller this time--about \n     250,000 with more on the way compared to 700,000 in 1991--but \n     many lawmakers believe the impact on the VA could be \n     significant.\n       Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group, \n     estimated the war could require $5 billion to $20 billion in \n     VA benefits and health care during the next 10 years. The \n     wide range is based on the last Gulf War's aftermath but \n     reflects the current uncertainties.\n       Bush's 2004 budget includes a $2.1 billion increase for VA \n     health care, which is intended to deal with existing \n     shortcomings. Principi said the Iraq war will bring \n     additional costs as soldiers require care for physical and \n     psychological wounds.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, there is no linkage between the \nJanuary action of cutting off veterans from enrolling in VA health care \nservices and the costs which the VA is legally obligated to assume for \nservice personnel who will be returning from the second gulf war. We \ngave the VA the duty to care for service members after numerous troops \nreturned from the first gulf war. This duty stretches not only to \ninjuries in combat but also those who suffered mysterious illnesses, \nthe cause of which, in many instances, still remains undetermined.\n  The cost of this war will not end with the war itself and will not be \nconfined to the borders of Iraq. Veterans will continue to pay those \ncosts for years to come. We must be prepared for thus far neglected \ncosts of war by assuring the VA will be prepared when the newly created \nveterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom seek their health care. It is our \nresponsibility to assure the VA has adequate resources to fulfill this \npromise. It is a promise which we, the Congress, made to our \nservicemen. The Senate, in 1998, unanimously passed the statutory right \nof veterans to have VA health care for 2 years after they separated \nfrom service for those veterans who were actually in combat in this and \npossibly future engagements.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to see our veterans \nare provided the care they are currently earning by their service.\n  I seek unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several \nletters in support of my amendment from the American Legion, from \nDisabled American Veterans and Paralyzed Veterans of America, \norganizations which, together, represent more than 2 million Americans.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 2003.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the 2.8 million members \n     of The American Legion, I would like to express full support \n     for your amendment to provide $375 million to the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs (VA) in the Wartime Supplemental bill.\n       The current conflict with Iraq will regrettably create a \n     new generation of service-connected disabled veterans. Due to \n     the experiences from the first Gulf War, President Clinton \n     enacted of Public Law 105-368, the Veterans Programs \n     Enhancement Act of 1998, which extended essential health care \n     benefits for service members returning from combat duty. This \n     law provides a two-year window for recently-separated, \n     combat-veterans timely access to VA's quality health care.\n       Currently, VA is struggling to provide services for the \n     current veterans' population and this supplemental funding \n     will be essential to anticipate the needs of returning \n     service members from Operation Iraqi Freedom. While this \n     Nation gives its full support to the war fighters, it must \n     equally match its support for those returning from war. The \n     American Legion urges you and your colleagues to provide the \n     necessary funding to meet the health care needs and benefits \n     for veterans--past, present, and future.\n       The American Legion supports and applauds your efforts and \n     your continued support of the men and women who serve and \n     have served in uniform.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Steve Robertson,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     National Legislative Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Disabled American Veterans,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I would like to thank you for your \n     proposed amendment to the Fiscal Year 2003 Supplemental \n     Appropriations Bill that would increase Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA) health care funding by $375 million.\n       As you know, sick and disabled veterans suffer because of \n     insufficient funding in VA health care. This amendment would \n     ensure that the government is capable of meeting the needs of \n     not only veterans currently using the system, but also those \n     returning from Iraq and the global War on Terror.\n       The Disabled American Veterans fully supports this effort. \n     Thank you for your advocacy on behalf of our nation's sick \n     and disabled veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Edward R. Heath, Sr.\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Paralyzed Veterans of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the members of Paralyzed \n     Veterans of America I would like to express our strong \n     support for your amendment to provide $375 million in funding \n     for the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) health care \n     system in the Wartime Supplemental Appropriations bill.\n       In approving legislation, now Public Law 105-368, the \n     Congress extended essential health care benefits for service \n     members returning from combat duty after the first Gulf War. \n     This law provided access to VA health care for newly \n     separated combat veterans for a two-year period following \n     their return to civilian life. The Department of Veterans \n     Affairs must be prepared and Adequately funded to meet the \n     challenges placed upon it by a new generation of returning \n     veterans as well as, undoubtedly, health care demand from \n     increasing numbers of veterans with service-connected \n     disabilities sustained as a result of this new war in Iraq.\n       Thank you for your continuing care and concern for those \n     who serve and have served in defense of this Nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard B. Fuller,\n                                    National Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I join my colleague from Florida in supporting \nhis amendment. The Senator clearly has examples all over the country \nbut we, especially, have examples in our State of Florida of backlogs \nof 6 months before a veteran can get an appointment. One of the clinics \nhas enrollment backlogs of up to 2 years just to get in the system. \nThere are 44,000 veterans in Florida who are backlogged, waiting 6 \nmonths for appointments. Nationwide, there are 230,000 veterans waiting \nto get an appointment and have to wait 6 months. That is \nunconscionable.\n  Then, the administration, in trying to deal with the shortage of \nmoney, has denied enrollment of what is called category 8 veterans \nwhich are not service connected and have an income of over $24,000 a \nyear. They cannot even get into the system. Nationwide, that is 360,000 \nveterans.\n  I think my colleague from Florida has made the case most pointedly \nand I certainly will support the distinguished senior Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I express my appreciation for \nthe comments by my good friend and colleague, Senator Nelson. What the \nVA seems to want to do is to use the money saved by denying services to \nhundreds of thousands of veterans. They want to use it twice.\n  In January, the rationale was they could not meet their core \nresponsibilities, for instance, for veterans who had a service-\nconnected disability. In March, they want to use the same $375 million \nto pay for the veterans who will be coming out of the gulf war and \nwill, by statute enacted by this Congress in 1998, be eligible, be \nguaranteed, access for 2 years to VA health care services.\n  They cannot have it both ways. The responsible thing to do is to \nrecognize this as a cost of war. But for the fact we have men and \nwomen, including reservists and National Guard personnel at risk in \ncombat, we would not be\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\ntalking about an additional $375 million. However, the fact is, they \nare in combat and they at some point, like the 82 percent from the \nfirst gulf war, will be separated from the service and therefore become \neligible.\n  We also have this issue of the large number of veterans who are \notherwise eligible because of their previous service for VA benefits \nwho have been cut off. We need to deal with both of these problems. At \nleast by adopting this amendment we will deal with the most current \nissue which are the combat veterans from the war which is currently \nunderway.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment would provide an \nadditional $375 million for VA medical care to address the medical \nneeds of returning veterans from the war in Iraq.\n  This funding would be used to meet the funding requirements of the \nVeterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998 which entitles, for 2 years \nfollowing participation in combat, that any active duty service member \nis immediately eligible to receive VA health care upon release or \nseparation from service.\n  These funds will be needed at some point in the future but this \namendment does not meet the requirements of this supplemental as \nfunding that is needed immediately to address concerns related to \nhomeland security or the war in Iraq.\n  And while I agree with my colleagues that VA medical care is not \nmeeting the medical needs of veterans in a timely manner and there is \nmuch to be improved, the problem is as much systemic as it is funding. \nHowever, this funding is not needed now on the heels of the fiscal year \n2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill in which we appropriated some $23.9 \nbillion for VA medical care. This funding level was an increase of some \n$2.6 billion over the fiscal year 2003 level and $1.15 billion over the \nfiscal year 2003 Budget Request. The VA medical system has all the \nfunds that it can absorb this year and will be able to meet the medical \nneeds of any returning veterans from the war in Iraq.\n  We will need additional funding for VA medical care in the future but \nthat is the job of the fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2005 \nappropriations bills.\n  I also do not want to leave my colleagues with the false impression \nthat VA medical care is broken. Yes, there are problems with patient \nbacklog, but I can assure you that Secretary Principi has made a \ncommitment to fix VA medical care and has made significant strides in \naddressing veteran concerns, reducing patient backlog and improving VA \nmedical care.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Graham \namendment to increase funding for VA medical care.\n  I am proud to cosponsor the Graham amendment. Our men and women in \nuniform have my steadfast support. We must support the brave men and \nwomen who are fighting for our country. Our troops need to know that \nAmerica is with them, and we owe them a debt of gratitude. We need to \nremember our troops in the Federal checkbook.\n  That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Graham amendment. The \namendment is simple and straightforward. It would provide $375 million \nmore for VA medical care, so that when our troops return from war, the \nVA can give them the medical care they deserve.\n  Under a law we passed after the Persian Gulf War, the VA must give \npriority to returning troops for immediate medical care. But the VA \nmedical care system is strained. Nationally, there are 236,000 veterans \nwaiting longer than 6 months to get their first appointment with a VA \ndoctor. In January, the VA health care system stopped accepting \nPriority 8 veterans. These are veterans who are not service disabled, \nand whose income is higher than about $29,000 per year.\n  Our veterans didn't stand in waiting lines when they were called up \nor they volunteered to serve our country. So they shouldn't have to \nstand in line or pay toll charges to get the medical care they deserve.\n  As the ranking member on the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, my \nguiding principle for the VA budget is that we keep the promises we \nmade to our veterans. In the last four years, the VA-HUD Subcommittee \nhas provided large increases for medical care, including $1.7 billion \nin 2000, $1.3 billion in 2001, $1 billion in 2002, and $2.4 billion in \n2003. We provided these increases because we know that the failure of \nprivate health insurance companies and high prescription drug costs are \nreally straining our veterans on fixed incomes. At the same time, our \nveterans population is growing and getting older. Today, the VA treats \n2 million more veterans than in 1996\n  I am very concerned that the administration's VA budget for next year \ndoes not keep promises to our veterans, and will not support the needs \nof our troops. The VA's budget puts new toll charges and means tests on \nour veterans. Specifically, the budget proposes four things. First, the \nbudget proposes to keep the VA closed to Priority 8 veterans. Second, \nthe budget proposes a new $250 entrance fee for veterans. Third, the \nbudget proposes to increase outpatient primary care copayments from $15 \nto $20. Fourth, the budget proposes to increase prescription drug \ncopayments from $7 to $15.\n  I raised my concerns about these proposals with Secretary Principi \nduring the VA-HUD Subcommittee budget hearing last month. We have great \nrespect for Secretary Principi. He is a Vietnam Veteran who continues \nto serve his country. Now he's battling OMB against a skimpy and \nspartan budget. But I am concerned that the budget OMB gave VA this \nyear leaves the VA foraging for funding. It will leave our troops \nwithout access to the medical care they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our troops and our veterans in the \nFederal checkbook by supporting the Graham amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the full attention of the Senate is \nfocused today on legislation to fund our ongoing military campaign in \nIraq. The newspapers this morning were focused on our latest military \nfeats, including the apparent destruction of two important Republican \nGuard divisions and advances that leave us very near the outskirts of \nBaghdad.\n  Senator Bob Graham, the ranking member of our Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, has asked us to look ahead and begin planning for the future \nto ensure that our veterans receive the counseling, health care, and \nother services we know they will need after the last battles are \nfought.\n  The Graham amendment, of which I am a proud cosponsor, would provide \n$375 million to the Department of Veterans Affairs so the VA can \nprovide adequate care for returning troops.\n  I cannot stress enough how vital this amendment is.\n  During my career, I have been involved in dealing with the aftermath \nof two major wars, Vietnam and Operation Desert Storm. In both cases, \nthere was enormous confusion, frustration, and pain--much of it \nunnecessary, in my view--because our government assumed that veterans \nwould come back and pick up their lives where they left off before the \nwar.\n  It didn't work that way, and it probably never will. I learned this \nthe hard way, from talking to hundreds of veterans about post-traumatic \nstress disorder, Agent Orange, readjustment counseling, and Gulf War \nillnesses. A fascinating literature review, published in 1996, found \nthat war syndromes, many of them poorly understood, have been \nassociated with armed conflicts at least since the Civil War.\n  Today's amendment would prepare us to assist veterans from day 1, \nhopefully allowing us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. It \nis not the complete answer, but it begins to move us in the right \ndirection, by adjusting VA funding levels to reflect the number of \nveterans who will be returning from Iraq.\n  The funding level in this amendment has a very logical basis. We know \nthat about one-third of veterans from the 1991 Gulf War have been \ngranted service-connected disability claims, which makes them eligible \nfor VA health care. We can expect, at a minimum, a similar number of \nveterans to turn to the VA after the conflict. The number may well be \neven higher than in 1991, since our troops so far are experiencing more \nground combat and higher casualties than in Operation Desert Storm. So \nif one-third of our returning troops seek VA compensation or health \ncare, we can multiply that figure by the VA's average per-patient cost \nand arrive at an approximate dollar figure: $375 million, the amount \nrequested in this amendment.\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\n  Remarkably, the Administration claims the VA already has sufficient \nresources to accommodate returning veterans. To that surprising claim, \nI would respond that the VA's wait list in the upper Midwest now forces \n23,000 veterans to wait at least 6 months for health treatment. For \nnext year, the Administration has told us that it needs to charge \nveterans $250 million in new fees and higher copayments, not to raise \nmoney, but to drive away 1.2 million veterans from VA hospitals and \nclinics. Everyone except the White House is using the word ``crisis'' \nto describe the current state of affairs at the VA.\n  Senator Graham has a recent newspaper article from Florida, in which \nVA Secretary Anthony Principi reportedly claims that the VA can take \ncare of returning troops because it blocked access to VA health care \nfor thousands of middle-income veterans. But in January, when the \nregrettable eligibility decision was announced, the Secretary said this \nmove was necessary just to begin working down the atrocious backlogs at \nVA hospitals and clinics.\n  Sadly, this is all just another chapter of an old story with this \nadministration. When it comes to the VA, their budget claims long ago \nceased to be credible. The ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Graham, deserves our thanks for stepping into the \nleadership void and proposing a constructive solution.\n  We are all proud of the spirit, valor, and selflessness exhibited by \nour troops. Now is the time to show our understanding, our recognition, \nof the personal cost associated with wartime service. I urge all \nsenators to join this effort to prepare the VA to meet the needs of \nthese men and women after they return home.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 4 minutes and the \nSenator from Alaska has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I do not believe there are any \nSenators requesting to speak under my time, so I reserve my time for \nfinal remarks until Senator Stevens has completed his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have to agree with my colleague from \nFlorida that additional funds will be needed in the VA medical care \naccount in the future. That, again, is a job for the 2004/2005 bill. \nThose people are coming out of the service and are cared for a period \nof time after they leave the service and the VA picks them up at the \nend of that time. This $365 million is strictly for the medical needs \nof returning veterans from the war in Iraq.\n  I remind the Senate we appropriated $23.9 billion for VA medical care \nfor fiscal year 2003. That was $2.6 billion over the amount made \navailable in 2002 and $1.50 billion more than the President request. \nThe VA medical system was adjusted for what we believe will be the \ndemands on the VA for returning veterans during the period of this \nfiscal year.\n  Again, there is no question there will be additional funds to meet \nmedical needs of returning veterans and they will be defined, I am \nsure, as we get into the fiscal year 2004 bill.\n  I do know that there are some problems in the VA, but they are not in \nfunding. They are systemic problems that need to be addressed. I have \nevery confidence in the current Secretary of the Veterans' \nAdministration, Secretary Principi. He has visited with me personally. \nAs a matter of fact, he worked here in the Senate. We know him well. He \nwas a staff member to the Senate committee. I do believe he is sincere \nin telling us these funds are not needed at this juncture.\n  The funds that may be needed in the future must be addressed on the \nbasis of the needs as the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan and \nthe war on terrorism proceed.\n  I state categorically to the Senate I do not oppose additional funds \nto meet the medical needs for returning veterans. I will oppose putting \nthem up now. Only 3 months ago we gave the VA $2.6 billion more than \nthey asked.\n  The situation is a difficult one. When the Senator finishes his \nstatement, I intend to move to table his amendment because it is not \nour proper process now to deal with returning veterans' needs from the \nVA that might exceed funds already available for fiscal year 2003.\n  I hope to work with the Senator from Florida. I assure him, \nobviously, there are many of us here on the floor of the Senate who are \nveterans. We would not in any way take action to deny the funds that \nare necessary to meet their needs, particularly these gallant people \nwho are over there now.\n  No one on the floor of the Senate yet has mentioned the stories on \nthe front pages of all papers in America today about the gallant young \nlady who fought the fight in Iraq, almost to her own death, and after \nthe death of several of her colleagues. She was trained as a supply \nclerk. She is one of the veterans, now, that will have needs. I assure \nthe Senate we are going to see those needs are met. Jessica Lynch is an \nexample for all Americans, and particularly for young women. I have had \nseveral comments about her gallantry and we are all inspired by her \ngallantry. But the subject now is what is her need?\n  There is available, for this fiscal year, the balance of the $23.9 \nbillion that this Department already has. When the time comes, I am \nconfident that Secretary Principi will request additional funds for \nfiscal year 2004 as they are defined, but let's not precede that. Let's \nnot put additional money up.\n  This will be money for 2003. I state categorically there is no \nevidence any additional money is needed in fiscal year 2003 for the \nVeterans' Administration.\n  As soon as the Senator has completed using his time, I will make a \nmotion to table his amendment, regretfully.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, it seems the issue now is not \nwhether we are going to meet this responsibility which we have taken on \nourselves by a vote of this Senate and the House of Representatives to \nprovide to returning combat veterans, men and women who actually were \nunder fire, a 2-year period of access to the Veterans' Administration \nhealth care services. The issue seems to be when we should make this \ncommitment. My answer to that question would be: Now.\n  The fact is, unless this war goes on much longer than the \nadministration or any American prays that it will, there will be \nreturning veterans, particularly reservists who, as soon as they \ncomplete their period of active duty, are going to be eligible for \nthese health care costs. I hope we are not taking the position that \nthis war is going to drag on so long that no reservist, no National \nGuard member will be eligible for these benefits prior to September 30 \nof this year.\n  There also will be regular duty combat soldiers who will be \nseparating from service and therefore become eligible.\n  I believe, if we are concerned about the morale of our service men \nand women and wish to show American support for their gallant service, \nthere is no better way to do it than to indicate that we are fully \ncommitted to meet our responsibilities to those men and women when they \nreturn home.\n  The issue is, is there enough money in the VA budget to accept this \nnew responsibility? The VA, just 2 months ago, terminated the \neligibility of several hundred thousand veterans because of the \nfinancial pressures that they were under at that time. The increase in \nthe veterans budget, which is applauded, essentially represents the \ncost of medical inflation from one year to the next. There are no \nsignificant real dollar additional resources for the VA to carry this \nnew responsibility.\n  I urge the Senate not table this amendment but, rather, to \nenthusiastically endorse it as a tangible statement of our commitment \nto the men and women of America who are, today, putting their lives at \nrisk in order to achieve Iraqi freedom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent.) Who yields time? The Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Florida. I ask unanimous consent that it be set aside to \noccur in the sequence that beings at 10 minutes of 2.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe motion to table.\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am not prepared to agree to the yeas and nays at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair needs to inform the Senator from \nAlaska the motion to table is not in order because time remains to the \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I apologize. I thought the Senator used his time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. The Senator from Alaska is correct. I have \nused my time and am prepared to yield it back. Let me make a \nparliamentary inquiry. The Senator from Alaska is now requesting a \nmotion to table my amendment, which will be voted on later today. I \nwant to be clear I am not foregoing my right to ask that there be a \nrecorded rollcall vote on that motion to table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have no intention to deny that. I may \nwish to ask the Senator to modify his amendment at a later date, so I \nwould like to not get the yeas and nays yet, but I will agree to them \nwhen the time comes, if necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has not lost the right to request \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator. I do make the motion to table and \nreserve the right to decide what to do.\n  Under our understanding, we will have Senators from our side of the \naisle offer amendments now. I see the Senator from Nevada here. He has \nan amendment.\n  Before that, if he doesn't mind, I ask unanimous consent that we \nreturn to the amendment of Senator Bayh and have it put before the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 474, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send to the desk a modification of that amendment on \nbehalf of Senator Bayh and his cosponsors and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 474), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 38, after line 24 add the following:\n\n\n         smallpox and other bioterrorism inoculation activities\n\n       For additional expenses necessary to support grants to \n     States for smallpox and other bioterrorism inoculation \n     activities, $105,000,000, to remain available until September \n     30, 2004: Provided, That this amount is transferred to the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. The amendment has now been modified according to the \nsubmission I made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I now urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 474), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada has an amendment, \nand I know he is willing to accept a short time agreement. But I would \nask him to offer it, have it read, and then we will see how much time \nmay be required.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 488\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds in a manner that benefits \ncitizens or businesses of France and Germany unless physically located \n                         in the United States)\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 488.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, has it been read? Was the amendment read \nin full?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asked consent to have the reading \nof the amendment called off.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will read the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       At an appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec  . (a) No funds made available in this Act for purposes \n     of reconstruction in Iraq may be provided, to a person who is \n     a citizen of or is organized under the laws of France or \n     Germany, unless such person is a resident of or organized \n     under the laws of the United States.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be 30 \nminutes on each side for this amendment. I do not know how much time \nSenators might request, but I have been informed there may be several \nSenators who wish to discuss the matter, and 30 minutes on a side would \nbe sufficient.\n  Does the Senator from Nevada wish to be recognized?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the manager of the bill, I am going \nto talk to Senator Biden. He has called the cloakroom. I will see how \nhe feels about this. He is at a Foreign Relations matter.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I withdraw the request for the unanimous \nconsent, but I do believe there is going to be substantial need for \ntime on this one.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I have a very simple amendment.\n  As we have seen leading up to this time of war, the United States and \nour President attempted many diplomatic means to try to make us not go \nto war. And many people, including myself, feel those diplomatic means \nwere thwarted by some of our traditionally closest allies. And what I \nmean by thwarted is that the stronger of a hand our President would \nhave had in the negotiations, I believe the better chance we would have \nhad of not going to war.\n  Gerhard Schroeder, in his election bid, I believe, shamelessly used \nsome anti-American sentiments to narrowly gain his reelection. Now, \nthat may have been a shrewd political move for him to make, but it was \ncertainly not statesmanlike. He started many in the world against the \nUnited States in this diplomatic effort that we were engaged in in \ntrying to avoid war with Iraq by getting them to disarm.\n  After Germany started leading this battle, France joined the battle \nand has taken it to a new level, much to the dismay of, I believe, most \nAmericans.\n  We now are engaged in a conflict to change the regime in Iraq. That \nregime, by all accounts, is a brutal regime and needs to be changed. \nAnd we need to disarm that country from weapons of mass destruction, \nwhich, as Americans--and I think the rest of the world looking on--we \ncan see what a fabulous job our military is doing in accomplishing \ntheir mission.\n  My amendment today says when the conflict is over and we are going to \nrebuild Iraq, American taxpayer dollars are not to go, in the \nrebuilding of Iraq, to French or German companies, to French or German \ncitizens, because of what their governments did in opposing the United \nStates actively. It was not just that they voted against us at the \nUnited Nations. They led--especially France led--the world against the \nUnited States and, I believe, because of that, made it more difficult \nin Turkey. If we could have had our ground troops available in Turkey, \nwe could end this war much sooner than when it will be ended.\n  So this amendment says American tax dollars, in the rebuilding of \nIraq, are basically refused from going to any companies and/or citizens \nfrom the countries of France or Germany.\n  Now, if a company from France actually has a subsidiary in the United \nStates that employs people, our amendment allows that company, that \nsubsidiary to bid on the contracts. But in no case can the company that \nis located in France or located in Germany bid on these contracts and \nwin the contracts from the United States.\n  Now, in the future, if the United Nations and other countries decide \nto put together a coalition and fund that coalition with international \ndollars or\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\ntheir own dollars, our President, the State Department, and everybody \nelse in the United Nations concerned can give the contracts to whomever \nthey want. But I believe, as an American--and I believe the American \npeople would support this amendment--I believe it would be wrong to \nhave our tax dollars going to companies and individuals within France \nand within Germany because I believe their behavior leading up to this \nwas really quite despicable.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I offer this amendment to the Senate today. I hope \nit is supported widely across this body. I believe it is the right \nthing to do. I believe it will send a strong message in the future that \nwhen countries are trying to do the right thing, and rid the world of a \nbrutal dictator, they should be supported, and you should not expect a \nreward afterward, as we are seeing countries now around the world \ntrying to jump on board as the war looks like it is going well. We \nshould not reward those countries who, in the first place, had opposed \nus.\n  So, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and look \nforward to hearing other Senators speak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment. I \nvery much respect the distinguished Senator from Nevada. However, I \nthink this amendment is enormously destructive. If America is going to \nbecome an arrogant nation, do things only our way, this is a good way \nto begin. I believe it would be a tragic and a terrible mistake.\n  The amendment is couched in such words that no one would know exactly \nwhat it means. It reads:\n\n       No funds made available in this Act for purposes of \n     reconstruction in Iraq may be provided, to a person who is a \n     citizen of or is organized under the laws of France or \n     Germany, unless such person is a resident of or organized \n     under the laws of the United States.\n\n  Just to know how this would affect an employee of a given company, an \nofficer of a given company, or anyone else, I think creates a whole \nmiasma of very real problems. I think to use the word ``despicable'' \nperhaps is hyperbole. I think there is a legitimate point of difference \nbetween European nations and the United States with respect to how to \nhandle Iraq. Culturally there are differences. Diplomatically there are \ndifferences. But to pass a piece of legislation that puts America's No. \n1 allies in a position of being an absolute enemy of this country, I \nthink is a terrible thing to do. I would hope we would vote down this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I believe we will have relationships with \nFrance and Germany. We have had many good relationships with both of \nthose countries in the past. I believe we need to have good relations \nwith both of them in the future. But I just think it would be patently \nwrong for us to use money from this supplemental bill we are doing \ntoday in providing for the rebuilding of Iraq, it would be absolutely \nwrong to use that money for countries that actively tried to get the \nrest of the world to oppose us in doing what the United States believed \nwas right in the world: To disarm a brutal dictator, to rid his own \ncountry of weapons of mass destruction which he has used against his \nneighbors. When a country stands up and tries to do what is right--not \nin an arrogant sort of a way but in a way in which it is trying to do \nsomething that is right--its closest allies should not lead some of the \nworld opinion against it.\n  The United States during World War II was the leader with our allies \nin getting rid of a brutal dictator back then. Today the United States \nis attempting to do the same thing. Some countries tried to appease \nAdolf Hitler during World War II. We were hearing up until this a lot \nof the same arguments, especially from the French, about Saddam \nHussein. Well, we will just deal with him. We could just appease him, \njust keep him going along.\n  I believe brutal dictators understand force. They understand \ncountries that will stand up to them. The more you try to appease them, \nthe more it emboldens them. I believe that is what France was trying to \nlead the rest of the world to do, to make Saddam Hussein more dangerous \nin the future.\n  President Bush is leading a coalition to disarm Saddam Hussein and to \ndisarm him from weapons of mass destruction. It is the right thing to \ndo. When we are done with it, when we rebuild that country, liberating \nthe Iraqi people is going to take some reconstruction. It always has to \nhappen. A beautiful thing about the United States is, we don't just go \nover, liberate people, and then walk away. We actually believe there is \na responsibility. We want to help rebuild that country. But I think it \nwould be absolutely wrong for American tax dollars to go to countries \nand companies in those countries that have tried to turn the world \nagainst us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to respond. The fact is, there \nare dozens of countries in this world that disagreed with what the \nUnited States is doing. I am one who voted to authorize the President \nwith the use of force. Most of the larger countries in the world \ndisagree.\n  Additionally, the French and the Germans, in many ways in the war \nagainst terror, have been helpful to the United States. Those of us who \nserve on the Intelligence Committee know this. We know that \nintelligence comes from both of those nations which is instrumental in \nhelping in the war on terror.\n  The unilateral approach of this country is subject to some concern by \nother countries. That is not necessarily a bad thing. This is the first \ntime in America's history we have unilaterally, with Great Britain, \nwith the help of a couple thousand Australians, and with some tacit \nsupport of other countries in different ways, some public, some not \npublic, essentially invaded another sovereign nation. There is a \ndifference of opinion as to whether we should have stayed at the United \nNations. I happen to share that view. I believe we should have worked \nto have made this more multilateral. I believe we should have taken the \ntime to do so. But we chose not to do that. The administration chose \nnot to do it.\n  For the Senate to pass this amendment--you might as well include a \nwhole host of other countries in this--sets us upon a very bad course \nof action. I would think we would want everyone's help in the \nrebuilding of Iraq. I would think we would want everyone's help in the \nestablishment of a secure and stable and open and free and, perhaps one \nday, democratic, new Iraqi government. To place two of America's \nstaunchest allies, France and Germany, that have shown their solidarity \nwith us over the years from the time--certainly the French from the \ntime our country was founded, the Germans certainly subsequent to World \nWar II, and not to understand that there are strong antiwar feelings in \nboth of these countries is shortsighted.\n  What this Senate should try to do is bring people together, bring our \nallies together, to reduce America's unilateral courses in the world, \nto work with our friends. This does not help.\n  I hope there will be an overwhelming vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the bill actually reflects sort of the \nsentiments we are talking about here today, but it is only a sense of \nthe Senate. We actually want to put it in legislative language. Section \n506, page 35 says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, contracts (including subcontracts) and grants \n     for relief and reconstruction in Iraq from funds appropriated \n     under this chapter should be awarded to United States \n     companies (particularly small and medium sized businesses) \n     and organizations, to companies and organizations located in \n     the Near East region, and to those from countries which have \n     provided assistance to Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n  Our amendment narrows it. It was said there are countries that have \nbeen opposing America around the world, not just France and Germany. I \nagree. But it is France and Germany that have been leading the fight. \nThat is the reason we targeted those two countries. In World War II, \nEuropean security was threatened. America came to the rescue. In \nKosovo, European security was threatened. America came to the rescue. \nWith Iraq, American security is threatened and Germany and France are \nAWOL. It would be entirely\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\ninappropriate for the money from an emergency supplemental bill to pay \nfor the war and pay for reconstruction of Iraq, for those moneys to go \nto countries that have attempted to lead the world against us in \nprotecting our own security, in liberating the Iraqi people, and in \nridding the Middle East of one of the most brutal dictators it has ever \nseen.\n  It is highly appropriate to have this amendment. I hope we have a \nvery strong vote from this body that shows the American people when \ncountries come against us, we are not going to reward them. We will not \nreward them by giving them money to help rebuild something.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Biden, and he is unable to be here \nright now. He will be here in the next 15 minutes or thereabout. He \nindicated he would take a relatively short period of time. He may have \nan amendment to offer and he can discuss that with the sponsor of the \nbill when he arrives. So we will stay on this amendment until Senator \nBiden arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of \npoints on this amendment. I ask the distinguished Senator two \nquestions. The first is, is he aware that Germany has allowed over \n60,000 U.S. troops to pass through U.S. Air Force bases in Germany--all \ntroops bound for Iraq? Is he aware that the Germans have helped in many \nways?\n  Second, is he aware that there are already contracts out from our \nDepartment of Defense with firms that would be nullified under this \nbill? Also, I would like to ask the question, if he does know, to what \nextent would those contracts be nullified by this legislation?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I am very aware of the role that Germany \nis playing there. We defended Germany, with those bases, from the \nSoviet threat during the entire cold war. It is the reason that Germany \nhasn't had to spend hardly any money on their national defense--because \nAmerica has been providing that umbrella of defense, and now we are \nusing those bases, obviously, with their permission.\n  That is something we appreciate, but it doesn't take away the fact of \nthe role they played in trying to turn world opinion against the United \nStates. I still think it is inappropriate to have these funds going \ntoward these other countries. If this nullifies those other contracts, \nas far as I am concerned, the purse strings are controlled by the U.S. \nHouse and the U.S. Senate. That is under the Constitution. We should be \nable to at least direct--when we feel strongly--where some of those \nfunds could go. I think it would be highly inappropriate for those \nfunds to be going toward companies and persons from Germany and from \nFrance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I might, I would like to read an \neditorial that was published in the Los Angeles Times. I think it is \npertinent. It was published on the 30th of last month, a few days ago. \nIt is entitled, ``Move Past the Grudges.''\n\n       The United States should act to review tattered alliances \n     that will be needed in the fight against terrorism.\n\n  It goes on to point out:\n\n       Blair visited Bush at Camp David last week and readily \n     acknowledged the bruises left by the rancorous United Nations \n     debate before the war. When Bush was asked about the many \n     nations that declined to join the Iraq war alliance, he \n     replied only that the United States and Britain had plenty of \n     Western allies that continue to stand with us. Blair, \n     however, frankly conceded that many countries disagree with \n     what we are doing. How that divide is handled now and after \n     the war will affect global relationships for years to come.\n\n  Mr. President, I could not agree more. I don't know why we have any \nneed to be small, to be rancorous, and to be bitter. Right now, we have \nour men and women in harm's way, and the battle is turning and it is \nfavoring our side. The hope should be that we can put this conflict to \nan end, that we can mend the wounds, that we can rebuild the country, \nthat we can show to the entire Muslim/Arab world that America is indeed \nan open, fair, democratic country, and we care about the Muslim people.\n  I don't believe any purpose is served by this amendment. I don't \nbelieve the world is going to be a better place because we pass this \namendment. I don't believe we are going to be able to restore or bind \nany wounds with this amendment. I believe we will drive deeper the \nscars into the psyche of America with this amendment. I believe we will \nspread apart our alliances with this kind of amendment. I hope this \namendment is not a harbinger of things to come on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate because I believe it does disrespect to a strong, able, \ncompetent, and compassionate United States of America. I urge its \ndefeat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. It has been asked, What should the United States do to \nrepair our relationship with France? My question is, What should France \ndo to repair its relationship with the United States? The United States \nis attempting to defend itself, to rid the world of a brutal dictator. \nSeptember 11 changed everything. We all know that. America is \nvulnerable. America is the only superpower left in the world, which \nmakes us a target.\n  France is taking advantage of the fact that we are the only \nsuperpower and, because of that, there are natural sentiments against \none country having that much power--even though the United States \ndoesn't go into countries to occupy them. We are going into Iraq to \nliberate it and rebuild it and then get out. We want to get out of \nthere as soon as possible. We would love to be able to have a stable, \ndemocratically elected government there as quickly as possible; have \ninfrastructure put in place and get out of there. We don't want our \ntroops or our personnel, whatsoever, to be potentially in harm's way \nfor any longer than they have to be.\n  So France, in its effort to continue to curry favor with the Saddam \nHussein regime, and to continue the trade relations they have, I \nbelieve has done something that is very wrong. So I believe France has \nan obligation to America to try to repair the relationship they have \nwith us. I believe it is up to them to make the first step, and they \ncertainly have not done that--at least up to this point.\n  Are we open to having them do that? Absolutely. But they have not \ndone it up to this point. At least Germany is making some strides, but \nFrance hasn't even made strides toward that. If you look at this \nhistorically, over the last many years, France has done just the \nopposite. France didn't even want Turkey to be able to defend itself \nagainst weapons or missiles coming in and use NATO to defend Turkey \nfrom missiles coming in from Iraq. That is how much France has wanted \nto keep favorable relations with Saddam Hussein and his brutal regime.\n  What is the motivation for this? I don't know. Maybe because France \nand Jacques Chirac helped them build a nuclear reactor that would lead \nto nuclear bombs, and then once Israel took out their nuclear reactor, \nhe offered to rebuild it. There seems to be some interest that France \nhas with Saddam Hussein that leads to ulterior motives and this whole \nidea of getting the world against the United States.\n  So for France to have taken this idea that the United States is a \nsuperpower, and if you want to be against the only superpower, come \nover here and join us, I think to take advantage of those kinds of \nnatural sentiments in the world has been very wrong, when the U.S. is \ntrying to do something that I believe is on the moral high ground. All \nyou have to do is look at how this brutal regime treats prisoners of \nwar--they torture them--or how they treat their own people, who either \nare afraid to fight--I mean, if you had bombs coming in night after \nnight after night and you see people around you getting blown up in \ntheir tanks, you would think that that might be a little unnerving.\n  When those people try to go back to their homes, they say: You know \nwhat. This regime is not worth giving my life for. What do they do? \nThey have checkpoints, and as those people try to leave, they are \nshooting them. That is the kind of regime with which we are dealing, \nand that is the kind of regime France was trying to prop up.\n  Do I want to see our relations in the future improve with Germany and \nimprove with France? Yes, but they have\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\nto come to the table with something for those relations to improve. The \nUnited States gives and gives and gives, and it is time for the United \nStates to hold countries accountable that come against us. That is all \nI believe this is doing. It is saying taxpayer dollars that are earned \nby the American people and sent to Washington, DC, are not going to be \nsent to companies and citizens of France and Germany.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Ensign \namendment be temporarily set aside so we might consider an amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, as I have explained to the \nmanagers of the bill, we have been waiting now for some time for the \nSenator from Delaware. He will be here and he will now speak after the \nSenator from Arizona. It is my understanding on the Ensign amendment \nthere are others who wish to speak so Senator Biden would not be the \nlast.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand there may be several \nSenators who wish to speak on the amendment of Senator Ensign. It would \nbe my desire that we accommodate those people but then go back to the \nMcCain amendment until he has finished. The Ensign amendment will be \nwith us for a little while this afternoon.\n  Does the Senator from Arizona wish to enter into a time agreement?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sure it will not be long, but since my colleague \nSenator Kyl wants to speak on it, I would like to wait before entering \na time agreement.\n  Mr. STEVENS. For the interest of Senators, could we have some \ntimeframe?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It should not be more than 15 or 20 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 481\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Kyl proposes an amendment numbered 481.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To remove unauthorized and earmarked appropriations)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n\n                    LIMITATIONS ON OTHER PROVISIONS\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act:\n       (1) Amounts made available under sections 310, 312, and 313 \n     of title I shall not be made available for the purposes \n     stated in those sections.\n       (2) Amounts made available for each of the following items \n     elsewhere in this Act for fiscal year 2003 shall not be made \n     available as provided in this Act:\n       (A) $500,000 for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to be \n     used for sea lamprey control in Lake Champlain within the \n     Procurement, Acquisition and Construction Account of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the \n     Department of Commerce as provided for under chapter 2 of \n     title II.\n       (B) $225,000 for the Mental Health Association of Tarrant \n     County, Ft. Worth, Texas, to provide school-based mental \n     health education to schools in Tarrant County; $200,000 for \n     the AIDS Research Institute at the University of California, \n     San Francisco, for Developing County Medical Program to \n     facilitate clinician exchange between the United States and \n     developing countries; and $1,000,000 for the Geisinger Health \n     System, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to establish centers of \n     excellence for the treatment of autism, as provided for under \n     paragraph (5) under the amendments to Public Law 108-7 for \n     matter under the heading ``Department of Health and Human \n     Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, \n     Health Resources and Services, under the Department of Labor \n     as provided for under chapter 5 of title II.\n       (3) Amounts appropriated for each of the following items \n     for fiscal year 2003 shall be zero instead of the following \n     amounts appropriated elsewhere in this Act:\n       (A) $98,000,000 for Buildings and Facilities under the \n     Agricultural Research Service of the Agricultural Department \n     as provided for under chapter 1 of title 1.\n       (B) $50,000,000 for the cost of guaranteed loans under the \n     Maritime Guaranteed Loan (title XI) Program Account of the \n     Maritime Administration of the Department of Transportation \n     as provided for under chapter 10 of title 1.\n       (C) $1,000,000 for the Jobs for America's Graduates (JAG) \n     school-to-work program for at-risk young people for Training \n     and Employment Services under the Employment and Training \n     Administration of the Department of Labor as provided for \n     under chapter 5 of title II.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I said yesterday during the debate on \nthe supplemental, I hope we can consider the bill that did not include \na host of add-ons and provisions not requested by the administration. \nToday, with many of our young men and women in harm's way, we should be \nconsidering a measure to support the ongoing war efforts and our \nNation's homeland security needs free of earmarked or unauthorized \nprovisions. Unfortunately, that is not the case with the bill before \nthe Senate.\n  I wonder why we could not once--especially with a war going on--bring \nforward a bill that was free of unnecessary provisions in wasteful \nearmarks. I hoped we could do it just once.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Kyl and myself is intended to \nimprove the bill to achieve that goal. This amendment would not provide \nfunding for a number of items in the bill that are not associated with \nthe stated purpose of the bill. If there is discussion by other \nMembers, I make it fully understood this amendment is proposed in the \nframework of the title of the bill which I may repeat several times, \nwhich is: Making supplemental appropriations to support Department of \nDefense operations in Iraq, Department of Homeland Security, and \nrelated efforts for the fiscal year ending September 20, 2003, and for \nother purposes.\n  Clearly, this legislation is to pay for the war in Iraq and other \nhomeland security needs. It is not here to pay for agricultural \nfacilities, for loan guarantees, for sea lamprey control in Lake \nChamplain, for the Mental Health Association in Tarrant County, Forth \nWorth, TX, or AIDS research at the University of California, for the \nstudy of treatment of autism at the Geisinger Health System, \nHarrisburg, PA. None of those, even in one's wildest imagination, \nrelates to the title of this legislation.\n  What Senator Kyl and I have done is propose an amendment, rather than \ndrag the Senate through each individual measure and forcing votes on \nit--which we could have done--but lump them all together and find out \nwhether the Senate is going to continue its porkbarreling ways, which \nhas become, to me, a national scandal, or we are going to draw the line \nsomewhere.\n  Let me go specifically through what our amendment would not fund. It \nwould not fund $98 million for buildings and facilities under the \nAgricultural Research Service to continue construction for USDA \nresearch facilities. Of course, it is designated in Ames, IA.\n  The very first lines in the emergency supplemental bill include $98 \nmillion in funds that are intended to be used to continue modernization \nwork on the animal and inspection services facility near Ames, IA. I \nnote this facility received favorable attention from the appropriators \npreviously when a $50 million earmark for the same facility was \nincluded in last year's supplemental bill that was intended to fight \nthe war against terrorism. An additional $33 million was also earmarked \nin the fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations bill.\n  The administration has previously stated additional funding as \nsuggested in last year's supplemental bill was not an essential \npriority at that time. As a further demonstration of the nonemergency \nnature of this project, the administration's 2004 budget does not \nrequest any funding to supplement this effort.\n  Certainly, the study of farm animal diseases and controlling known \nand unknown animal diseases are clearly important to national public \nhealth\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\nissues. As part of the Government's effort to improve its knowledge of \ndisease agents and mechanisms, this research facility and other related \nfacilities do serve an important purpose. However, this work is already \nunderway. Adding an additional $98 million as part of this essential \nwar spending measure is simply not required or necessary.\n\n  Finally, this ongoing project will clearly be the subject of \nadditional appropriations in future years through the routine \nappropriations process. These particular renovations are not scheduled \nto be completed for at least a few more years. I find it difficult to \nbelieve removing this $98 million earmark at a time when it is not \nneeded will jeopardize its continued planning and construction.\n  We will not fund $50 million for the Maritime Administration's title \nXI loan guarantee program. Chapter 10 of title I provides $50 million \nin funding to the Maritime Administration's title XI guaranteed loan \nprogram for shipbuilders and shipyards. As I said yesterday, this \nfunding is not justified as part of an emergency supplemental to fund \nthe ongoing war. Not only is the program riddled with problems, but the \nadministration did not propose funding it, either in its 2004 or 2003 \nbudget. The Title XI program does not serve any defense or homeland \nsecurity purpose. It should not receive funding under the guise of a \nwartime need.\n  The title XI program is without question one of the most wasteful and \nmismanaged guarantee programs in the Federal Government. Since 1998, \nloan defaults have totaled $490 million. On Monday of this week, the \nDepartment of Transportation's Office of Inspector General released a \nreport that details the multiple problems with the program's \nadministration. Moreover, how can this provision be aimed at supporting \nthe current war when vessels take years to be built? It simply cannot.\n  I take a moment to respond to some of the comments made by my \ncolleagues yesterday on the floor in defense of the title XI Maritime \nLoan Guarantee Program that warrant clarification to ensure there is no \nmisconception about the program.\n  First, it was asserted that this program is a critical need for the \nauxiliary maritime capacity during time of war. Yet based on \ninformation provided by the Maritime Administration, nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. The fact is, as I indicated in my statement \nyesterday, out of the 51 vessels currently being used in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, only 1 was built using a title XI maritime \nloan guarantee. Furthermore, when the Maritime Administration reviews \nsuch loan applications, it does not evaluate them to determine if the \nproposed vessels have any military applicability.\n  Second, the proponents of this funding claim that the program \nstrengthens our shipbuilding industrial base in support of our defense \nneeds. This argument has been used time and time and time and time \nagain in an attempt to justify this porkbarrel program. Appropriators \nhave claimed for years that commercial ship construction keeps \nshipyards open and reduces the costs associated with defense ship \nconstruction.\n  I cannot argue against the claim that providing subsidies helps to \nkeep shipyards open. There is little, if any, evidence that commercial \nship construction reduces the costs associated with defense ship \nconstruction. In fact, recent evidence shows just the opposite.\n  In February, the Department of Justice filed suit against Newport \nNews Shipbuilding for knowingly mischarging the U.S. Navy for more than \n$72 million of costs related to the design and development of \ncommercial tankers which were passed through as overhead on major Navy \nshipbuilding contracts. This is one case, but clearly more \ninvestigation is needed to determine how other yards are doing their \nwork.\n  I point out again, $490 million in defaults over the last 5 years is \na lot of money. Speaking of a lot of money, I point out the $98 million \nfor building facilities under the Agricultural Research Service and $50 \nmillion for the Maritime administration is about $150 million that is \nbeing added. So we are not talking about small amounts of money.\n  Mr. President, $500,000 for another program that will not be funded \nis $500,000 for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. Title 11, Chapter 2 \nof the bill earmarks $500,000 for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to \nbe used for sea lamprey control in Lake Champlain. This funding was not \nrequested by the administration and the sea lamprey does not, in my \nopinion, pose a clear and present danger to our national security. I \nhope my colleagues will agree that a wartime supplemental is not an \nappropriate vehicle to fund an earmark of this nature, which has \nabsolutely nothing to do with fighting the war in Iraq or meeting our \nhomeland security needs.\n\n  One million dollars for the Jobs for America's Graduates (JAG) \nschool-to-work program for at-risk young people for Training and \nEmployment Services under the Employment and Training Administration of \nthe Department of Labor.\n   The supplemental appropriations bill provides $1 million for the \nDepartment of Labor's Jobs for America's Graduates school-to-work \nprogram for at-risk youth people. This program is a school-to-career \nprogram implemented in 1,000 high schools, alternative schools, \ncommunity colleges, and middle schools across the country and United \nKingdom. Its mission is to keep young people in school through \ngraduation and provide work-based learning experiences that will lead \nto career advancement opportunities or to enroll in a post-secondary \ninstitution that leads to a rewarding career.\n  No one disputes that the goals of this program are worthwhile and \nthat this may be a valuable and effective program. But what is it doing \nin a appropriations bill whose purpose, by its stated title, is to \n``support Department of Defense Operations in Iraq, Department of \nHomeland Security, and Related Efforts . . .''? Can someone tell me how \nthis program is so related to our war effort and homeland security that \nwe must provide funding for it today in this bill? If it is so urgent, \nthen why was it not included in the President's supplemental \nappropriations request?\n  When we consider the Labor/HHS appropriations bill for the next \nfiscal year, we should debate funding for this program at that time. \nThe Labor/HHS appropriations bill is the proper legislative vehicle for \ndebate about this program--not this war supplemental. We are doing a \ndisservice to our young men and women fighting the war in Iraq by \nattaching this unrelated program to a bill designed to support their \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, there is $225,000 for the Mental Health Association of \nTarrant County, Ft. Worth, TX to provide school-based mental health \neducation to schools in Tarrant County; $200,000 for the IDS Research \nInstitute at the University of California, San Francisco for Developing \nCounty Medical Program to facilitate clinician exchange between the \nUnited States and developing countries; and $1,000,000 for the \nGeisinger Health System, Harrisburg, PA to establish centers for \nexcellence for the treatment of autism.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) portion of the \nemergency supplemental spending bill to fund the war in Iraq contains \nseveral earmarks. Such funding may be for worthy health endeavors. \nHowever, these provisions are earmarks and they do not belong within \nthe text of an emergency bill devoted to funding the war. These \nearmarks are funded from monies allocated by the fiscal year 2003 \nomnibus appropriations bill which I understand were earmarked in the \naccompanying report. But now, the appropriators are seeking to earmark \nthem in statute.\n  There is directive language that would allow West Point cadets to \nreceive flight training during the summer at The University of North \nDakota.\n  Last year's appropriations Senate Report--I emphasize ``report,'' \nwhich does not have the effect of law--earmarked $2 million in Army \nOperation and Maintenance account for the University of North Dakota \nROTC program, known as ``Air Battle Captain.'' On this supplemental \nbill, there is directive language which would authorize--for the first \ntime--a new program to teach flight training to West Point cadets \nduring summer training at the University of North Dakota. This sounds \nlike a good program, but\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\nshouldn't this aviation training program be competitively bid? Perhaps \ncadets could be better trained at the Army aviation school at Fort \nRucker in Alabama. Arizona also has a very good aviation school in \nPrescott, AZ--Emory Riddle University. These schools should be afforded \nthe same opportunity to train West Point cadets. At the very least, \nthere should be competition, to determine the most cost-effective means \nto provide this type of initial pilot training to West Point cadets. I \ndon't know. However, I do know the appropriations bill should not \ndirect the West Point Superintendent to send his cadets only to The \nUniversity of North Dakota, without consideration of other pilot \ntraining capabilities. That is wrong. That is wrong.\n  In the Senate report--not in bill language--there is an earmark for \n$12 million from Defense-Wide Research, Development, Testing and \nEvaluation for airfield improvements in Alaska that may be associated \nwith the ground-based mid-course missile defense program. Because this \nis report language, I can not strike it in my amendment, however it is \nequally as appalling.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of \nManagement and Budget: ``Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation \ncovers the costs of developing and testing new systems and \nsubsystems.'' My staff advises me that, this may have been included in \nprevious appropriations tables in some form--but I could not find it. \nHowever, I question the merit of this earmark. If this was a valid \nprogram, why would we take critical dollars from research, development, \ntesting, and evaluation funding--which Republicans and Democrats alike, \nunderstand is underfunded according to defense budget experts--to pay \nfor airfield improvement in Alaska? Why are we robbing critical defense \nResearch, Development, Testing, and Evaluation funds to pour concrete? \nWhy not use Military Construction money? Mr. President, $12 million is \na lot money for airfield improvements.\n  The Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee provides Airport \nImprovement Program funding for airports in the United States for \nplanned maintenance and construction. This is a lot of money to \nrefurbish the airfield. Because it is report language--it is a Senate \nAppropriations Committee recommendation only--the Department of Defense \ndoes not need to apply the $12 million in this way, so it could simply \nignore the Committee recommendation as it does not have the force of \nlaw.\n  Similarly, there are two other earmarks--that my colleagues will \nexplain are not new earmarks. In fact, they were included in the Senate \nAppropriations Report language last year.\n\n  We have a new kind of routine that is going on here by the \nappropriators that certainly is a testimony to imagination, but I think \nit is something that is a new opening for porkbarrel spending. In an \nappropriations bill, you put in money for a general fund and it is in \nthe report language, not having the force of law, so, therefore, those \nof us who want to eliminate it cannot do so because it is in the report \nlanguage. Then in the following appropriations bill, they earmark from \nthat report language in the law the porkbarrel project. It is wrong. It \nis wrong.\n  In any case, there is no doubt this year--the war supplemental to \nsupport Department of Defense operations in Iraq--includes directive \nbill language specifically to provide $6.8 million from Air Force \nOperation and Maintenance accounts to build and install fiber optic and \npower upgrades at the 11th Air Force Range in Elmendorf Air Force Base \nin Alaska. Furthermore, there is $3 million earmarked in the Operation \nand Maintenance accounts directing the Army to build a rifle range for \nthe South Carolina National Guard. Why not use Military Construction \nfunding, if this was a worth-while project. Why hide it in Operation \nand Maintenance funding?\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, operations and maintenance money is \nused to train people. This is what we could use to provide spare parts. \nThis is the heart and soul of the movement and readiness of our \nmilitary. So we are, in report language, saying they should take money \nfrom operation and maintenance accounts to build fiberoptic and power \nupgrades at Elmendorf Air Force Base and to build a rifle range for the \nSouth Carolina National Guard.\n  The one thing many of us have worried about, and worried about for \nyears and years, is operation and maintenance. We always shortchange \nthem because they are nonsexy items. There is no contract let, \ngenerally speaking, for operation and maintenance--to provide the spare \nparts, the maintenance of the high-tech equipment, the fuel, all of \nthose things. Now, where is this directed money coming from for \nfiberoptic upgrades, for building a rifle range? Out of operation and \nmaintenance.\n  Again, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of \nManagement and Budget: ``Operation and Maintenance (O) includes \nspending on fuel, spare parts, and overhauls of military equipment. O \nalso includes spending on such items as health care, environmental \nprograms, the maintenance and repair of buildings, roadways, runways, \nand base operating support including telephone systems and computers.''\n  Report language does not have the force of law. The war supplemental \nbill language does however. There will now be no doubt in any Pentagon \ngeneral counsel's mind because the Iraqi war supplemental says: Spend \nthe money or you will be breaking the law.\n  Mr. President, let me also express my deep concern about a pattern \nthat seems to be developing. It seems to becoming a practice in which \nfunding is provided in one appropriations bill, and then earmarked, \nunder the guise as technical corrections, in a subsequent measure. In \nfact, this is the very situation that is taking place with the above \nmentioned earmarks under the Department of Health and Human Services. \nFunding was authorized and now we are expected to not even question the \nfact that the pending bill proposes a number of provisions to earmark \nthe previously authorized funds.\n  Again, I will never underestimate the imagination and creativity of \nthe Appropriations Committee. This is one pattern that must be halted.\n  I hope we can vote in favor of this amendment. It is not a huge \namount of money when we are talking about the size of this overall \nbill. I believe all of these provisions from which we are trying to \neliminate the money would probably be restored in a normal \nappropriations process--whether I happen to agree with it or not. But \nhow do we tell our constituents, who are paying their taxes--and \nunderstanding they have difficult times now with unemployment high, \nwith cutbacks, and people being laid off--that we are going to take \ntheir tax dollars, in the name of funding the war on Iraq and homeland \nsecurity, and spend it on these projects? I do not think we should be \ndoing this.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider voting in favor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could direct a question to the Senator \nfrom Arizona, it is my understanding there are others who wish to speak \non your amendment. The reason I mention that is because what we would \nlike to do is arrange a vote on your amendment in the order that has \nbeen set to begin at 1:50.\n  Prior to that, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee \nis here to speak on the preceding amendment. As the Senator from \nArizona knows, we took the Senator from Arizona out of order.\n  How long does the Senator from Idaho wish to speak?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I mention to my colleague, I tried to get a handle on it. \nMy colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, I know wants to speak on it, \nbut I am not sure there is a lot of other significant debate on the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senator from Idaho \nfinishes his remarks, the Senator from Delaware be recognized and we \nwould return temporarily back to the Ensign amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. McCAIN. After that, return to the Ensign amendment or return to \nthe McCain amendment?\n  Mr. REID. He is going to speak on the Ensign amendment. Then we would \nimmediately go back to the McCain amendment.\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator repeat the request?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Idaho, Mr. Craig, be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes on the \npending amendment, the McCain amendment, and that following his \nstatement, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, be recognized to speak \non the Ensign amendment; and that following the statement of the \nSenator from Delaware, we will go back to the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in support of \nS. 762, but in doing so, I have been seated here for the last few \nminutes listening to the senior Senator from Arizona. I must tell you, \nwhat he speaks about in relation to this appropriations bill makes a \ngood deal of sense.\n  I think all of us are looking at debt and deficit at this moment and \nrecognizing the tremendous importance of supporting our men and women \nin uniform and our President's request for supplemental spending for \nthe operations in Iraq, knowing full well we will fully fund all they \nneed in that area.\n  We also recognize this may well be a time for some belt tightening. \nWe are creative around here as it relates to our ability to associate \ncertain activities in our State with other activities in a national \nsense, to build a slightly different image or character of them.\n  I think we need, at this point in time, to be much more careful than \nwe have been in the past, and deal with our debt and our deficit and \nrecognize that money is very tight, and that we are struggling at this \nmoment as a Senate, as a Congress, working with our President, to do a \nvariety of things that, in the near future, are going to be very \ncritical--not only the operations ongoing in Iraq but the economy \nitself, and being able to build a stimulus package for this economy \nthat gets it rolling, gets investment back into the marketplace, and \nbuilds job opportunities for the men and women in America who are \ncurrently out of work. It is certainly true in my home State. It is \ntrue across the Nation at this moment.\n  Our economy is flat. We struggled mightily to put a budget resolution \nout. That budget resolution is now working its will with the House in a \nconference to try to resolve our differences, to set the spending trend \nand limits for the coming fiscal year, and, as importantly, to build a \nstimulus package to get this economy moving.\n  This is not a time for extra spending. This is not a time for that \nextraordinary opportunity, if you will, that clearly has value, \ncertainly in the minds of the Senator and the home State that he or she \nrepresents but in the whole of things may not be as important in this \nmoment in time as is funding defense, funding our war effort, making \nsure we hold our spending down so the deficit does not become \nunmanageable, getting this economy turned on, and getting the men and \nwomen of America back to work. That is really what we all ought to be \nabout at this moment. Certainly this supplemental appropriations bill \nought to address just that.\n  I must tell you, there is a part of this bill I am struggling with: \n$3.5 billion to benefit the airline industry. I do not question the \nvalue of the airline industry. I do question whether it has \nreorganized, restructured, asked its employees, asked its executives, \nasked its pilots to reshape their salaries to get them in line with \nother industries in our country, and, as a result of that, get their \nact back together instead of asking the American taxpayers to \ncontinually bail them out.\n  I do not, in any way, underestimate the value of the flow of commerce \nand industry in this country, of tourism and recreation, and business \nmen and women flying around our country, and certainly the average \nperson who just wishes to travel for whatever purpose. I understand the \nimportance of the airline industry.\n  I will vote for this legislation, but I am struggling mightily at \nthis moment in an industry that just has not faced the reality of the \nday, the reality of years and years of building a commitment to its \nemployees that it may now not well be able to finance and, therefore, \nto ask the American taxpayer to bail them out in absence of significant \nreform.\n\n  Some airlines are doing that. Some have already announced major \ncutbacks, major adjustments in salary, and they are struggling to hang \non. Others have not done so. I hope they will follow suit. We have put \nsome provisions in the legislation that I trust will allow for that.\n  Lastly, let me say, because I have not had the opportunity in the \nlast several days--busy in briefings on the war, busy in committees--to \ncome to the floor and, as one of Idaho's Senators, and 1 of 100 \nSenators here, tell the men and women in uniform who are currently in \nharm's way in Iraq how proud I am of them, how proud I am of their \nleadership and the tremendous work they are doing there on behalf of \nhuman freedom, on behalf of the civilian population of Iraq, who for \ndecades have only known the iron fist, the bullet, or the poison of a \ndictator who has brought that country to phenomenal despair--a country \nthat has lost almost a quarter of a million people in the last decade \nthrough starvation or from fleeing their homeland just for the sake of \ntheir families and themselves and their well-being.\n  We are there for a purpose. Yes, it is self-serving in the sense of \nthe stability of our country and the wiping out of terrorism around the \nworld and those who might feed it and those who might cause it to \nflourish, but it says something about this great country when we are \nwilling to put ourselves, our men and women and our resources, at risk \nto save others, to free others, to provide them with a better \nopportunity. That is what we are doing in the nation of Iraq at this \nmoment.\n  The war, on the whole, goes well, and I am extremely proud of those \nwho execute it and those brave souls who stand in harm's way on behalf \nof our country and on behalf of the citizens of Iraq.\n  The supplemental appropriations is about that. And it should be about \nthat and not about a lot of other things that can appropriately come \nbefore the Appropriations Committee, on which I serve, and/or the \nauthorizing committees that should be setting the necessary budgets, \nholding the necessary hearings as it relates to how the public \nresources of this country get allocated.\n  So I trust that my colleagues will review this critically, can, in \nthe whole, support S. 762, and recognize its importance as we fight our \ndeficits, work to turn on an economy, work to put the men and women of \nAmerica back to work, and at the same time assure those who stand in \nharm's way in Iraq at this very moment that they have the support of a \ncountry, an appreciative country, and they have the resources of this \ncountry to assure them the material necessary to not only execute their \nmission but to keep them safe.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by the \nSenator from Arizona, an amendment of which I am a cosponsor.\n  This amendment, if accepted, will require the Department of State to \nproduce a report within 60 days following the termination of offensive \nmilitary operations in Iraq detailing everything that is known about \nthat country's weapons of mass destruction programs, as well as about \nits ability to field conventional forces after a decade of sanctions. \nMost importantly, it will require that the report in question provide a \nthorough description of the means by which Iraq acquired the designs, \ntechnologies, components, and systems with which to develop and \nconstruct weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.\n  Finally, the report required by this amendment will include a \ndiscussion of the effectiveness of the unilateral and multilateral \nagreements designed to prevent Iraq's acquisition of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their means of delivery. This is not intended as an \nindictment of these agreements. On the contrary, they were an essential \ncomponent of the structure needed to try to contain Iraqi aggression \nand impede its ability to acquire such weapons. Rather, it is intended \nto educate us as to the ways in which rogue governments seek to \nmanipulate and undermine sanctions regimes and, in some instances, \nexploit the somewhat mercantilist tendencies of some nations to look \nthe other way when logic otherwise dictates caution.\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\n  American blood is being shed in the deserts and in the towns and \nvillages of Iraq for the principal purpose of ensuring that a brutal \ndictator is denied the ability to use chemical, biological or nuclear \nweapons against his neighbors, against U.S. interests, and against the \nAmerican homeland. The reasons that we arrived at this point in time \nare many and are varied. Suffice to say, however, that vitally \nimportant lessons will be drawn from this conflict, and from the period \nleading up to it. Among those lessons will be ways in which Iraq was \nable to amass the capabilities that it possessed at the time of \nOperation Desert Storm, and that it was able to retain and accumulate \nin the decade since. We know, for instance, that it succeeded in \nexploiting oil-for-food income for illicit purposes. What we need to \nbetter understand and to illuminate for the public, however, is the \nextent to which others facilitated such transactions.\n  As the remains of Americans killed in combat and in combat-related \naccidents return home for burial, and as the images of innocent Iraqi \nvictims fills the world's television screens, a reckoning will \nincreasingly be in order. This war is a terrible necessity. I fully \nsupport the President of the United States in his decision to bring a \ndecade-long problem that threatens our national interest to a \ndefinitive conclusion. As the elected representatives of the American \npublic, however, it is incumbent upon us to prepare to focus our \nattention on the history that brought us to where we are today. Only \nthrough a thorough examination of the ways in which Saddam Hussein was \nable to reach the stage where we were compelled to bring the full \nweight of our national power to bear upon him can we hope to prevent a \nrecurrence elsewhere in the world.\n  I urge support for this amendment. It is about knowledge. It is about \nlearning from the past. It is about helping to avoid traveling the road \nto war again in the future because we failed to keep our moral bearings \nin the present. Vote yes on the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from \nDelaware is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 488\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the amendment of a \ngood friend of mine, Senator Ensign from Nevada. He introduced an \namendment that maybe I should have been aware of but was unaware of \nuntil just a few minutes ago that reads:\n\n       No funds appropriated or otherwise made available in this \n     Act for purposes of reconstruction of Iraq may be obligated \n     or expended to pay any person who is a citizen of a country \n     named in a subsection.\n\n  It goes on to name in the subsection France and Germany.\n  I don't want to speak for the Senator, but that view is an expression \nof the frustration of an awful lot of Americans and some anger at the \nfailure of the Germans and the French to support our effort to disarm \nSaddam Hussein.\n  I begin by saying, I have just spoken with the White House and the \nState Department. They are adamantly opposed to this amendment. France \nand Germany are providing support for our effort to disarm Saddam that \nexceeds that of many countries who were formally members of the \ncoalition. There are overflight and basing rights, and many of our \nwounded are being flown first to Germany before they come here, not to \nmention their absolutely critical support in the war on terrorism.\n  Again, I understand the motivation and the frustration and the anger \nthat may be behind some who want to support the amendment. Our decision \nto use force in Iraq has created deep divisions within the Security \nCouncil. Nonetheless, America need not and cannot take sole \nresponsibility for the challenges of postwar Iraq. That is exactly what \nthis would produce. We can't allow the Security Council and our \nAtlantic alliances to become casualties of this war.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is aware there are German military and \ncivilians working right now, helping in the reconstruction and \npeacekeeping in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And have these Germans perhaps been associated with some \nfirm that may also be in the work of reconstruction and peacekeeping in \nBosnia and Kosovo and Afghanistan? Does my friend from Delaware believe \nsomehow we should prevent any company, corporation, or individual who \nmay have a contract in those three parts of the world from doing so?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Absolutely not. Any more than they should be in Iraq. This \namendment is a disaster. I understand the frustration. But this is a \ncase where, as my dear mother would say--and my friend from Arizona has \nmet my mom--she would look at me when we were both young--neither the \nSenator from Arizona nor I have a temper any longer, but when we were \nyoung we were alleged to have tempers. My mother, every time I would \nlose my temper, would look at me and say: Joey, don't bite your nose \noff to spite your face.\n  We are about to, in the colloquial phrase, bite our nose off to spite \nour face if, in fact, we were to ever allow this amendment to become \nlaw.\n  Mr. McCAIN. One more question: As the ranking member and senior and \nformer chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, suppose in the case \nof Kosovo, where Germany contributed enormously in the force of \npeacekeeping, medical care, other provisions of sustenance, \nparticularly in Kosovo and Bosnia, where there was enormous \ndevastation, suppose we had passed a law like this with regard to \nBosnia or Kosovo: Do you think we would have gotten the kind of \nassistance from the German government and the people we have received \nto date, including leadership of the peacekeeping forces?\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Absolutely, positively not. Because of the, as some view \nthem, arcane rules of the Senate, the Senator has to make his point by \nasking me questions. I would be delighted to yield him some time to \nspeak to this directly as well.\n  What we are both saying is, this is a fool's errand. This is a \nfoolish undertaking. Let me lay it out, if I may. And then I will be \ndelighted to save some time for my friend from Arizona, who is not only \na good personal friend, but a person for whom I have great respect on \nall matters, particularly foreign policy.\n  The first reason this would be such a profound mistake is that \nrebuilding Iraq an Iraq that is secure and self-sufficient, whole and \nfree is going to require tens of billions of dollars over many years. \nWhile Iraq's long-term economic promise is good, its short-term \nprospects are bleak.\n  This is something we don't focus on. Iraq's annual oil revenues in \nthe first 5 years after Saddam is out--God willing--are projected to be \nno more than $15 billion. Iraq is saddled, as they should be, with U.N. \nsanctions, an estimated $61 billion in foreign debt, and $200 billion \nin reparation claims through the U.N. Compensation Committee. So the \nidea that we can thumb our nose at the rest of the world and say, we \ndon't need you in there helping us, is profoundly mistaken.\n  Many Senators think that what happens once Saddam is down, once the \nwar is over, is that the oil is going to flow and there will be plenty \nof money for the Iraqis to move toward democracy, reconstruct their \ncountry, all from their oil revenues.\n  The fact is, the estimates are, if all goes well, there will be no \nmore than $15 billion a year, and they sit now with obligations that \nexceed $61 billion in foreign debt and $200 billion in claims.\n  Experts who have testified before the Foreign Relations Committee put \nthe price tag at post-conflict security--a fancy phrase for saying \nafter the war is over--humanitarian assistance and reconstruction to be \nbetween $20 and $25 billion per year for the next 10 years.\n  My point is, the United States should not take on that obligation \nalone. Yet if we bar the companies of friendly countries who did not \nsupport us in the war from taking part in the peace, what incentive \nwill there be for their governments to help pick up the tab? I \nrespectfully suggest it would be zero.\n  Secondly, as pointed out to me by the State Department and my staff--\nand it is self-evident when you think about it--this is going to \nrequire the so-called ``iffies,'' the World Bank, the International \nMonetary Fund, and other international banking institutions, to be part \nof this reconstruction. We are taking a country that has been decimated \nby a guy named Saddam for\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\nthe past several decades, and we are going to try to make it a member \nof the family of nations on the road to democracy. We know how hard \nthat is, even where there has been no war. We know how important it is \nto have international institutions part of the process of helping \nfledgling democracies come into being.\n  Now, what prospect do you think there is that the World Bank will get \ninvolved, or the IMF, if in fact the two leading members who make \ndecisions on those boards are German and French and they are \nprohibited, in an almost spiteful way, from having any German or French \nindividuals, let alone any companies, participating in anything having \nto do with the reconstruction of Iraq?\n  Third, we need military forces of those countries to be in on the \npeace. That is what the Secretary of State is doing right now. He is \nmeeting with NATO. The Associated Press published an article today \nentitled: ``Powell Says U.S. Will Lead Postwar Effort in Iraq.'' And I \nquote:\n\n       Powell and the Europeans did reach a tentative agreement, \n     however, that NATO should consider deploying peacekeepers to \n     Iraq.\n\n  I want someone else in the deal besides the United States. I don't \nwant it merely to be for the next year or 2, 3, 4 or 5 years that there \nis a young American woman or man standing at every checkpoint, guarding \nevery border crossing, guarding every oil field, and becoming the \ntarget of every malcontent and terrorist in the world.\n  I want the world to take on this responsibility with us. That is what \nthe Secretary of State is trying to do. A military occupation, even \ntemporary, that includes only Americans and British soldiers could fuel \nresentment throughout the Middle East, bolster al-Qaida's recruitment, \nmake America the target for terrorists and malcontents everywhere. If \nthe military mission stretches beyond several months or years, as is \npredicted, the failure to include other countries would compound these \nproblems and, I predict, if history is any teacher, turn us from \nliberators into occupiers.\n  We need to make peace in Iraq the world's responsibility, not just \nour own. If we bar their companies from the peace, we may as well \nforget about their help on the security side. Let's not undermine our \ndiplomacy here by passing such an ill-conceived amendment.\n  Four, if the United States alone selects a new Iraqi government--even \nan interim one--that will call into question the government's \nlegitimacy in the eyes of the Iraqi people, the region, and the world. \nIraqis who have lived through the brutality of Saddam Hussein's rule \nshould be given the time, the space, and the support to choose their \nown leaders and to develop the institutions of a stable representative \ngovernment. We should work with the international community to help \nachieve that. Who is going to be involved with us if, in fact, we take \nthese punitive measures because they disagreed about the course of \naction to begin with?\n  Fifth, many around the world, even long-time allies, question our \nmotives in Iraq. They believe, wrongly, that the President was driven \nby a quest for oil, driven by commercial interests, or imperial \ndesigns. They are dead wrong. But barring foreign companies in the \nindustrialized world--particularly from France and Germany--from taking \npart in the peace, would only go a step further to confirm the \nmisconception that we are in this for economic gain. We are not. That \nis not why the President moved. If we allow that to happen, I believe \nwe risk further erosion of those alliances and institutions that have \nbeen essential to American security and global cooperation for more \nthan 50 years. It would undermine our interests because we cannot \ncontend with all the threats around the world, including the unfinished \nwar on terrorism, the dangerous nuclear programs in North Korea and \nIran, and the spread of infectious diseases, such as SARS, without the \ncooperation of others in the world. Making friends and allies who \noppose the war our partners in Iraq's peace can go a long way to repair \nthe hard feelings that have been emerging in recent months.\n\n  Six, if we start blackballing foreign companies, we better be \nprepared for retaliation against the many American companies operating \nin France, Germany, and other countries. These American companies bring \nin billions of dollars that support tens of thousands of jobs in the \nUnited States of America. If we were to blackball those who disagreed \nwith us, including France and Germany, from participating in any way in \nthe reconstruction of Iraq, I believe you would see retribution from \nthat which will have impacts beyond anything I am sure my friend from \nNevada, Mr. Ensign, intended. This amendment would put a lot in \njeopardy.\n  Let me conclude--because I see the chairman on the floor--by \nreiterating what I said at the outset, which is that the Ensign \namendment is opposed by the White House. I spoke to Dr. Rice, and I am \nauthorized to say the White House opposes this amendment because it \nwould deny the President of the United States the flexibility he needs. \nI spoke to the State Department, the Deputy Secretary of State, who \npointed out that this would significantly undermine the other projects, \nthe other issues we are trying to negotiate with our allies.\n  The last point I will make is this: Some will say, why do we have to \nreconstruct Iraq at all? If we fail to secure the peace in Iraq, then \nwe will fail to honor those young marines and soldiers and airmen and \nNavy pilots who have been killed in Iraq. The purpose of this endeavor \nis not only to deny Saddam Hussein those weapons of mass destruction, \nbut to begin the process of stabilizing in that region so we don't have \nto send, in the future, our children--young American men and women--to \nIraq to give their lives to secure our freedom.\n  I am not in any way suggesting the motive of my friend from Nevada, \nSenator Ensign, is not a pure one. I am suggesting that it is \ndangerously misguided.\n  I am prepared to yield the floor. I am looking to the leadership here \nto determine whether I should suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue with the call of the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak against the McCain \namendment. I assume that is in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 481\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support funding \nfor the construction of the Ames, IA, animal health facilities \nlaboratory. That is the National Animal Disease Laboratory--a national \nfacility, not an Iowa facility--in Ames, IA. I heard my colleagues \nquestion the relevance of this provision. I am here now to explain to \nall my colleagues the importance of this facility to America's national \nsecurity.\n  In the event of an animal disease outbreak, this facility in Iowa \nwill play a very crucial role. Whether the issue is bioterrorism or a \nnew or emerging disease, this facility will be centrally involved. \nModernization of this facility that was built three or four decades ago \nis a paramount priority to ensure America's agricultural biosecurity \nand the safeguard of our food supply. Both the Department of \nAgriculture in Washington, as well as this Congress, have recognized \nthe importance of moving forward with this modernization project as \nquickly as possible.\n  I quote from a May 2001 report which was issued by the Secretary of \nAgriculture:\n\n       The Agricultural Research Service and Animal Plant and \n     Health Inspection Service partnership in Ames represents an \n     unmatched team of scientific and response personnel providing \n     expertise and skill to address known and emerging domestic \n     animal disease threats.\n\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\n\n  Our current national threat level demonstrates that we need to be \naware of our environment and prepared for realistic threats. Animal \ndisease is a realistic threat to all Americans because it affects our \nfood safety and supply.\n  Even without bioterrorism, we know what mad cow disease, for \ninstance, has done to agriculture and to the people of England, as one \nexample; and that carried over to Europe a year later and it has \nrecently scared the consumers of Japan. That is not even bioterrorism; \nthat is just a natural course of animal disease and, in fact, how that \nin turn impacts upon whether humans live.\n\n  The Ames lab is very important as we talk about the safety of our \nfood. This lab is the best large research and diagnostic facility in \nthe United States. Unfortunately, after all these decades, it is \nobsolete. It does not even meet international standards. Nearly every \nother livestock trading nation has superior facilities. They understand \nthe importance of effective and expedient diagnostic competency. The \nAmes lab is a surveillance hub for animal disease in the United States. \nIt is the closest thing we have for agriculture and livestock health to \nhuman health with the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, GA. \nDoesn't it seem unbelievable that the Ames facility does not have the \nelectrical capacity to handle new computers necessary to update the \nfacility, let alone a complex array of essential electronic diagnostic \nequipment? This is more than an embarrassment for our Government. It is \na national security risk.\n  We have worked through many different scenarios to improve this \nfacility. We have evaluated leaving the current facility in place and \nrenovating the existing facility to bring it in to the 21st century. We \nfound in the interest of the taxpayers that the most cost-effective \nmethod to bring this facility up to speed is to start over from the \nground up.\n  Let me be clear. This $98 million is not full funding for the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture master plan. This amendment only affords us \nthe opportunity to build the laboratory. The laboratory is clearly \ncritical for research, diagnosis, and prevention of all animal disease \nthreats. We cannot afford to delay construction. We need to be \nprepared, and this is the only way to reach an optimum level of \nsecurity.\n  Remember, we have already appropriated some money for other aspects \nof this renovation, and this still will not complete the renovation of \nthe animal disease laboratory to what is planned by the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  The fact is, the Ames laboratory is the cornerstone of the planned \nNational Animal Health Laboratory Network. The Ames facility is a \nfundamental element required to protect American agriculture and to \nimprove food safety.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment \nto delete but instead vote for continuing the process that is already \nin place, that has expended tens of millions of dollars of the \ntaxpayers' money in partial renovation. To move one step closer toward \nthat renovation for the safety of our food supply means to vote against \nthe McCain amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will not waste the time of this body \nresponding to the statement of the Senator from Iowa except to say I \nagree with him. It is more than an embarrassment. It is more than an \nembarrassment that we would be putting $98 million into a project that \nalready received $50 million before an additional $33 million in the \n2003 omnibus appropriations bill and for which there was not any \nadditional funding requested by the administration.\n  There is a reason there was not any request for this money by the \nadministration when they asked for this funding which is supposed to be \nfor the war.\n  As I say, I will not waste time except to say it is more than an \nembarrassment to me to tell my constituents that when we are supposed \nto be funding a war that is going on right now when young Americans are \nfighting and dying and badly need the equipment and materiel and the \nhelp that is in this bill that we are going to try to stuff in a $98 \nmillion porkbarrel project for an agricultural research facility which \nis already more than adequately funded, rather than put it into an \nemergency supplemental. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have a great deal of respect for \nSenator McCain. He is very consistent. I want to only argue with one \npoint. This is a national facility. It was located decades ago in my \nState for reasons that I believe are closely related to Iowa State \nUniversity being a very good land grant and research institution.\n  Second, the issue of whether this is legitimate at this point is best \njustified by the fact that this renovation has already been \nreauthorized, and this is just one more step by the Congress in \ncarrying out a decision that Congress previously made that this \nfacility that is now decades old should be renovated for the good of \nthe safety of food in the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. If the senior Senator from Arizona said the junior Senator \nwanted to speak, we would have no objection. He wants 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I was about to say there is no more honest \nMember of this body than the Senator from Iowa, who spoke a moment ago. \nWhen he lays out the case for this particular facility in Ames, IA, I \ndo not think any of us can quibble with that. That is not the point.\n  The point of this amendment is literally to help the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee resist the very persuasive cases that every \none of us can make that some great project that needs to be completed \nor started needs to be part of this very special supplemental \nappropriations bill. We are hoping to make his job a little easier in \nthe future so he can say: No, these bills are going to be clean.\n  This is a bill to fund the war. It is not to complete a research \nfacility and do other activities that may be good ideas but have no \nplace in this bill to fund the war. Let them go the regular process. I \ncan make the case there is something that relates to our ability as \nfirst responders to deal with an emergency from a terrorist threat in \nthe State of Arizona. We are trying to get some money to prevent our \nhospital emergency rooms from closing down because we are having to \ntreat illegal immigrants with health care under a Federal mandate, a \nFederal law, which we are happy to comply with, but which costs our \nhospitals hundreds of millions of dollars every year. We would like \nreimbursement for that so those emergency rooms will not close down, as \nthey had to, but can stay open. We will not ask for that in this bill.\n\n  Instead, we think the best approach is to go through the regular \nprocess. That is why I hope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry. It is my understanding there are \ntwo amendments that will be voted on consecutively now, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the McCain amendment be added as \nthe third amendment to be voted on in that queue.\n  Mr. REID. And that there be no second degree amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry. Is my friend intending to move to \ntable my amendment or will it be a straight up-or-down vote?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have already \nmoved to table the amendment of the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am trying to work out the sequence. What is the second \namendment in the queue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Graham amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 472\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now two minutes equally divided on \nthe Boxer amendment.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have worked hard to protect aircraft by \nmaking sure pilots are equipped to defend the airplane. We need to go \nan extra step today. The FBI warned us that terrorists with shoulder-\nfired missiles are a threat to our commercial aircraft. The \nadministration has determined airports are vulnerable to shoulder-fired \nmissiles and they have deployed the National Guard. But we need to do \nmore. We need to adapt countermeasures now installed in our military \naircraft for commercial use. It is possible to do this. El Al is doing \nthis.\n  Opponents argue, and we will hear this, we should wait until a study \nprovision I wrote into another bill becomes law. We should not wait \nbecause things have moved on since that study.\n  This amendment is not even inconsistent with it. It will, in fact, \nmake the money available for that study. This is about fighting a war \non terrorism. I hope we will vote in favor of my amendment and not to \ntable this amendment\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment takes money from the \nTransportation Security Administration allocation for passenger \nscreening and other costs to be incurred for additional security at \nairports. There is no current technology that can fulfill this need. \nThe systems are too heavy for most commercial aircraft. We do have \nunderway research and development in the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to try to develop the kind of devices \nthat provide this protection.\n\n  This is not a wartime request. This bill is a wartime request. We do \nnot want to see the Senate vote amendments that would earmark the \nhomeland security moneys in this bill. I have opposed them before and \nthe Senate has voted against this action before. I have previously made \na motion to table.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, then I would like 30 \nseconds to conclude debate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If it is 30 seconds, I don't object, but the 30 seconds \nhave a way of going on and on. Not the Senator's 30, but with all due \nrespect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No objection to 30 seconds on each side.\n  Thirty seconds on each side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will take ten seconds. I oppose the amendment, but I \nassure the Senator from California we recognize this is a threat; we \nrecognize this is a danger. I hope we defeat this amendment, but I \ncommit to her we will work to try to address this clear and present \ndanger, through studies and work with TSA and other agencies of \ngovernment. I look forward to working with the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very grateful. Senator McCain is my \nchairman, Senator Hollings is the ranking member. We will work together \non this threat.\n  I have to say when we are dealing with an emergency supplemental bill \nwhere we have a study already accepted by my friend, which I am very \nhappy about, which is moving forward, this is not inconsistent with \nthat. This will just move along a little quicker. If you look at the \nFBI warning, we need to act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. \nDole) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mrs. Dole) would vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, the next order of business is the \namendment of the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I see my friend is here. Maybe he would like to \nannounce, we have reached agreement to modify his amendment. We will \nput it in the managers' package because it is being withdrawn. We have \nreached accommodation with the Senator from Florida, after further \nconversation with the VA administration.\n  I yield to my friend for a minute if he would like.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, the Senator from Alaska has \nvery accurately described the negotiation. Therefore, I ask unanimous \nconsent to temporarily withdraw my amendment with the understanding it \nwill be approved in the managers' package, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I thank the Senator. It is the proper \nthing to do.\n  I yield now to the Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 488 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, regretfully, I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw my amendment. I also want to briefly say that this is a battle \nI plan to continue. I believe it was the right thing to do. But we are \ngoing to live to fight another day on this particular amendment. We are \ngoing to watch what the administration does with the funds for \nreconstructing Iraq, perhaps even join this fight at a later date. I \nask unanimous consent that amendment No. 488 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to withdraw his \namendment at this time.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I would like to address an inquiry to \nthe Senator from Nevada who indicates he intends to live and fight \nanother day on this amendment. If and when he does so, I hope he will \nalso address the question of how much cooperation he anticipates \nreceiving from the intelligence services in both Germany and France in \nour fight against international terrorism. If he is going to be laying \ndown a marker to these countries with his amendment, I hope when he \ndoes so the consideration of its impact on our cooperation with these \ncountries in the effort against terrorism will be in the forefront of \nhis explanation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 481\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, we still have another amendment to vote\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\non in the queue according to previous agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The McCain amendment is the next amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is an up-or-down vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, could we, in this body, strike these \nnonessential and unnecessary projects from this bill so we can focus on \nthe intent of the language? I don't want to debate the merits or \ndemerits of projects that are included in the bill. They are clearly \nnonemergency and nonwar related. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to \nconsider striking them. They can come in future appropriations bills, \nbut they are certainly not appropriate at this time on this bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the Senator from Iowa has expressed \nopposition to this amendment. I do express opposition to it myself. I \nwould like to take the balance of the time to tell the Senate we are \nworking to try to finish the bill. This is the last of the amendments \nthat is part of this package. We will struggle to put together another \nseries of amendments to vote on no later than 4 o'clock. We have, for \nvery strong reasons, at least one Member and others who requested we \ntry to finish this bill as early as possible today. I urge Senators to \ncontact us to see if there are any further amendments we might work out \nand not have to vote. But there will be some votes probably by 4:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Regular order, Madam President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I took the time in opposition. I thought I was entitled \nto take the time in opposition. As manager, I oppose the amendment. I \nask unanimous consent for 1 minute on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 481.

Madam President, I was not in the Chamber prior to the \nlast vote, and there was an objection to having an extra minute so I \ncould make some comments on the vote just held.\n  I thank the Senators for rejecting the McCain amendment for a number \nof reasons, but most importantly because the biggest item in that \nproposed amendment was funding to begin to complete the National Animal \nDisease Laboratory located in Ames, IA. I point out that this National \nAnimal Disease Laboratory is fully authorized, specifically authorized. \nIt has been peer reviewed. The USDA developed all the lands, and it is \nbeing built on an expedited basis to get it completed as soon as \npossible. It is a national animal disease laboratory in Ames. It is not \nan Ames lab, it is not an Iowa lab. Think about it like NIH. The \nNational Institutes of Health is located in Maryland, but it is not a \nMaryland facility. It is a national facility. You can look at it like \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA. That is \nnot a Georgia facility; it is a national facility that just happens to \nbe located in Atlanta. The same is true of the National Animal Disease \nLaboratory. It is a national laboratory that is located in Iowa.\n\n  I think in speaking of the Centers for Disease Control, we could also \nthink of the National Animal Disease Lab as sort of the animal \ncounterpart to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Just as \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is there nationally to \nhelp prevent or stop any kind of an infectious outbreak that might \noccur among humans, whether it is anthrax or smallpox or SARS or \nwhatever it is, the job of the CDC is to get in there, contain it, stop \nit from infecting more people. The National Animal Disease Laboratory \nhas the same function for animals. It is there to prevent, to stop \ninfectious outbreaks among animals, infectious outbreaks that could \ndevastate entire herds or entire populations of animals in this \ncountry, as we saw what happened with the mad cow disease in Great \nBritain. The National Animal Disease Lab would be charged with the \nresponsibility, if there is any kind of bioterrorist outbreak or you \nhad an animal infectious disease that could be transmitted to humans, \nthe National Animal Disease Lab would be there to stop\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\nit, contain it, and keep it from spreading.\n  That is why it is so important at this time to make sure we complete \nthe National Animal Disease Lab as soon as possible.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support in \ndefeating the McCain amendment that would have drastically cut back on \nour ability to get the National Animal Disease Lab completed as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I inquire if the Senator is willing to have a time \nagreement for his amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator restate his inquiry?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I asked if the Senator would be willing to discuss a \ntime agreement on his amendment?\n  Mr. BREAUX. The answer is yes. What was the custom of some of the \nother amendments? What was the division of time on the others, 20-10?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The custom, as the Senator from Nevada says, is 20 \nminutes on your side, 10 minutes on this side on amendments we didn't \nintend to work out, with the understanding the vote will be delayed.\n  I ask unanimous consent there be 30 minutes, 20 minutes for the \nSenator from Louisiana and 10 minutes under my control, and with the \nvote to occur at a time to be specified after consultation with my \nfriend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Also with no second-degree amendment in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Senator if that \nwill provide sufficient time? I would like to speak for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I have no other request for time. Ten minutes is \nsufficient for me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 494\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I send to the desk amendment No. 494 and \nask it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 494.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n         TITLE III--FEDERAL HOMELAND SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n                    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n                       United States Coast Guard\n\n\n                           operating expenses\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Operating Expenses'', \n     $200,000,000, to remain available until December 31, 2003, \n     for terrorism-related prevention, preparedness, and response \n     requirements associated with Operation Liberty Shield, \n     including but not limited to operating expenses related to \n     the increase in maritime operating tempo, the protection of \n     critical infrastructure and enforcement of Security Zones, \n     and the activation of Coast Guard Reservists.\n\n                   BORDER AND TRANSPORTATION SECURITY\n\n\n                     customs and border protection\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Customs and Border \n     Protection'', $366,000,000, to remain available until \n     December 31, 2003, of which not less than $35,000,000 shall \n     be for the Container Security Initiative, not less \n     $200,000,000 shall be for radiation portal monitors and other \n     forms of non-intrusive inspection equipment to be deployed at \n     the Nation's ports-of-entry, and not less than $131,000,000 \n     shall be for increased border and maritime protection \n     operations, overtime pay, and other activities resulting from \n     the movement to the ``Code Orange'' terrorist threat level \n     and in support of activities related to Operation Liberty \n     Shield.\n\n\n                  immigration and customs enforcement\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement'', $131,000,000, to remain available until \n     December 31, 2003, for increased operations, overtime pay, \n     and other activities resulting from the movement to the \n     ``Code Orange'' terrorist threat level and in support of \n     activities related to Operation Liberty Shield.\n\n                 Transportation Security Administration\n\n       For additional amounts for necessary expenses of the \n     Transportation Security Administration related to \n     transportation security services pursuant to Public Law 107-\n     71 and Public Law 107-296 and for other purposes, \n     $1,355,000,000, to remain available until December 31, 2003, \n     of which not less than $235,000,000 shall be available for \n     costs associated with the modification of airports to comply \n     with the provisions of the Aviation and Transportation \n     Security Act, not less than $300,000,000 shall be available \n     for grants to public transit agencies in urbanized areas for \n     enhancing the security of transit facilities against \n     chemical, biological and other terrorist threats, not less \n     than $620,000,000 for shortfalls pursuant to Public Law 108-\n     10, including the securing of airline cockpit doors, port \n     security grants, and airport modifications, not less than \n     $200,000,000 for railroad security grants including grants \n     to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation for capital \n     expenses associated with tunnel and dispatch facility \n     security enhancements;\n\n                Federal Law Enforcement Training Center\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses'', \n     $20,000,000, to remain available until December 31, 2003 for \n     personnel, equipment and support for increased training \n     requirements for Federal and State and local law enforcement \n     personnel.\n\n                    Office for Domestic Preparedness\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Emergency Management \n     Planning and Assistance'', $150,000,000, to remain available \n     until December 31, 2003, for grants to States and localities \n     to improve communications within and among first responders \n     including law enforcement, firefighters, emergency medical \n     services personnel, and other emergency personnel.\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\n                         National Park Service\n\n\n                 operation of the national park system\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Operation of the National \n     Park System'', $18,000,000, to remain available until \n     December 31, 2003, for expenses related to enhanced security \n     at nationally significant facilities.\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\n                     United States Marshals Service\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses'', \n     $25,000,000, to remain available until December 31, 2003, for \n     necessary expenses relating to courthouse security;

Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, funding under the heading Department of Homeland \n     Security, Departmental Management, Counterterrorism Fund, \n     shall be zero.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, the committee has done a very good job in \naddressing a number of concerns dealing with terrorism, particularly in \nthe area of counterterrorism, by creating a fund that is going to give \nto the Department of Homeland Security $1.135 billion for \ncounterterrorism. I think the administration actually requested a \nlittle more money than that.\n  Regarding the amendment I have, we think, No. 1, it should be more \nthan that and, No. 2, we think Congress should be involved and the \nAmerican people should be involved in where that money is going to be \nallocated, as to which department doing this type of work is going to \nget the additional funds.\n  The amendment of the committee, about which I am concerned, says: Mr. \nPresident, here is $1.135 billion. Let's throw it up against the wall \nand hope it comes off the wall and falls down and does some good. We \ntake $1.135 billion and throw it up in the air and somehow hope it \ncomes down and settles in the areas where it can do the most good to \nprotect the American people.\n  I think that is not the way we should do business. We are taxing the \nAmerican people for these moneys to be spent to protect the American \npublic. We as a Congress should have a direct say-so, not just entrust \nit to an individual Secretary as to where the money should go.\n  My amendment says in the area of counterterrorism funds, instead of \n$1.135 billion, we are going to have $2.65 billion, an increase for \ncounterterrorism provisions in the bill.\n  In addition to that, we are going to say where the moneys are going \nto be allocated. That is the role of the Congress. That is the \nappropriate role of the Congress.\n  For instance, in the Coast Guard, our provision provides $200 million \nmore for the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard is being asked to do a lot \nmore work domestically. Most of the money in the committee's bill is \nfor Coast Guard utilization overseas. That is fine; they ought to be \noverseas doing this work, but they also should be protecting the ports \nof America, the ports of New York, and the gulf and the west coast and \neast coast ports. We also say the Bureau of Customs and Border \nProtection should have an increase of $366 million for the inspections \nthey are going to be required to do.\n  We have literally millions of containers, each carrying as much as \n60,000 pounds of material, coming into the ports of the United States. \nWe ought to be looking at these containers where they are loaded, in \nforeign ports. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection is going to \nneed that additional money if, in fact, they are going to be able to \nget the job done.\n  In addition to the Bureau of Customs, we are talking about $1 billion \nfor transportation security. We are talking about making sure that at \nall the airports where we are telling them now you have to put in all \nthis fancy equipment, not just to check luggage that is carried on the \nplane but check every single piece of luggage that is going to go into \nthe cargo hold of the plane--how many of us have had to be delayed at \nairports because they are checking not only your carry-on luggage but \nalso the stuff that is going to be checked into the hold of the plane. \nYou see the long lines develop. They need the equipment to make sure \nthat type of luggage is safe and not delaying passengers and the \ntraveling public moving into the airports.\n  We also say about the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, give \nthem an additional $20 million for enhanced training.\n  We are asking these organizations now to work 24 hours a day, 7 days \na week training these new employees to make sure they know what they \nare doing. They are going to need additional funds for that.\n  I read the bill from the committee. It just says on page 36 of the \nbill: counterterrorism, give the Secretary the discretion to spend \n$1.135. That is what the bill says. That means throw it over to the \nSecretary; let him spend it anywhere he wants. I think the report \nlanguage says here are some suggestions. That is fine; we all know what \nhappens with report language. It is filed in some staff person's desk, \nand they don't pay any attention to it. That is not the law. They can \ntotally ignore it. They can disregard it, pay no attention to it \nwhatsoever.\n\n  If you put it into law, it would state that these are the categories \nthat are necessary in order to make sure this counterterrorism \nprovision is run the way we would like to see it run.\n  Mr. President, I want to yield time to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I think he said he would like to have 10 minutes. And if \nhe could use less, we may get another speaker in here. But I yield 10 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by \nmy colleague, Senator Breaux. I am a cosponsor of that amendment.\n  Let me describe why I think this is so important. We have a number of \nwars that are going on at the moment. We have a conflict, a war in \nIraq. We have a war against terrorism. So in this piece of legislation \nwe deal with defense, the costs of defense.\n  Part of defense is the Defense Department, in which men and women in \nAmerica's uniform are overseas protecting our country and involved in \nthe conflict in Iraq. But, also, part of the defense is our homeland \ndefense. The issue of homeland defense is very important.\n  Let me describe what happens inside this country each and every day: \n1.1 million passengers come into this country processed by the Customs \nService; 57,000 trucks and containers come into this country every \nsingle day; 580 vessels arrive at this country's ports; 2,459 aircraft \narrive in this country; 323,000 vehicles, every single day.\n  No one is going to provide an adequate homeland defense in this \ncountry unless we have secure borders and are able to prevent \nterrorists--both known terrorists and those who associate with \nterrorists--from coming into our country. Frankly, we are not doing as \ngood a job as we must in order to prevent a future act of terrorism in \nthis country.\n  I speak from the standpoint of a northern border State. We have \nthousands of miles of common border with our good neighbor to the \nnorth, the country of Canada.\n  We know that at least two of those who perpetrated the September 11 \nattack came into this country across the northern border. We also know \nthat, in the past, almost all of our resources in this country were \ntargeted at the southern border, southwestern border. Border Patrol, \nImmigration, the Customs Service: Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds--\nin fact, thousands--of agents from all of those agencies were at the \nsouthern border, and a very few at the 4,000-mile northern border that \nwe share with Canada.\n\n  So what do we do about that? Well, we need the resources at the \nnorthern border, and the new technology that is available, to make sure \nwe try to keep terrorists out. Once again, you must have control of \nyour borders or you do not have control inside the country to prevent \nan act of terrorism perpetrated against our country.\n  Now, when I began this process, even before September 11, I proposed \nsomething called the Northern Border Initiative. That became law. That \nadded some resources at the northern border. It became more imperative \nafter September 11 that we do much more. Prior to that time, when the \nnorthern border ports would close, especially in the remote areas, they \nwould simply put an orange cone in the middle of the road, and that \nwould be the protection in this country against terrorism. Well, \nterrorists, of course, were they to enter at one of those rural remote \nports, would shred that orange cone at 70 miles an hour with their \nvehicle.\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\n  The fact is, we have to do more. And we are now doing more. But we \nare not doing enough. That is why the Senator from Louisiana offers an \namendment that says let's make the investments we know we need to make.\n  He mentioned seaports. I come from a landlocked State. I do not know \nmuch about seaports, but I have made two tours of seaports, two of them \nrecently, to understand what is happening at our ports. Mr. President, \n5.7 million containers come in every single year on container ships--\n5.7 million. And 100,000 of them are inspected.\n  I was at a port one day--and I have told my colleagues this \npreviously--but they had a refrigerated container there that they had \ntaken off a container ship. I said: What's in that container? They \nsaid: Well, we're just inspecting that. They said: This is frozen \nbroccoli from Poland. And they showed me one of the 100-pound bags of \nfrozen broccoli they pulled out of this container. They ripped open the \nbag, and, sure enough, there it was, frozen broccoli from Poland. It \ndidn't look very appetizing to me, but it was going to go into \nAmerica's food supply.\n  So I said: Well, that is interesting to know. You have shown me the \nbag at the end of the container. What is in the middle of the bag in \nthe middle of the container? Do you know?\n  They said: No, we don't know. I said: Do you know where it came from? \nThey said: We know it came from Poland. I said: Do you know who loaded \nit? They said: No, we don't know. I said: Do you know that there's not \nsomething in the middle of this container that could threaten our \ncountry? They said: No, we don't know.\n  Mr. President, 5.7 million containers come into this country every \nyear, and we inspect 100,000 of them.\n  You know the story about the person from the Middle East who put \nhimself in a container and intended to ship himself to Canada in a \ncontainer. He had a little bathroom set up in the container. He had a \nwater supply. He had a computer. He had a GPS. He had a cot. He had a \nheater. He was going to ship himself to Canada, presumably then to \nenter this country from Canada. But he did it in a container. They \ncaught him actually before he left the Middle East.\n\n  The fact is, we had better care about homeland security--yes, about \nthe northern border, about the southern border, about aircraft coming \ninto this country, and, yes, about ships that are pulling up to our \nseaports this afternoon in New York, Los Angeles, and the other major \nports around this country.\n  Which of those ships might have a weapon of mass destruction in the \nmiddle of a container, piled in the middle of that ship, that will be \nhoisted off, by a crane, put on 18 wheels, and then sped across \nAmerica's highways to Cincinnati or Toledo or Fargo or Los Angeles? \nThat is what homeland defense has to be about: preventing these kinds \nof things from happening, preventing terrorists from perpetrating an \nattack in this country.\n  We have actually done pretty well since 9/11. The fact is, there is \nmuch more to do. It will not do any good to say: Well, yes, this is \nneeded, but let's do it later.\n  This is the legislation. This is a supplemental appropriations bill. \nThis is emergency funding. And this is about defense, yes, the Defense \nDepartment, but also, in my judgment, the defense of our homeland.\n  I have not gone through all of the portions of this bill that the \nSenator from Louisiana suggests we adequately fund, but it is the \nImmigration Service, the Customs Service, the Border Patrol, and a list \nof agencies that we know have to have adequate funding to do the job \nthis country expects in order to protect itself against a terrorist \nattack.\n  So this is not some ad hoc spending for which the Senator has no \njustification. This is spending and funding every bit as important as \nevery dollar that is going to the U.S. Department of Defense. This is \nhomeland defense. That is the Department of Defense. Both are of \nparamount importance in protecting this country's interests. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting the amendment now offered by the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  There is, perhaps, an unlimited number of things we could do to \nprotect this country, but we do not have unlimited funds. The Senator \nhas selected specific areas of investment that all of us know are \nunderfunded. And he said: Yes, let's do this, but, more important, \nlet's do this now.\n  I just submit, in the shadow of 9/11, this country knows that \nterrorists want to attack this country. Homeland defense is of \nparamount importance. The investment--a rather small investment, in my \njudgment--made by the amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana \nwill make this a stronger country, better able to resist terrorists who \nwish to attack her.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the amendment \noffered by Mr. Breaux.\n  For many months now, the American people have been told that we are \nat war. We are at war in Iraq. We are at war here at home. We are at \nwar against the al-Qaida terrorist network and other organizations like \nit. We are at war against terrorists who would use any means possible \nto destroy our Government, strike fear in our people, and cripple this \ngreat Nation.\n  But, America is still woefully unprepared to prevent or respond to \nanother terrorist attack. Despite the constant warnings from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security about terrorist threats here at home, \nand despite the obvious vulnerabilities, there are some in Congress who \nseem to want to put off sound investment for increased protections for \nour people. ``Hold off! Hold off! Wait for another day!'' they say. Mr. \nPresident, we may wait, but the terrorists, I fear, will not wait.\n  The amendment before the Senate, which is offered by Mr. Breaux, \nwould invest dollars now--today!--in some of the most critical areas of \nvulnerability here at home.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana would provide \n$2.6 billion for border and transportation security, including $200 \nmillion for the Coast Guard, $35 million for the Bureau of Customs and \nBorder Protection, $200 million for radiation detection equipment, $235 \nmillion for airport explosion detection systems, $300 million for mass \ntransit security, $300 million for interoperable communications for \nfirst responders, $225 million for terrorism prevention at the Federal \nBureau of Investigations, and funding to reimburse Department of \nHomeland Security expenses incurred as a result of Code Orange and to \nmake up for fiscal year 2003 funding shortfalls at the Transportation \nSecurity Administration.\n  A March 12, 2003, General Accounting Office report concluded that the \nCoast Guard faces ``fundamental challenges in meeting its new security-\nrelated responsibilities while rebuilding its capacity to accomplish \nother missions that have declined'' and that these challenges are made \neven more difficult by the heightened terror alert and by Coast Guard \ndeployments to the Persian Gulf.\n  In addition, a December 2002, GAO report identified more than $700 \nmillion in security needs at only eight transit agencies that were \nvisited. The GAO concluded that, ``Obtaining sufficient funding is the \nmost significant challenge in making transit systems as safe and secure \nas possible.'' Yet to date, no money--none--has been provided for \ntransit security.\n  If there is one lesson that we should learn from 9/11, it is that \nterrorist attacks on our Nation can no longer be viewed as distant \nthreats across the oceans. The enemy may attack our troops, the enemy \nmay attack our citizens overseas or civilians here at home. Clearly, we \nmust provide all of the necessary resources to support our troops \noverseas. But we must also provide significant homeland security \nresources now to meet real needs that have been authorized by the \nCongress and signed into law by the President for port security, \nairport security, border security, and nuclear security.\n  We should not accept the alarming deficiencies in our seaport \nsecurity--an area that many experts have identified as perhaps the \nNation's single greatest vulnerability. We should not accept the fact \nthat our land borders are porous and that our airports simply cannot \nafford modern security equipment. We should not be satisfied that our \ncities and States--the front lines of this war\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\nat home--do not have sufficient equipment or expertise to handle wide-\nranging threats involving madmen who may have gotten their hands on \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  The danger is clear. The need is clear. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Breaux amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Byrd, Senator \nBreaux, and others in supporting this Federal homeland responsibilities \namendment. In particular, I want to speak for a moment about the \nNational Park Service component of the amendment. As the ranking member \non the Interior and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am deeply \nconcerned that the administration's supplemental funding request will \nleave the National Park Service in the lurch, without the resources it \nneeds to protect our most important national symbols.\n  The Statue of Liberty, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, \nthe Jefferson Memorial, the St. Louis Arch, the Liberty Bell, and \nIndependence Hall in Philadelphia; these are just some of the national \nicons under the protection of the Park Service. These treasures are, in \ntheir own unique way, potent reminders of the liberty and freedom that \nare the foundation of the American experience. They symbolize the \nstruggles this Nation has overcome, the hope we have maintained for our \nfuture, and the essence of the democracy we all cherish.\n  The Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were a powerful symbol of \nthe economic might of our Nation, and that is why they were attacked. \nThe Pentagon is a powerful symbol of our military might, and that is \nwhy it was attacked. I worry about which symbol is next. Which of these \nfacilities, emblematic of our liberty, will the terrorists target next? \nI don't have the answer to that question, nor do I know anyone who \ndoes. This is precisely why we need to provide the National Park \nService with the resources it needs to ensure the safety and security \nof these national treasures.\n  In fact, yesterday's Washington Post contains an article which \nsubstantiates my fears. As of yesterday, the Park Service has closed \nIndependence Hall in Philadelphia because of security concerns \nassociated with the elevated threat level. The very birthplace of our \nConstitution--the document once called the ``most wonderful work ever \nstruck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man''--has been \nclosed to the American people because the Park Service is unable to \nprovide for its security. Part of the problem, as the article points \nout, is lack of funding. ``Since the government raised its color-coded \nthreat index to orange, or high risk, two week ago, the National Park \nService's daily security costs have increased by $63,500. . . .'' That \nis a daily cost, and comes to nearly $2 million per month, money the \nPark Service simply does not have. Yet despite asking for $75 billion, \nthe administration's supplemental request did not include any funding \nfor these additional security costs. That is wrong, and it is why we \nhave included funding for the Park Service in our amendment.\n  We cannot turn our backs on the security needs mandated by the \nincreased threat level. Nor can we expect the Park Service to just \nabsorb these costs. It is our responsibility to provide these funds, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Breaux \namendment for a variety of reasons, but I will limit my remarks to the \nprovision dealing with increased funding for mass transit security.\n  I commend the Senator from Louisiana for bringing attention to this \nimportant issue. While I believe that transit security is an issue \ndeserving of increased investment, the approach taken in the amendment \nis not one that I can support at this time.\n  Existing Federal transit law already requires that a percentage of \nformula funds be used for safety and security needs. The Federal \nTransit Administration has made transit security a priority. FTA has \nalready conducted assessments for the 33 largest systems and has \nprovided a ``tool box'' to help systems develop their own \nindividualized security programs. Further, FTA has developed and \ndistributed a checklist of the most important measures that transit \nagencies should implement to ensure that their systems are as secure as \npossible. FTA has made it a priority to work with agencies to assist in \nimplementation of those measures.\n  Mass transit is perhaps one of the most difficult modes of \ntransportation to secure. By its very nature, transit must operate in \nan open environment in order to provide its customers with mobility and \naccess. We need to carefully consider how we develop transit security \nmeasures to ensure that we do not risk stranding those who depend on \ntransit for their day-to-day mobility needs.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \nI am cognizant of the unique need for further analysis of transit \nsecurity issues. As the committee reauthorizes the Federal transit \nprogram this Congress, we intend to make the issue of transit security \na high priority.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Breaux amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Breaux Federal \nhomeland security responsibilities amendment. This amendment addresses \na number of important homeland security needs that the administration \nhas failed to adequately fund, and it deserves the support of this \nSenate.\n  I particularly want to thank the author of this amendment for \nincluding specific resources to help protect our Nation's transit \nsystems and the 14 million Americans who depend on them to get to work \nor elsewhere safely and securely every workday.\n  In the 107th Congress, as the chairman of the Housing and \nTransportation Subcommittee, I chaired two hearings on the topic of \ntransit security in the wake of September 11. At these hearings, we \nheard from transit operators and others that public transportation is \nregrettably a target for terrorists. Indeed, roughly one-third of \nterrorist attacks worldwide have occurred against transportation \nsystems. One only needs to watch international news to see pictures of \nthe devastation of suicide bombers on buses.\n  Senator Sarbanes and I also requested a General Accounting Office \nreport on transit security entitled ``Mass Transit: Federal Action \nCould Help Transit Agencies Address Security Challenges.'' The GAO \nfound that the Federal Transit Administration and the Transportation \nSafety Administration were providing technical assistance and some \ntraining to transit systems, but that there are still many unmet needs. \nFor example, when the GAO asked just eight transit systems how much \nthey needed to address their security needs, the answer was over $700 \nmillion. Transit systems also expressed concern that there is often \ninsufficient planning, communication and coordination with local, State \nand Federal law enforcement entities.\n  The administration, which has embraced the Senate's efforts to \nimprove aviation security, has unfortunately not shown the same level \nof commitment to our transit systems. It failed to request specific \nfunding for transit security in either its fiscal year 2004 budget or \nits fiscal year 2003 supplemental request.\n  The Breaux amendment would address this shortcoming by providing a \ndown-payment for transit security improvements and send a strong signal \nto the millions of working men and women who ride our subways, buses, \nand commuter rail lines that their government is aggressively working \nto improve transit security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it has been our hope that we could get \nthe cooperation of the Senate in funding what are essential needs of \nthe Department of Homeland Security for the balance of this fiscal \nyear. In trying to determine what those amounts are for all of these \nnew activities, the 22 agencies that have been folded into this new \nDepartment under the jurisdiction of Secretary Tom Ridge, we had \nhearings. We have questioned agency officials to determine how we could \nhelp support the administration's effort to improve the security of our \nhomeland, to fund the activities of those agencies that are involved in \nthe war effort in Iraq, such as the Coast Guard, to be sure that they \ncould meet their responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\n  We did this in a very careful and deliberate way, knowing full well \nthat because of the concerns and the fears that exist throughout the \ncountry about terrorism attacks and because of the increase in the \nthreat levels that from time to time are announced, there is no way we \ncould assuage the concerns of everybody with just money. But money \nhelps. If a State or locality believes it is not able to afford what it \nthinks it needs to do right now to protect its citizens, there is \npressure that builds on elected Members of this body. All of us feel \nthis pressure right now to be sure that we do the best job we possibly \ncan to put money in the hands of those agencies and those government \nofficials that can make a difference in terms of our national security \nneeds.\n  We didn't just think up these numbers and throw them in the bill. \nThey are based upon estimates we have received from each agency, the \nPresident's request that was submitted to the Congress, and the \ntestimony from the recent hearing when Secretary Ridge appeared before \nour committee and we had an opportunity to talk with him about these \nneeds.\n  One reason there is some concern is that the Secretary asked for \nflexibility. There were some members of the committee who questioned \nhim pretty sharply about why he needed flexibility, that it is the role \nof the Congress to make sure we appropriate money for specific purposes \nand not just write a blank check.\n  Well, we didn't write a blank check. We have written not only the \nprovisions of the bill with specificity about how the funds we are \nappropriating are to be used, but we also have accompanied the bill \nwith a written report that spells out, in the case of the \ncounterterrorism fund, what our understanding of the needs are and the \nestimates that we received from the agencies. So in spite of the \nsuggestions we have heard by the proponents of this amendment, we do \nhave some specificity.\n  We have, for example, put in the committee report, with respect to \nthe Department of Homeland Security's 30-day surge associated with \nimmediate or emerging terrorism-related prevention and response \nactivities, the following: Bureau of Immigration and Customs \nenforcement, $55 million. Federal Protective Service overtimes \noperations and maintenance for the air program and other related costs \nare included in that. For the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration \nServices, $1 million. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, we \nhave $65 million. That includes overtime, operation costs of assets, \nimpact on user fee collections and other logistics costs, and on and \non. Transportation Security Administration, $120 million, overtime for \npassenger screeners, operation costs of assets, contract hiring, \nservice training, and State and local expenses. We enumerate several \nother activities with specificity in that connection.\n\n  One thing the Senate needs to know, the Breaux amendment deletes the \nentire provision, the funding for the entire provision of the \ncounterterrorism fund. I will read it. This is what it says; it is very \nclear: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, funding under \nthe heading Department of Homeland Security, Departmental Management, \nCounterterrorism Fund, shall be zero,'' knocking out $1.132 billion. \nThen $500 million is zeroed out of the Department of Justice, General \nAdministration, Counterterrorism Fund.\n  Think about what you are being asked to do. This amendment is \nsuggesting that you disregard the efforts by the committee in the \nwriting of a meticulously drafted committee report that specifies our \nunderstanding of where these funds are going to be spent, and you trade \nthat for this amendment that is offered, as we are in the closing hours \nof consideration of this supplemental bill and assume that these \nrecommendations are going to be superior to the ones the committee has \nproposed to the Senate.\n  I am suggesting this is not a good way to legislate. The Senate ought \nto reject this amendment. These are efforts and activities of our \nGovernment that are too important for the Senate to be asked to \nsubstitute the judgment of a new list of activities with new numbers \nbeside them that are not related to estimates from the agency, are not \nrelated to any testimony we have received in any of our hearings, but \nyet amount to a rewrite of this entire section of the supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  There is some money in here for States and localities. We hope the \nSenate understands that we have written in here some requirements that \nget the money out faster to States and localities. It requires that 80 \npercent of the funding go directly to localities in some of the grant \nprograms administered by the Department of Homeland Security.\n  We have made a concerted effort to ensure that the taxpayers will get \ntheir money's worth out of the funds appropriated in this bill. For \nexample, although this amendment adds money for the Coast Guard, we set \nup a separate section for funding of Coast Guard activities. We put in \n$580 million directly to the Coast Guard. I have to admit, that was not \nrequested by the administration, but we wanted to be sure their \nactivities, particularly with regard to Operation Iraqi Freedom, were \nfully funded.\n  The Coast Guard has been mobilized, in effect, as a part of our war \nagainst terror in the Persian Gulf area, so-called Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. But they also have responsibilities here for homeland \nactivities. The bill reported by the Committee on Appropriations gives \nthe Secretary discretion to use fiscal year 2003 funds from the \ncounterterrorism account to allocate funding to the Coast Guard for \nadditional operation expenses. That includes Operation Liberty Shield. \nThe bill fully funds the administration's request in support of the \nCoast Guard and general terrorism prevention, preparedness, and \nresponse capability.\n  There is absolutely no basis for the $200 million estimate in the \namendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana. It is just added on. \nIf there is evidence, if there is a request, if there is documentation, \nthen we need to see it. We ought not be asked to support add-ons to \nthis bill to make it sound as if we are underfunding the legitimate \nneeds of these agencies in the protection of the security of our \ncountry.\n  I suggest the Senate should look very carefully at this amendment.\n  I will cite one other area. This amendment puts in $131 million for \nincreased border and maritime protection operations. What this \namendment does is double the amount that the administration says they \nneed, just doubles it: If what we suggest is good, then twice as much \nought to be twice as good.\n  That is not good reasoning and the Senate ought to reject the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 6 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Mississippi has 25 seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senators Schumer, Clinton, Stabenow, and Kennedy be added \nas cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, the idea that Congress ought to be \ninvolved in how the money is spent is not a novel idea. If we are going \nto spend $1.135 billion, Congress ought to be involved in saying how it \nis going to be spent.\n  The bill before the Senate now says that we are going to give $1.135 \nbillion to the Office of the Secretary of Homeland Security, and \nwhatever he wants to do with it, he pretty much has carte blanche to do \nwhatever he thinks fit. I would hope he would make the right decisions, \nbut I would like to have Congress involved in saying these are the \npriorities within that $1.135 billion as to what we think should be \nspent and how it should be spent. We do not do our job if we just \nappropriate money and do not indicate how the money should be spent, \nespecially when you are talking about billions of dollars.\n  Here is an example. The Senator from Mississippi says we have a \nreport that makes suggestions. Folks, this is a suggestion. This could \nbe filed in a desk drawer at the Department, thrown in the waste paper \nbasket, and ignored, because it doesn't have the effect of law. It is \nnice that people worked on it and that it was printed, but how many \npeople will read it? Not very many, and not many will read it over at \nthe Department of Homeland Security either.\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\n  If you want to say how money is going to be spent, it has to be part \nof the law. We are not saying spend whatever you want. We are giving \nhim a specific amount. We should also say how that specific amount is \ngoing to be spent. That is what my amendment does.\n  Let me give an example of what the problem is. For the Coast Guard--\nand we know how much work they are going to have to be doing in the \nUnited States, in the ports of New York, Florida, New Orleans, Houston, \nand the west coast because of the problems we have--the supplemental \nappropriations bill puts in $580 million more for the Coast Guard. What \nthey say is that $400 million of it is going overseas. We need it \noverseas. That is appropriate and proper. But we also have some \nhomeland needs for counterterrorism.\n\n  Under the supplemental bill pending before the Senate, we would have \n$180 million for the domestic Coast Guard needs, and then the remainder \nof $400 million would be going overseas. We are neglecting homeland \nsecurity. We are talking about homeland security, which means here at \nhome.\n  So we are suggesting that we add an additional $200 million, which \nwould be utilized in this country for the needs at all of the ports. \nThey have to do a lot more, we are telling them, and the Coast Guard \nhas to devise a security plan for every single port in the United \nStates. They are not going to be able to do that for free, with all the \nwork that needs to go into those ports.\n  If we are going to spend $1.135 billion, the Congress should be \ninvolved in saying where it is going to be spent. We should not simply \nsay: Here is the money; we hope it does some good; whatever you want to \nuse it for, do it, as long as it fits the generic title of \ncounterterrorism. Well, counterterrorism is more than a word; it is the \nCoast Guard, the Bureau of Customs, the Immigration Service, and it is \nmoney for airport modifications to detect the luggage going into the \nholds of the ship; it is mass transit security, railroad security, \nFederal law enforcement training, and it is better communications for \nthe men and women who work in counterterrorism.\n  That is what counterterrorism is. It is not just a term; it is a \nbunch of Agencies and Departments that have a lot of work to do. We \nought to have the intelligence to be able to say where it is going to \nbe spent, instead of just putting a term out there and saying we are \ngoing to give $1.135 billion for counterterrorism.\n  What is counterterrorism? I suggest that counterterrorism is outlined \nin the descriptions we have in the amendment now pending before the \nSenate, which we ask our colleagues to consider supporting. It is nice \nthat we have suggestions in a report, but we all know--if you have been \nhere more than a week--a report is not binding, not law; it is merely a \nsuggestion. We are here to write laws, to direct the Departments as to \nhow their funds should be used. I am sure they are going to read the \nreport, but they can also ignore the report. I think it is better to \nspell out what we are talking about when we talk about \ncounterterrorism. It is not just a word; it encompasses a lot of \ndifferent Departments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, contrary to the suggestion of my friend \nfrom Louisiana, the committee is requiring the administration to \nrespond and spend the money as provided in this bill. I am reading:\n\n       Prior to the obligation of any funds, the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security is required to submit a notice to the \n     Committee on Appropriations. The committee expects this \n     notice to be accompanied by a full and complete justification \n     of the costs to be reimbursed by agency accounts, including a \n     detailed breakdown by program, project and activity.\n\n  We are going to maintain oversight. Who is not going to get money if \nthis amendment is adopted? The U.S. Secret Service, law enforcement \ntraining requirements, emergency preparedness and response, and other \nimportant activities are going to be zeroed out of this bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, $2.65 billion is not zeroing out \ncounterintelligence and counterterrorism. It is a large add-on, $2.65 \nbillion. The only difference is we are suggesting in law where it ought \nto be spent, instead of saying you can do what you want and then come \nback to the committee and tell us why you did it that way. We should \ntell them where it should be spent before the fact, not after the fact. \nOur amendment adds money to counterterrorism. I think that is what we \nshould be doing as a Senate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding that the manager of the bill and the leaders have agreed \nthis vote would occur at a later time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is correct. I ask unanimous consent that the Breaux \namendment be temporarily set aside and a vote occur on or in relation \nto the amendment at 4:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may direct a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair wants to clarify the situation \nregarding the motion to table. Did the Senator make a motion to table?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, a motion to table was made. I now ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I direct a question to the manager of the \nbill. I have indicated to Senator Stevens that Senator Feinstein is \nready to offer an amendment. It is my understanding that there has been \nsome arrangement made on the amendment she is going to offer.\n  I see my friend from Missouri. Does he wish to offer an amendment? I \nthought we were going to the Feinstein amendment. May I have an \nindication from the Senator from Missouri how long he is going to take, \nor what the subject matter is?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri has an \namendment, and there will be a short discussion of it, and it may not \nrequire a vote.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 499\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is temporarily set \naside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Talent], for himself, Mr. \n     Bond, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 499.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To require certain air carriers that receive funds \n appropriated under this Act to accept procedures that ensure the fair \n and equitable resolution of labor integration issues in transactions \n                  for the combination of air carriers)\n\n       At the end of title IV, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) This section may be cited as the ``Airline \n     Workers Fairness Act''.\n       (b) The purpose of this section is to require covered air \n     carriers that receive funds appropriated under this Act to \n     accept procedures that ensure the fair and equitable \n     resolution of labor integration issues, in order to prevent \n     further disruption to transactions for the combination of air \n     carriers, which would potentially aggravate the current \n     disruptions in air travel associated with increased terror \n     alerts and other factors in the United States.\n       (c) In order to receive funds appropriated under this Act, \n     a covered air carrier shall agree to be subject to this \n     section.\n       (d) In any covered transaction involving a covered air \n     carrier that leads to the combination of crafts or classes \n     that are subject to the Railway Labor Act--\n       (1) sections 3 and 13 of the labor protective provisions \n     imposed by the Civil Aeronautics Board in the Allegheny-\n     Mohawk merger (as published at 59 CAB 45) shall apply to the \n     covered employees of the covered air carrier; and\n       (2) subject to paragraph (1), in a case in which a \n     collective bargaining agreement provides for the application \n     of sections 3 and 13 of the labor protective provisions in \n     the process of seniority integration for the covered \n     employees, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement \n     shall apply to the covered employees and shall not be \n     abrogated.\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\n       (e) Any aggrieved person (including any labor organization \n     that represents the person) may bring an action to enforce \n     this section, or the terms of any award or agreement \n     resulting from arbitration or a settlement relating to the \n     requirements of this section. The person may bring the action \n     in an appropriate Federal district court, determined in \n     accordance with section 1391 of title 28, United States Code, \n     without regard to the amount in controversy.\n       (f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \n     any provision of law that provides greater employee rights \n     than the rights established under this section.\n       (g) In this section:\n       (1) The term ``air carrier'' means an air carrier that \n     holds a certificate issued under chapter 411 of title 49, \n     United States Code.\n       (2) The term ``covered air carrier'' means an air carrier \n     that is involved in a covered transaction.\n       (3) The term ``covered employee'' means an employee who--\n       (A) is not a temporary employee;\n       (B) is a member of a craft or class that is subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.); and\n       (C) was an employee of a covered air carrier on April 1, \n     2003.\n       (4) The term ``covered transaction'' means a transaction \n     that--\n       (A) is a transaction for the combination of multiple air \n     carriers into a single air carrier;\n       (B) involves the transfer of ownership or control of--\n       (i) 50 percent or more of the equity securities (as defined \n     in section 101 of title 11, United States Code) of an air \n     carrier; or\n       (ii) 50 percent or more (by value) of the assets of the air \n     carrier;\n       (C) was pending, or had been completed, during the period \n     beginning on January 1, 2001 and ending on September 11, \n     2001; and\n       (D) did not result in the recognition of a single air \n     carrier by the National Mediation Board by September 11, \n     2001.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise, along with my colleagues, Senators \nBond, Clinton, and Schumer, to offer the Airline Workers Fairness Act, \nwith the hope of ensuring the fair and equitable resolution of labor \nintegration issues surrounding American Airlines and the former TWA. I \nwant to give the Senate a brief history of these issues.\n  American Airlines acquired TWA in April of 2001. We all thought that \nwas a good thing. We still hope it is a good thing. We supported it. At \nthe time, American Airlines promised TWA employees that they would be \ntreated fairly as a result of the buyout, and in fact that promise was \none of the conditions of Federal approval of the buyout. Certainly, our \nexpectation was that when the representative employee groups merged, \ntheir seniority lists would be dovetailed in the normal fashion. In \nother words, the years of service for TWA employees would count in the \nmerged company, and years of service for former American Airline \nemployees would count as well. For whatever reason, that didn't happen. \nIn fact, nothing even close to it happened.\n  The former TWA flight attendants were stapled to the bottom of the \nmerge seniority list, and most of the TWA pilots were stapled to the \nbottom of the seniority list. In all my years in public office and in \nthe years when I practiced labor law, I have never seen a merger that \nwas as disadvantageous to one of the former employee groups as this \none.\n  The effect of it is that employees who have been working for TWA for \ndecades are placed behind on the seniority list employees working for \nAmerican Airlines only a year or two. All you have to do is fly \nAmerican Airlines and be recognizable as a Member of Congress to see \nwhat the implications of this have been for real people.\n  I do not think I go on a flight where a flight attendant does not \ncome up to me and tell a story, such as she is a 28-year flight \nattendant for TWA who is now going to be laid off while people who have \nbeen working for American Airlines for only a year or two will be still \nflying.\n  A specific example: Sally Young, a former TWA captain who now works \nfor American Airlines whom I have met and talked with, is a 15-year \nveteran of TWA. She was demoted, because of seniority, from being a \ncaptain to a first officer, and now, after the recent layoffs were \nannounced, is scheduled to be laid off even though pilots who have been \nworking only a short time for American Airlines will continue to fly.\n  The result of this for the flight attendants is that there were 4,000 \nflight attendants who worked for TWA. By midsummer, all of them will be \ngone. These are people who have given their life to this company, \npeople who have mortgages, people who are at a stage in life where it \nis very difficult for them to retrain and find other employment. People \nwho were promised better, who clearly understood that in some way, \nshape, or form they would be protected in this buyout are going to be \ngone, and most of the pilots will be gone as well.\n  I am not here to blame anybody for this. It is an extraordinarily, \nuniquely disadvantageous situation. I do not know how it happened, but \nI know it is not right, and this amendment is designed to fix it in a \nfair and equitable fashion. It applies only to this merger.\n  It says that the parties will bargain for several weeks after this \namendment becomes effective, and if they cannot reach an agreement, \nthey will go to a neutral expert binding arbitration, and the \narbitrator can then decide what result will be fair in light of the \nsituation they are in now. These people who have worked for so long and \ngiven back so much over the years to keep this company afloat will have \nthe consideration that we all thought they would have had.\n  Those of us who are offering this amendment and supporting this \namendment would rather not do it on this vehicle. We would not have \ndone it on this vehicle, but the underlying bill provides several \nbillion dollars of extraordinary relief for the airline industry. We \nsupport that.\n  In addition, American Airlines announced several thousand more \nlayoffs earlier this year. If we do not do something soon, it will be \ntoo late to do anything. Certainly it will be too late to do anything \nas conveniently as it will be if we adopt this amendment.\n  Again, our amendment does not impose any Government solution on the \nparties. It costs no money. It affects no other airline and no other \nsituation. We are offering it now to provide some relief to a group of \npeople who expected and deserve better and who, unless we do something, \nare going to be out on the street. That is the reason we are offering \nthe amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment by \nmy colleague from Missouri. We are dealing with another very \nsignificant bailout, using taxpayers' money, for the airlines which \nhave been hurt.\n  I agree with the need to keep the airlines flying. Airlines are \nabsolutely essential to our economy. But I believe when we are sending \ntaxpayers' dollars to airlines, that we have at least some \nresponsibility to ensure the employees are being fairly treated. This, \nto me, is simply an issue of equity and fairness.\n  Back when American Airlines acquired TWA, they did not just take the \nairplanes. They took the hub, they took the facilities, and they took \nthe heart of TWA as well--its employees, employees we have come to know \nand respect and trust and whose service we have appreciated over the \nyears.\n  Since April 9, 2001, American Airlines and TWA have operated under a \nsingle umbrella. On that date, Donald J. Carty, chairman and CEO of \nAmerican Airlines, stated:\n\n       Today, we warmly welcome TWA's employees to the American \n     family. While employees and customers will see business-as-\n     usual for some time, we're looking forward to working \n     together and building a future as one team. Employees at \n     American and TWA are united in our commitment to meeting our \n     customers' needs and providing opportunities for growth in a \n     rewarding work environment. Our theme for today's \n     celebrations is ``Two Great Airlines--One Great Future,'' and \n     I'm sure that, working together, we can fulfill that promise.\n\n  I was out there and I joined in that recognition in celebrating two \ngreat airlines with one great future, and on January 1, 2002, all TWA \nemployees officially became American employees. At that moment, all \nformer TWA employees were now an integral part of the new team at \nAmerican Airlines.\n  Promises were made to the hard-working TWA employees in my home \nState, and these employees were publicly referred to as the crown jewel \nof TWA. It was not as if they were ``lucky to have a job at all,'' as \nsome have suggested. They are employees with extensive years of \nbackground and years of seniority over a great number of their \ncolleagues at American Airlines and, through their service to the \ntraveling public to our communities, had developed a reputation for \nservice that made this an extremely valuable hub.\n  Had they known that the promises were not going to be kept, there \nwere\n\n[[Page S4771]]\n\nother options--reorganizing in bankruptcy, seeking alliance with \nanother airline that would treat them fairly. They were made promises \nof fair treatment. They gave up what they call their Allegheny Mohawk \nprotection rights on the expressed promise that they would be treated \nfairly.\n  After American Airlines stapled the TWA seniority list to the bottom, \nat least the top official of American Airlines came to my office and \nsaid: We are going to protect the hub at St. Louis; we are going to put \na wall around that and keep former TWA employees serving the traveling \npublic out of that hub, and we are not going to have them laid off \nbecause they will continue the TWA service.\n  The wall came down. They were not protected. The crown jewel of TWA, \nthe people in St. Louis, are losing their glitter. These promises made \nto them were the root of the entire agreement reached between TWA and \nAmerican Airlines back when this whole deal was going down, and now \nthese promises appear to have been broken.\n  If the TWA employees knew at the beginning they were merely being \ntaken as a sacrificial lamb, then the deal would likely never have \nhappened. Now the TWA employees, the TWA pilots, and the TWA flight \nattendants are the blood donors when cuts have to be made.\n  According to today's issue of the St. Louis Post Dispatch:\n\n       All American Airlines flight attendants based at Lambert \n     Field will lose their jobs if members of the Association of \n     Professional Flight Attendants approve a contract by April 15 \n     to help the airline avoid bankruptcy.\n\n  That is what we are providing money to support?\n  The situation for former TWA pilots is grim as well. Fifty-four \npercent of former TWA pilots will lose their job before a single former \nAmerican Airlines pilot will lose his or her job because they were \nsimply stapled to the bottom of the seniority list.\n  After planned furloughs, there will only be 565 former TWA employees \nremaining. To help everyone with the math, that is 76 percent of the \nformer TWA pilots and 100 percent of TWA flight attendants in St. Louis \nwho will lose their jobs. They are literally cutting off the family \ncrown jewel.\n  The senior most TWA pilot hired in 1963 was integrated along with a \n1985 hire from American Airlines. That is almost 22 years later, and \nguess which one is on the chopping block first? Promises made in \nfairness have not been achieved.\n  In this supplemental bill, we are poised to provide our airlines with \n$3.5 million to keep them in the air. With that assistance, more \nlayoffs are coming. We must act before more of our talented and \nqualified employees are let go before junior colleagues within the same \norganization.\n  The choice before this body is simple: Support the Talent-Bond \namendment and you support fairness, or oppose the Talent-Bond amendment \nand you decide with the bosses who are strong arming weaker unions, \nresulting in an extremely unfair integration of two great airlines and \none great future. About 5,000 jobs are at stake.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this fair integration \nproposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the amendment. \nI respect my colleagues, Senator Talent and Senator Bond very much. I \nam very sad and very sorry about the situation with the TWA employees. \nIt was a difficult situation when TWA was in bankruptcy. A number of \nairlines sought to take over TWA. American was the one that was willing \nto do it.\n  There were agreements made at the time. American offered to preserve \nthe jobs and pensions of the TWA employees at the time if the unions \nwould agree to waive their seniority rights from TWA. That was the \nagreement. If American had not stepped up to the plate, all of the TWA \npilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and ticket agents would have lost \ntheir jobs immediately and their pension funds would have been wiped \nout. Instead, American not only persevered their jobs but fully funded \nthe TWA pension funds.\n  Everyone hoped the aviation industry would recover and that everyone \nwould stay employed. It is still the hope of every American employee \nthat the TWA former employees who have been laid off will be hired \nback. American is committed to hire back former TWA employees before \nanyone else.\n  However, the TWA employees took this matter to the National Mediation \nBoard. The National Mediation Board has rendered a decision reinforcing \nthe original agreement. TWA's pilots and flight attendants have \nappealed. That is their right.\n  This case is still in litigation. It is completely inappropriate to \nbog down a wartime appropriations bill with language that would attempt \nto pit winners and losers in a battle between unions or between any \nunion and management.\n  This amendment is coming at a time when American's unions are set to \nvote on the most significant cost restructuring proposal in U.S. \nhistory, with $1.8 billion in proposed union concessions. Interference \nwith these negotiations at this time could impact that vote and push \nthe world's largest airline into bankruptcy. Of course, if that \nhappens, everyone at American, not just the former TWA employees, could \nlose their jobs.\n  I do sympathize, and I hope very much the little bailout that we are \ngiving the aviation industry, will result in American staying strong \nand being able to hire back everyone who has had to be laid off. That \nis the purpose of the bill today.\n  Regretfully, I must raise a point of order and offer an objection to \namendment No. 499 on the grounds that it is legislation on an \nappropriations bill and thus violates rule 16, paragraph 4 of the \nSenate rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 499 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President as cosponsor of this amendment, I ask the \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 500\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have discussed this matter with my good \nfriend from Texas, who is very understanding. I believe the sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment which we have prepared essentially states some of \nthe findings in perhaps less colorful language than I have described \nbut encourages American Airlines, or tells American Airlines to \nencourage its employee groups to integrate all employees in a manner \nthat is fair and equitable for all parties involved. I send that \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments are set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] for Mr. Talent, for \n     himself, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 500.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate regarding procedures that \nensure the fair and equitable resolution of labor integration issues in \n           transactions for the combination of air carriers)\n\n       At the end of title IV, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the asset acquisition of Trans World Airlines by \n     American Airlines was a positive action that should be \n     commended;\n       (2) although the acquisition was a positive action, the \n     combination of the 2 airlines has resulted in a difficult \n     seniority integration for the majority of the employee groups \n     involved;\n       (3) airline layoffs from American Airlines should be \n     conducted in a manner that maintains the maximum level of \n     fairness and equitable treatment for all parties involved; \n     and\n       (4) American Airlines should encourage its employee groups \n     to integrate all employees in a a manner that is fair and \n     equitable for all parties involved.\n\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that a number of \nSenators want to speak for a brief time on the amendment the Senator \nfrom Missouri sent to the desk that is now pending. I ask they be \nallowed to speak on this amendment but that no action be taken until we \nhave had a chance to review it on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I will speak briefly. First, I commend my \nfriend and colleague from Missouri for his work on this issue for \nseveral years and his consistent advocacy for fairness to all the \nemployees of American Airlines. I also express my deep gratitude to our \nfriend and colleague from Texas for how she has worked with us on this \namendment and indeed on this whole issue within, of course, the limits \nof her convictions.\n  Briefly, this situation is not easy for anyone and I recognize that. \nI emphasize that there are thousands of people who are in a uniquely \ndifficult situation, people with 10, 15, 20 years seniority with a \ncompany. When you get that kind of seniority with a company, you order \nyour life so far as it is job related, on the assumption that unless \nthe company goes down--in this case, stops flying--you are not going to \nbe laid off. You do that in terms of your financial affairs; you get \nmortgages; you make arrangements with your kids and their college \neducation. Thousands of people worked for TWA for years and years and \nyears and did that.\n  Then something happened. I don't know what happened; I was not there. \nThe people who were supposed to represent their interests in this \nprocess--management, the union, the government--for some reason did \nnot. Their interests were not represented. As a result, they are now \nfacing layoffs contrary to all their expectations.\n  I support the Senator's sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I hope it \nmeans as we continue to represent those interests we will have some \nchance along the process to get fairness for these people who expect \nbetter and deserve better and who have worked so hard in giving so much \nto this company for so long.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I certainly support the sense of the \nSenate. We all want fair treatment. If the aviation industry had stayed \nviable and we had a good economy, I believe every employee would have \nmaintained their employment status and there would have been more \nhires. However, we all know the economy is in a very precarious \nsituation. The aviation industry has been hit hard since September 11, \nparticularly American. And they do not want these layoffs. That is the \nonly alternative they have.\n  I know the first people hired back when business picks up are going \nto be these employees who have been laid off. I certainly support the \nsense of the Senate. We all want fair treatment for all of the \nemployees of American Airlines.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Feinstein has been waiting here all \nday. She has a speech she wants to give and an amendment to offer. This \nwill not be part of the voting in 45 minutes because she and Senator \nStevens have been in discussions about how to resolve this issue.\n  If I could have Senator Cochran's attention, Senator Byrd is here. \nYou and Senator Breaux used up all the time on the amendment, the \nBreaux amendment pending, which we will vote on at quarter to 5. \nSenator Byrd will ask for up to 15 minutes to speak in favor of the \nBreaux amendment. We have no objection to that.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection to that request, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nCalifornia be recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Following that speech, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nByrd be recognized to speak in favor of the Breaux amendment for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I was going to call up an amendment \nabout interoperable communications, but the text of our amendment is \nbeing worked out by the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember. I believe it is going to be successfully worked out, so I would \nlike to say a few words about what I would like to see happen.\n  This emergency supplemental provides $2 billion through the Office of \nDomestic Prepareness for State and local governments and first \nresponders for homeland security.\n  It also states in the Conference Report that $30 million of the $2 \nbillion should go to provide ``technical assistance to States for a \nvariety of activities'' and mentions ``assistance with interoperable \ncommunications and equipment'' as one such activity.\n  But nowhere is there a specific earmark for interoperable \ncommunications, and none of the $30 million mentioned for ``technical \nasssistance'' will go directly to the people who need it most--\npolicemen, firefighters, and emergency assistance personnel.\n  And even if some fraction of the $30 million does trickle down to \npublic safety first responders, this is simply not enough to make a \ndent in the problem.\n  There are, today, about 2.5 million public safety first responders \noperating in the U.S., located at 18,000 law enforcement agencies, \n26,000 fire departments, 6,000 rescue departments, and many other \nagencies as well.\n  They have historically depended on their own radio systems, even \nthough sometimes these systems are often incompatible with other \nagencies with whom they work.\n  As a result, law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency medical \nservice (EMS) teams can't talk to each other.\n  For example, while police received a radio message that the World \nTrade Center was going to collapse on September 11, firefighters never \nreceived the message because they use different radios.\n  A report from the University of New Hampshire-based ATLAS Project \nstates:\n\n       From numerous interviews gathered as part of a fire \n     department inquiry into the events of September 11th, it \n     would appear that non-interoperability was at least partially \n     responsible for the loss of 343 firefighters at the World \n     Trade Center.\n\n  According to an article in The New York Times on January 30, 2002, \nthe New York Fire Department's most senior commanders report that:\n\n     they had little reliable radio communications that morning, \n     could not keep track of all of the firefighters who entered \n     the towers and were unable to reach them as the threat of \n     collapse became unmistakeable. . . . So poor were \n     communications that on one side of the trade center complex . \n     . . a city engineer warned officials that the towers were at \n     risk of ``imminent collapse.'' Those he told could not reach \n     the highest-ranking fire chief by radio. A messenger was sent \n     across, dodging flaming debris and falling bodies, to deliver \n     it in person. He arrived with the news less than a minute \n     before the first tower fell.\n\n  Let me give some other examples.\n  Interoperability was also a problem at both the Littleton, Colorado \nshooting spree at Columbine High School. During that horrific attack, \nover 2000 students and teachers were effectively held hostage and 15 \nwere killed and 23 wounded.\n  Forty-six separate agencies responded during the incident. Many of \nthese responders were operating on different emergency radio channels, \nand in different parts of the radio spectrum. Some operated on VHF \nfrequencies, some on an Ericsson 800 megahertz system, some on an \nanalog 800 megahertz system, and some on a digital 800 megahertz \ntrunked system.\n  According to an internal report by the Jefferson County Sheriff's \nOffice:\n\n       With such varying systems being used, not only were \n     agencies prevented from communicating directly with each \n     other, but groups with similar functions also could not \n     communicate via radio. Ideally, groups with the same \n     responsibility, such as the various SWAT teams or those \n     officers setting up inner or outer perimeters would have \n     their own channel to use in order to report and obtain vital \n     information about their particular area.\n\n  In the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, the Federal, State, \nand local first responder agencies also couldn't talk to each other.\n  Things were so bad that agencies resorted to using ``runners'' to \ncarry\n\n[[Page S4773]]\n\nmessages from one command center to another. To ensure that all \nagencies were on the same page, these runners often had to run between \ndifferent agencies repeating the same message.\n  This is the same method of communication used thousands of years ago \nby the ancient Greeks and Romans. We all know--Senator Byrd \nespecially--the story from 490 B.C. of the man who ran 26 miles from \nthe plains of Marathon to the city of Athens to report victory in the \nBattle of Marathon and warn the people in the city of impending attack. \nIn some ways, we are no better off today, 2,500 years later.\n  It is outrageous that our emergency communications systems can be \nreduced to levels that existed 2\\1/2\\ millennia ago.\n  And even if runners are not needed to transit messages physically \nfrom agency to agency, lack of interoperability can still spell \ndisaster.\n  Lack of interoperability always means that precious minutes are lost \nand lives are put at risk.\n  The bottom line is that Congress has not provided enough money for \ninteroperable communications--and that means we are needlessly \njeopardizing the safety of our public safety first responders and the \ncitizens of our country.\n  The fiscal year 2003 appropriations bill only provides $45 million in \ndedicated money for interoperable communications--only $12 million of \nwhich is likely to go directly to first responders. Twenty million \ndollars was given to the COPS program for interoperability, but $8 \nmillion of this amount was earmarked for other purposes--$5 million to \nthe National Institute of Standards to develop minimum standards and $3 \nmillion for research and development through the National Institute of \nJustice's Advanced Generation of Interoperability for Law Enforcement--\nAGILE--program.\n  Another $25 million was given to FEMA under the Emergency Management \nPlanning and Assistance account. However, my staff has been told that \nthis money will probably go to State emergency management agencies.\n  There is another $400 million for equipment grants and $750 million \nfor fire grants, but only some of this could be used for interoperable \ncommunications. There was only about $50 million set aside specifically \nfor interoperable communications in fiscal year 2002.\n  And I mentioned earlier, that there is $30 million in the \nsupplemental for ``technical assistance'' to the States, some of which \ncould be used for interoperable communications.\n  In my view, providing only $12 million in dedicated money directly \nfor first responders for fiscal year 2003 is simply not enough.\n  We have talked with the International Chiefs of Police. We have \ntalked with all the national firefighting and first responding \norganizations. They are all strongly in support of increasing this \namount.\n  I must tell you, I am delighted that both the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the ranking member have responded, and I \nam assured there will be added, in the managers' package, an additional \namount which will go directly to first responders.\n  Now, let me make one point. I recently heard from a Los Angeles city \ncouncilman, Jack Weiss, about one potential solution. It is a device \ncalled ACU-1000, which is also available in a mobile version called the \nFirst Responder Vehicle. ACU-1000 is manufactured by JPS \nCommunications, which is owned by Raytheon.\n  Now, here is how the First Responder Vehicle works: They take an SUV, \nand fill it with software that converts the different frequencies into \na compatible network that allows first responders, using different \ncommunication devices, to talk to each other. So a local community, \nsuch as one of yours, I say to the Presiding Officer, or one of mine, \ncan purchase this vehicle for $150,000 to $200,000 and thus allow first \nresponders to coordinate using diverse, incompatible communications \nsystems.\n  A public safety first responder will drive the SUV to an emergency. \nThen Federal agency, State agencies, local agencies, the National \nGuard, police officers and firefighters can all talk to one another. \nThis can be done for as little as $150,000 a unit.\n  While my amendment is for $400 million, I am hopeful that as much as \nthe chairman and the ranking member believe is possible can be \nappropriated and earmarked for interoperable communications in the \nsupplemental and go directly to these first responding communities.\n  I also ask that the Record reflect that Senator Mikulski, Senator \nDodd, Senator Durbin, and Senator Dayton are also very concerned about \nthis issue and that they worked on the amendment with me. I thank them \nall very much.\n  The bottom line is that it is easy to solve this problem and that \nsolving the problem is going to save lives. If you are going to protect \nthe homeland, you have to enable those who first respond to a major \ncrisis to be able to communicate.\n  Once again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for working \nwith me to include money for interoperable communications in the \nsupplemental. I look forward to this issue being resolved in the \nmanager's package, but I would like to reserve the right, in the event \nsomething goes wrong, to call up the amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from California. I particularly \nthank her for bringing this issue to the attention of the Senate. I ask \nunanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter from the Governor of Louisiana and a \nletter from Louisiana's Department of Public Safety and Corrections. \nThose documents substantiate the statement outlined by the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               State of Louisiana,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                      Baton Rouge, March 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mary: I am writing to request that the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee report to accompany the Fiscal Year \n     2004, Commerce, Justice and State, the Judiciary and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, include language in the Law \n     Enforcement Technology Program account to provide $7 million \n     for one-time equipment costs necessary to upgrade Louisiana's \n     statewide 800 MHz SmartZone public safety communication \n     system.\n       This system is operated by the Louisiana State Police and \n     utilized by 75 other state and local agencies including \n     numerous sheriffs' departments, the Louisiana National Guard, \n     the U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Coast \n     Guard, among others.\n       The existing 800 MHz system is an analog one, designed over \n     15 years ago. The existing system has numerous gaps in \n     statewide coverage. Upgrading to the digital system would \n     eliminate statewide communications coverage gaps. The \n     existing system is also limited in terms of communications \n     interoperability. The digital system upgrade would greatly \n     enhance communications interoperability. The requested system \n     upgrade would measurably assist the public safety agencies in \n     Louisiana who provide the bulk of the first responder, \n     investigative follow-up (in case of terrorism, or other \n     manmade disasters) and consequence management efforts in \n     emergency situations.\n       The move to a digital capable system allows the state to \n     build on the existing MHz infrastructure by reusing a large \n     percentage of the hardware at the existing sites. These sites \n     would be upgraded to allow for digital communications. New \n     sites would be added to enhance coverage for the users. With \n     the capability to add more sites and improve coverage and \n     audio clarity, the ability to interoperate with other public \n     safety agencies would be greatly enhanced, thus providing \n     more agencies the capability of communications during a \n     disaster recovery effort.\n       The state of Louisiana and local governments have invested \n     approximately $42,500,000 in infrastructure and subscriber \n     units for the statewide system. Your assistance in \n     appropriating the necessary federal funds for the new digital \n     communications upgrade will be greatly appreciated by the \n     state of Louisiana, public safety community and those whom we \n     serve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        M.J. ``Mike'' Foster, Jr.,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Department of Public\n\n\n                                       Safety and Corrections,\n\n                                  Baton Rouge, LA, March 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: The Governor of Louisiana, M.J. \n     ``Mike'' Foster, Jr. has sent\n\n[[Page S4774]]\n\n     a letter to you dated March 14, 2003 requesting that the \n     House Appropriations Committee report to accompany the Fiscal \n     Year 2004, Commerce, Justice and State, the Judiciary and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, include language in the \n     Law Enforcement Technology Program account to provide $7 \n     million for one-time equipment costs necessary to upgrade \n     Louisiana's statewide 800 MHz SmartZone public safety \n     communication system. In addition, as Deputy Secretary of the \n     Department of Public Safety Services, Superintendent of \n     Louisiana State Police, and as the largest user of this \n     lifeline communications network I am also asking for your \n     support.\n       This system is operated by the Louisiana State Police and \n     utilized by 75 other state and local agencies including \n     numerous sheriffs' departments, the Louisiana National Guard, \n     the U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Coast \n     Guard, among others.\n       The existing 800 MHz system is an analog one, designed over \n     15 years ago. The existing system has numerous gaps in \n     statewide coverage. Upgrading to the digital system would \n     eliminate statewide communications coverage gaps. The \n     existing system is also limited in terms of communications \n     interoperability. The digital system upgrade would greatly \n     enhance communications interoperability. The requested system \n     upgrade would measurably assist the public safety agencies in \n     Louisiana who provide the bulk of the first responder, \n     investigate follow-up (in case of terrorism, or other manmade \n     disasters) and consequence management efforts in emergency \n     situations.\n       The move to a digital capable system allows the State to \n     build on the existing 800 MHz infrastructure by reusing a \n     large percentage of the hardware at the existing sites. These \n     sites would be upgraded to allow for digital communications. \n     New sites would be added to enhance coverage for the users. \n     With the capability to add more sites, improve coverage and \n     audio clarity the ability to interoperate with other public \n     safety agencies would be greatly enhanced thus providing more \n     agencies the capability of communications during a disaster \n     recovery effort.\n       As mentioned in the Governor's letter the State of \n     Louisiana and local governments have invested approximately \n     $42,500,000 in infrastructure and subscriber units for the \n     statewide system. Your assistance in appropriating the \n     necessary federal funds for the new digital communications \n     upgrade will be greatly appreciated by the State of \n     Louisiana, public safety community and those whom we serve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Col. Terry C. Landry,\n                                  Deputy Secretary/Superintendent.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Senator from California is \nabsolutely correct, that even with the finest training, law \nenforcement, on the ground--and of which they are doing a better job \nevery day--as they step up their training to address these new threats, \nall of that training is for naught if they cannot communicate with each \nother. There are some real challenges in our communication ability.\n  The Senator is absolutely correct, with just a small investment, the \ncurrent communications systems could be made more operable.\n  I conclude by saying to the Senator from California that this was one \nof the first requests asked of the Mayor of DC and the city council \nhere as they experienced the attack on September 11. It has been on the \ntop of the list of law enforcement from Louisiana.\n  I am pleased to join her as a cosponsor. I thank her for her \nleadership.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana. I appreciate that. I was a mayor for 9 years. I required all \nof the departments to have portable radios. Every Monday we would test \ntheir radio systems at 7:30 because, in the event of an earthquake, at \nthat time there was no other way for all the city departments to talk \nto one another except over a radio system. So I know firsthand the \nimportance of interoperable communications.\n  I appreciate the comments. Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I remind Senators we are going to come up \non a series of votes soon. This bill is a bill the President asked us \nto move quickly on to provide moneys for the ongoing events in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and the war on terrorism. We are now being besieged by \namendments for homeland security. As a matter of fact, we have been \nbesieged by homeland security amendments as long as I can remember.\n  The problem is, apparently there is an assumption here on the floor \nthat the Federal Government is responsible for every single dime spent \nby any city or county or State in the interest of security. I always \nthought this was a mutual security society, and the cities and States \nand counties did what all they could do, and we would follow up and do \nthe balance. Now it seems we are getting to the point where we are \nasked to provide each city, each State, each county with the full cost, \nnot only of their systems for security against terrorism, but for their \novertime.\n  I again ask the Senate, how much overtime are the people out in the \ndesert in Iraq getting? How much overtime are the people right here on \nthe floor, who are going to be working late tonight, getting? And they \nare going to be working over the weekend. It is high time people \nrealized, I will not support financing every city, every town, every \ncounty, every State for every dime they say they need for homeland \nsecurity. I think we should wake up. There is just so much that can be \nput on the Federal taxpayer.\n  We are running an enormous deficit. On the one hand, my colleagues on \nthat side of the aisle are beating on this President every day for a \ndeficit, yet there isn't one amendment here that doesn't go billions \nabove the request the President made. What for? For war. Not for \nhomeland security. There is a very small amount for homeland security. \nIt was associated with moneys that were necessary to prosecute the war.\n\n  Now we are going to the total concept of homeland security, whatever \nit may be. Politically it may be good. I expect to read about these in \n2004 in every single spot combating anyone over here who voted with me \nto table these amendments. I hope the American public wakes up to what \nis going on. I don't think the average person working for wages expects \ntheir money they pay into the Treasury is going to be used to pay \novertime money in every city, every State, every village in this \ncountry.\n  When I inquired about several of these amounts, I was told they were \nto pay overtime. We have not accepted those amendments. We will \ncontinue to oppose them. Any campaign I hear about in 2004 where any of \nour people are attacked for votes made here, I will pay my own expense \nand go defend them. I will defend them and tell the American public \nwhat is right.\n  Everyone ought to be part of homeland security. There ought to be \nvolunteerism. There should be people paid by the cities, by the \ncounties, by the States, and by the Federal Government. We are \nproviding the money for the Federal people. This bill is full of money \nto pay those who are in Federal employment to increase the level of \nhomeland security. But what we are hearing now is that every city wants \nmore. Every State wants more. It is time we realize we ought to have a \ndebate about this in terms of what is the Federal policy.\n  I remember we used to have debates about federalism and what it \nmeans. It doesn't mean the Federal taxpayer pays every dime everyone \nwants in order to get ready for a potential terrorist attack. I have \nsaid this before. I had one mayor from a very small village in my State \nask me to help him to get a new fire truck for homeland security. When \nI looked into it, I found out they didn't have a fire station. As a \nmatter of fact, most of the roads weren't paved. This concept that \neverybody is going to get part of the money we put up for homeland \nsecurity, I believe, is wrong.\n\n  As we vote, I hope the Members on my side stand up and be counted in \nterms of protecting this bill that the President wants. I keep hearing \nwe have a war going on. Well, I see three wars out there, and I don't \nknow how long any one of them is going to go.\n  The President deserves our support. Our people in uniform deserve our \nsupport, and the people fighting in Iraq are not the primary concern of \nhomeland security. This bill is. This is a bill for supplemental \nassistance for national defense and a very small amount\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\nfor homeland defense--$4.6 billion out of almost $78 billion. Yet we \nare spending most of our time on the floor debating adding to the $4.6 \nbillion. I hope that does not go on much longer. As a matter of fact, \nit isn't going to go on much longer because I am not going to continue \nto accept amendments that are directed toward just beefing up homeland \nsecurity for political purposes. I accepted the amendment of the \nSenator from Florida when he cut it down to five-sevenths of what he \nwanted, and we fund it after the balance of this year.\n\n\n                           PFC Jessica Lynch\n\n  This gets to the point where I would like to talk about something \nelse for a minute. I mentioned before today that I read in this \nmorning's paper the tremendous story of one of our brave young \nsoldiers, PFC Jessica Lynch. I asked my staff to look up more about \nher.\n  As we all know from reading the papers, she is 19 years old. She is a \nsupply clerk with the Army's 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company \nsupporting the 3rd Infantry Division advancing toward Baghdad. I am \nsure Senator Byrd knows that PFC Lynch is from Palestine, WV. I know he \njoins me in recognizing this brave young woman.\n  I remember so well standing on the floor of the Senate years ago, \nwhen we had the draft, urging that we extend the draft so it covered \neverybody who was 19, male and female. That was defeated. People \nthought that young women should not be in combat at all. This young \nwoman shows what happens when a brave, young American woman is in \ncombat.\n  She was taken captive, as we all know, by Iraqi forces on March 23, \nafter her company was ambushed near the southern city of Nasiriyah. She \nwas rescued Tuesday from an Iraqi hospital after 8 days in captivity. \nIt was obvious that the hotel had been used as a military command post. \nShe suffered two broken legs, a broken arm, and at least one gunshot \nwound during her ordeal. They found her at her position and the \nmagazine on her gun was empty. Most of the people in her detail had \nbeen killed. She survived.\n  I think this is a tremendous example of the young people who are \ninvolved in this war. She is the first POW to be rescued since World \nWar II, Mr. President. I believe it is something I would like the \nSenate to think about for a moment. We commend the outstanding work of \nour Special Forces and the other units involved in the joint operation, \nincluding Marines and Army Rangers, who rescued this young woman. I \nthink their efforts are a demonstration of our military's commitment to \nnever leave a soldier behind.\n  We have invested a great deal in the Special Forces. Just recently, I \nflew to Tampa and visited with Special Forces Command. We will continue \nto rely on their expertise. This recent success is proof that our \ninvestment is paying dividends in saving American lives, and it \ndemonstrates the critical need of Congress to continue to support \nAmerica's Special Forces and to support this bill and get this bill to \nthe President as soon as possible.\n\n  Above all, I want to commend Jessica Lynch for her commitment to this \ncountry, her patriotism, her courage, and to thank her for her \noutstanding service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we all know the President pro tempore of the \nSenate, the manager of this bill, is one of the great legislators in \nthe history of this body. We also believe we have been acting \nresponsibly on this side of the aisle during the last 2 days. We have \nbeen admonished for 2 weeks now by the Democratic leader that we must \nfinish the bill this week.\n  We have tried to be responsible with the amendments we have offered. \nWe have negotiated with the Senator from Alaska and his staff in good \nfaith, and we have been able to work out some very big amendments, I \nthink, to the betterment of this country.\n  We have not tried in any way to alter the financial package that is \ngoing to the President that relates to the military. I have told the \nSenator from Alaska, and anyone else who would listen, that I am \ngrateful he was able to put in the bill something that will help \nbolster the airline industry in this country, which badly needs help.\n  But we also believe on this side of the aisle--and I personally \nsupport all $9 billion that the President has put in this bill for \nforeign aid--that if we can get $9 billion for foreign aid, we can \nreexamine what is being done for homeland security, and that is in \neffect what we are doing--reexamining what is taking place in the bill \nrelating to homeland security.\n  So the Democratic leader and all the Senators on this side of the \naisle are committed to finishing the bill tonight. We understand the \nimportance of it. Nobody should criticize any of the amendments that we \nhave filed. They have been responsible, targeted, and they are not \npolitical in nature. They are responsible in nature.\n  Before I yield the floor, the Senator from Mississippi is here. It is \nmy understanding that we are going to have a vote in about 7 minutes. \nThe Senator from Louisiana has an amendment to offer that has been \nworked out on the other side. I think it would be to everyone's \nadvantage that we go to her until the vote. There will not be a vote \nrequired on her amendment.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I don't have first-hand knowledge of the \nagreement with respect to the Senator's amendment. I assume this is the \nMerchant Marine amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection to her proceeding until we vote at \n4:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, before I send my amendment to the desk, \nI want to take a point of personal privilege and comment on the remarks \nmade by the Senator from Alaska and tell him how much I and many women \nand many men appreciate them. They were heartfelt and they were right \non target, and they were sincere, and they were very meaningful on this \nday, as we all read about the extraordinary event of the last 48 hours \nin which this young soldier was rescued and returned safely to her unit \nand will be, ultimately, to her family.\n  As the first Democratic woman to ever serve on the Armed Services \nCommittee in the Senate, following in the footsteps of Margaret Chase \nSmith; the Senators from Maine, Ms. Snowe and Ms. Collins, I am \nparticularly appreciative of the support of the Senator from Alaska and \nother members who have, year after year, argued--and I think \nsuccessfully, as the record will show--that women can most certainly \nmake extraordinary contributions to the strength of our military in \nmany different ways. We have all been proud as we have watched the \nlevel of contribution grow over time and, most certainly as this war \nunfolds before our eyes, we are reminded again of the continued bravery \nand skill and expertise of the women who are serving at the highest \nlevels of our military and challenging the notions that women can serve \nbut not on the front lines, or women can serve but not in this \ncapacity, that women can serve but not here. I think those glass \nceilings are shattering, and women are showing themselves to be, as we \nall know, the brave and courageous individuals who help us strengthen \nour military and strengthen every aspect of our national life.\n\n  I thank the Senator for his comments and for his leadership and add \nmy own voice to the progress we are making on that issue.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 504\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration and a vote on it at whatever time the \nmanagers believe will be convenient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself and \n     Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 504.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To make applicable provisions of law requiring the use of \n     privately owned United States flag commercial vessels for the \n            transportation of U.S. Aid and other materials)\n\n       At the end of chapter 2 of title I, add the following:\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\n       Sec. 210. No provision of this Act may be construed as \n     altering or amending the force or effect of any of the \n     following provisions of law:\n       (1) Sections 2631 and 2531a of title 10, United States \n     Code.\n       (2) Sections 901(b) and 901b of the Merchant Marine Act, \n     1936 (46 U.S.C. App. 1241(b), 1241f).\n       (3) Public Resolution Numbered 17, Seventy-third Congress \n     (48 Stat. 500).\n       (4) Any other similar provision of law requiring the use of \n     privately owned United States flag commercial vessels for \n     certain transportation purposes of the United States.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand this amendment has been \nagreed to on both sides. I brought this issue up in committee and was \nasked specifically by the leadership to wait until the bill was before \nthe Senate to discuss it. I understand the amendment has already been \nworked out.\n  It is an amendment that merely restates current law regarding the \nmerchant marines. There is in this bill a very broad waiver that the \nPresident may furnish assistance under this heading, notwithstanding \nany provision of law, dealing with provision of aid, cargo, and \nsupplies that we are sending to Iraq. I do not think it is the \nintention of the President to use this broad waiver to diminish or to \ncircumvent current law regarding the merchant marines which would, of \ncourse, have the effect of giving a preference, and rightly so, to \nvessels sailing under the American flag with American crews.\n  As you understand and as the Senate is well aware, in the drafting of \nthis amendment, there is an exception in the event of an emergency; \nthere is an exception in the event that the particular cargo could be \nshipped at a less expensive price if the rates are not competitive. All \nfour sections of the law that we cite in our amendment have national \nsecurity waivers.\n  The cargo preference is only 50 percent, which gives the President \nthe flexibility he needs in the event that a foreign carrier is \nnecessary, and with DOD cargo, the President can also look at cost, as \nI said, to ensure that fair and reasonable rates are being charged.\n  I hope this amendment that Senator Mikulski and I offer for the \nconsideration of the Senate will be accepted. It is very important for \nmany reasons to support our merchant marines, particularly at a time \nwhen American taxpayers have really stepped up to the plate in their \nsupport of this war effort and will pick up a huge share of the \nreconstruction of Iraq. It only makes sense that we also extend and \nrestate in this supplemental appropriations our intention not to waive, \nunless absolutely necessary, the current law regarding cargo shipments \nin this time of war and also post conflict.\n  At the appropriate time, I will ask for either a vote or the proper \ndisposition of this amendment. It is very important to many Members of \nthe Senate but is something that can be supported in a bipartisan way.\n  In additional support of this amendment, it does not cost anything. I \nknow there are Members who say every amendment that has come to the \nfloor has added money to the bill. This does not add any money to the \nbill. It is not offered to attempt to slow down the bill. It is simply \noffered to make sure that our merchant marines and the laws governing \nflags, the vessels, and the crews of the ships that will be carrying a \nlot of this cargo follow the law as it is today and only grant the \nwaiver to the President and give him broad flexibility under certain \nguidelines unless there is an emergency or cost is involved.\n  At the appropriate time, I will ask for a vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 494\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the vote on the motion to \ntable the Breaux amendment No. 494.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The yeas and nays have been ordered, I think, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 494. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``no.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 119 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Inouye\n     Kerry\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is 5:20 now, and I want to update \nMembers where we are pending the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The chairman has been here throughout the day working on amendments. \nWe have made outstanding progress, if you take yesterday and today. We \nhave had some amendments agreed to by voice vote. Some have been \nwithdrawn and, as you know, we have had a number of rollcall votes.\n  I do want to ask our Members, as much as possible, to show restraint \nand not feel compelled to offer every single amendment. I believe every \nMember in this body does understand the urgency, that it is absolutely \nimperative we pass this bill. It is an emergency bill. It is an \nemergency supplemental bill. We need to do it in a responsible way. And \nwe need to do it expeditiously.\n  I once again ask for the cooperation of all Members in allowing us to \nmove forward on this bill, which we will do, so we can keep moving in a \nprogressively advancing way and finish this bill this evening.\n  We are going to stay in session until we finish this bill tonight. We \nwill stay in as late as it takes to get this bill through to final \npassage. I hope it will not necessitate being here for hours and hours \nand hours, but it means we, as a body, must look at the individual \namendments, come forward with some restraint, and understand the \nimportance of finishing this bill in a responsible but expeditious way.\n  I do want to be clear that Senators should be prepared to be here \nuntil we have final passage sometime tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have asked Members to stay who have \namendments they might wish to consider. If the Senator from Nevada is \nprepared, we could go through some of those and see what the time \nconstraints may be in getting the bill finished tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am in the process of working. During the \nvote, I was not able to contact everyone. If we could go to the next \namendment, it would be better in a few minutes from now.\n  We have been able to work quite well with Members who have offered \namendments, amendments that others have offered. We still have a number \nof amendments Senators want to offer. I could go over those now if the \nSenator wanted. We are down to about half a dozen amendments over here.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4777]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

nationally significant \n     facilities.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could direct a question to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, I forgot that the Senator from Louisiana has been \nhere all day. She has 5 minutes on an amendment that is agreed upon. \nThere would be no vote on it. I apologize because it is my fault \ntotally. Would the Senator from West Virginia allow the Senator from \nLouisiana to proceed for up to 4 minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Byrd amendment be \ntemporarily set aside and that the Senator from Louisiana be allowed to \noffer her amendment and to speak up to 4 minutes and then we would \nreturn to the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 504, As Modified\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk with a \nmodification suggested by Senator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 504), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of chapter 2 of title I, add the following:\n       Sec. 210. No provision of this Act may be construed as \n     altering or amending the force or effect of any of the \n     following provisions of law as currently applied:\n       (1) Sections 2631 and 2631a of title 10, United States \n     Code.\n       (2) Sections 901(b) and 901b of the Merchant Marine Act, \n     1936 (46 U.S.C. App. 1241(b), 1241f).\n       (3) Public Resolution Numbered 17, Seventy-third Congress \n     (48 Stat. 500).\n       (4) Any other similar provision of law requiring the use of \n     privately owned United States flag commercial vessels for \n     certain transportation purposes of the United States.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for yielding for \na few moments because I understand this amendment has been worked out.\n  This amendment simply clarifies the underlying bill. It doesn't add a \npenny to the bill. It seeks to clarify the waiver given to the \nPresident that will mirror the current law regarding U.S. flagships. It \ndoesn't add any new legislation to the law. It simply clarifies the \ngeneral waiver provisions in the supplemental provision, that the same \nlaw in effect today will remain in effect for the Military Cargo \nPreference Act. I understand it has been agreed to. I submit the \namendment for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 508\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I sent to the desk an amendment and I asked \nunanimous consent that further reading be dispensed with, which was \ngranted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Hollings be \nmade a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on March 25, 2003, the President sent to \nCongress a $74.7 billion supplemental appropriations request for \n``urgent and essential requirements'' for the costs of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and for the global war on terrorism. In his request, the \nPresident sought an unprecedented level of flexibility in the use of \nthose funds. This request was not only for the Secretary of Defense for \nthe prosecution of the war in Iraq but also for the Secretary of \nHomeland Security and for the Attorney General.\n  While I understand the unique circumstance in which the Nation finds \nitself, the situation is not entirely without precedent. We have been \nat war before. We have faced earthquakes and we have faced floods \nbefore. We have faced economic crises before. But the need to confront \na crisis in a thoughtful or nimble way does not mandate that the \nCongress allow the executive branch to usurp its constitutional duties.\n  The Constitution grants to the Congress the authority to appropriate \nfunds and the responsibility to use that authority to make careful \nchoices. Yet the President has asked the Congress to hand over its \nresponsibility to the executive branch. The bill that is before the \nSenate includes $1.135 billion to be parceled out by the Secretary of \nHomeland Security for whatever purpose he believes is most appropriate. \nSo will he use that authority to support the Coast Guard? Will he use \nthat authority for border security or for port security? Will he give \nthe money to States or to localities? Will he give it to first \nresponders--police, fire, or emergency medical personnel in our \ncommunities? Or will he use it to build up a new bureaucracy?\n  These are questions to which Congress should be seeking the answers. \nCongress itself must guard its prerogative and resist succumbing to \nexpediency and to political partisanship.\n  While I fully support the funding in this legislation for the men and \nthe women who are engaged in battle in Iraq, I do not support \nadditional grants of authority to this administration, or to any other \nadministration, that would infringe upon the congressional power of the \npurse.\n  Senator Stevens and I, together with the subcommittee chairmen and \nranking members, have worked, in most cases, to improve the President's \nsupplemental budget request. We have eliminated or reduced the sweeping \ngrants of new authority requested by this administration, while still \nproviding some very limited flexibility where appropriate.\n  However, with regard to this unallocated fund for the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, we have not adequately protected the prerogatives of \nthe Congress, nor have we done enough to protect our homeland. Time and \nagain, the White House has argued that funding for securing our \nhomeland can wait. When the Senate debated legislation to increase \nfunding for homeland security just 2 months after the September 11 \nattacks, we tried to add money for homeland security, but the President \nsaid let's wait--let's wait until 2002. Then, in 2002, the Congress \napproved a $2.5 billion supplemental for first responders, for port \nsecurity, border security, aviation security, and nuclear security, and \nthe President refused to spend it. He claimed that homeland security \ncould wait until 2003. Now it is 2003 and Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle--some of them--are saying we are half way through the fiscal \nyear; so let's wait until 2004. Well, I must ask the Senate, in the \nname of the people whom we represent, when will it be time to invest in \nsecuring our homeland? How much longer must we wait?\n  The President proposes to put more than $1 billion in a fund for \nhomeland security, but he does not tell us what the money will be used \nfor. He does not tell us which agencies have requested funding. He \nprovides us with no evaluations of those requests. He does not tell us \nwhen the money will be spent. For all we know, he may take the rest of \nthis year to decide how the money will be spent so that he can reduce \nhis spending request for fiscal year 2004. But who knows, he may just \ntell us that homeland security spending can wait until 2005.\n\n  How can I reconcile this desire to wait, wait, wait, with the fact \nthat the Secretary of Homeland Security has said that more terrorist \nattacks are inevitable and the threat of further attacks is a long-term \nthreat to our Nation? I simply cannot reconcile his statements with the \npolicies of this administration. This threat of terrorist attack will \nnot end at the end of this war.\n  So today, here is an amendment that does not add one thin dime to the \nbill. Instead, this amendment does what the Constitution--which we all \nswore to support and defend--compels us to do. This amendment makes \nchoices. Last year, the Senate Appropriations Committee held 5 days of \nbipartisan hearings on homeland security. It was an excellent series of \nhearings where we heard from Governors, mayors, first responders, six \ncabinet officers, the Attorney General, and the Administrator of FEMA. \nIn those hearings, we identified numerous gaps in our security. Based \non those hearings and numerous reports, such as the nonpartisan Rudman-\nHart report, my amendment, which I offered together with Senator \nHollings, allocates the $1.135 billion contained in the committee bill \nfor specific programs.\n  More than $365 million would fund critical improvements at our \nseaports. Six million containers enter into the United States each year \nthrough our ports and very little is known about the contents of these \ncontainers or their shippers. There is no national system in place to \ntrack who is working within our own ports. This funding would begin to \ndevelop that system.\n  The amendment would also pay for the installation of monitors at \nseaports to detect radiological, nuclear, chemical, biological \nsubstances, and weapons of mass destruction, without disturbing cargo. \nAdditional equipment would expedite the inspection process. At the same \ntime, we invest in port security teams and in other quick-response \nefforts should a terrorist strike at one of the Nation's seaports. We \nprovide $150 million for mass transit and rail security. Transit \nsystems throughout the world have historically been a top \ntransportation target of terrorists. They are, by their nature, open \nsystems used by a vast number of people and are very vulnerable to \nattack.\n\n  With the exception of the Metro in the District of Columbia region, \nno money to date has been provided to our Nation's transit system to \nenhance security and reduce the vulnerability of these systems.\n  Under the amendment, the Transportation Security Administration will \nreceive $147 million for aviation security, while $55 million is \ndirected toward the effort to find ways to protect commercial airplanes \nfrom missile attack.\n  Another key part of this amendment is the $100 million directed \ntoward interoperable communications equipment for police and fire \ndepartments. First responders need equipment that allows them to \ncommunicate with each other regardless of the team, the squadron, or \nthe department to which they belong.\n  Finally, there is funding totaling $75 million for the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to use for responding to unanticipated problems. The \nSecretary could draw on this fund by notifying the Congress 15 days in \nadvance of spending the money. Mind you, this is no small sum. This is \n$75 million.\n  This Congress can make intelligent choices and this Congress should \nmake intelligent choices about how to use the taxpayers' dollars. We \nshould not abrogate that responsibility by handing it off to unelected \nofficials in Washington.\n  I urge Members to support this amendment. Mr. President, I reserve \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nunder the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment is a modified version of \nthe amendment the Senate just acted on a little while ago offered by \nthe Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux. That amendment was tabled by \nthe Senate. This amendment would strike the appropriations provided in \nthe committee bill of $1.135 billion for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Counterterrorism Fund and replace it with specific \nsupplemental appropriations for various Department of Homeland Security \naccounts. It includes a number of specific earmarks and proposals that \nhave been included in other amendments that have been offered to this \nbill but have been either tabled or defeated.\n  These additional amounts have no direct relationship to additional \ncosts borne by the agencies as a result of heightened security related \nto the Iraqi war as part of Operation Liberty Shield.\n  For example, this amendment proposes to add an additional $160 \nmillion for the Customs and Border Protection account. Of this amount, \n$35 million is proposed for the Container Security Initiative. That is \nnearly three times the fiscal year 2003 regular appropriations level of \n$12 million; and $125 million for radiation portal monitors and other \nequipment, over two times the regular fiscal year 2003 appropriation \nlevel of $45.7 million.\n  It does not seem to me to make good sense to add these amounts of \nmoney at this time to a supplemental of immediate need to pay costs \nrelated to the war and Operation Liberty Shield.\n\n  We are 8 months into this fiscal year. The amendment proposes an \nadditional $452 million in supplemental appropriations for the \nTransportation Security Administration. It includes $100 million for \nport security grants when the fiscal year 2002 funds have not been \ncompletely awarded. Ninety million dollars in 2002 funds have been \nrewarded, and $105 million in applications are being currently \nexamined, and there is another $150 million in 2003 appropriations.\n  It also includes the $55 million proposed by the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, which the Senate already \ntabled earlier today. This amendment being presented to the Senate now \nis a proposal that we have already rejected.\n  The amendment proposes $5 million for the Federal Law Enforcement \nTraining Center. This is more than double any supplemental funding \nrequirements identified to us by the agency. We have asked the center \nwhat they need to meet their responsibilities. We tried to find out \nwhat the requirements are and to make this bill coincide with those \nrequirements. We are not talking about a full fiscal year, we are \ntalking about the balance of this fiscal year, this supplemental \nappropriations.\n  This amendment proposes an additional $300 million on top of the $2 \nbillion recommended separately in the bill for the Office for Domestic \nPreparedness. Listen to this: For the Coast Guard, it adds an \nadditional $73 million. This is on top of $580 million provided \nseparately in this bill for the Coast Guard costs related to Operation \nIraqi Freedom and Operation Liberty Shield. Of that amount, $42 million \nis for port security assessments, when the highest estimate we know of \nto complete this is $37.8 million. Another $7 million is for the \npurchase of radiation detection equipment which is currently under \nstudy. Specifically, the Coast Guard is studying what the cost to \npurchase this equipment will be. So it is difficult to determine the \nfunding required until that study is complete.\n  Further, the amendment proposes $40 million in supplemental funds to \nimplement the Automated Identification System and other tracking \nsystems when only $4 million is proposed for fiscal year 2004.\n  Think about that: This supplemental amendment proposes $40 million in \nsupplemental funds for something when only $4 million is proposed for \nfiscal year 2004.\n  Finally, it proposes $105 million for the Counterterrorism Fund and \nspecifies the transfer of these funds to other Federal agencies rather \nthan proposing to appropriate these funds directly to those agencies--\n$20 million to the District of Columbia, $10 million to the National \nPark Service.\n  My position is the same on this amendment as it was on the Breaux \namendment which the Senate tabled. We have carefully examined the \nproposal from the administration for supplemental funding. The request \nwas submitted to our committee. We had hearings. We had opportunities \nto talk with the agencies that are going to be spending these funds. We \nhave made a concerted effort to find out what the needs are and to \nrespond to those needs in this supplemental appropriations bill.\n  We might be wrong, but we are certainly not coming in and \ndisregarding the needs of the agencies and throwing money out here and \npretending that is going to solve all the problems at a time when we \nare concerned about the deficit, people are worried about our economy, \nwe are trying to be sure we do not make decisions that make it harder \nto create new jobs and return good health to the economy.\n  We are under a lot of pressure from the added costs for the war in \nIraq. We know that. We are under a lot of pressure for the added costs \nto defend our cities and localities against terrorist attacks. It is a \nbig challenge to do what is right and to make the best judgments on \nthese subjects. But I can assure the Senate that a concerted effort and \na very thoughtful effort has gone into the development of the funding \nlevels in the bill before the Senate. I am prepared to defend it and to \nnot apologize for the amounts we put in here because it reflects a \ngood-faith effort to do what is right.\n\n  I urge the Senate to reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield me 3 minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. There is no one I admire more than my distinguished \ncolleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, but he is off base. The \nfather of homeland security studied it way better than Governor Ridge. \nWe have been holding the hearings on all of these things, and you can \nsee they have no idea what is going on in that so-called Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  We brought the Attorney General up, and he said: Well, the Office of \nDomestic Preparedness is transferred over. Then you go, by gosh, to the \nhomeland security people, and you cannot find the money.\n  What the ranking member for homeland security is doing is bringing \ntogether all the chaos. We are the ones having the Coast Guard hearings \nfor 30-some years up here. We are the ones who have been handling the \nOffice of Domestic Preparedness. We are the ones who have been knowing \nthe needs.\n  This does not add a red penny but says here is how these needs should \nbe responded to and it is an emergency.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his \nparticular amendment. He is trying to do the right thing. He is being \ncharged with doing the wrong thing. It is the same thing as the Breaux \namendment.\n  I remember one time they told me I had an impediment in my speech, \nand I asked: What was that? They said: The trouble with you, Senator, \nis that you can't listen.\n  The trouble with my friends on the other side is they didn't listen \nto the Breaux amendment.\n  Now we are getting it clearer with the amendment of the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend from South Carolina. He is a good \nlistener. As far as I am concerned, he does not have any impediment in \nhis speech.\n  The Constitution invests the power of the purse, the control of the \npurse, here, in Congress, section 9, article I, of the Constitution. \nThe Constitution does not say anything about letting some bureaucrat \ndowntown--we all appreciate the fact we have to have bureaucrats, but \nnowhere do I swear it is important to defend the Department of Homeland \nSecurity when it comes to the allocation of the taxpayers' money.\n  We are doing what we ought to do here. We are saying these funds are \nthe taxpayers' money; Congress shall determine how they will be spent. \nWhy should we turn over $1.3 billion to a Department and say to that \nDepartment head: You take it? That Department head does not appear on \nthe ballot anywhere. He may have in times past. He\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\nwas a good Governor, I suppose. I have a lot of respect for him. But \nnowhere does he appear before the elected representatives, before the \nelectors in the various States. And we do. We have a responsibility to \nsay where this money will be spent.\n  We had hearings, as Senator Hollings has so ably pointed out. We had \nextensive hearings. We had six Department heads, we had the Attorney \nGeneral, we had the Director of Homeland Security, we had mayors, we \nhad Governors, we had local responders, we had firemen, we had \npolicemen, we had emergency health personnel before the Appropriations \nCommittee. Those hearings were well attended by Members on both sides \nof the aisle. My distinguished friend from Mississippi was there.\n  We then reported out bills based on the hearings and the facts that \nwere gleaned from those painstaking hearings, and in a great way that \nwork was for naught.\n  But here we are, we come back, and we are trying to say yes, we will \nrespond, Mr. President. We will appropriate this money, but we are not \njust going to turn over a blank check to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. That agency head--I have a lot of respect for him, as I say, \nbut he was not allowed to come before our committee during those \nhearings. He was not allowed by this President. This President said, \nno, no, Mr. Ridge shall not appear before the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Now are we willing to turn it over to Mr. Ridge and say: Here it is, \nlock, stock and barrel, the whole kit and caboodle; you have it; we \nwill spend it; we will set ourselves aside. I am not willing to do \nthat, I say with great respect to my friend from Mississippi, and he is \nmy friend. We have a responsibility to say where this money is going to \nbe spent, how it will be spent. We ought to live up to that \nresponsibility.\n  I hope Senators vote for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is with some trepidation that I oppose \nthe amendment of the Senator from West Virginia because I have enjoyed \nworking with him on this committee and in the Senate for a long time.\n  There may very well be provisions in this amendment he offers that \nshould be seriously considered for inclusion in the fiscal year 2004 \nappropriations bill.\n  Right now, we are having hearings in the various subcommittees of \nAppropriations looking at the budget requests for 2004. Every committee \nis involved in that process, every subcommittee is involved in that \nprocess. But this is an appropriations bill that is targeted to the \nneeds that are arising from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \nLiberty Shield, the functions of the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\n  It is a very narrow and limited area that we are concentrating our \nattention on right now. Some of these programs are hard to estimate in \nterms of what is really needed for the remainder of this fiscal year in \naddition to the funds that have already been appropriated in the \nregular appropriations bills for the Department of Defense and \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  But the President submitted this request, asked for the funds to \nfinish out this fiscal year. We know we can add funds and probably use \nthem later on, but this is not the last bill we will consider during \nthis calendar year, that funds these Departments and these activities. \nWe have the 2004 bill coming up after the supplemental appropriation. I \nask Senators to take that into account. If we have underfunded anything \nas a result of mistakes made, we can make up those shortfalls in the \nyear 2004, but right now this is what the administration says they \nneed.\n  I am not the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. I have \nnot devoted all of my personal attention to that job as has Secretary \nRidge. The President and his other staff members and the executive \nbranch have. We have to respect their right to participate in this \nprocess. Just because we think we can improve upon what they have \nsuggested by adding funds to these accounts--even funds that have been \nconsidered and rejected today by the Senate--let's vote on it again.\n  This amendment contains a lot of things that have already been \nconsidered today and rejected by this Senate. So think about that, as \nwell.\n  I don't think I need to take up any more time. I am prepared to yield \nback my time. I do yield back the time on this side. When the Senator \nhas used all his time, it would be my intention to move to table the \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my friend from Mississippi says the folks \ndowntown want to participate. They did not want to participate last \nyear when we asked the Secretary of Homeland Security--who is now the \nSecretary of Homeland Security--to appear. The President did not want \nto participate then. The President said: No, he shall not go up before \nthat committee.\n  So I say, Mr. President, once again, this administration is simply \nasking for too much authority. They want to participate? Well, this is \nnot the first time administrations have wanted to participate. Under \nthis Constitution, Congress has the power to appropriate funds. I say \nthat Congress has not only the right, it has the responsibility to \nstate how those funds shall be spent. We should not turn over the whole \nkit and caboodle to some unelected somebody down there, who will be the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. We transfer our responsibilities, we \nhand off our duties when we do that.\n\n  This is an effort to stand by our constitutional duties, to stand by \nthe taxpayers of the country who provide the money. This is our \nresponsibility. We should say where these moneys will be spent, and we \nare doing that based on the testimony that was given to the \nAppropriations Committee last year. That is where we are getting our \ninformation.\n  What is wrong with that? Why do Senators want to quarrel with that? \nIt is the responsibility of Senators, I say to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas who is in the Chair. He shares that responsibility \nwith the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from North Carolina \nand the Senator from Mississippi. That is our responsibility. Why do we \nwant to hand it over to some bureaucrat who is not elected by the \npeople, who doesn't have to stand before the bar of judgment as we \nSenators do? Why do we want to hand that over to the administration? \nJust because the administration wants to have it?\n  This administration, time and time again, has turned the back of its \nhand to Congress when Congress has made appropriations for homeland \nsecurity--time and time again. We appropriated $2.5 billion last year, \ndesignated as an emergency, and that money would be out there in the \nhands of the local responders right today if this President hadn't \nturned the back of his hand on that and said: No, I refuse to attach my \nsignature designating that as an emergency.\n  So, there you have it. That is talk versus action.\n  Mr. President, I hope Senators will support this amendment.\n  Read the Constitution once again if need be, but take my word for it, \nthat is in the Constitution.\n  I hope Senators will stand up for the Constitution, stand up for the \ntaxpayers. See, those taxpayers are looking right at us through those \nelectronic lenses there. I say support this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment. I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I understand there are discussions with the acting \nleader on the other side. Senator Hollings has a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment dealing with taxes that we could take up now and have a \ndebate on it and have a vote in relation to that amendment that would \nfollow immediately after the vote on the Byrd amendment. I will be \nhappy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, Senator Stevens has indicated it \nhas been cleared by both leaders that we could have a vote around 6:30.\n  I ask unanimous consent, in keeping with the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, that we have a vote in relation to the Byrd amendment \nat the\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\nexpiration of 20 minutes for the Senator from South Carolina, and 10 \nminutes for the Senator from Mississippi, and that there be no second-\ndegree amendments. Following that, there would be a motion on or in \nrelation to the Hollings amendment, there would be no second-degree \namendments ordered, and we would vote on that following the disposition \nof the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is satisfactory with this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the present \namendment be set aside temporarily so I can call this amendment up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 479\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I call up the amendment and ask the clerk to report the \nsense of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 479.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To instruct the President to submit a bill raising revenues \n     to offset the costs of this supplemental appropriations bill)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PAYING THE COSTS OF THE WAR \n                   WITH IRAQ.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should submit a proposal to the Committee \n     on Finance to raise sufficient revenues to offset the funds \n     spent in this supplemental appropriations Act for the war in \n     Iraq;\n       (2) the President should submit this proposal not later \n     than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (3) if the President does not submit such a proposal, the \n     Committee on Finance should put forward its own proposal to \n     offset the funds spent in this supplemental appropriations \n     Act for the war in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right to the point, the comment was made \njust a minute ago about taxes. I wish I could introduce a tax measure \nbecause I introduced one way back in January to pay for the war. The \nreason I rise now with a sense of the Senate is because under the \nrules, any revenue measure should arise in the House of \nRepresentatives. So I am asking that we have at least a sense of the \nSenate to break this syndrome of not paying for anything.\n  A minute ago our distinguished colleague handling the bill said, ``We \nare concerned.'' They are not a bit concerned about deficits, I can \ntell you that. We spent a half trillion dollars last year we didn't pay \nfor. Under the President's budget we just passed--another half a \ntrillion dollars in deficits this year. And the President projects to \nspend nearly $600 billion next year, unpaid for. The particular budget \nwe just passed increases the debt, the national debt, from \napproximately $6 trillion to $12 trillion. We double the debt in the \nnext 10 years and we are going merrily along, not paying for anything.\n  We all say the Pledge of Allegiance. We run around with our flags in \nour lapels. We all have a moment of silence for the troops in Iraq. It \nis a sincere demonstration. But then you have to question the sincerity \nwhen we will not pay for anything.\n  We are sending that GI into Iraq, and we are saying we hope you don't \nget killed. And the reason we hope you don't get killed is we want you \nto hurry back so we can give you the bill. We aren't going to pay for \nit.\n  What we need, and Carl Rove has told us, is a tax cut so we can get \nelected next year. We are not concerned about the needs of the country. \nWe are concerned only about the needs of the campaign. I hope this \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment will engender support for the troops.\n  The articles on the front page of the business section of the New \nYork Times today explain why this is necessary.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the two articles, ``Sour Mood \nPervades the Economic Front,'' and, ``A Year-long Decline in the Dollar \nIs Little Help in the U.S. Trade Gap.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Sour Mood Pervades the Economic Front\n\n                         (By Edmund L. Andrews)\n\n       Washington, April 2.--While American optimism about the war \n     in Iraq rose sharply today, American spirits about the \n     economy are still being battered.\n       Stock markets surged on hopes that American and British \n     forces are closing in on victory in Iraq, but the mood among \n     business executives and consumers is sour.\n       Every survey of manufacturers over the last month has shown \n     a sharp increase in pessimism as executives complain about \n     slumping demand for their own goods and higher prices for the \n     materials they use to make them.\n       The Commerce Department reported today that factory orders \n     dropped 1.5 percent in February, the steepest drop in five \n     months. On Friday, economists predict, the government will \n     report that unemployment rose again in March.\n       Though the increase in joblessness is expected to be \n     modest, the economy has already shed more than 600,000 jobs \n     since November and two million since President Bush took \n     office.\n       Consumers, whether because of anxiety about the war or \n     because they have been preoccupied with the television \n     coverage, have slowed their spending. Car sales declined last \n     month, airline travel has dropped and retailers have reduced \n     their expectations of growth for the year.\n       The trend is even worse in Europe and Japan, where growth \n     has almost stalled entirely. As if that was not enough, \n     tourism and travel through Asia are now being hurt by fears \n     of the spread of the disease known as severe acute \n     respiratory syndrome, or SARS.\n       In effect, President Bush is being forced to fight wars on \n     two fronts. Anxieties about the war in Iraq have slowed the \n     economy, with businesses still reluctant to invest in new \n     factories or expand their work forces.\n       But a growing number of analysts are skeptical that the \n     economy will snap back quickly after the shooting subsides. \n     The aftershocks of the stock market bubble still appear to \n     inhibit investor confidence and corporate spending.\n       ``We have had three consecutive quarters of below-trend \n     growth,'' said William C. Dudley, chief United States \n     economist at Goldman Sachs. ``To explain all that on the \n     basis of the war in Iraq seems to be a stretch.''\n       Initial data from retailers indicates that consumers slowed \n     their spending noticeably in the first week of the war. But \n     it remains unclear whether they will rush back into stores \n     when the war dies down.\n       On Tuesday, Instinet Research's survey of chain stores \n     found that sales dropped by 2.8 percent last week, compared \n     with those in the week a year earlier, and that March sales \n     were off 1.5 percent.\n       A significant part of that decline stemmed from unusually \n     bad winter weather, as well as the fact that the Easter \n     weekend fell earlier last year.\n       But consumer surveys suggest that Americans have curbed \n     their urge to shop. The most recent poll by ABC News and \n     Money magazine, released on Tuesday, showed that consumer \n     confidence remained near its lowest point in nine years.\n       In a poll by The New York Times and CBS News, taken from \n     March 20 to 24, about 49 percent of the respondents said the \n     economy was bad while 50 percent said it was good.\n       Those attitudes constituted an improvement over the month \n     before and may have reflected the initial surge of optimism \n     that the United States and Britain would defeat Iraq within \n     days.\n       In follow-up interviews today, at least some participants \n     had returned to their earlier pessimism.\n       ``I would not make any purchases at this time,'' said \n     Robert Micheo, a retired probation officer in Los Angeles. \n     ``The economy is going down day by day, and it's going to get \n     worse.''\n       Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has continued \n     to express a comparatively sunny view that confidence will \n     revive as soon as the ``geopolitical uncertainties'' abate.\n       But Fed officials say the uncertainties about the economy \n     are so numerous that they cannot make any predictions. And \n     the surveys of business sentiment by Fed regional banks have \n     been extremely gloomy.\n       Earlier this week, the Philadelphia Fed's survey of \n     manufacturers showed deteriorating conditions in several \n     areas. Companies in the region reported that new orders and \n     hiring declined sharply in March and that its broadest \n     measure of manufacturing conditions had plunged.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Yearlong Decline in Dollar Is Little Help on Trade Gap\n\n                           (By Daniel Altman)\n\n       For many economists, the dollar's jagged yearlong slide is \n     just a side effect of an inevitable contraction in the \n     nation's huge trade deficit. But current economic and \n     political conditions are making the process more perilous \n     than it might otherwise have been.\n       Recently, the dollar's exchange rates have bounced up and \n     down with news from the\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\n     Iraq war: late yesterday, on news of American military \n     progress toward Baghdad, it reached 118.98 yen, up 0.76 \n     percent from Tuesday. But the dollar's overall trend in the \n     last year has been distinctly downward. Weighted by the \n     volumes of trade with other countries and adjusted for \n     inflation, an average of the rates dropped 4.4 percent from \n     March 2002 to last month.\n       A deeper decline could be on the way, though. The run-up to \n     the war in Iraq hurt the American economy, and fears of \n     similar conflicts to follow could deter foreigners from \n     holding dollar-denominated securities. With less demand for \n     the securities, there would be less need for dollars.\n       ``Perceptions are very important,'' said Kermit L. \n     Schoenholtz, chief economist of Salomon Smith Barney. ``If \n     people believe that the events we've seen in Iraq are not \n     one-off events, it will affect their investments.''\n       The falling dollar has helped some American companies to \n     increase their exports, but not enough to counteract the \n     effects of a middling global economy.\n       ``It's only offset part of it,'' said Frank Mendizabal, a \n     spokesman for Weyerhaeuser, the paper and building materials \n     maker. The company exported 18 percent of its sales last \n     year, and the weaker dollar helped it compete with producers \n     in Latin America and Asia. But factors like a stagnant \n     housing market in Japan still restrained demand, Mr. \n     Mendizabal said.\n       Several forces may be combining to dull the effect of the \n     exchange rate on exports. Mr. Schoenholtz said that weakness \n     of incomes and demand abroad was ``a very significant portion \n     of the reason'' why the deficit in international transactions \n     had not narrowed more. Heightened world competition is also \n     adding to the difficulty of American exporters' task.\n       ``I can't think of an exchange rate at which U.S. exports \n     might be competitive with those from a very low-cost country \n     like China,'' said John G. Lonski, chief economist at Moody's \n     Investors Service. And in China's case, Mr. Lonski said, the \n     currency is tied to the dollar, which helps prevent a \n     narrowing of its trade imbalance with the United States.\n       Despite the decline in the trade-weighted value of the \n     dollar, from October (when the dollar reached a peak) to \n     January (the last month for which the Commerce Department has \n     data), exports barely changed and imports rose 5 percent, \n     seasonally adjusted. At least in the short term, the dollar's \n     movements seem to reflect foreigners' willingness or \n     reluctance to hold American securities more than the balance \n     of trade.\n       ``The recent confrontation with Iraq may have convinced \n     investors of a need to better diversify their investment \n     portfolios away from dollar-denominated assets,'' Mr. Lonski \n     said. Though he did not forecast any large-scale dumping of \n     American securities, Mr. Lonski said that ``in view of the \n     U.S.'s record-breaking current account deficit, it seems like \n     some decline in the dollar appears to be overdue.''\n       Last month, according to a report by Morgan Stanley, \n     foreign investors' demand for Treasury securities suddenly \n     slackened. And well before the possibility of war in Iraq \n     began to concern investors, corporate scandals pushed \n     foreigners to shift their portfolios away from American \n     securities, said a senior executive based in the New York \n     office of a major European bank.\n       ``It was more that than anything else initially, and now it \n     has to do with them feeling uncomfortable about the war,'' \n     said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n       In addition to the changes in portfolios, the pace of \n     foreigners, direct investment in the United States has \n     slowed. The euro zone has outpaced the United States as a \n     target for foreign direct investment for six consecutive \n     quarters, according to figures compiled by Morgan Stanley.\n       All American companies, exporters or not, could suffer if \n     foreign capital being pulled out of United States investments \n     is not replaced by domestic savings. Though household savings \n     rose to about $330 billion last year from $200 billion in \n     2001, the budget deficit of $158 billion cut the nation's \n     total savings in half. This year, the overall deficit will \n     probably be $250 billion to $300 billion, according to the \n     latest estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.\n       With national savings near zero, almost all new investment \n     by American businesses would essentially be financed with \n     foreign money. ``The only way we can grow is to get capital \n     from abroad,'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist of \n     Morgan Stanley. ``What we're seeing now are some early \n     warning signs of how this will play out over the next several \n     years.''\n       The Treasury also needs foreigners to remain interested in \n     dollar-denominated securities. According to estimates by the \n     Bond Market Association, a trade group, foreigners hold about \n     35 percent of the Nation's outstanding debt. The Treasury's \n     borrowing requirements seem likely to balloon as result of \n     the Iraq war, the sluggish economy and President Bush's tax \n     cuts. If demand for that debt falls at the same time, \n     interest rates could rise.\n       ``We're asking the world to give us too much of their \n     surplus savings,'' Mr. Roach said. ``That's just not a \n     sustainable way to run the economy, period.''\n       Mr. Schoenholtz says he thinks the United States could \n     regain its attractiveness to foreign investors. ``If concerns \n     about the war fade, and oil prices recede sharply,'' he said, \n     ``then you'll be back in a position where you could argue \n     that the chance of an economic pickup would be greater for \n     the U.S., than in Europe of Japan.'' In that case, he said, \n     the United States would be likely to resume its position as \n     the preferred market for foreign investors.\n       Indeed, investors may still be hard pressed to find a \n     better place to invest. ``The Europe economic data has been \n     as bad or worse than the U.S.,'' said Ifty Islam, head of \n     United States fixed-income strategy at Deutsche Bank \n     Securities. ``Just because this is not a European war, it \n     doesn't mean Europe is not suffering.''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I quote hurriedly, Mr. President, just to emphasize, if \nyou please, the problem we are really getting this generation in:\n\n       A growing number of analysts are skeptical that the economy \n     will snap back quickly after the shooting subsides. The \n     aftershocks of the stock market bubble still appear to \n     inhibit investor confidence and corporate spending. ``We have \n     had three consecutive quarters of below-trend growth,'' said \n     William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman \n     Sachs. ``To explain all that on the basis of the war in Iraq \n     seems to be a stretch.''\n\n  Moving along:\n\n       But consumer surveys suggest that Americans have curbed \n     their urge to shop. The most recent poll, by ABC News and \n     Money magazine, released on Tuesday, showed that consumer \n     confidence remained near its lowest point in nine years. . . \n     .\n\n     . . . surveys of business sentiment by regional banks have \n     been extremely gloomy. . . .The Philadelphia Feds survey of \n     manufacturers showed deteriorating conditions in several \n     areas. Companies in the region reported that new orders and \n     hiring declined sharply in March, and that its broadest \n     measure of manufacturing conditions had plunged.\n\n  There is also the statement that we have lost 600,000 jobs since \nNovember.\n\n       On Tuesday, a closely watched index of manufacturing \n     activity by the Institute of Supply Management . . . [f]or \n     the first time in five months . . . suggested that factories \n     were contracting rather than expanding.\n\n  Then, Mr. President, jumping right to that next article, because you \ncan see we have always depended on the foreigners to pay for our debt--\nthey have been carrying over a third of our debts--I quote, again:\n\n       Last month, according to a report by Morgan Stanley, \n     foreign investors' demand for Treasury securities suddenly \n     slackened.\n\n  They stopped buying that debt. I tell you, this is very dangerous to \nus because we are going to have to increase the interest rates, when \ndeficits matter, according to Alan Greenspan. All my colleagues want to \nobject, and they run around with the litany that: We are worried about \ndeficits.\n  The truth is, we are not worried about deficits. This $80 billion \nbill before us--there is no money for it. We are going to borrow to \nsupport the troops, and then want the troops to come back and let them \npay for it.\n  Let me read some more:\n\n       In addition to the changes in portfolios, the pace of \n     foreigners' direct investment . . . has slowed. The euro zone \n     has outpaced the United States as a target for foreign direct \n     investment for six consecutive quarters, according to figures \n     compiled by Morgan Stanley.\n\n  So they are investing back in Europe rather than the United States, \nwhich was always their first preference.\n\n       With national savings near zero, almost all new investment \n     by American businesses would essentially be financed with \n     foreign money. ``The only way we can grow is to get capital \n     from abroad,'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist of \n     Morgan Stanley. ``What we're seeing now are some early \n     warning signs of how this will play out over the next several \n     years.''\n\n     . . . foreigners hold about 35 percent of the nation's \n     outstanding debt. The Treasury's borrowing requirements seem \n     likely to balloon as a result of the Iraq war, the sluggish \n     economy and President Bush's tax cut. If demand for that debt \n     falls at the same time, interest costs could rise.\n       ``We're asking the world to give us too much of their \n     surplus savings,'' Mr. Roach said. ``That's just not a \n     sustainable way to run the economy, period.''\n\n  I wish I had the time to read it all, but it is not Hollings just \ntrying to pass a tax. I would rather be tax and spend than spend and \nwreck. We can't get this crowd off the deficit barley corn. If we can't \nsober them up with a war, when troops are dying in Iraq and the amounts \nthat we appropriate we can't even pay for--I don't know how it is ever \ngoing to happen.\n  We have always paid for all of our wars. For the Revolution War, they \nput on a property tax. Back in the Civil War, they put a tax on \ndividends and estates; for World War I, they raised\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\nthe marginal tax rate to 77 percent; World War II, 94 percent; Vietnam, \n77 percent. That is the last time--and I was here--that we balanced the \nbudget, that we paid our way, under President Lyndon Johnson, guns and \nbutter. The tax rate was 77 percent.\n  Now it has already been cut to 38.5 percent, and they want to cut it \nfurther in the budget that just passed. And to say, Why do we have \ndeficits? and to use the statement that we are concerned about \ndeficits--that is nonsense. There is no concern. This place has run \namok. And if we can't get a sense of the Senate that we are willing to \npay for the war, we are just going to have to quit, we are not doing \nthe people's job at all.\n\n  The party of Lincoln that passed in order to pay for the Civil War \nthe estate tax and the dividend tax, this party of Lincoln today, in \n2003, says: Let's go to war. And the first order of business is to \neliminate the estate tax, eliminate the dividend tax, and talk about \nstimulus, stimulus, growth, growth.\n  Do you know that in 200 years of American history, with all the \nwars--World War II, right on through, Korea, Vietnam--we never had a \n$100 billion interest cost on our debt. But, by gosh, along came \nPresident Reagan. George Walker Herbert Bush called it voodoo. And \nunder voodoo we went not only to $100 billion, but we went to $200 \nbillion in interest costs. And then we went to $400 billion under \nPresident Bush's father.\n  Then, under President Clinton, we eliminated the deficit. It took 8 \nyears to eliminate that $400 billion deficit, but we raised taxes, \nwhich I am asking us to do, at least to pay for the war--not for any \nother program. I have a value-added tax.

Mr. President, before I forget, I ask unanimous consent \nto have this article printed in the Record: ``No Excuse for Tax Cuts,'' \nby E.J. Dionne, Jr.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 25, 2003]\n\n    Washington Talks a Blue Streak As Social Security's Red Ink Runs\n\n                            (By Allan Sloan)\n\n       No matter how well the war goes, the United States has one \n     problem that isn't going away: Social Security. And despite \n     what you may have read last week, Social Security's financial \n     situation isn't getting better. If anything, it's getting \n     worse, because another year has passed without doing anything \n     about the program's long-term problems.\n       Pour yourself a glass of warm milk or a stiff drink, \n     depending on how you calm your nerves, then look at the \n     numbers. Open the 2003 Social Security Board of Trustees \n     report, issued last week, to page 184. If you don't happen to \n     have a copy of this jewel sitting around, go to www.ssa.gov/\nOACT/TR/TR03/lr6F9-2.html.\n       You get Social Security's projected annual cash flow by \n     subtracting the outgo column from the income-excluding-\n     interest column. This disregards the interest that Social \n     Security gets on its trust fund, because the interest is paid \n     not in cash but in Treasury securities. This year's $77 \n     billion cash surplus and $88 billion of interest that doesn't \n     count as a budget expense produces a $165 billion Social \n     Security surplus in the federal budget. This surplus is being \n     pillaged to support huge tax cuts and other government \n     expenses.\n       Social Security's cash surplus is projected to peak at $112 \n     billion in 2008 and then start to decline. For 2027, the \n     surplus is projected at $5 billion. Given that Social \n     Security will be spending more than $1.1 trillion, the $5 \n     billion is a rounding error, not a margin of safety. By 2018, \n     the ``crossover date,'' when the amount collected in Social \n     Security taxes isn't enough to cover current benefits, the \n     program is projected to run a $25 billion negative cash flow, \n     and the red ink starts to run like a river.\n       If you subscribe to the school, consisting primarily of \n     Democrats, that says we're okay until 2041 because we can \n     depend on the trust fund, you're in dreamland. Take a look at \n     the horrific projected cash-flow deficits that lie ahead. In \n     2020, $568 billion. by 2039, it's more than $1 trillion. You \n     think we're going to spend that kind of money? What are you \n     smoking?\n       But, you ask, why can't the trust fund, currently at $1.54 \n     trillion and climbing, be used to fund the cash deficit? \n     Welcome to the wonderful world of Washington math. The \n     federal government putting Treasury securities into a federal \n     trust fund is like you funding your retirement by writing \n     IOUs to yourself. It's a meaningless exercise, because you \n     have to convert the IOUs into cash--and having the IOUs on \n     hand doesn't make it easier for you to come up with cash.\n       If you put Treasury securities into your file drawer to \n     finance your retirement, you'd be fine. You'd depend on the \n     Treasury to redeem its securities; you wouldn't have to raise \n     the money with your own resources. If Social Security had put \n     your IOU into its trust fund--say, by making you a mortgage \n     loan--it would be fine, provided you paid off your loan. \n     Instead, the government will have to redeem Social Security's \n     Treasury securities with its own cash, by cutting other \n     spending, getting more revenue or borrowing. Exactly what it \n     would have to do if there were no trust fund. So the trust \n     fund, no matter how many trillions are in it, isn't helpful \n     when it comes to paying bills.\n       The cash-crossover date has been moving forward steadily \n     for five years. Is that a sign that the problem will never \n     actually arrive? No, says Stephen Goss, Social Security's \n     chief actuary. ``The possibility is about 50-50 that the \n     dates will be earlier in next year's report,'' he says. And \n     Goss isn't a political numbers troll. He's a career civil \n     servant who's a total truth-teller. He said the same things \n     during the Clinton administration that he said to me last \n     week.\n       Just as Democrats engage in fantasy when they say the trust \n     fund will protect Social Security recipients, Republicans are \n     engaging in fantasy when they talk about ``saving'' the \n     program by diverting some Social Security tax payments to \n     individual investment accounts. For starters, the utterly \n     imprudent tax cuts the Republicans are pushing would ensure \n     that there won't be money available to cover the shortfall if \n     some Social Security taxes go to private accounts rather than \n     being used to pay current beneficiaries. Second, the whole \n     idea of stock-based individual accounts isn't very social--\n     it's each person for him or herself. And these accounts offer \n     no security: If you turned a private account into a lifetime \n     annuity today, you'd get only about half as much per month as \n     you'd have gotten three years ago, because the market and \n     interest rates were much higher then.\n       The logical solution to Social Security's long-term problem \n     is to cut benefit growth, increase taxes or both. You could \n     also use general revenue to pay benefits, but then there'd be \n     no limiting the benefits level. The earlier we deal with the \n     problem, the less pain we'll inflict. But with Democrats \n     denying there's a problem and Republicans fantasizing about \n     the stock market solving Social Security's ills, don't hold \n     your breath waiting for something constructive to happen. \n     You'll turn blue.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 25, 2003]\n\n                         No Excuse for Tax Cuts\n\n                         (By E.J. Dionne, Jr.)\n\n       Do the leaders of Congress really want to make their branch \n     of government look foolish?\n       The attention of Americans is focused on the war in Iraq--\n     the successes, the sacrifices, the capture of American \n     fighting men and women, the march on Baghdad.\n       Congressional leaders should not exploit this moment to \n     push narrow ideological agendas. Ramming through enormous tax \n     cuts is not the best way to unite the country or--the phrase \n     is on the lips of every politician--to show our support for \n     the men and women in uniform. At a time of war, we should not \n     feel we are witnessing a political Ponza scheme.\n       The administration waited until this week to discuss what \n     this war might cost. President Bush's aides insisted, \n     implausibly, that they really couldn't know the price until \n     hostilities began.\n       Hey, some estimates and ranges would have done just fine. \n     The administration, already proposing far too much tax \n     cutting in the face of rising deficits, clearly wanted to \n     avoid putting out numbers that would make the budget picture \n     even worse. The hope was that Congress would just push \n     through budget resolutions containing its $726 billion tax \n     plan.\n       But once the war started, the fact that it was happening \n     became a rationale for supporting the tax cut. House Speaker \n     Dennis Hastert told his Republican colleagues that it was \n     important not to embarrass the president by cutting back on \n     his tax proposal.\n       Since the tax plan was losing support among moderates on \n     the merits, Hastert had to haul out the flag. Hastert is \n     saying that to oppose the president on anything right now--\n     even on tax policies that have nothing to do with the war and \n     that make less sense than ever because of the war--is somehow \n     to oppose the war effort. If the speaker really believes \n     that, he should just put the House on automatic pilot to \n     ratify the president's desires. Who needs a legislative \n     branch?\n       The Senate, fortunately, is a more complicated place. \n     Republicans hold only 51 of 100 seats, and many Republican \n     moderates are restive. Sens. John McCain of Arizona and \n     Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island think\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\n     tax cutting is senseless until we know more about the costs \n     of war and postwar reconstruction. Sens. Susan Collins and \n     Olympia Snowe of Maine and George Voinovich of Ohio have been \n     trying to hold down the size of the reductions.\n       McCain has particular standing on this matter. He's as \n     strong a supporter of the Iraq war as there is in Congress. \n     On this issue, he has been unwavering in standing up for \n     Bush--not one of his favorite people after the bitter 2000 \n     Republican primaries. McCain is suggesting that conservatives \n     who favor a large American role in the world should put their \n     money where their mouth is and pay for their expansive \n     foreign policy. The alternative is to stop pretending and go \n     back to being a party for which tax cutting is the one and \n     only priority.\n       If the five Republican skeptics held together, they could \n     put a brake on the mad rush to unaffordable tax cuts. Last \n     week Senate moderates carried a proposal to trim the tax cuts \n     by $100 billion. But it's not clear that vote will stand, and \n     it's not enough anyway.\n       It would take courage for moderate Republicans and \n     Democrats in the Senate to do more. But they would only be \n     matching the courage of moderate and conservative Democrats \n     in the House, who put their anti-deficit principles above the \n     convenience of voting with a president popular in many of \n     their districts.\n       Perhaps the most powerful argument in last week's budget \n     debate came from Rep. Gene Taylor, a solidly conservative \n     Mississippi Democrat. Taylor wondered how Congress could be \n     considering policies that would throw today's costs onto \n     tomorrow's taxpayers--including the many young Americans now \n     fighting for their country.\n       ``You're sticking those 250,000 young Americans and their \n     children with that bill,'' Taylor said. ``And that's \n     inexcusable.''\n       Deficit arguments tend to be abstract. But Sen. Kent \n     Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat who heads his party's \n     contingent on the Budget Committee, makes the essential \n     point. When the policies of the 1980s threw the country into \n     deep deficits, there was time to repair the problem before \n     the baby boomers retired. This time there will be no \n     opportunity to correct the mistakes. If these tax cuts go \n     through, the choices just a few years from now will be sharp \n     cutbacks in Medicare and Social Security, big tax increases \n     or unheard-of-deficits.\n       War should not be used as an excuse to evade these \n     consequences. This tax debate should be shelved until victory \n     is won.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 25, 2003]\n\n                         A Fair Payment for War\n\n              (By William H. Gates, Sr. and Chuck Collins)\n\n       Last week we saw something unprecedented in American \n     history: a push for tax cuts targeted to the wealthy in a \n     time of war. As U.S. jets prepared to bomb Baghdad, Sen. Jon \n     Kyl (R-Ariz.) offered an amendment to the federal budget \n     legislation accelerating the repeal of the estate tax. It is \n     a provision that would benefit less than 2 percent of the \n     wealthiest taxpayers. It passed by a narrow vote of 51 to 48.\n       There is something unseemly about Congress's obsession with \n     repealing the estate tax, the nation's most equitable tax on \n     accumulated wealth, at a time when life and death are at \n     stake. The American history of estate and inheritance taxes \n     is wound together with mobilizations for war. The first \n     federal tax on wealth was levied in 1797, as our country was \n     faced with the escalating costs of responding to French \n     attacks on American shipping.\n       During the 19th century, federal revenue came primarily \n     from excise taxes and tariffs. Income and estate taxes were \n     imposed only in revenue emergencies, during the Civil War and \n     the Spanish-American War. Wartime taxation, or the \n     ``conscription of wealth,'' was perceived as equitable at a \n     time when many citizens were sacrificing their lives, \n     sometimes as soldier proxies for wealthier citizens.\n       The 1916 estate tax was a fundamentally American response \n     to the excessive inequalities of the Gilded Age and reflected \n     the country's need to move beyond reliance on the regressive \n     tariff and excise taxes as primary sources of government \n     revenue. Yet it was given a tremendous push by the U.S. entry \n     into World War I and the need for wartime funds. Even after \n     the war, businessman Harlan E. Read argued in his book ``The \n     Abolition of Inheritance'' that war debts should be paid off \n     with heavy taxes on inherited wealth.\n       In order to pay for World War II, the income tax was \n     broadened to many lower-income households. In 1942 Irving \n     Berlin wrote a patriotic song called ``I Paid My Income Tax \n     Today'' to mark the unprecedented tax collections. One verse \n     went: ``You see those bombers in the sky, Rockefeller helped \n     to build them, so did I.'' President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     understood that national unity against Hitler depended on \n     a sense of shared sacrifice, by both Rockefeller and Rosie \n     the Riveter.\n       Top income rates were boosted, and the estate tax was \n     increased so that fortunes exceeding $50 million would be \n     taxed at 70 percent. FDR spoke out boldly against war \n     profiteering, saying, ``I don't want to see a single war \n     millionaire created in the United States as a result of this \n     world disaster.''\n       Today the lives of some of our citizens are at risk. Others \n     are feeling the pain of the recession, losing their jobs, \n     savings and security. State and local governments, facing the \n     worst budget cuts since World War II, are laying off workers \n     and cutting education spending, children's health care and \n     basic human services.\n       Rather than facing these problems and appropriating the \n     money to resolve them, congressional leaders are using the \n     diversion of war to pass a tax cut for the wealthy that would \n     exacerbate budget shortfalls at all levels. While the \n     public's attention is riveted on Iraq, the Senate acts to \n     accelerate the repeal of the progressive estate tax.\n       At a time when states need $70 billion in federal aid to \n     close their deficits, federal priorities seem to be very \n     different. Will the costs of war be paid by reductions in \n     spending, mostly affecting our most vulnerable citizens? Will \n     there be clear domestic economic winners and losers in the \n     conduct of this war?\n       Political scientist Michael Lipsky observed a year ago that \n     this war ``will evidently excerbate the divide between rich \n     and poor.'' Wars have had this effect on the United States \n     before, but absolutely without precedent is a push for a \n     windfall tax cut for the wealthy as wartime expenses mount.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right to the point, we got voodoo II here the year \nbefore last with George W. Bush's tax cuts, and we are jumping back to \n$400 billion deficits. And now we are asking, with the budget that we \npassed, for voodoo III, to really run $700 billion deficits.\n  I wish they would hear that and listen to me. They have no idea. The \ninterest costs--the distinguished Presiding Officer, you come from a \nresponsible State. In the State of Texas, I can tell you, you have to \npay the bill. In fact, in my State, you cannot run for Governor unless \nyou promise to pay the bill.\n  But it has gotten so that now the Republicans have taken over, and \nyou can't run for the Senate unless you promise not to pay--not to \npay--the bill. They are taking over in this miasma of growth, growth. \nThe only thing that grows is the national debt, the interest costs, the \nwaste. There has been $300 to $400 billion waste since voodoo 1. There \nit is.\n  We could pay for all of these particular needs--there is $80 billion \nhere for the war--if we had a pay-as-you-go government up here in \nWashington. But they back off onto that deficit barley corn. They have \nno intent of paying for anything. Tax cuts, tax cuts, says Karl Rove. \nYou have to do it in order to get reelected. And it is a dirty shame. \nIt is a dirty shame.\n  I have been in government now for 50 years, and I have to say, \nimmodestly, I have been the longest serving member of the Budget \nCommittee. I have been chairman of that Budget Committee. As Governor \nof South Carolina, I got the Standard & Poors' and Moody's AAA credit \nrating for our State.\n  As a Senator, I voted for the balanced budget. And we cut the deficit \nwhen I was chairman of that Budget Committee, and those kinds of \nthings. I got together with Senator Gramm and Senator Rudman, and we \nhad Gramm-Rudman-Hollings to systematically cut $35 billion a year. We \njust passed a budget that increases the deficit by $350 billion, and \nthey are fighting over at the White House to make sure they get more \nthan $350 billion in tax cuts.\n  This sense of the Senate merely says to the President: You submit \nyour program. And if you don't, we have tax revenues to pay for this \nwar. And don't say the revenues are going to ruin the economy because \nit will take a year for the value-added tax to be implemented by the \nInternal Revenue Service. So if we pass this now, we are telling the \nmarket, like we did back in 1993, that we are going to start getting \nrid of the deficits, and paying down the debt.\n  We said, for 8 years: Pay down the debt. Pay down the debt. We don't \nsay that any longer. We are just saying, we are concerned about \ndeficits.\n  I can tell, my time is up. I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi for yielding me this time. I appreciate it very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina is one of my best friends. It is always a pleasure to hear him \naddress the Senate on a subject about which he feels strongly and where \nhe is truly an expert. He served as one of the first members of the \nBudget Committee and helped shape budget policies in Congress for many \nyears.\n  I remember that it seems like last week we were debating the budget \nresolution that contained provisions relating to assumptions about tax \npolicy\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\nand fiscal policy for the next fiscal year. The Senate had an \nopportunity to consider and vote on a lot of amendments and provisions \nin that budget resolution having to do with tax policy.\n  Of course, we all know that what we are confronted with is a request \nfrom the President for funding for supplemental funds for the balance \nof this fiscal year to help finance the war in Iraq and to help finance \nOperation Liberty Shield by providing funds to the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Department of Defense.\n  While this sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina does raise a subject about which we have thought and \ndiscussed a good bit in recent weeks, we hope the Senate will approve a \nmotion to table the amendment and continue to work our way through this \nbill so we can complete action on the appropriations measure tonight if \nat all possible. We can go to conference with the House and work out \ndifferences between their bill and ours and get these funds in the \nhands of the administration so we can get about the business of \nprotecting the security of our homeland and waging a winning war \nagainst terror. That is the purpose of this legislation. We hope the \nSenate does not get too sidetracked on what our mission is tonight.\n  I hope Senators will be aware. We called over to the Finance \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy, to let them know \nabout the amendment and that we had an opportunity for them, if they \nwanted to, to come over and speak on the subject. Not having had a \nrequest for time, I am prepared to yield time back and proceed to a \nvote on the Byrd amendment or in relation to the Byrd amendment and \nthen the Hollings amendment.\n  Mr. President, if there is no problem with that, I yield back the \ntime on this side. I move to table the Hollings amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote not to table the Hollings \namendment.\n  We still do not know how much the war in Iraq will cost, and we do \nnot know how we will pay for those costs.\n  I have been concerned about the United States shouldering the entire \nfinancial burden not only of the ongoing war, but also of the necessary \npostwar reconstruction. The President has released a list of more than \n40 nations that are supporting our effort in Iraq. However, a close \nlook at the nations on that list will show that the overwhelming \nmajority of them are in no position--and have made no commitment--to \nhelp pay for the effort.\n  In comparison, during the 1991 gulf war, our allies paid for 88 \npercent of the costs of the war. We have no such assurance this time.\n  Because of this uncertainty, I believe the Senate should be \ndiscussing and debating this issue. That is, discussing and debating \nhow we will meet the costs of the war and the costs of reconstruction.\n  Will we receive contributions from our allies? Will we use revenues \nfrom Iraqi oil after the war is over? Will we cut wasteful government \nspending?\n  These questions need to be asked and debated. That is why I voted not \nto table the Hollings amendment. With his amendment, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina tried to raise the issue of how we will pay for the war \nand reconstruction. And, his amendment was intended to force the Senate \nto debate this issue. I believe we need to have that debate, and that \nis why I voted not to table the Hollings amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween the two votes be 10 minutes; the second vote be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. There is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I don't know if the Senator from Mississippi can answer \nthis question. The Senator from Louisiana had talked to Senator \nStevens' staff and Senator Stevens on the amendment. We will work on \nthis during the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My understanding is Senator Stevens wanted an \nopportunity to talk about that.\n  Mr. REID. We will go ahead and start the vote then.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 508\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Byrd amendment, No. 508.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when Senator \nSchumer offers his first-degree amendment regarding first responders, \nupon the reporting of the amendment it be set aside and Senator Specter \nbe recognized to offer a first-degree amendment on the same subject; \nthat the amendments be debated concurrently with a total of 30 minutes \nof debate to be controlled by Senator Schumer and Senator Specter--\nactually, I asked my colleague to yield me 5 of those minutes--or their \ndesignees, and that no amendment be in order to either amendment prior \nto a vote in relation to each amendment; upon the use or yielding back \nof time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Specter \namendment to be followed immediately by a vote in relation to the \nSchumer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to inquire as to whether or \nnot, in the opinion of the distinguished manager of the bill, we might \nbe able to finish action by no later than 9 o'clock?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are doing everything we can. I thought \nwe were going to finish by 5:30 but we are having votes that we might \notherwise not have had, if we proceeded with the agreements we had \npreviously. But we are doing our best to be finished. My feeling is \nthis vote will take place at about 7:30, between 7:30 and 7:35. After \nthat, we are inquiring to see how many more votes. There are two votes, \nactually.\n  If it would be in order, I ask the second vote be 10 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that the second vote on this sequence to come be 10 \nminutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will do everything we can to shorten the time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wonder if it might be possible to get agreement that the \nvote would occur--the final passage would be voted at 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We can't do it because we are still reviewing the \nmanagers' package.\n  Mr. REID. I would say, if I could, if the Senator would yield, \nthrough the Chair, I think we have a real good opportunity of finishing \nthe bill quickly after these two votes. We will need cooperation of \nboth sides but I think we can do that.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the appropriation for the Office for Domestic \n   Preparedness, Department of Homeland Security, by $2,330,000,000)\n\n       On page 37, strike lines 3 through 25 and insert the \n     following:\n       For additional amounts for the ``Office for Domestic \n     Preparedness'', as authorized by the Homeland Security Act of \n     2002 (Public Law 107-296), the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 \n     (Public Law 107-56), and the National Defense Authorization \n     Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-201), for grants to States and \n     local governments, $3,000,000,000, to remain available until \n     December 31, 2003: Provided, That of the total amount \n     appropriated, $2,500,000,000 shall be made available for \n     grants to States under section 1014 of the USA PATRIOT Act of \n     2001, subject to the minimum grant amount requirement of that \n     section, and the requirement that remaining amounts be \n     distributed on a per capita basis, for the purchase of needed \n     equipment, including interoperable communications equipment, \n     and to provide training, exercise, planning, and personnel \n     funds to State and local first responders: Provided further, \n     That the Office for Domestic Preparedness (referred to under \n     this heading as the ``Office'') shall transfer funds for such \n     grants to States not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and not less than 80 percent of funds \n     made available to each State under this proviso shall be made \n     available to units of local government based on population \n     within 30 days of receipt by the State: Provided further, \n     That up to 20 percent of the amount made available under the \n     first proviso shall be for costs of law enforcement, fire, \n     emergency medical services, and other emergency personnel, \n     including overtime expenses and reimbursement of States (in \n     addition to personnel costs related to training), local \n     governments, and Indian tribes for additional costs incurred \n     to replace first responders who are called to active duty in \n     the Reserves for periods of not less than 6 consecutive \n     months: Provided further, That $500,000,000 shall be for \n     personnel costs of States and units of local government, \n     subject to the minimum grant amount requirement of section \n     1014 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the requirement that \n     remaining amounts be distributed on a per capita basis, for \n     enhanced security around critical infrastructure (as that \n     term is defined in section 1016 of the USA PATRIOT Act of \n     2001 (Public Law 107-56)), the Office shall transfer funds \n     for such grants to States not later than 30 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, and not less than 50 percent \n     of such funds made available to each State shall be made \n     available to units of local government within 30 days of \n     receipt.\n       For additional amounts under the Acts referred to in the \n     preceding paragraph for grants to high threat urban areas, \n     which should be identified by criteria that include credible \n     threat, vulnerability, the presence of infrastructure of \n     national importance, population, and needs of public safety \n     organizations, for the purchase of equipment, including \n     interoperable communications equipment, and to provide \n     training, planning, exercise, and personnel costs, \n     $1,045,000,000: Provided, That not less than 80 percent of \n     funds made available under this proviso shall be made \n     available to units of local government: Provided further, \n     That up to 20 percent of this amount shall be for costs of \n     law enforcement, fire, emergency medical services, and other \n     emergency personnel, including overtime expenses (in addition \n     to personnel costs related to training).\n       For additional amounts for such office for programs as \n     authorized under section 33 of the Federal Fire Prevention \n     and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.), \n     $155,000,000, to remain available until December 31, 2003.\n       For an additional amount, $130,000,000, which shall be \n     transferred to, and merged with, funds in the ``Community \n     Oriented Policing Services, Department of Justice'', \n     appropriations account for Public Safety and Community \n     Policing Grants pursuant to title I of the 1994 Act, for the \n     hiring of law enforcement officers to prevent acts of \n     terrorism and other violent and drug-related crimes, of which \n     up to 30 percent shall be available for overtime expenses.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 515\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 515.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funds for protection and preparedness of high \n     threat urban areas under the Office for Domestic Preparedness)\n\n       On page 37, line 10, strike ``$2,000,000,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$2,200,000,000''.\n       On page 37, line 12, strike ``$1,420,000,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$1,270,000,000''.\n       On page 37, line 17, strike ``$450,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$300,000,000''.\n       On page 37, line 23, strike ``$100,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$600,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the essence of my amendment is to provide \nadditional funds for high threat urban areas. This amendment would add \nan additional $500 million over the $100 million currently contained in \nthe bill for the protection or preparedness of high threat urban areas.\n  This increase would be achieved with $200 million in additional funds \nadded to the supplemental appropriations bill, and a reduction of $300 \nmillion in State and local grants for other accounts in the Office of \nDomestic Preparedness.\n  The amendment which has been submitted by the Senator from New York \nwould increase the appropriation for the Office of Domestic \nPreparedness from $2 billion to $4.3 billion. My amendment would \nincrease the appropriation from $2 billion to $2.2 billion. And while \nthere is no doubt the high-threat urban areas and the Office of \nDomestic Preparedness could use additional funds, the fact is, that \nincrease of more than $200 million which is in my amendment would, in \neffect, tend to break the bank.\n  The distinguished manager of the bill, Senator Stevens, is trying to \nkeep this bill within $80 billion, and that can be accommodated with \nthe addition of $200 million.\n  The urban areas have very substantial risks involved. In very brief \nsummary, the city of Philadelphia has had expenses of almost $30 \nmillion annually.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated April 2 \nfrom Mayor John Street to me be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, there is no doubt that major cities, such \nas Philadelphia, with airports and seaports and Independence Hall and \nthe Liberty Bell, have much higher costs than cities which do not have \nthese facilities.\n  I have discussed the issue with Mayor Street. The letter which I have \nhad printed in the Record is a succinct summary, so we can observe this \nvery short time limit which has been agreed to.\n  Similarly, I have conferred with Mayor Tom Murphy of Pittsburgh, who, \nagain, makes the comment about the additional costs.\n  I have had an opportunity--actually, I was called by Mayor Bloomberg \nof New York City about the very substantial increases in costs there, \nand during the markup in the Appropriations Committee earlier this week \ncommented about these factors and have sought to increase the funding \nfrom the $100 million for high-risk urban areas to a total of some $600 \nmillion.\n  Again, it would be highly desirable if we had more money, as \nsuggested by Senator Schumer, but that simply cannot be accommodated \nwithin the current budget constraints.\n  In the conversations with Mayor Bloomberg, he pointed out about the \nfact that police cost some $5 million a month, and there are other \ncosts in the range of $8 million a month for the United Nations, with a \nvery heavy imposition of costs on New York City, commenting in a way \nvery similar to the mayors of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\n  There is no doubt these costs really ought to be borne principally by \nthe Federal Government. In the bill, language was inserted by Senator \nGregg and language by myself which would require the Secretary of \nHomeland Defense to make a report to the Congress within 60 days to \nidentify what are the costs in safeguarding airports, seaports, \nlandmarks such as Independence Hall, such as the Liberty Bell, and to \nmake a recommendation as to an allocation by the Federal Government, \nand whether such costs, in part, should be borne by other entities. \nThat will enable us to make a determination as to how this $600 million \nwill be spent, and to have a rationale for what the expenses will be \nwith the specification of the costs involved and an allocation between \nthe Federal Government and other governmental agencies if it is \ndetermined that would be appropriate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                             City of Philadelphia,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                  Philadelphia, PA, April 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     9400 Federal Building,\n     Philadelphia, PA.\n       Dear Senator Specter: In Fiscal Year 2002, the City of \n     Philadelphia spent $21.2 million in increased domestic \n     security costs. These costs include overtime incurred by the \n     Police, Fire and Public Health employees associated with the \n     formation of Rapid Assessment Teams. These teams, consisting \n     of employees from each department responded to all critical \n     incidents citywide. Additionally, $8 million was allocated \n     for security improvements to city facilities. These \n     improvements include installations of bollards around the \n     perimeter of City Hall, installation of security access and \n     surveillance systems in the One Parkway Building and \n     installation of security cameras and metal detectors at other \n     facilities. The Police Department enhanced coverage in Center \n     City and provided enhanced security staffing at the \n     Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Red Cross Headquarters and the \n     City's Emergency Operations Center. An intensive training was \n     given to a team of police officers and supervisors that may \n     be called upon to respond to a hazardous materials incident.\n       Going forward, the Police Commissioner formed the Bureau of \n     Counter-Terrorism absorbing the Detective Bureau's Organized \n     Crime Unit as its foundation. The 76 member Bureau is \n     developing new methods and initiatives to pursue counter-\n     terrorism preparedness. These initiatives include strategic \n     and tactical training, equipment purchase, inter-agency and \n     regional cooperation and coordination, and community \n     outreach. The Bureau meets regularly with task forces such as \n     the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, the US Attorney's Anti-\n     Terror Task Force and the US Coast Guard Task Force to keep \n     current with the latest counter-terrorism strategies. These \n     initiatives are likely to cost about $10 million annually.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John F. Street,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n                                  SECURITY COSTS IN RESPONSE TO SEPTEMBER 11TH\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       Full year\n                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             Purchased       Matrl., Supplies\n                                          Personnel           Services         & Equipment           Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPolice Department (General Fund)....          3,949,187             47,006          1,400,437          5,396,630\nPolice Department (Airport).........          3,288,784  .................  .................          3,228,784\nFire Department.....................          2,810,271  .................  .................          2,810,271\nPublic Property.....................            891,000            360,000             17,000          1,268,000\nOffice of Fleet Management..........             54,034            102,770  .................            156,804\nPublic Health.......................            340,178  .................  .................            340,178\nTriplex Security....................  .................          8,000,000  .................          8,000,000\n                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total...........................         11,273,454          8,509,776          1,147,437         21,200,667\n                                     ===========================================================================\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\n \n    Total General Fund..............          8,044,670          8,509,776          1,417,437         17,971,883\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much of my 15 minutes remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have asked for a portion of the time of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania because we had worked to try to reach an \nagreement between the two amendments so that they would be put together \nand have an amendment we could adopt. We are unable to do that.\n  I am compelled to state I will oppose the first-degree amendment of \nSenator Schumer. It is a situation where, as far as I am concerned, \nthere is ample money in the House bill, if we are compelled to raise \nthe amount that is in our bill. But it is the kind of situation where \nwe prefer to have this amendment not be adopted now, so we can find a \nway to work the matter out with the House.\n  We have $100 million in the bill. The Schumer amendment, as I \nunderstand it, as drafted, now adds $600 million. I oppose going to \nthat height. That would, in effect, take it to the level of the House. \nAnd the administration opposes the level in the House bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I believe I have time. I will yield 3 \nminutes to myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I heard my friend from Pennsylvania speak \non----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator allow me to interrupt \nfor a problem that has come up.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Please.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The problem has come up in connection with the unanimous \nconsent agreement. There was no time allocated to those who might want \nto oppose the Specter amendment. And, as I understand it, a Senator on \nthe Democratic side wishes to oppose the Specter amendment. In \nfairness, I ask unanimous consent she be given 5 minutes to speak; and \nif it raises additional items the Senator has not spoken to that he \nwishes to speak to, I would allocate an additional 5 minutes to Senator \nSpecter, so there would be a comment back and forth. All right. I make \nthat request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I heard my friend from Pennsylvania speak \nfor his amendment. I will support that amendment because it is better \nthan what is currently in the bill, although I wish it had more money. \nI wish it had money for the FIRE and COPS Programs, which the amendment \nI am offering with my colleagues from New York and Maryland, does. And \nI wish it gave more funding to high-threat, high-need areas, and to all \nother areas. I also wish that it ensured, as my amendment does, that \nthe Department of Homeland Security would be required to provide the \nfunds within 30 days and that the amendment would guarantee an 80/20 \nsplit of those funds between the States and localities.\n\n  The Schumer amendment is the amendment that provides sufficient \nfunding for police, for fire, for first responders all across the \ncountry. We all know how beleaguered they are. We know how stretched \nthey are. We know whether they be in a large city like New York City, \nor a medium-sized city like Rochester or Syracuse, or a suburb, or even \na rural area, our police and firefighters have been pushed to the \nlimit. They must meet their regular law enforcement and public safety \nresponsibilities, but now have new responsibilities under 9/11, and \nfrom the Iraq war.\n  And many police and fire departments have to do more with fewer \npeople and fewer resources, because of the terrible budget deficits at \nthe State and local level, and because many are in the Reserves and \nhave been called up and are proudly serving our country.\n  So we have an obligation. If we are going to fight the war on \nterrorism at home, we have to vote for this amendment. We cannot just \nfight the war on terrorism overseas and not fight it at home. Our first \nresponders, our police and fire, in a very real sense are on the front \nlines.\n  So I hope we will get support for the Schumer amendment. I hope we \nwill back up our police and firefighters. I hope we will back up our \nlocal governments and our first responders.\n  The idea that we can win the war on terror just by fighting it \noverseas and giving it all the money for needs overseas--I am for that \nand support that proudly--but not do what we need to do domestically \nmakes no sense. We will rue the day.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for an amendment that really provides \nsufficient funding. Again, I am for the Specter amendment. It is an \nimprovement. I salute my colleague from Pennsylvania for offering it. \nBut if you really want to give the dollars to police and fire in the \nway that they need them, then the Schumer amendment is the answer. It \nis not a Democratic or Republican amendment. It is supported by police \nand fire organizations, both management and union throughout the \ncountry. It is supported by local governments. It is what our badly \nstrapped local governments need in this post-9/11 world.\n  Again, a good team needs a good offense and good defense. Our \nsoldiers overseas are providing the offense. But it is our police, our \nfirefighters, our first responders who are providing the defense. We \nneed to back them up and back them up fully as well.\n  I urge support of the Schumer amendment and yield 3 minutes to my \ncolleague who has been with me all along on this issue, the Senator \nfrom New York, Mrs. Clinton.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I support the Schumer-Clinton-Mikulski \namendment because I believe it more accurately reflects the needs that \nhave been conveyed. Even in the materials that the Senator from \nPennsylvania has entered into the Record, the kind of requests we are \nhearing from mayors and county executives and police chiefs and fire \nchiefs far exceed what is available. It has been now 18 months where we \nhave failed to arrive at an understanding of what our local communities \nand our States require in order to fulfill their obligations on the \nfront lines of this second front.\n  Once again, I believe we have an opportunity to do what is needed, \nbut we are not taking it. The Schumer amendment provides the kind of \nthoughtful analysis and disbursement of funds that will most guarantee \nthat the money, No. 1, gets out of the Federal Government within 30 \ndays--something not in the Specter amendment--and that once it gets to \nthe States, it has to be distributed within 60 days. And we appreciate \nthat. But one of the problems we have had is getting the money out of \nthe Federal Government to the States, and we also have to assure that \nthe money gets where it is most needed--to our first responders.\n  I urge our colleagues to support the Schumer amendment as being far \nmore reflective of the overall needs our country confronts when it \ncomes to homeland security.\n  Across the country, there are common sounds that should trigger an \nalarm in all of us: the sound of a firehouse door closing for the final \ntime; a police officer turning in his or her badge as it slides across \nthe desk; or an ambulance door locking. In the cities\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\nand the towns in the States we represent our first responders are \nlosing their jobs.\n  States and cities are trying to deal with budget deficits--some the \nworst in a generation, and they simple do not have the money to keep \npaying for additional homeland security costs.\n  We need to work together--Republicans and Democrats--to provide them \nwith the resources they need to strengthen our domestic defense.\n  Yes, we have made progress since September 11, but we have not done \nenough. That same message echoes from report after report, from our \nexperts, from independent commissions, from our police commissioners, \nfire chiefs, mayors, doctors and nurses--we have not done enough to \nprevent and respond to another terrorist attack.\n  I cannot find a single credible security expert who has said, ``We're \nfine. We've done enough.'' ``There's no need to guard our chemical \nplants and nuclear plants. It's okay if we only check 2 percent of the \ncontainers that come through our ports. Don't worry about hiring border \nguards they don't need the extra support. We don't need to give our \npolice officers, firefighters, and emergency response personnel the \nequipment they need. We're fine, and `All's Quiet on the Homefront.' ''\n  You know last week, the President was asked about how long the war in \nIraq would take and he responded correctly, ``How ever long it takes.''\n  That's the same attitude we need to use for homeland security--\n``whatever it takes'' to protect the American people. This isn't a new \npublic work project or an example of frivolous spending; this is about \nsecuring our country on the frontlines here at home. And for 18 months \nour cities and States and counties have been shouldering this burden \nalone. Homeland security is a national priority and these costs and \nthese responsibilities should be shared by the Nation.\n  So what are we doing?\n  What we are doing 18 months after that tragic day in September when \nnearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives still debating homeland \nsecurity?\n  Still debating whether or not we should not take the steps we need to \ntake in order to prevent another day like that from ever happening \nagain. Still talking about whether or not we should provide our first \nresponders with the support they need.\n  Homeland security is a concern we all share. We should not allow \npolitics to prevail over our Nation's protection. We should not let it \nget in the way of strengthening our border and port security, improving \nsecurity at our chemical and nuclear plants, and providing critical \nsupport for our police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel, and \npublic health officials.\n  Why would some in this Chamber willingly say ``no'' to critical steps \nthat would improve our domestic defense? Why would our colleagues who \ncare just as much about their constituent's safety as I care about the \npeople of New York say, ``no, this isn't the right vehicle for these \ninvestments. No, this isn't the right time for homeland security \nbecause this supplemental bill is for spending that's an emergency-it's \nfor the war.''\n  This is the right vehicle. This is the right time. This is an \nemergency. This is funding that does go toward winning the war against \nterrorism here at home. And this would be the right moment for \nWashington to send a clear message to the millions of first responders \nacross this Nation who have sacrificed in order to keep us safe--we \nsupport you too.\n  This amendment that I am proposing with Senator Schumer and Senator \nMikulski would provide $4.3 billion for critical first responder \nfunding. It includes $3 billion for grants to States and local \ngovernments; another $1.045 billion for high-threat areas like New York \nCity; $155 million for the FIRE Act, and $130 million for the COPS \nProgram.\n  Yes, the President's proposal last week was a good start, but it is \nnot nearly enough for what we need to do here at home in order to fight \nthis two-front war.\n  This amendment would provide $3 billion to Office of Domestic \nPreparedness at DHS for grants to States and Local Governments:\n  $2.5 billion of this funding would go toward equipment, training, \nexercises, planning, and first responder personnel costs.\n  The Federal Government must pass the money to States within 30 days.\n  States must pass on at least 80 percent of this money to local \ncommunities within 30 days of the date they receive it.\n  And States and local governments may use up to 20 percent of this \n$2.5 billion for first responder personnel costs, including overtime.\n  For the last 18 months, our majors, fire chiefs, police \ncommissioners, and public health officials have been telling me that \nthey need more help from Washington to better protect the American \npeople. This amendment provides that help. It guarantees that the \nFederal resources will get out of Washington and to the state houses \nand to our local first responders quickly so that they can continue to \ndo what they do best-keep America safe.\n  In January I gave a speech at John Jay in New York City to talk about \nhow our country needed to renew its commitment to strengthen our \ndomestic defense. I also released a report that showed how 70 percent \nof New York cities and counties had not received any federal homeland \nsecurity funding.\n  I continue to work with the U.S. Conference of Mayors, national \npolice organizations, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians \nfrom across the country to find the best way to support our first \nresponders. And I spoke with Secretary Ridge the other day to talk \nabout improving this formula to meet our country's needs, and he \nagrees.\n  Within the $3 billion for State grants, $500 million is set-aside for \nStates and local communities to secure critical infrastructure \nsecurity--bridges, nuclear and chemical plants, water treatment \nfacilities, communication centers to name a few.\n  All of this money may be used for first responder personnel costs, \nincluding overtime. The States must provide 80 percent of this funding \nto local communities, with states allowed to use 20 percent. And again, \nthe federal government must send this money to the States within 30 \ndays, and the States must pass through 80 percent of the funds to local \ncommunities within 30 days.\n  These ideas follow my block grant proposal of 2001 and I am very \npleased that the leadership has adopted my other proposal to put aside \nmore than $1 billion for high threat areas. And I want to thank my \ncolleague Senator Byrd for understanding that New York's needs are \ndifferent because it is the top target for terrorists.\n  The $1.045 billion for high-threat areas would be disbursed based on \nwhether or not there is a credible threat, over-all vulnerability, \ncritical infrastructure that is important to the Nation, population, \nand the needs of public safety organizations.\n  This isn't just good for New York City and DC; it's good for all of \nour Nation's most vulnerable targets. This applies to Arizona and the \nrecent threat against the nuclear power plant. This amendment would \nhelp cover extra security costs. Recent news reports suggested that al-\nQaida was targeting the Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. This would \nhelp Hawaii cover costs and take precautions. It would assist Las Vegas \nNevada where the population doubles Friday through Sunday. This would \nbenefit Florida and help them cover costs to secure Disney World.\n  These are high-threat areas. They are different and they need extra \nassistance. Let's look at recent ``code orange'' costs. According to \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors, they estimate that cities are spending \nan extra $70 million a week. In six months, when this supplemental runs \nout, that's $2 billion in costs. $2 billion they don't have, but costs \nthey will incur because they are honoring their commitment to protect \nthis country.\n  During the ``code orange,'' New York and New York City are spending a \ntotal of $12 million a week. In the supplemental, the President set \naside only $50 million to cover such costs for every high-risk area. \nNew York will have exhausted those resources by the end of next week. \nThat's why we need this extra $1 billion for high-threat areas. And we \ncannot forget that it's not just in our cities where extra security \nsteps are being taken. Who would have thought that a terrorist cell was \nworking in Lackawanna, NY? This could\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\nhave been a small town in Missouri, Texas, or Pennsylvania.\n  I know that some of my colleagues believe that their State isn't a \ntarget--they may think that because their state is small, it's safe. I \nbet the chief of police in Lackawanna, NY, would beg to differ about \nthe likelihood of terrorists turning up in small towns. He would say we \ncannot forget that the terrorists continue to plot and plan against us, \nand we can't predict exactly where they will turn up.\n  Yesterday, the FBI issued a new warning to their field agents to look \nout for people making chemicals like Ricin. Yesterday, the Wall Street \nJournal reported that the Bush administration was getting ready to \nlaunch a plan to increase chemical plant security. The Department of \nHomeland Security's spokesman said, ``We realize that voluntary efforts \nalone will not be sufficient to assure the appropriate level of \nsecurity across the chemical sector.''\n  And in the last few weeks, we heard Secretary of State Powell, FBI \nDirector Mueller, Secretary Ridge and CIA Director Tenet all state that \nanother attack by al-Qaida is not a matter of ``if'' but ``when.''\n   We can all hope for the best, but I think it's best to plan and \nprepare for the worst.\n  Why would any of us want to take a risk that ``when'' that day comes, \nit would be in someone else's back yard--a tragedy in another state \nacross the Continental Divide and not my problem. When any city or \nState or American interest abroad has been attacked like we were. \nAmerica was attacked and Washington and the country united to deal with \nthat aftermath.\n  Again, we have to do that today to pass this amendment and improve \nour domestic defense.\n  I believe that Retired Colonel Randy Larsen, from the ANSER Institute \nsaid it best when he testified about the Hart-Rudman report on November \n14, 2002. He said, ``All of us want what is best for America. But we do \nnot have much time. We must get it right--or close to right--very soon. \nI cannot repeat often enough: America is at war. We need to act like it \nwhile there is still time to prepare.''\n  But they way to prepare, the way to fund homeland security isn't by \ntaking money from existing traditional first responder programs. That's \nwhy this amendment also includes $155 million for the FIRE Act, and \n$130 million for the COPS Program. We need to fully fund every \ntraditional first responder program. Since 1994, COPS has helped nearly \n12,950 jurisdictions through 27 different grant programs. As of \nSeptember 2002, COPS had provided funding for 116,573 community \npolicing professionals across the country.\n  It has played a critical role in reducing crime. It has worked well \nin the past, and it will continue to work well in the future to help \nour communities fight crime. And it should not be used to fund homeland \nsecurity.\n  The same applies to the FIRE Act. The $155 million here ensures full \nfunding--$900 million--for the FIRE Act for FY 2003. This program \nassists fire departments in protecting communities and fire fighters' \nhealth and safety. Local communities may use the funding for training, \nequipment and additional staffing.\n  Currently, 2/3 of this Nation's fire departments do not meet the \nstandards for adequate staffing. Congress would never allow our Army to \nengage in a war with 2/3 of its divisions understaffed.\n  But this is exactly what we are asking our fire fighters to do. To \ndate this grant program has received requests totaling more than $2 \nbillion. The program's funding levels only allow it to award grants \nthat a small percentage of that need. In the event of a terrorist act, \nfire fighters are the troops on the front lines. And they deserve our \nfull support.\n  So when we think about all of the good that comes out of this \namendment and the others that strengthen our domestic defense, why \nwouldn't every leader support these steps?\n  There are some who may try to defeat domestic defense funding by \nsaying that the only dollars that should be included in the emergency \nsupplemental are those that go toward winning this war. I agree, we \nshould only be talking about funding to fight the war, but I believe we \nneed to fight the war on all fronts that it is being waged.\n  Every support that our troops in Iraq need to win will have the full \nsupport of Congress. We cannot forget about our men and women who \ncontinue to fight al-Qaida in Afghanistan--they too deserve every \nresource they need. And so do our domestic troops, our police, \nfirefighters, and EMT's, on the frontlines here at home. The \nPresident's proposal last week was a good start, but it is not nearly \nenough. The Congress and the administration have the opportunity to do \nso much good for our first responders and strengthen the domestic \ndefense of our Nation. It would be a shame if we did not take advantage \nof this moment, use this as the moment Washington turned the page and \nsaid the time has come, whatever it takes, we will give it our all to \nsecure our country.\n  But instead of using this as a chance to do more for our country, \nwe're hearing phrases like ``beat them straight up.'' ``We will fight \nit out.'' ``Defeat them.'' Those aren't words meant for Saddam Hussein \nor al-Qaida. Those are fighting words against those of us who are \ntrying to get more homeland security funding, new masks for \nfirefighters, extra patrols along our borders and at nuclear power \nplants, guards at tunnels and bridges, new high tech equipment to track \nradioactive material, and more help for the Coast Guard.\n  We seem to have gotten stuck in a dialogue that eliminates our \nability to look at a great American tradition that is at stake in this \ndebate. Some of our country's greatest successes reside in our ability \nto do whatever it takes to do what is right for the greater good of our \ncountry.\n  Imagine if George Washington had decided at the battle of Brooklyn \nthat it was too much of a challenge for the army to retreat to \nManhattan that night? That decisive act saved the majority of our army, \nmade victory inevitable, and this debate possible.\n  What about Lewis and Clark? What if they turned back just after they \nhad embarked on their journey? Or imagine if Jefferson believed that it \nwould take too long and that it was too much for two men to search for \nthat path to the Pacific? But his belief in them, the task at hand, and \nthat expansion and exploration was critical to a young nation.\n  What about Josuah Chamberline, a professor from Bowdoin College in \nMaine and what he did for our country at the battle of Gettysburg. He \nand his regiment stood their ground at Little Round Top. Against \noverwhelming odds and the future of the Union resting on his shoulders, \nChamberline charged. His regiment followed, they prevented the south \nfrom taking that hill, and our Union was preserved.\n  Or when President Lincoln gave the final speech about Reconstruction \nin April 1865, he did not buckle at the great challenge of uniting a \ndivided and partially destroyed country.\n  Or today, what if we as a Congress decided to only partially support \nour troops in Iraq? What kind of victory would follow if we balked at \nthe challenge? So then why would we not do the same for our domestic \ndefense? Why wouldn't we support our first responders?\n  Again, our country's success rises and falls in our ability to \nconfront great challenges. On September 11th, we were tested once \nagain. The new challenges that came out of that tragic day are what we \nare debating today. These are the stakes.\n  The Senate has a choice to meet the new demands against the war on \nterrorism at home, to finally give it our all to protect this country, \nand to carry on this tradition of never giving up and doing what it \ntakes to do what is right.\n  Or we can bow our heads, look the other way and pray that tragedy \ndoes not strike again on our shores and hope that if the alarms do ring \nin our fire stations and police stations, our brave men and women in \nuniform here at home are ready to answer the call to 9-1-1.\n  I urge my colleagues to make the right choice and support this \namendment.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Schumer, \nClinton, and Mikulski in offering this amendment that addresses funding \nshortfalls for the Federal, State, and local first responders who are \non the front lines of the war on terrorism. I\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\nam disappointed that since 9/11, the administration has failed to \nprovide adequate funding for local governments to prepare for the \npossibility of new terrorist attacks.\n  This funding is critically important to Hawaii. The Hawaii State \nCivil Defense estimates that a response to a weapons of mass \ndestruction attack would challenge the State's emergency response \nsystem. As with all States, in the event of a terrorist attack, Hawaii \nwould rely on Federal, State, and local officials. However, unlike all \nStates but Alaska, external assistance from the U.S. mainland is not \nimmediately available. Hawaii's geographic location makes mutual aid \nfrom mainland States or from other Pacific jurisdictions impossible.\n  As a result, Hawaii's State Civil Defense estimates that each of the \nState's four counties need the capability to sustain an effective \nresponse to any weapons of mass destruction attack for up to 72 hours.\n  Independent experts and government officials have repeatedly warned \nthat first responders do not have sufficient resources. A Council on \nForeign Relations Task Force Report entitled ``America--Still \nUnprepared, Still in Danger'' concluded that first responders are not \nprepared for a weapons of mass destruction attack. According to the \nsame report, first responders lack the training and equipment to \nprotect themselves and the public in an emergency and do not have \nradios that can communicate with one another. In fact, the National \nFire Protection Association estimates that only one-quarter of the \nNation's fire departments have equipment to communicate with State and \nFederal emergency officials.\n  Our amendment takes important steps to respond to funding shortfalls \nby providing $4.3 billion for first responders, including $3 billion \nfor State and local first responders.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nSchumer's amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor.\n  We spent much of last year on the Senate floor talking about how to \nreorganize our Federal Government to meet and beat the challenge of \nterrorism. In the end, we passed a bill creating a Department of \nHomeland Security that for the first time is refocusing and \nreorganizing the Federal Government to make America safer.\n  But we have said all along that while better organization is a \nnecessary prerequisite to making us safer, it isn't enough. We need to \nput dollars where the danger is. You can't protect your house in a \ndangerous neighborhood with a jerry-rigged lock or no lock at all. A \n``Beware of Dog'' sign isn't good enough. You need to spend some money. \nYou need to buy a real lock. You need to get a decent dog.\n  The President often says that America has the resolve it needs to win \nthis war against terrorism. And that is true. Americans are resolute. \nThey are courageous. They are prepared to face down danger and do what \nit takes to overcome it. That is especially true of the men and women \nin our fire departments, police departments, emergency medical offices, \nand hospitals the men and women we call first responders.\n  Resolve, however, will only go so far if it isn't matched by real \nresources. Can resolve buy interoperable communications equipment? Pay \nfor firefighters' overtime? Install a security system at a port? \nUpgrade the information sharing databases in local communities? \nDramatically improve public health systems to deal with biological or \nchemical attacks? No all those urgent improvements and others demand \nmore than resolve. They demand resources.\n  Right now the resources are nowhere to be found. This administration \nseems determined to do homeland security on the cheap adding just $300 \nmillion to the budget for next fiscal year for homeland security. And \nthe reason boils down to one reason and one reason only. The \nadministration is committed to protecting $2 trillion in unfair, \nunfocused, and ineffective tax cuts, at all costs. On this, it will not \nbudge. It will not yield. It will not reconsider a single digit or a \nsingle dollar.\n  That irrational and ideological commitment to those unaffordable tax \ncuts has squeezed out every other priority. It has raided the national \ncupboard at a time when we desperately need new resources to tackle new \nthreats.\n  America has the greatest military in the world, and that is because \nwe have paid for it. Generation after generation, we have worked \ntogether across party lines and every other division to invest in our \nArmed Forces and the men and women who dedicate their lives to the \ncommon defense. We are truly, to recall President Kennedy, willing to \npay any price and bear any burden to deter and defeat foreign threats.\n  There is no way around this: If we want the best domestic defenses, \nwe will have to pay for them, too.\n  At the State and local level, where fiscal crises are already forcing \ncuts in services, the Federal Government's failure to invest is \nespecially serious.\n  The amendment under consideration today addresses the critical \nshortfalls facing our local communities by providing $3 billion in \nfirst responder grants to States in the wartime supplemental budget, \nand over $1 billion for grants to high threat urban areas. In addition \nto these first responder grants, the amendment provides $155 million in \ngrants to fire departments to fully fund the $900 million authorized \nlevel, and an additional $130 million to the COPS Program, which will \nfund additional police costs.\n  This is the least we can provide. As you may know, I have called for \na still greater investment--$7.5 billion for our first responders above \nand beyond the President's proposal in next year's budget--and $16 \nbillion overall in that budget above and beyond the paltry $300 million \nincrease.\n  But this amendment, along with the other amendments I am proud to \ncosponsor that will come before the Senate today, is a good start, a \nnecessary start. Let me give you a few examples of the urgent needs \nthroughout America today that it would begin to address:\n  New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said his city is currently spending \n$5 million a week to post armed units at potential targets like Times \nSquare, conduct bioterrorism detection, and prepare police in the five \nboroughs to operate as independent departments should the Manhattan \nheadquarters be disabled in an emergency.\n  According to The Washington Post in an article published April 1--\nand, no, unfortunately it wasn't an April Fool's joke--Los Angeles \n``has grown so desperate waiting for federal money that last week it \nreluctantly raided a municipal trust fund for $4.5 million and bought \n1,000 chemical protection suits for firefighters and police.'' L.A. has \nalso reduced staffing at its 24-hour emergency operation center in part \nto save money on security costs.\n  According to The Baltimore Sun, the mayor's office in Baltimore \nestimates that the city needs to spend another $8.4 million on new \ncommunications and hazmat equipment, protective gear, and training, not \nto mention another $122 million to upgrade water treatment plants, \nbuild a new emergency operations center, and more.\n  The list goes on. My own home community of New Haven, CT, has been \nable to outfit about 10 percent--just 10 percent--of its 300 \nfirefighters with protective equipment that will be needed to respond \nin the event of a chemical or biological attack.\n  Let's face it. Meeting those needs and others will take more money \nfrom Washington, plain and simple. But some don't seem to understand \nthat. The majority leader, Senator Frist, was quoted in CongressDaily \nas saying that, ``It is unnecessary and wasteful to spend more money at \nthe federal level. The problem is not the federal availability of \nmoney. It's getting it down to the local level.''\n  With all respect, that is just not the case. In fact, according to \nthe National Governors Association, States have already obligated or \nspent more than 90 percent of their Federal funds. And to complicate \nthings, many States have been spending their own money for 15 months \nbut have yet to be reimbursed by the slow and cumbersome process \nthrough which money flows from the Federal Government to States and \nlocalities. This is only exacerbating budget crises at the State and \nlocal level, where many communities are actually laying off and \nreducing the number of first responders--so we are going backwards. The \nreality is that we need to get more funding to first responders, and we \nneed to get it to them as quickly as possible.\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\n  The bottom line is this: We must get our first responders more \nresources and we need to do it without further delay. Enough posturing, \nenough politics. Let's rise above partisanship and put the national \ninterest first.\n  The strain on our local first responders has put them in a fiscal \nstraitjacket of historic proportions--one we must relieve now if we are \nto protect Americans from terrorism.\n  Nevertheless, let's be fair. Let's realize that, yes, we have made \nsome progress in the 18 months since September 11. Today we are better \nequipped to handle a second September 11. Our skies are safer. The FBI \nhas announced major reforms, which are in progress. I hope we are \nbeginning to tackle the problem of intelligence coordination that \nplagued us in the weeks and months leading up to that dark day.\n  But the terrorists constantly change their methods. Next time, the \nthreat isn't likely to come in the form of airplanes crashing into \nbuildings. The weapon might only be visible under the microscope. \nInstead of arriving with a loud crash and flames, it might come \nquietly, secretly, surreptitiously. Just as September 11 challenged our \npolice officers and firefighters as never before, a biological or \nchemical attack would challenge our public health first responders as \nnever before.\n  The reality is, if that happens, we are nowhere near ready. As \nresolute and resourceful as our public health professionals are, they \nlack the support, the capabilities, and the funding they need to detect \nthese deadly diseases swiftly and protect us effectively. We need \nsignificant new investment today to improve our readiness tomorrow.\n  Look at the reaction to the recent outbreak of Severe Acute \nRespiratory Syndrome, or SARS. An unknown microbial agent. A mysterious \nname. Those harrowing pictures of children with surgeon's masks \ncovering their mouths and noses. The slow but consistent spread \nthroughout Asia, and now around America. Travel warnings from the World \nHealth Organization placing large swaths of the world off limits. This, \nby all accounts, is simply a serious disease with which we are \nunfamiliar--but the profile of the outbreak is frighteningly close to \nwhat we imagined a bioterror attack might look like.\n  The public health officials in our local communities are well \ninformed and well trained. But working together with the CDC, they just \ndon't have the tools to determine what is causing SARS. They don't have \nthe tools to treat the victims. They don't have the tools to try to \nstop the spread of the disease in its tracks.\n  If SARS is 4-percent lethal, what will we do with a disease that is \n80 percent lethal? What will we do with a disease that spreads faster \nand is harder to diagnose? Let's not cross our fingers and hope. \nUnfortunately, that is exactly what we are forced to do under the \nadministration's budget, which shortchanges investment in our local \npublic health systems and hospitals.\n  As a result, our hospitals--already constrained by drastic budget \ncuts, are now rubbing quarters together when they need to be building \nsubstantial new capabilities to contend with the new threats. Time \nmagazine put it this way: ``Speed and calm, both critical in a state of \nemergency, can be taught without special gear, but training in certain \ntechniques and life-saving equipment, like $25,000 protective suits, \ndon't come cheap. That means most of America's hospitals are ill-\nprepared to face a major disaster.''\n\n  According to the Greater New York Hospital Association, hospitals \nthroughout the State have spent more than $200 million on security and \nemergency response improvements that they never imagined would be \nnecessary before September 11--with plans to spend more than that in \nthe coming year. What has Washington's contribution been? About $8 \nmillion in new funding--less than the hospitals will spend on the new \nsmallpox vaccination program alone.\n  These new demands are only further straining emergency rooms that are \nalready stretched to the limit. Dr. Cai Glushak, director of emergency \nmedicine at the University of Chicago, described the state of Chicago's \nhospitals this way: ``The hospitals are vastly lacking in resources and \nhave yet to address major things with brick and mortar to create truly \nadequate facilities to deal with a major contamination issue.'' He went \non to say of his hospital, ``If we had an onslaught of 20 people in \nthis emergency room, it would be a catastrophe. It would be sending an \nexternal disaster on top of an internal overload.''\n  How can we expect our hospitals, clinics, labs, and public health \ndepartments to protect us from unknown biothreats when they themselves \nare on the verge of being fiscally bedridden?\n  Now, of course money isn't all that local hospitals need from the \nFeds. They also need information, expertise, and guidance. They are \ngetting some of that from the CDC. But a sustained improvement in our \nbioterror defense demands more than that. It demands a real investment. \nIt demands Federal leadership. Those are sorely lacking in the budget \nrequests that we have seen from this administration.\n  For the next fiscal year, I have called for $3 billion in new \nhomeland security funding over and above the president's proposal to \nshore up bioterror preparedness. Mr. President, $1 billion of that \nincrease would increase CDC grants to help State public health \ndepartments care for and track infectious disease outbreaks, $500 \nmillion would help local hospitals increase capacity, training and \nsupplies, and $1.5 billion would help get new medical research as \nquickly as possible from ``bench to bedside''--meaning, from the \ndiscovery phase into actual use.\n  Hand in hand with these efforts, we simply must jumpstart efforts to \nspark private sector production of the drugs, antidotes, and \ncountermeasures we need to fight unknown chemical and biological \nagents. Again, the SARS example is instructive here as well.\n  We have no antidote for this disease. No vaccine. No countermeasure. \nNo diagnostic. It is possible that the only effective medical response \nwill turn out to be quarantine.\n  Imagine a biological weapon that spreads twice as fast and is twice \nas deadly. Do we really want quarantine to be our only answer? No--we \nneed real medical shields to fight back against the biological and \nchemical weapons our enemies might use.\n  And we can't simply hope and pray for these to appear. Stocking our \nmedicine cabinet with the right drugs to protect people from SARS will \ntake months or years of research, months or years of investment, months \nor years of hard work by private and government professionals.\n  That is why we need to begin today--not in 6 months, not in a year--\nengaging every national resource we have to develop the drugs, \nvaccines, and antidotes we may need in the event of a biological \nattack. We know of dozens upon dozens of deadly agents for which we \ncurrently have no defense, and this does not even count the hybrid or \ngenetically modified organisms we may see in the future. America is \nblessed with thousands and thousands of brilliant researchers in \nuniversities and companies across the country. Why not harness their \ningenuity to develop those antidotes, those vaccines, those medicines? \nSenator Hatch and I have proposed legislation that would do exactly \nthat.\n  I do not believe that Project Bioshield, the limited incentive \nprogram the President has proposed, is remotely enough. At best, it \nfocuses on short-term procurement of existing countermeasures, not on \nlong-term research to deal with the threats for which we have no \ncountermeasure. It will not lead to development of a broad-spectrum \nantibiotic, or to the development of powerful new research tools that \nwill enable us to quickly develop an antiviral to deal with a new \nthreat like SARS. It is a start, but it is late and it does not reflect \nthe urgency that is warranted by the threat.\n  The bill Senator Hatch and I have introduced will put in place a \nbroad range of incentives our private sector needs to start filling our \nmedicine cabinet today so our public health first responders are not \ncaught emptyhanded tomorrow, as they have been caught with SARS.\n  We are at war against terrorism. Our first responders--whether they \ngo to work in firehouses, police precincts, hospitals, or \nlaboratories--are our first line of defense. Let's not frustrate and \ncondemn to failure those whose job it is to protect us--many of whom \nrisk their lives--by failing to provide them\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\nthe resources they need to meet and beat the new and unfamiliar threats \nto our homeland.\n  The war against terrorism cannot be won with a magic wand, tough \ntalk, or wishful thinking. It will take talent, training, and \ntechnology. It will take real, not rhetorical, partnership among every \nlayer and level of government. It will take bipartisan action in \nCongress. It will take money. To begin providing our Government the \nresources it needs to protect us from terrorism, I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senators Schumer, Clinton, Mikulski, and others. I am proud \nto join them as a cosponsor of this amendment that will provide \ndesperately-needed funds directly to State and local governments to \nboost the emergency preparedness capabilities of our Nation's first \nresponders. The amendment also provides much-needed funding for high \nthreat urban areas, FIRE grants, and COPS.\n  Our Nation is at war, and we find ourselves facing enormous \nchallenges, both at home and abroad. The American people have responded \nto those challenges and are performing with skill and determination and \nvalor on both fronts.\n  We have nearly a quarter of a million troops in the Middle East. Our \nsoldiers and marines have been engaging tenacious guerilla fighters in \nIraq's harshest weather conditions. Our sailors are superbly executing \ntheir complex missions. Our Air Force already has performed thousands \nof missions over long distances amid withering ground fire, eliminating \nthreats to all our troops. And we have National Guard units being \ncalled up all across the country to prepare for what could turn into a \nlengthy assignment overseas.\n  Here on the homefront, our first responders and thousands of \ndedicated Federal workers are giving their all to preparedness and \nprevention. Police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical \nresponse providers are being pushed to the limit with added duties, \nlonger shifts, and cancelled time off. The new responsibilities they \nare shouldering in guarding against and preparing for terrorism have \nbecome largely unfunded mandates on them and on their States and \ncommunities. Every time the threat alert level is raised, it takes \nmillions more in local and State costs to respond.\n  The administration readily accepts the need to fund our antiterrorism \nefforts abroad, but the administration continues to downplay and \nminimize the real needs in real communities across the Nation for \nadequate resources to meet homeland defense needs here at home. That \nmust change. We need to do both we need a robust response to terrorism \non both fronts, here and abroad.\n  This supplemental spending plan the President submitted to the \nCongress addresses costs in Iraq and other locations overseas but \nmisses the mark by a mile in funding our needs on the homefront. We are \nfighting a two-front war, yet the President's request mostly only \naddresses the war in Iraq--as well as the needs of a few coalition \nallies.\n  It is frustrating, as well as more than a little ironic, that after \nall of the repeated requests from Congress and State and local \nofficials, over a period now of a year and a half, about the need for \ntaking care of the fight against terrorism at home, the administration \nhas decided to request almost $8 billion in assistance on behalf of the \nforeign nations that it considers helpful in the war against Iraq, but \nonly $2 billion for first responders. The Nation's Governors and mayors \nhave made abundantly clear the urgent need for that same level of \nfunding, $8 billion. Our hometown heroes need help now.\n  In recent months, the Nation's first responder needs have grown \nincreasingly urgent. I have repeatedly joined with congressional \nleaders like Senator Byrd, Senator Daschle, and others in asking the \nPresident, in this supplemental request for appropriations, to include \nat least $5 billion for our State and local first responders. But the \nadministration has fallen far short in this bill, including only $2 \nbillion to assist State and local governments to support federally \nmandated terrorism preparedness during this time of heightened threats \nand insecurity. The amount included in the supplemental is inadequate.\n  No Federal agencies are doing the jobs that we need first responders \nto do. When terrorists attack, the first call that is made is not to a \nFederal agency in Washington. It is to 9-1-1, for their State and local \nfirst responders. The responsibility now falls to the Congress to boost \nfunding for our first responders. We are in a two-front war, overseas \nand here at home, and we need to fund both.\n  The sooner we help first responders help us in the war on terrorism, \nthe better. I hope you will agree that our Governors and mayors know \nwhat their States and communities need to be safe from and respond to \nterrorist attacks. My colleagues and I who introduce this amendment \nhave heard their pleas and responded. I hope the Congress will respond \naccordingly, even though the administration so far has not.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, September 11, 2001, taught us that the \nNation is vulnerable to terrorist attacks on our own soil. In \nMassachusetts, almost 200 families lost loved ones on that day, and \nthey bear an especially heavy share of the burden of that \nvulnerability.\n  Here in Congress, we are each committed to do all we can to see that \n9/11 never happens again. We need to work together to provide the \nresources to prevent terrorists from attacking the cities, the towns, \nthe villages, and the communities we all care so much about in our \nStates and across this country.\n  Yet we failed to live up to our responsibility yesterday during the \ndebate on Senator Hollings' needed proposal to strengthen the \nprotection of our seaports. It would have provided $1 billion to begin \nto protect our Nation's notoriously porous and vulnerable ports. Yet \nduring the debate on the amendment, opponents questioned ``where will \nit end?'' as if this was such an extravagant investment. It was \ndefeated, and I cannot understand why.\n  One billion dollars was proposed to secure our seaports against \nsabotage, dirty bombs or worse in cargo containers. Was that really too \nmuch--even though the President has pledged $9 billion in aid to other \nnations to help them protect their own citizens?\n  These entryways into the United States are responsible for 95 percent \nof all U.S. international trade, but only about 2 percent of all cargo \nis now being inspected. An urgent proposal to do more, and do it now, \nshould certainly get a unanimous vote in the Senate. The stakes are too \nhigh. September 11 taught us what can happen.\n  Obviously, we don't have unlimited funds. Obviously, we can't make \nourselves 100 percent free of the terrorist threat. But can we really \nsay that we are doing all we can when the overall bill before us \nprovides only $2 billion to help State and local governments meet their \nnew security requirements? Facing serious budget reductions of their \nown, the Nation's cities are spending an additional $70 million a week \non direct homeland security costs, and tens of millions more in \nindirect costs.\n  But can we really say we are doing all we can when Federal assistance \nfor homeland security has, to date, provided the entire State of \nMassachusetts with only $11 million, the entire State of Pennsylvania \nwith only $18.5 million, and the entire State of California with only \n$45 million?\n  Can we say we are doing all we can--let alone all that we should--\nwhen the bill before us provides the grand total of only $100 million \nto protect all the high-level-threat urban areas in the country?\n  How many of these high-level-threat urban areas are there?\n  Is $100 million enough--or is it only a drop in the bucket--when we \nare talking about the security of Atlanta or Austin or Baltimore or \nBoston or Charleston or Cleveland or Chicago or Dallas or Denver or \nDetroit or Houston or Las Vegas or Los Angeles or Miami or Milwaukee or \nMinneapolis or New York City or New Orleans or Philadelphia or Phoenix \nor Portland or Pittsburgh or Seattle or St. Louis or St. Paul or San \nDiego or San Antonio or San Francisco or Tampa or Washington, DC, or \ndozens of other American cities that can legitimately be called high-\nthreat areas.\n  Mr. President, $100 million for high-level urban threat areas--just \nfor the 29 cities I mentioned above, that works out to $3.3 million for \neach city. That won't go very far in New York City,\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\nwhere the mayor is spending $5 million a week.\n  It won't go very far in Boston, which is struggling to meet its \nsecurity obligations while confronting a potential 2-year State-aid cut \nof $153 million. As a result of these cuts, and declining tax revenues \nbrought about by the recession, there will be no incoming class of \npolice officers for Boston this year. No incoming class, when the \nthreats to the city are unprecedented and when 18 of Boston's officers \nare serving their country in Iraq.\n  Is Boston supposed to take on these new challenges, with only token \nfinancial support from Washington?\n  Apparently, Boston is to go it alone in its efforts to prevent a \nterrorist attack on any of the 61 hazardous material storage facilities \nthat dot its waterfront. Boston alone is supposed to protect the home \nheating oil depots along its expressway. And Boston alone is supposed \nto prevent terrorists from commandeering any one of the hundreds of \ncruise vessels that stop in our port every year.\n  Instead of wondering where it will end, a better question for us to \nbe asking ourselves today is: How can we go back to our States without \ndoing all we can to protect our communities?\n  Last week, half of the Senate had no problem voting for a massively \nexcessive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans on the flimsiest of \neconomic justifications. Yet now we have voted down $1 billion to \nprotect our seaports--even though their vulnerability could have \nimmediate and devastating effects on our economy--and we are reluctant \nto add another $2 billion to secure our communities.\n  The amendment before us is modest. It does not try to change the \nfundamental fiscal relationships between the Federal, State, and local \ngovernments. It simply says that we can do more. We can do more than \nthe bare minimum that the President's Budget Director says is \nabsolutely necessary. We can do more so that our Nation's homeland \nsecurity isn't entirely dependent upon property taxes, lottery \nrevenues, and car washes.\n  The amendment before us would increase assistance to first responders \nby $1 billion, provide a total of $1.05 billion for assistance to high \nthreat urban areas, $155 million for firefighter's equipment grants, \nand $130 million for staffing and overtime expenses for COPS Program \nactivities.\n  In the context of an unprecedented supplemental appropriation request \nof $74.8 billion, and with the backdrop of heightened domestic \nsecurity, can anyone really pretend that these investments are unwise \nor unnecessary?\n  Today, I spoke to 17 mayors in Massachusetts by conference call, all \nof whom are struggling to meet the challenges of post-September 11 \nsecurity--and none of whom know how they can go on bearing these costs \nalone. Their obstacles are impossible to overcome.\n  Mayor Fred Kalisz of New Bedford, a city of 94,000 people and home of \nthe Nation's highest value commercial fishing fleet, has incurred \n$500,000 in specific homeland security expenses to date and has come up \nwith list of $3.4 million in essential capital security requests to \nprotect his city's port, its commercial fishing fleet, and key public \nfacilities. He has no way to pay for these costs. He recently had to \nsuspend drug and alcohol prevention programs for New Bedford's youth.\n  Mayor John Barrett of North Adams, a city of only 14,000 people, has \nto deploy his small town police force to secure two nuclear \npowerplants--including 533 spent radioactive fuel rods--against \nterrorist attack.\n  In Everett, a city of 38,000 people located just outside Boston, \nMayor David Ragucci spends $10,000 a day to secure facilities \ncontaining 685,000 gallons of propane, 95 million gallons of jet fuel \nand a 1500 megawatt powerplant from terrorist attack. In the wake of a \n$4.5 million budget cut, Mayor Ragucci deserves a combat medal for his \nefforts to protect these facilities which are within 5 miles of nearly \n1 million people.\n  Mayor Bill Whelan of Quincy, a city of 88,000 people, has been hit \nwith over $300,000 in overtime and other personnel costs responding to \nover 300 anthrax and hazardous materials calls since 9/11. He also has \nhad to begin patrolling the city's 27 miles of open coastline, and \nbegin providing 24-hour police protection for a Muslim place of \nworship. And he is staring at $4.3 million of State local aid cuts in \nthe face.\n\n  In Fall River, with 92,000 people, Mayor Ed Lambert has done a good \njob so far balancing a very difficult situation. With a reservoir that \nserves 200,000 people and the State's largest bridge within city \nlimits, Mayor Lambert has had to dramatically increase security at both \nthese critical sites. But, he has had to do it while cutting back his \npolice and fire forces in response to difficult budget shortfalls. Over \nthe last 18 months, Fall River has lost 15 percent of its police force \nand 10 percent of its firefighters because of budget cuts.\n  In Brockton, Mayor Jack Yunits has been trying to meet the challenges \nconfronting his city of 94,000 while dealing with the loss of 17 police \nofficers. Another six will soon be retiring, and there is no funding to \nreplace them. Among the mayor's chief homeland security challenges is \nthe safety and well-being of the 6,000 students and faculty who attend \nBrockton High School each day, the largest high school this side of the \nMississippi River. His difficulties will soon be compounded if the \nproposed State cut of $2.9 million from his budget becomes law.\n  In Lowell, with a population 105,000, six of its police officers and \na fireman have been sent to Iraq. With a police force of 220, Lowell \nmay have to insist on 30 early retirements this year to meet its budget \nconstraints. City Manager John Cox tells me that for the first time in \nrecent memory, there will be no new recruits from the police academy.\n  Worcester is Massachusetts' second largest city, and Mayor Tim Murray \ntells me that he has lost over 80 police officers and 86 firefighters \ndue to budget difficulties.\n  All these mayors have their backs against the wall. They are trying \nas hard as they can to protect their security, but they are not being \ngiven the help they need.\n  I think Mayor Yunits from Brockton said it best ``Our first \nresponders are fighting for their jobs, while they continue fighting to \nprotect us.''\n  They will keep at it, I am sure, because they care about this \ncountry. They care about their city. They care about protecting their \ncitizens. They care about doing every last thing possible to prevent \nanother disaster on American soil.\n  Shouldn't we in the Senate--with our responsibility to protect the \nAmerican people--at least try to help ease this burden?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and send a message to \nthe Governors and mayors of America that they are not alone, that they \ncan count on Congress to provide more than mere photo opportunities as \nthey confront the threat of domestic terrorism in their communities.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Schumer for \noffering this amendment to immediately provide more resources to our \nlocal first responders. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  This amendment is vital to our first responders at the State and \nlocal levels of government. We must increase the resources available so \nthat our police, firefighters, and other emergency personnel can help \nprevent and respond to terrorist acts.\n  This amendment makes $2.2 billion available to the Office for \nDomestic Preparedness in the Department of Homeland Security.\n  This $2.2 billion is for direct grants to States and local \ngovernments. This funding will be passed to the States, and then on to \nlocal governments within 45 days.\n  This expediency is an important concern of many States, including my \nState of California. We have all heard about the budget shortages that \nmany States are facing. These budget shortages then affect cities and \ncounties.\n  My State of California is facing a budget shortfall of between $26 \nand $35 billion. In California, revenue from vehicle license fees helps \ncommunities pay for the equivalent of 12,000 police officers or 15,000 \nfirefighters for one year. But, because of the State shortfall, this \nfunding may not be passed on to local communities.\n  Already, the financial crunch is taking its toll. For example, the \ncity of Marysville faces a $700,000 budget shortfall. This shortfall \nwill affect the police payroll, which accounts for 60 percent of the \ncity's budget. The cities of Santa Cruz, and Napa have also made cuts \nin police and fire departments. This amendment will assist cities like \nMarysville, Santa Cruz and\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\nNapa to have full teams of first responders.\n  On top of this budget crunch, the Federal Government has handed \nadditional responsibilities and a heightened terror alert to already \ntroubled State and local governments. The states are paying for \nsecurity costs that the Federal Government has asked them to cover. In \nCalifornia, the Governor estimates $500 million in statewide homeland \ndefense costs for the State and local governments. These estimates are \nprobably low, especially if the war in Iraq goes on for several months.\n  The city of Los Angeles spent an additional $4.2 million just during \nthe 20 days of code orange to meet the demands of heightened security. \nThe city of Fresno is spending between $15,000 and $20,000 per week on \nhomeland security costs. On average, the city of San Francisco is \nspending $2.3 million per week, second only to New York City. In fact, \nof the five cities nationwide that are spending the most money on \nprotecting the homeland, two of them--San Francisco and Los Angeles--\nare in my State.\n  This amendment is vital for our communities, vital for our local \npolice, vital for our local firefighters, vital for the protection of \nthe American people. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to another sponsor of \nthe amendment, somebody who has fought long and hard for first \nresponders and localities, the people of Maryland, the Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Schumer and Clinton, who have been working steadfastly to get \nthe resources we need to properly fund homeland security. They have \nstood up not only for New York but for all of America because we know \nthat homeland security cannot be done on the cheap. We are at war. We \nare at war in Iraq, and we need to support our troops. But we are at \nwar here. The President of the United States, George Bush, said we are \nat war here in the war against terrorism and we need to support the \nhometown, homeland troops. They are our first responders.\n  Where are they? They are in local governments. They are in fire \nstations. They are in police stations. They are standing sentry behind \nthe ambulances ready to respond to any emergency need. When a citizen \ncalls 911 because of an event that has happened in their community, it \nhappens locally.\n  The Schumer-Clinton-Mikulski amendment not only gives more money, \nwhich is desperately needed, but it brings money to the local \ncommunities where it is needed.\n  We live in the capital region, we in Maryland, whether it is \nMontgomery County or Prince George's or Baltimore City. Our overtime is \nskyrocketing. We are spending loads of money in the protection for \ninfrastructure. In Baltimore, every time we go to code orange we are \nspending $50,000 a week on police overtime. Prince George's County \nneeds $50 million just to be able to talk to the rest of the State in \ninteroperable radio equipment. Anne Arundel County is responsible for \nthe protection of the National Security Agency, the Naval Academy, the \ncapitol of the State of Maryland, and BWI Airport. We say: Oh, wow, we \ncan't afford to do it.\n  Let me say this: When the country goes to code orange, our local \ncommunities go to red ink. Local governments have no place to turn \nexcept higher property taxes. We say no to higher property taxes. We \nsay yes to more funds for homeland security. If we want to wear the \nflag, let's stand up for the flag and let's stand up for the flag by \nsupporting our first responders in the local community and by putting \nthe money where our patriotism is, right in the Federal checkbook.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Schumer \namendment, but I also wanted to make a comment about the Specter \namendment. I support the amendment of the Senators from New York and \nMaryland who are lead sponsors on this particular amendment. They are \nabsolutely correct. We are not giving the resources that are necessary \nto first responders.\n  While the bill before us attempts in good measure to support the war \nunderway, we always need to be prepared each and every day to fight the \nwar on terrorism--which is broader than the battlefield in Iraq. The \nbattlefield has now become in some sense the U.S. territory, and we \nneed to do more faster. I realize we can't pay for every bill that is \nsubmitted, but we most certainly can do more than what we are doing. I \nintend to vote for the Schumer amendment.\n  I am not sure what I will do on the Specter amendment. I will say \nwhy. I think the offset is inappropriate. I understand there might be \nsome consensus about the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nbut let me say what I object to strenuously in the amendment. To fund \nthe high threat urban areas, a portion of the money, $150 million, is \ntaken from State and local governments, and a portion is taken from \ncritical infrastructure protection. So here, as a Senator from \nLouisiana, I have to now be forced to choose--these are tough votes and \nthis is a job we asked for--because on one hand, I do want to add money \nto the overall pot, which the amendment does, but I want to call to the \nattention of my colleagues that part of the offset is taking it away \nfrom protection for pipelines, chemical plants, ports, and other \ncritical infrastructure that could be described as highways, rail, et \ncetera, to support high urban threat areas.\n  It is a dilemma. I hope, however, it is resolved. Perhaps a better \noffset could be found in the conference report because I agree with \nSenator Schumer and Senator Clinton that we have to do more. I don't \nagree with the proposal put down by the Senator from Pennsylvania that \nto solve that problem, it needs to be taken from States such as \nLouisiana--perhaps Texas could find itself in the same situation--\nhaving a tremendous amount of critical infrastructure to protect, which \nI might say to my colleagues in the Senate, supplies a tremendous \namount of energy for the Nation. Those critical infrastructures are all \nover urban as well as rural parts of Louisiana. So I rise in support of \nthe Schumer amendment, and with great reservations about the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan, who has been a great supporter of first responders.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my colleague. I rise as a cosponsor of this \namendment. I commend my colleagues for bringing it forward.\n  As has been said so many times, we have two front lines in the battle \non terrorism. We have come together virtually unanimously in support of \nour troops in Iraq and for the efforts on other soils away from our \ncountry. But here at home we have not done the same. Back in Michigan, \nI held nine different community meetings around the State, and I heard \nthe same thing from our urban to rural areas: They are working hard, \nworking overtime, but they cannot do it alone.\n  When our country was attacked, it was not just New York or \nWashington. They were, in fact, attacking the United States of America. \nWe have an obligation to our hard-working men and women, the \nfirefighters, the police officers, the emergency medical workers, to \nmake sure we are partnering with them to make sure they have the \nresources they need.\n  I have heard so much about the need for communications equipment, \nbioterrorism training, additional personnel. They are saying to me that \nit is very frustrating when, on the one hand, we say we are getting \nthem more money, and then we cut the COPS Program or the Fire Grant \nProgram.\n  The Senator from Louisiana raises an important point about the \nSpecter amendment as to where the dollars come from. I will support the \nSpecter amendment, but we have to make sure these are really new \ndollars and not just moving from one pot to another pot because the \nreality is that our first responders cannot do this without our \npartnership and our support.\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\n  This is the time we are bringing forth the resources to fund the war \nto support our troops abroad. We have troops right here. They are \nasking us, finally, to support them. We have tried for 18 months to \nprovide the resources, to let them know, and today is the day.\n  I hope my colleagues will join unanimously to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of a brief reply and comment on \nthe arguments that have been made, I agree with a great deal of what \nhas been said. It would be highly desirable to put in more money, but \nwhat we have seen today are efforts on the other side of the aisle to \nadd funds, and a response on this side of the aisle, pretty much on \nparty-line votes, to deny the addition. I have sought to find a figure \nthat is significant, such as $600 million, which will be agreed to by \nvotes significantly on this side of the aisle, and with some votes on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  When the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, made the comment that \nthere are features of Senator Schumer's amendment that expedite the \ndisbursement of the funds, that is not included in my amendment because \nwe don't really know what the formula should be. When Secretary Ridge \ntestified before the Appropriations Committee on March 27, he agreed \nthat the current formula on a population basis was inappropriate, that \nhigh-risk areas need more money. At the moment, we do not have a \ndetermination as to what those costs are. We have directed the \nSecretary to make that determination. Once he makes that determination, \nthen we can make an allocation. I certainly would like to see more \nmoney.\n  I agree totally with the comments made about the bravery of the \nfirefighters and of the police officers, and the threat of terrorism \nthat has to be fought domestically as well as overseas. What I am \nlooking for in my amendment is the art of the possible--to come up with \na figure, and $600 million is substantial.\n  It is true, as the Senator from Louisiana points out, money has been \ntaken in other lines for $300 million. But we have gotten the managers \nto agree to an additional $200 million, so it is a matter of \npriorities. If you look at the high-risk areas, such as New Orleans, it \nis in the interest of the State of Louisiana to have this allocation.\n  How much of my time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I inquire how much time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the Senator from \nPennsylvania because this is a very important debate. I thank him, \nfirst, for the effort he has made to try to bring some compromise to \nthe issue.\n  I restate how difficult it is for some of us from some States that \nhave serious needs of critical infrastructure. We supply 20 percent of \nthe Nation's oil and gas. I have more pipelines in my State than any \nother State in the Union. We are happy to provide the energy. We have \nmore chemical plants than Illinois, New Jersey, and other States. To \nask us to be forced to say we don't really need money for that and we \ncan give money to urban areas--the fact is, we need to give money to \nboth, and to New York, Pennsylvania, New Orleans, as well as other \nplaces where pipelines run under very small communities.\n  I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania will take seriously--and I know \nhe does--what point I am making and perhaps work as a member of the \nAppropriations Committee as this bill moves through to try to find an \nadditional remedy so we don't have to get rural areas giving up their \nmoney for urban areas, or urban areas giving up their money for rural \nareas, and we can try to make fair allocations to protect all of the \ncritical infrastructure in the Nation, whether it is in rural or urban \nareas.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Louisiana makes \na valid point on the need for more funding. We are now on the emergency \nsupplemental. We do not know at this moment what the costs are to \nprotect all of these interests. We will know shortly. We have asked for \n60 days. We will be moving forward with more appropriations bills. We \nare in the process now of moving forward.\n  The subcommittee, chaired by the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, on which I serve, will be taking it up. We will be \ninterested to see the specifications as to what it costs to protect the \ninterests identified by the Senator from Louisiana. But I think this is \na substantial start. This is a combination of trying to get more funds \nin, and getting $200 million is not easy on this side of the aisle. \nMaking the reallocation of the $600 million is a very material advance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for his comments. I look forward to \nworking with him as we try to provide additional funding for the \ncritical structure that is necessary throughout many places in the \nSouth and in the industrial East.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nLautenberg as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Jersey 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by our colleagues, Senator Schumer, Senator Clinton, and \nSenator Mikulski.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania, too, is an amendment \nthat has to be considered favorably. This amendment would provide \ndesperately needed funds to State and local governments to bolster \ntheir emergency preparedness. I am pleased the amendment sponsors have \nincluded my proposal to reimburse State and local governments for \nadditional costs that they are incurring because they have not replaced \nthe first responders called to active duty in the Reserves or National \nGuard.\n  Not surprisingly, many local police and fire and rescue and emergency \nmedical service and hazardous material disposal personnel serve in the \nNational Guard and Reserves. More and more, these men and women are \nbeing called up for longer and longer tours of active duty, and \nespecially now that the war with Iraq is underway. It is critical that \nwe bolster our military capabilities here and abroad but that we not do \nit at the expense of our safety and security at home.\n  I have spoken to a lot of mayors in New Jersey. New Jersey shared the \nimpact of the terrible assault on the Trade Centers with New York, as \n700 of our citizens died that day. What perplexes them is the fact that \nhere they are being asked to bolster the defenses at home, to make sure \nthey cover the emergency needs, and, in many instances, it takes people \naway to serve either in the Reserves or the National Guard, to put them \non active duty.\n  They do not understand--and I agree with them--why it is we cannot \ntake care of our defenses with strength at home as well as abroad.\n  I am pleased that the amendment sponsors have included my proposal to \nreimburse State and local governments and Indian tribes for the \nadditional costs they incur replacing their first responders who are \ncalled to active duty in the Reserves or National Guard.\n  The 1.2 million men and women who serve in the National Guard and \nReserves are a crucial component of our military. They account for just \n8.3 percent of the Defense budget but give us the capability, if \nnecessary, of nearly doubling our armed forces.\n  Not surprisingly, many local police, fire, rescue, emergency medical \nservice, and emergency hazardous material disposal personnel serve in \nthe National Guard and Reserves. More and more of these men and women \nare being called up for longer and longer tours of active duty, \nespecially now that the war with Iraq has begun.\n  It is critical that we bolster our military capabilities here and \nabroad. But we must not do it at the expense of our safety and security \nat home.\n  Our local communities must have the necessary personnel to respond to \nterrorism, natural disasters, and other emergencies.\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\n  My proposal would reimburse State, local, and tribal governments for \nthe additional costs they incur when their ``first responders'' who \nserve in the Reserves and the National Guard are called to active duty \nfor 6 or more consecutive months.\n  Reimbursable costs could include the salary and benefits associated \nwith hiring a replacement or the overtime paid to other emergency \npersonnel who ``fill in'' for the first responder called to active \nduty.\n  The effect of my amendment would be to make such reimbursements an \nauthorized use of the $500 million contained in the underlying \nprovision.\n  Increasingly, I am hearing from State and local officials who are \nconcerned about the toll that active duty call-ups are taking on their \nemergency preparedness.\n  According to the Police Executive Research Forum, 452 of 1,002 law \nenforcement agencies and departments surveyed so far have lost \npersonnel to call-ups.\n  The problem is worse in rural and smaller jurisdictions where just a \nfew call-ups can decimate a police or fire department.\n  State and local governments are facing their worst fiscal crisis in \nover 50 years. We shouldn't leave them ``holding the bag'' when their \nfirst responders get called up. And we should not be making our \ncommunities less able to respond to terrorism, natural disasters, and \nother emergencies.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues from New York and Senator Mikulski for \naccommodating my proposal. I think my language makes a good amendment \neven better and I urge my colleagues to adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the bill reported by the committee \nprovides an additional $2 billion in supplemental appropriations to \nenhance assistance to State and local first responders. It does so in a \nmanner which builds on the State strategies; provides funding for \nenhanced security of critical infrastructure, and allows the Secretary \nto target funds to high threat urban areas.\n  This amendment does more than just boost funding for the Office for \nDomestic Preparedness. It mandates mechanisms for the dispersal of \nFederal funds which would dilute the impact of the supplemental funding \naltogether.\n  The amendment which has been offered requires a direct pass-through \nof grant funds to States within 30 days. This requirement would negate \nthe strategic planning process the Office for Domestic Preparedness has \ndeveloped and implemented with States to allocate funds to those with \ngreatest need and it would undermine the States' regional approach \nwhich is currently supported by the majority of States.\n  The amendment requires that funds for grants be allocated to States \nbased on the minimum grant requirement in the USA PATRIOT Act and the \nremaining amounts being distributed on a per capita basis. This is what \nis being done currently. However, it mandates that the funds be \nallocated to States within 30 days of enactment of the Act. This would \nnot allow time for the States to submit a plan for the use of the funds \nrequested which ensures some degree of accountability that Federal \nfunds will be used to cover allowable costs.\n  The amendment further requires that not less than 80 percent of each \nState's funds be made available to units of local government based on \npopulation. Of the 80 percent mandated to go to localities, the \namendment then requires 20 percent be used ``shall be for''--``costs of \nlaw enforcement, fire, emergency medical services, and other emergency \npersonnel, including covering overtime expenses.''\n  In addition, the amendment allows grant funds to be used for \n``personnel funds''. It does not define what this means. Does this mean \nhiring personnel or reimbursement of costs of existing personnel, or \nboth? What is the baseline for determining this? What will ensure that \nFederal assistance supplement and not supplant existing levels of \neffort?\n  The amendment also does not define units of Local Government. If it \ntruly means all local units will receive funds based on population, the \nFederal funding will be diluted by giving many small jurisdictions \nsmall grants. And, it will most likely cause further delay, if you \nconsider there are over 3,100 counties, each containing townships, \nvillages or other governmental units, and the States are required, as \nthis amendment mandates, to disperse all these funds to this number of \njurisdictions based on population within 30 days, and then to make sure \nthat 20 percent of those funds be allocated only for specified \npurposes, as the amendment requires.\n  Where the current system relies on planning-based decisionmaking, \nthis amendment resembles revenue sharing.\n  I realize that changes to the current system may be merited. \nQuestions have been raised about the appropriate Federal share of the \nadditional cost to States and local governments of terrorism \npreparedness and response efforts; what should properly be a Federal \nresponsibility; and the formula for distributing funds, and the extent \nto which it properly reflects risks and vulnerabilities.\n  However, changes should be made after careful review by the authoring \ncommittees of jurisdiction, not done on this supplemental \nappropriations bill. The chairman of the Senate Government Affairs \nCommittee has already announced a series of hearings, beginning next \nweek, to review the Department of Homeland Security's grant programs \nand their effectiveness.\n  I do know that with respect to making a decision on this here today, \nthe current process is preferable to what is being proposed by this \namendment. This amendment would only make things worse.\n  The same is true for the mechanism proposed by this amendment to \ndeliver critical infrastructure protection funds to States. It would \nrequire funds be distributed on a per capita basis to States. Once \nfunds are available to States, 50 percent must be made available to \nlocal jurisdictions within 30 days of receipt.\n  Again, it would dilute the funds being made available for security \ncosts related to protection of critical infrastructure, which are \nintended to help State and local governments cover additional costs \nresulting from Operation Liberty Shield. Again, this is not targeted \nassistance, it is a revenue sharing approach to a problem.\n  The amendment also provides an additional $155 million for grants \nunder the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act. There is no \nindication that additional funding is needed at this time. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security is still processing applications for \nthe $745 million made available for fiscal year 2003.\n\n  Plus, this additional funding, as well as an additional $130 million \nproposed for the Department of Justice Community-Oriented Policing \nServices, is proposed on top of the amendment's requirement that 20 \npercent of local jurisdictions' share of State grants be used for ``law \nenforcement, fire, emergency medical services, and other emergency \npersonnel, including covering overtime expenses.''\n  The bill reported by the Appropriations Committee includes $2 billion \nin supplemental appropriations for the Office for Domestic Preparedness \nto assist State and local governments to expand their capacity to \nprepare and respond to potential terrorist acts.\n  It provides an additional $1.42 billion for grants to States, at \nleast 80 percent of which must be passed through to local governments. \nThis funding is for the acquisition of equipment, training, excercises, \nand planning. It is intended to assist States to more aggressively \nimplement their statewide domestic preparedness strategies.\n  In addition, the committee-reported bill provides an additional $30 \nmillion in direct technical assistance to states for a variety of \nactivities, as needed, including support for plan development and \nimplementation of exercises.\n  It also provides $450 million, as requested by the President, for \nState grants to assist State and local governments with the costs of \naugmenting security at critical infrastructure facilities during the \nperiod of hostilities with Iraq. This recognizes the new requirements \nimposed on States and localities by the immediate need for heightened \nprotection of critical infrastructure facilities. We understand\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\nthat the department has already reached out to States to ensure \nsecurity measures are under way for the most sensitive sites and has \nbeen working with governors in developing site protection plans so that \nthese funds can be released rapidly.\n  Lastly, it provides an additional $100 million to be targeted to \nhigh-risk urban areas, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania would alter \nthe amounts recommended in the committee-reported bill to provide total \nsupplemental appropriations of $600 million for assistance to high-\nthreat urban areas and the total supplemental appropriations for the \nOffice for Domestic Preparedness to $2.2 billion. I support the Specter \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by \nSenator Schumer.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 8 minutes 16 \nseconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to make clear what I stated \nbefore. I do support the Specter amendment. By virtue of the approach \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania has enunciated, we end up with more \nmoneys in this area of great concern, but we increase the amount of \nmoney in the bill by $200 million. There was already $100 million in \nthe committee-reported bill.\n  I do accept Senator Specter's approach to this. I am hopeful we can \nconvince the House to recognize that this is the proper way to allocate \nthe money the President requested and convince them that the amount we \nhave in this bill is sufficient to meet the objectives we all seek to \nattain.\n  I urge Senators to vote for the Specter amendment. Again, \nreluctantly, I state I am opposed to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New York and his colleagues.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 1 minute 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back time if the \nSenator from New York is.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am prepared to yield back our time as well so we can \nmove this along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to be able to discuss what \nwe are going to do now. We have the managers' package that has some \nproblems. We have to decide how to get out of it. It is my suggestion \nthat we listen to the Senator from Arizona on some of the objections he \nhas to items in the managers' package and see what we can do after the \nSenator explains his position.\n  How long would the Senator like to talk?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent we listen to Senator McCain for \n10 minutes and see what objections we can possibly remedy with the \nproblems he has with the managers' package.\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized when he has \nfinished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, approximately 40 minutes ago, maybe a half \nhour ago, we were given a ``managers' package.'' The managers' package, \nthe first group was--we haven't yet received the second group of \namendments in the managers' package--27 amendments. There is $10 \nmillion for the South Pole station in the managers' package; $10 \nmillion for NOAA; $600 million for the Department of Agriculture expert \nassistance; $500 million for the DOJ and FEMA; $281 million for the \nDepartment of Energy; $5 million earmarked for a Kentucky public safety \ncommunications system. I haven't finished compiling the list because we \nhaven't even had a chance to review these amendments.\n  I ask my colleagues again: How do you accept a managers' package--in \nthis case worth billions, B as in billions--worth billions of dollars \nwithout any debate, without any vote, without any discussion that I \nknow of of any kind? How do you do that? How do you do that?\n  I intend to have votes on parts of the managers' package. I don't \nknow why we need in this bill $10 million for the South Pole station. I \ndid not know that al-Qaida had reached the South Pole. More \nimportantly, how can we appropriate $500 million for the Department of \nJustice and FEMA without even talking about it? Couldn't we debate it? \nMaybe it won't be absolutely necessary. Do we need $281 million \nadditional for the Department of Energy? I don't think the Department \nof Energy is on the frontline in the war in Iraq.\n  I am told by the Senator from Alaska--I have the greatest respect \nand, believe it or not, a great deal of affection for him--that, well, \nthey would pass anyway and this is the best way to treat it because \nthen he will be able to reduce it in the conference.\n  I am not a member of the conference. Most of us are not conferees. \nMost of us are just ordinary Senators who have a responsibility to our \nconstituents, not to approve of a managers' package worth billions of \ndollars that none of us have ever seen or read--and you would not have \nseen or read it if I had not demanded that the managers' package be \nshown to us.\n\n  Is this the way to govern? Is this the way to spend the taxpayers' \ndollars? It cannot be. It cannot be the right thing to do.\n  I have great sympathy for what the Senator from Alaska is trying to \nachieve by getting this bill done, paying for the war, paying for the \nwar on terror. But how do we sit here and accept billions of dollars in \na managers' package that none of us--excuse me, all but a few of us \nhave ever seen, debated, discussed, voted on, or will ever have \nanything to do with?\n  I trust the judgment of those who go to the appropriations \nconference, but I don't give them the responsibility that I have to the \ntaxpayers of my State.\n  I am sure many of these amendments in the managers' package will \npass. I have already seen that today. When we had an amendment to take \nout the totally extraneous provisions, we only got 39 votes. I am sure \nthey will pass. At least I will be able to go back and tell my \nconstituents that I didn't support $10 million for the South Pole \nStation in the name of fighting the war on terrorism and the war on \nIraq. I have greater respect for the men and women in the military who \nare doing the fighting than to vote for $10 million for the South Pole \nin the name of helping them fight the war.\n  I will yield the remainder of my time, and I will object to the \nmanagers' package, and we will have a series of votes. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from \nArizona. He provides really a service to the Senate to make us think \nabout these issues. I have thought about all of these. In fact, a dozen \nSenators on either side are already carrying a grudge because they \ndidn't get their amendment through the process to even get to the \nSenator from Arizona because they were rejected by someone in the \ncommittee of jurisdiction.\n  Let me say to the Senator, for instance, the $10 million for the \nSouth Pole is not an add-on. We took that money off an account and put \nit in there because they had a disastrous winter. This is the last \nsupplemental for this year, as far as we know. Only another tragedy and \nthe war could bring us to another supplemental. We are going into \nregular bills after this bill. We will have nights such as this on some \nof them, probably.\n  The money for the Department of Energy was identified by several \nMembers, and that is security at nuclear facilities. It was debated on \nthe floor. It was raised here and debated. I asked them to put it into \nthe package because it was my opinion that it was, frankly, raising the \nbill a little too much, and I didn't want it to look as if I was \naccepting those amendments. There are a few others that we accepted \nthat go in the bill. As you say, there are times that it is possible to \nreduce amendments voted on the floor in conference; but when the Senate \nvotes overwhelmingly for an amendment on the floor, it is difficult to \ndeal with in the House--if the House doesn't want to put the full \namount up and to reduce it, or negotiate it.\n  We have several amendments. Senator Kohl's amendment, for instance. \nHe has been courteous in allowing us to put that amendment--it will \npass, by the way; I know it will pass. I will tell the Senate that \nthere is not an amendment in this managers' package that I believe \nwould pass the Senate if raised individually.\n\n  Why do we have a managers' package? Because we have cleared each \namendment with the committee of jurisdiction, cleared by the majority \nand minority on the subcommittee involved in our Appropriations \nCommittee, and cleared by Senator Byrd and myself, and we have cleared \nthem or offered them to Senator McCain and to Senator Reid, or whoever \nwants to look at the package can look at it. It is a package of \nconvenience.\n  By putting these amendments together on items we think would pass \nanyway, we might be able to go home at a decent hour tonight. I might \nbe able to keep my commitment to the Senator from Hawaii to be in \nHawaii with him when he gets his great honor on Saturday. That may not \nbe possible because I have a job and I will stay until we do it.\n  It is also a problem that a couple of the Senators have already \ndeparted, and they are relying on us to put these in the package \nbecause they had other problems with family, and they are not here now. \nI can think of three of them who are gone who have amendments in here. \nWe passed judgment on a collective basis. It hasn't just been myself, \nor myself and my colleague, or our staffs. Everybody in the system is \ninvolved in clearing a bill, including the Senator from Arizona who \nknows I cleared several with him as chairman of the Commerce Committee.\n  All I say is, I am prepared to proceed in any way that the Senate \nwishes to proceed with the amendments. There are 25 amendments in this \npackage. They call it the first package. Several are being cleared that \nwill go in this. There is a group of, I think, six that is still out \nthere being cleared. Of these, Senator McCain has agreed with 11 out of \nthe 25. He agrees to modify four others that were not in my accounting. \nSo we can proceed with those on a consent basis and see if the Senator \nwants to call up the amendments. We are going to be here for a long \ntime if we do that, but in fairness I don't have the ability to \nwithdraw these and say the Senators cannot offer them. They allowed us \nto use them in the package mechanism so we could save time for the \nSenate. It is obviously not going to do that. I am prepared, however, \nas soon as I get the balance of this, to offer them all and let the \nSenator object and then we will move them one at a time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. BYRD. Why don't we just finish this Tuesday?\n  Mr. STEVENS. If we finish this Tuesday, the bill cannot be finished \nby next weekend because we have to have time for both Houses to prepare \na chart on a bill such as this, to see what our differences are, so we \ncan go into conference and deal with the differences. If we pass this \nbill Tuesday, the House will pass it Tuesday or Wednesday, and we will \nnot be able to get it finished by a week from Friday.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, sir.\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. In the request that will be propounded with respect to the \nappointment of conferees, how many conferees on the part of the Senate \nis the chairman expecting?\n  Mr. STEVENS. In the conference on the supplemental, following the \nprocedures the Senator from West Virginia and I have used in the past, \nwe will have the full committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Other Senators may do as they wish. This Senator is going \nto go home. That is my right to do. I don't have any quarrel with \nothers who want to stay. I have cast over 16,600 votes in the Senate. I \nthink I have been pretty loyal to my duties to my constituents. But I \nneed to be home. I have been married almost 66 years. I have been in \nthe Senate a little over 44 years. I have been married longer. So I \nthink my duty is to my wife. There are only two duties that will exceed \nmy duties in the Senate. One is my duty to my God and the second is to \nmy family.\n  So I ask unanimous consent, in accordance with paragraph 2 of rule VI \nof the Standing Rules of the Senate, that I be granted leave to go home \nnow and not vote any further today. I will be granted a leave of \nabsence for the rest of the day so that I can go home and be with my \nwife. Others who wish to stay here may do so. I have spent my time over \nthe years here. If others want to stay, that is fine. I don't think it \nis absolutely necessary to finish this tonight. I think we can wait \nuntil Tuesday. But as far as I am concerned, I thank all Senators for \ntheir staying around and completing action on this bill, but count me \nout. I so ask unanimous consent.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my great friend from West Virginia today \ntold me of the difficult problems he has and wanted to leave by 5:30. I \nthought we might make that. Again I find myself apologizing to my \nfriend twice in 2 days.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator does not owe me an apology.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thought we would finish the bill in time for the \nSenator to be with his wife.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator has always been courteous to me. I have no \nquarrel with him or any other Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not want to prolong the debate. The \nSenator from Alaska just mentioned there are six amendments still being \ncleared. This cannot be the way to spend the taxpayers' dollars--to \npack 25, or how ever many amendments there are, into a managers' \namendment accumulating billions of dollars.\n  The Senator from Alaska said ``the appropriate people were notified \nand these amendments were discussed with them.'' I do not like to \nindulge in a show of hands, but I guarantee you, Mr. President, most of \nthe Members of this body were not consulted on most of these amendments \nthat are in the managers' package because I have been here most of the \nday and I have never heard them discussed or debated. The only reason I \nam seeing them now for the first time, as I say, 40 minutes before we \nwould have had final passage on the bill is because we demanded to see \nthem.\n  Again, I am not a member of the Appropriations Committee. I believe \nthere are 20 some members of the hundred of us who are members of the \nAppropriations Committee. For us to simply say, I will accept a $600 \nmillion amendment; don't worry, we will work it out in conference--I am \nsupposed to go back to my constituents and say: I spent $600 million of \nyour money, but do not worry, we left it up to another Senator to work \nit out in conference.\n  We cannot govern this way. We cannot. We cannot have this kind of \nprocedure. I apologize to my colleagues for this, but I am not the one \nwho ran this procedure. I warned the Senator from Alaska time after \ntime that the managers' package was the most egregious of everything \nthat is done in the appropriations process. I will never forget a \ncouple years ago when I asked the manager of the bill: What is in the \nmanagers' package, as everybody was standing in line to vote. He said: \nI don't know.\n\n  I let it go because I did not want to anger my colleagues and upset \nthe schedules of my colleagues. Do you know what we found? We found \nabout $50 million in absolutely unnecessary and unrelated projects \nadded in a ``managers' amendment.'' We cannot do that. We cannot do \nbusiness this way.\n  I agree with the Senator from Alaska that he will win on every one of \nthese votes because we just saw earlier today that if we are not going \nto reject $93 million for an agriculture research center and $50 \nmillion for maritime administration guaranteed loans, which is a \ntotally failed program--and I have forgotten some of the others--we \ncertainly are not going to turn down amendments that have as much as \n$600 million.\n  Here is another one. An amendment described as town meetings. \nInteresting, town meetings. It removes a 250,000-person threshold for \nSenate funding of town meetings. What is that all about? It may be, as \nthe Senator alleges--I did not know they had more severe winters than \nothers at the South Pole, but there may be a very legitimate reason to \nlift the cap on a 250,000-person threshold for Senate funding of town \nmeetings. We do not know. We do not know, I say to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. I would like to finish first.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alaska. I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, I will wait.\n  Mr. McCAIN. All I am saying is we do not know. There may be good \nreasons or there may be bad reasons. There may be good reasons, when we \nare trying to fight the war on terrorism and the war on Iraq, to lift \nthe 250,000-person threshold for funding for town meetings. There may \nnot be also. We do not know.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make two points. One, I propose a vote \non the Kohl amendment, which is amendment No. 455, which gives an \nadditional $600 million for agriculture. At the conclusion of that \nvote, then I will be ready to go to final passage, but I want to tell \nmy colleagues for the last time, I will not--I will not--we cannot \ngovern this way. It is not right. We are not carrying out our duties to \nthe people who send their hard-earned tax dollars to us to handle with \ncare and deliberation.\n  So if it is agreeable with the Senator from Alaska, we will have a \nvote, which he will win, adding $600 million, which was in the \nmanagers' package and never debated or discussed that I know of, and I \nbet most of my colleagues never knew of, and we will probably adopt it, \ngiving an additional $600 million to help I guess feed the troops in \nIraq, and then we will go to final passage.\n  But I tell my colleagues who are here on the floor, I will not do \nthis managers' package routine ever again. If the Senator from Alaska \nfeels he will not carry something in conference because it is a losing \nvote, then that is how it should be, but at least every Senator will be \non record and their constituents will know how they stood on town \nmeetings and the South Pole and all of these others--Louisville/\nJefferson County Public Safety Communications System, et cetera. If it \nis agreeable with the Senator from Alaska, I will agree to a unanimous \nconsent request to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from Arizona \nfor that suggestion. I point out to him before we proceed--and we will \nproceed; I will ask Senator Kohl to be prepared to offer his amendment, \nand following that we will offer the managers' amendment--but just this \nafternoon, I was notified that travel and transportation for members of \nthe armed services was not authorized in some circumstances. One of \nthese amendments authorizes transportation of families of the people \nwho have been injured to Germany, or wherever they are, so they can see \ntheir loved ones. They did not have that authority. An amendment in \nthis bill will do that.\n\n  They also do not have the money and authorization to buy, for a young \nperson injured and coming back not on a\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\ngurney, but needs civilian clothes, something different to wear other \nthan a military uniform because of the injury--we have a provision in \nhere for the purchase of civilian attire for medical evacuation of \nmembers of the Armed Forces. Those came to me at 6 o'clock. I think \nthey are relevant to this bill, one of the six the Senator has not seen \nyet. There are a lot that came up.\n  I suggest we proceed. The managers' package concept replaces the old \nlitany of amendments that were offered and offered and offered. I \nremember one time we were here 40 hours. That is what you get into when \nyou do not have a managers' package.\n  Is Senator Kohl here?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We can offer it on his behalf.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Chair lay before the Senate Senator Kohl's \namendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 455\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 455.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Kohl, for \n     himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Harkin, and Mr. Nelson of Florida, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 455.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide humanitarian food assistance in connection with \n                        U.S. activities in Iraq)\n\n       On page 2, after line 7, insert the following:\n\n\n     ``public law 480 title ii grants (including transfer of funds)\n\n       ``For additional expenses during the current fiscal year, \n     not otherwise recoverable, and unrecovered prior year's \n     costs, including interest thereon, under the Agricultural \n     Trade Development Act of 1954, $600,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended, for commodities supplied in \n     connection with dispositions abroad under title II of said \n     Act: Provided, That of this amount, $155,000,000 shall be \n     used to restore funding for previously approved fiscal year \n     2003 programs under section 204(a)(2) of the Agricultural \n     Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954: Provided \n     further, That of the funds provided under this heading, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall transfer to the Commodity \n     Credit Corporation such sums as are necessary to acquire, and \n     shall acquire, a quantity of commodities for use in \n     administering the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust in an \n     amount equal to the quantity allocated by the Corporation \n     pursuant to the release of March 19, 2003, and the release of \n     March 20, 2003: Provided further, That the authority \n     contained in 7 U.S.C. 1736f-1(c)(4) shall not apply during \n     fiscal year 2003 for any release of commodities after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe consideration of Senator Kohl's amendment, the amendments that I \nshall offer en bloc be considered en bloc, and adopted en bloc as a \nmanagers' package.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw the request.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator renew his request?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I intend to renew the request. This is a unanimous \nconsent that the amendments we have here in the managers' package be \nconsidered en bloc following the vote on or in relation to the \namendment offered by Senator Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 455\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President,\n  I am pleased to join with Senator Roberts in offering this amendment.\n  I offer an amendment to provide $600 million for our international \nfood aid programs. The amendment is cosponsored by Senators Byrd, \nDaschle, Leahy, Harkin, Biden, Murray, Nelson of Florida, Dorgan, \nLincoln, Durbin, DeWine, Baucus, Roberts, and Dayton.\n  Our amendment is necessary because of the intense pressure the food \nneeds in Iraq have placed on our world food programs. Already, the \nDepartment of Defense has used $269 million from our largest \ninternational food aid program--PL-480--to feed the Iraqi people. That \nis $269 million from the $1.4 billion that was appropriated last year \nfor other world hunger needs in places like Sub-Saharan Africa and \nAfghanistan. As the war progresses and the reconstruction begins, the \ndraw on our existing food aid accounts will continue.\n  Specifically, our amendment replenishes the $269 million already \ntaken from PL-480 for Iraq. It also adds $100 million to an emergency \ngrain reserve--the Emerson Trust--which has recently released \napproximately 800,000 tons of wheat to Iraq. A final $231 million is \nmade available for future Iraqi draws on PL-480 as that country waits \nfor the resumption of the UN ``Oil for Food'' Program.\n  This amendment is responsible budgeting. We are asking only for the \nminimum dollars we need to meet an unanticipated food crisis in Iraq--a \ncrisis that is the direct result of the war. Our actions will allow us \nto meet this crisis efficiently without crippling our other food aid \nefforts.\n  I do not for a moment dispute the Administration's decision to tap \ninto PL-480 funds to meet immediate needs in Iraq. I do dispute the \nposition that we should not replenish those funds--thus effectively \ndefaulting on our obligations to starving people in other countries.\n  There is no doubt that the war has disrupted food delivery to \ninnocent Iraqis. And everyone agrees that, as we move to liberate the \nIraqi people, we have an absolute obligation to deliver humanitarian \nrelief.\n  Before the war, a full 60 percent of the Iraqi population was fed \nthrough the UN-run ``Oil for Food Program''--a program that turned \nIraqi oil revenues into food supplies. It provided over $3 billion \nworth of food a year distributed at more than 40,000 food distribution \nsites throughout the country. On March 17, UN Secretary General Kofi \nAnnan suspended the Oil for Food Program. Now, over 2 weeks later, the \ncitizens of Iraq are nearing the end of their food stocks.\n  We are not just guessing that a food crisis is imminent in Iraq. The \nUN has stated unequivocally that there is a continuing and immediate \nneed to feed the Iraqi people as they attempt to reestablish the Oil \nfor Food Program. Last Friday, the United Nations petitioned the world \ncommunity for $1.3 billion to meet that need. Just Saturday, the World \nFood Program announced that the operation in Iraq could ``evolve into \nthe largest humanitarian operation in history.'' The supplemental \nbefore us earmarks no funds for that effort.\n  The administration has decided--I believe correctly--to use our \nexisting food aid programs to deliver this aid to Iraq. Our amendment \nsimply asks that we replace the funds we are removing now--and will \ncontinue to remove--from that program--funds that were budgeted for \nstarving people in Africa, Afghanistan, Indonesia, and North Korea.\n  Our amendment is endorsed by a coalition of international relief \nagencies called the ``Coalition for Food Aid.'' Their members include \nthe American Red Cross, CARE, Catholic Relief Services, and Save the \nChildren. The amendment is also supported by the American Farm Bureau, \nthe National Association of Wheat Growers, the U.S. Rice Producers \nAssociation, the USA Rice Federation, and the Wheat Export Trade \nEducation Committee. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord these letters of endorsement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    April 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Herbert Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: The undersigned organizations appreciate \n     your dedication to restore funding for food aid and we \n     support your amendment to the FY03 Supplemental \n     Appropriations bill.\n       Your amendment comes at a critical time as the United \n     States prepares to provide necessary food aid for the people \n     of Iraq. Providing additional funding and replenishing\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\n     funding for current food aid programs will place these \n     programs in a better position to meet this year's food aid \n     needs. The amendment also provides the flexibility to \n     purchase the mix of commodities that are needed without \n     disrupting our own domestic market.\n       American agriculture is prepared and dedicated to providing \n     U.S. commodities for those in need to help alleviate hunger. \n     We thank you for your leadership and urge adoption of your \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Farm Bureau Federation, National Association of \n     Wheat Growers, US Rice Producers Association, USA Rice \n     Federation, and Wheat Export Trade Education Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n         Agriculture, Maritime and Charitable Organizations, \n           Supporting Additional Food Aid Funding,\n                                                    April 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: We appreciate and support your amendment \n     to the FY 2003 Supplemental Appropriations Bill to restore \n     funding for food aid programs and to provide adequate \n     additional funds for emergency needs. By appropriating $600 \n     million for PL 480 Title II, including funds to partially \n     replenish the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, this amendment \n     will allow the US to meet commitments to many needy countries \n     this year and to be prepared to provide adequate humanitarian \n     food assistance in the wake of conflict in Iraq.\n       Because of the gap between the amount of funds available \n     for food aid and actual food needs, the Administration has \n     been forced to limit funding for African emergencies and to \n     reduce ongoing food assistance in many vulnerable countries, \n     including Angola, Bangladesh, Uganda, Malawi, Haiti, \n     Mozambique, Ghana, Kenya, Bolivia, Guatemala, Peru and parts \n     of Ethiopia. The amendment assures the restoration of funds \n     for previously-approved food aid programs in FY 2003. It is \n     critical that these funds be provided as soon as possible to \n     replenish these programs, since it takes a few months to buy \n     commodities and to deliver them abroad.\n       The amendment also provides funds to restore the Bill \n     Emerson Humanitarian Trust to 2 million metric tons, one half \n     of the authorized level. This will replenish the value of \n     commodities that are allocated in FY 2003 for food assistance \n     related to the conflict in Iraq. For the rest of fiscal year \n     2003, it would remove the authority for the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to sell Emerson Trust commodities on the domestic \n     market. Because additional funds are made available by this \n     amendment for Title II and to replenish the Emerson Trust, \n     needed commodities can be purchased directly from the market \n     and sales of commodities held by the Trust is unnecessary.\n       With America's abundant agricultural resources and long-\n     standing tradition of helping the poor, providing funding so \n     the United States may meet its commitments to help alleviate \n     hunger is both appropriate and necessary. We therefore thank \n     you for your leadership and urge the acceptance of your \n     amendment by the United States Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n       ACDI/VOCA, Africare, American Red Cross, Cal Western \n     Packaging Corp., Adventist Development & Relief Agency \n     International, American Maritime Congress, American Soybean \n     Association, CARE, Catholic Relief Services, Counterpart \n     International, Food for the Hungry International, \n     International Food Additives Council, International Orthodox \n     Christian Charities, Jesuit Refugee Service/USA, Maersk \n     Sealand, and Maritime Institute for Research and Industrial \n     Development.\n       National Association of Wheat Growers, National Dry Bean \n     Council, National Milk Producers Federation, OIC \n     International, SUSTAIN, Transportation Institute, U.S. Rice \n     Producers Association, USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council, Wheat \n     Export Trade Education Committee, World Vision, Colorado \n     Potato Growers Association, Didion Milling, Inc., Global Food \n     & Nutrition Inc., International Organization of Masters, \n     Mates & Pilots, International Relief & Development, Land \n     O'Lakes, Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, Mercy \n     Corps, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers \n     Union, North American Millers' Association, Save the \n     Children, TECO Ocean Shipping Company, U.S. Dairy Export \n     Council, U.S. Wheat Associates; USA Rice Federation; and \n     Wilson Logistics, Inc.\n  Mr. KOHL. In the last month, we have heard many voices expressing \nmany views of what it means to be American and at war. Among those \ndisparate voices, there are strong, common themes: our pride in our \nbrave troops; our burning hatred for tyranny and injustice; our undying \ncompassion for the poor and hungry of the world.\n  Our amendment speaks to the last of these. It states simply that, \neven in times of war, America will remain a compassionate leader in the \nworld community and a passionate combatant of hunger and hopelessness \nthroughout the world.\n  To reiterate, I offer this amendment because through the Department \nof Defense and other agencies, $269 million from our largest \ninternational food program, Public Law 480, and the Bill Emerson \nHumanitarian Trust, have already been obligated to meet the urgent \nnecessity to feed the Iraqi people. That $269 million is derived from \nfunds appropriated or made available last year for other world hunger \nneeds in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Korea, and North \nKorea. We need to replenish that money which has been used to feed the \npeople in Iraq.\n  I also thought we needed to provide more than an additional $200 \nmillion for the requirements that I anticipate we will be very shortly \nfacing in Iraq with respect to feeding their people. The Bill Emerson \nHumanitarian Trust is an emergency grain reserve which recently \nreleased approximately 800,000 tons of wheat for assistance to Iraq at \na cost of $100 million. The replenishment of the Bill Emerson \nHumanitarian Trust, restoration of Public Law 480 funds that have been \ndiverted from areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa, and providing resources \nfor anticipated needs in Iraq total the $600 million I have included in \nthis amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as U.S. and allied forces \nsteadfastly close on Baghdad, they come closer to liberating the people \nof Iraq, and closer to ridding the world of a menace to global peace. \nOur troops are performing magnificently. The young men and women of our \narmed forces have served bravely and honorably, and have made me proud.\n  When the bombing stops and the war is over, the world will be a safer \nplace. But make no mistake, the American commitment in Iraq must endure \nfor a long haul. It is incumbent upon the United States to ensure \nIraq's transition to a freedom. One element critical to post-conflict \nreconstruction has already begun, and must continue throughout the \nfighting. That element is the supply of food and humanitarian relief to \nthe people of Iraq.\n  The supplemental does provide some funds for humanitarian relief, but \nit is not enough. The Senator from Wisconsin has offered an amendment \nto this legislation which would provide $600 million in funding in \nemergency food relief for P.L. 480, Title Two and the Emerson \nHumanitarian Trust. This $600 million the amendment provides is based \non close consultation with organizations who know the situation well \nfrom their humanitarian work. The Kohl amendment is vitally important \nto ongoing operations in Iraq. It: restores funds diverted from other \nemergency food assistance provided in P.L. 480 activities--including \nthose in Africa--that have been redirected for assistance to Iraq; \nrestores 800,000 metric tons of Emerson Trust, another humanitarian \nfood relief program, because of previous releases this year; and allows \nfor at least one third of food aid needs for Iraq, as identified by the \nWorld Food Program. Historically, the U.S. provides one half of \nemergency food aid needs.\n  At the time hostilities commenced in Iraq, the U.N. Oil for Food \nProgram provided food to over 60 percent of the Iraqi people via over \n40,000 feeding stations. These feeding stations were run by the regime \nof Saddam Hussein. Hopefully, U.S. and coalition forces can restore the \nprogram quickly. But hope alone will not feed Iraqi families left \nstarving by a disruption in this program. The world Food Program has \njust announced an overall appeal of $1.3 billion for food aid for Iraq \nfor the next 6 months.\n  We must make adequate preparations right now to provide the food \nassistance required of us. The Kohl amendment delivers on this moral \nimperative by providing funds needed for the remainder of this fiscal \nyear in the event significant Oil for Food Program revenues are not \navailable, or is otherwise unable to function.\n  In another part of the globe desperately needing food assistance, the \ndroughts in sub-Saharan Africa have caused a massive food shortage over \nthe last several months. The toll of this famine threatens millions of \nAfricans and could be far worse than anything we have seen previously. \nThe terrible epidemic of HIV/AIDS, which is currently ravaging the \ncontinent, destroys the immune systems of its victims. When further \nweakened by malnutrition, they are unable to fight off\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\neven the most mild illnesses thereby exacerbating the impact of the \nfood shortage. In addition, we know there is still about $250-$350 \nmillion shortfall in food assistance to Africa for this fiscal year, \nwhich the Congress was unable to provide during consideration of the \nomnibus appropriations legislation for 2003. It is vitally important \nthat food assistance to this region not be shortchanged, forcing us to \nchoose which mouths to feed, on which continents.\n  Similarly, there have been droughts in regions of Haiti. The United \nStates currently provides food assistance to Haiti from P.L. 480, Title \nTwo, to the tune of about $22 million, or about 40 percent of our \nbilateral assistance. This assistance is so important because it is one \nof the few ways in which we can help the Haitian people, without \nproviding assistance to a corrupt government. We do not provide Haiti \nwith other forms of assistance commonly provided to other countries, \nlike economic support funds or development assistance. This is due to \nthe political stalemate, almost 3 years old, and the inability of \nPresident Aristide to take any meaningful and demonstrable steps to \nresolve the crisis and improve conditions. Therefore, the integrity of \nthe food assistance to Haiti must be protected and preserved in its \nentirety. The Kohl Amendment does so.\n  This provision also provides initial resources that will be needed to \nwin the peace in Iraq. It does not specifically designate the funds for \nIraq, to be consistent with the way we have traditionally appropriated \nfood assistance governed by P.L. 480 Title II funds, but I trust that \nthese funds will be used for the purpose for which they are intended--\nfeeding the Iraqi people without raiding important food assistance \naccounts for other regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, and Haiti.\n  We must act now. I urge support of the Kohl Amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin mentioned Saudi \nArabia; I did not know the people of Saudi Arabia were in need.\n  But, again, it is unrequested by the administration. I am sure it is \nworthwhile. There is not an amendment that has come before us that is \nnot worthwhile, but it was not felt urgent at this time by the \nadministration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I don't know of anyone on our side who \nasked for time on the amendment. I believe the Senator has explained \nit. I ask unanimous consent that when we start consideration of this \nvote, there be no further amendments in order, and that immediately \nfollowing the vote on the managers' package, we go to third reading of \nthis bill, and we have a procedure arranged so that we would hold this \nbill at the desk until the House bill arrived and it would \nautomatically be married to the House bill and sent to conference as \nsoon as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object, I will be very brief. I am \nvery reluctant to do this because the chairman has been very gracious \nto me.\n  Senator Collins and I had worked throughout the day on a bipartisan \namendment. We would like a few minutes. It has been heard by the \ncommittees of jurisdiction, and we would like a few minutes to work \nwith the chairman because if we are going to spend billions, we \ncertainly ought to make sure there is a repetitiveness in the \ncontracting. The Senator from Maine, the Chair of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, has done exceptional work in this area. If we could \nwork with the chairman, I think in a few minutes we could work this \nout.\n  I am very reluctant to make this reservation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator's amendment would change the \nprocedure for every Department or Agency in the Federal Government in \nterms of the concept of what must be published in the Federal Register. \nIt also has an exception for withholding publication of any document \nthat is classified.\n  But in the period of time we are in right now, I don't have time to \nresearch this in terms of what does this do to the Department of \nDefense, what does it do to the CIA, what does it do to the FBI, what \ndoes it do to every other organization of the country. I have tried to \nclear this. There is a great deal of what has been eliminated, but I, \ntoo, am a member of this Governmental Affairs Committee, and I could \nnot ever remember taking it up in the Governmental Affairs Committee. I \nunderstand what it is, but I don't understand its impact on the \nagencies I am supposed to protect in terms of the Department of \nDefense.\n  I cannot in good faith accept that.\n  I renew my request that following the vote on the managers' package, \nno further votes be in order and we proceed immediately to third \nreading under the proceedings as outlined, which will be outlined in \nfuller detail at that time, but it will mean that will be the last vote \nof the day and we will not vote past taking the bill to third reading.\n  The Kohl amendment comes first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the first amendment offered \nby the Senator from Alaska when we started yesterday, that is going to \nbe withdrawn; is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will have a dialog here about the debt ceiling \namendment, and I have given my word to the Senator from West Virginia \nthat we would withdraw the amendment. I want to have that dialog. That \ncan take place after the vote. I assured everyone that will be handled \nin a proper way. I have been asked to make a record of why we did not \nproceed with the debt ceiling amendment, and I would like to do it at \nthat time.\n  I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The parliamentary situation is: We will vote on the Kohl \namendment, we will vote then on the managers' package, and then the \nbill will go to third reading under the outline we provided at that \ntime, and there be no further votes or amendments in order to this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are four amendments pending which must \nbe disposed of prior to third reading.\n\n\n              Amendments Nos. 440, 500, and 504, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would say there are amendments at the desk that have \nbeen modified or agreed to and put into the managers' package. So I ask \nthat those be withdrawn. I believe all the Members involved know what \nhas been done on those amendments. I ask that they be withdrawn and--\nthere are four of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We took out some \namendments and put a new one in its place, but we did not make it a \nsubstitute for the amendment that is in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 522.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an amendment \nI have offered to provide funding for the All Hazards Emergency Warning \nNetwork. If we are truly going to improve homeland defense, we must \nprepare Americans to respond in time of attack. And the first step \ntowards that goal is updating our emergency warning system. We must \nensure that warnings reach all Americans at risk as quickly as \npossible.\n  In the event of a terrorist attack or natural disaster, Americans \nmust know how to respond. Unfortunately, for everything that has \nhappened since September 11, if an attack happened again, many of us \nstill would not know what to do. Today, our emergency alert system \ndepends heavily on television and radio, and doesn't reach millions of \nAmericans who aren't near a TV and radio at a given moment. In \naddition, the system doesn't provide all the information we need. Right \nnow, the All Hazards Warning Network cannot effectively broadcast \ninformation about all types of emergencies, particularly terrorist \nattacks. That must change. We need to ensure that NOAA has the funds it \nneeds to begin incorporating new warnings and new technologies within \nthe national weather radio immediately.\n  I have proposed providing NOAA with $10 million right now for \nincorporating additional technologies for disseminating terrorism \nwarnings within the All Hazards Warning Network. There are a lot of \nways that NOAA weather radio could be broadcast using existing \ntechnology. For example, cell phones could receive emergency warnings \nfor users in a certain area even if those folks are just passing \nthrough. Pagers and beepers can achieve the same result. Televisions \ncan be programmed to come on automatically and provide alerts in the \nevent of a disaster. We need to encourage the development and \nimplementation of these new technologies.\n  Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, NOAA needs to have full \ncommunication with emergency managers at the local level--the men and \nwomen who will be on the front lines of any emergency. The All Hazards \nWarning Network needs to allow emergency managers to transmit warnings \nabout all types of disasters, including terrorism, to citizens in their \narea without the delays currently in place.\n  This is an idea I have been working on for some time. This first bill \nI introduced this session, together with Mr. Hollings, would require \nthe Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Commerce to \nmake sure that comprehensive, easily understood emergency warnings get \nto every American at risk. Today's amendment will go a long way towards \nreaching that goal.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am proud to offer an amendment with \nSenator Craig and five other Senators that will repeal a rider that was \ninserted without a vote, without debate, and without discussion into \nthe Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report.\n  After the Conference Committee met and behind closed doors, this \nspecial interest rider gutted the organic standards just recently \nenacted by U.S. Department of Agriculture. This special interest \nprovision was inserted into the bill on behalf of a single producer who \nessentially wants to hijack the ``organic'' certification label for his \nown purposes, to get a market premium for his products, without \nactually being an organic product.\n  The antiorganic rider allows producers to label their meat and dairy \nproducts ``organic'' even though they do not meet the strict criteria \nset forth by USDA, including the requirement that the animals be fed \norganically grown feed. This approach was considered and outright \nrejected by USDA last June. The entire organic industry opposed this \nweakening of the organic standards.\n  If beef, poultry, pork and dairy producers are able to label their \nproducts as ``organic'' without using organic feed, which is one of the \nprimary inputs, then what exactly is organic about the product?\n  Opposition to this rider has been broad, deep, and extremely \nbipartisan. I have spoken to Secretary Veneman, who has come out \npublicly in opposition to the antiorganic rider. In the last month, a \ntotal of 68 Senators have joined me by cosponsoring a bill to repeal \nthis rider.\n  This antiorganic rider is particularly galling because so many \nproducers have already made the commitment to organic production. For \nmost, this is a huge financial commitment on their part.\n  Now the rider has created a legal limbo for farmers. No one knows \nwhat the legal requirements for organic animal products are anymore.\n  I have heard from large producers--General Mills, Tyson Foods--as \nwell as scores of farmers from Vermont and around the country who are \nenraged by this special loophole included for one company that does not \nwant to play by the rules.\n  Our amendment simply strikes this antiorganic rider from the Omnibus\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\nAppropriations Act, restoring the strong organic standards created by \nUSDA. We need to send a message to all producers that if you want to \nbenefit from the organic standards economically, you must actually meet \nthem.\n  When I included the Organic Foods Production Act in the 1990 farm \nbill, it was because farmers recognized the growing consumer demand for \norganically produced products, but needed a tool to help consumers know \nwhich products were truly organic and which were not.\n  The act directed USDA to set minimum national standards for products \nlabeled ``organic'' so that consumers could make informed buying \ndecisions. The national standard also reassured farmers selling \norganically produced products that they would not have to follow \nseparate rules in each State, and that their products could be labeled \n``organic'' overseas.\n  The new standards have been enthusiastically welcomed by consumers, \nbecause through organic labeling they now can know what they are \nchoosing and paying for when they shop. The antiorganic rider, however, \nhas undermined public confidence in organic labeling, which is less \nthan a year old.\n  This was not the first attempt to weaken the organic standards. \nGetting the organic standards that are behind the ``USDA Organic'' \nlabel right was a long and difficult process, but critically important \nto the future of the industry. During the rule-making process, some \ntried to allow products treated with sewer sludge, irradiation, and \nantibiotics to be labeled ``organic.''\n  The public outcry against this was overwhelming. More than 325,000 \npeople weighed in during the comment period, as did I. The groundswell \nof support for strong standards clearly showed that the public wants \n``organic'' to really mean something. Those efforts to hijack the term \nwere defeated and this one should be, too.\n  Consumers and producers rely on the standard. I hope more members \nwill support my amendment and send a message to special interests that \nthey cannot hijack the organic industry through a rider on the spending \nbill.\n  We need to fix this mistake and restore integrity to our organic \nstandards.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today would \nrestore fiscal year 2003 funding for the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program, SCAAP, to the level of funding Congress provided in \nfiscal year 2002.\n  Specifically, my amendment would provide an additional $315 million \nin supplemental funding to the SCAAP program, to bring the total fiscal \nyear 2003 appropriations to the same amount that was appropriated in \nfiscal year 2002--$565 million.\n  Most of my colleagues have had to deal with the question of illegal \nimmigration. Just the sheer number of illegal immigrants in our \ncountry--estimates range from 9 to 11 million--suggests that Federal \nstrategies to curb illegal immigration have failed.\n  While only a relatively small percentage of the illegal immigrant \npopulation have committed crimes, nonetheless, even that small \npercentage represents a significant burden on State and local \ngovernments, which are forced to apprehend, prosecute, and incarcerate \nthose who prey on our communities.\n  Today most States are encountering their largest deficits in more \nthan 60 years. Indeed, the fiscal consequences of illegal immigration \nhave contributed to this challenge. In fiscal year 2002, for instance, \nStates and counties incurred more than $13 billion in incarceration \nexpenses. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to help \nshoulder the burden that its failures have created. The Federal \nGovernment alleviated some of that burden by providing $565 million to \nthe States in fiscal year 2002.\n  Increasingly, States and local counties are relying on SCAAP funding \nto help supplement their homeland security activities.\n  Clearly, our local governments would spend the $13 billion they have \nspent incarcerating criminal aliens on other fiscal priorities, such as \nhomeland security.\n  The amendment I offer today would not only provide a more equitable \nlevel of funding to help reimburse States for the costs they incur for \nincarcerating undocumented criminal aliens, it would also help free up \nfunds that State and local governments may need for their first \nresponder activities.\n  Without adequate funding, this fiscal burden will continue to fall on \nmany of our local law enforcement agencies--including sheriffs, police \nofficers on the beat, antigang violence units, and district attorneys \noffices.\n  At a time when cash-strapped State and local governments are being \nasked to do even more to protect our homeland, we cannot afford to \neliminate vital funding that already falls far short of what local \ngovernments spend to incarcerate undocumented criminal aliens.\n  SCAAP payments have never matched the true costs to the States \ndealing with this problem, but they have nevertheless been critical \nadditions to prison and jail budgets. They have also symbolized the \nFederal Government's obligation to pay for the results of its failed \nimmigration strategies.\n  Counties and sheriffs offices across the country, and not just those \nalong the border, are very concerned because of the severe cuts in \nfunding this year. I have received letters from county executives and \nsheriffs from Virginia, Wisconsin, New York, and other States who are \nfacing critical cuts in their law enforcement budgets because of the \nanticipated shortfall in SCAAP funding. Those amounts will be cut \ndrastically.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may submit for the record, a chart \ncomparing the amount of SCAAP money States received in fiscal year 2002 \nto the amount they will receive with the fiscal year 2003 SCAAP \nallocation of $250 million.\n  Our Nation is facing one of the most challenging periods in our \nNation's history. And, we want, to the best extent possible, our \nconstituents to feel secure in their homes and in their communities.\n  At a time when the Nation is focused on enhancing security within our \nborders, our States, and our local communities, a vital program like \nSCAAP should not be vulnerable to being underfunded or eliminated \naltogether.\n  The control of illegal immigration is a Federal obligation and we owe \nit to our States and local communities to provide them with the \ncritical Federal assistance they need to continue doing their job.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my amendment will increase funding by \n$295 million to help meet the humanitarian and other needs that are \nalready obvious in Iraq and that are likely to mushroom in the weeks \nand months ahead.\n  To achieve victory in Iraq, we must not only win the war, but win the \npeace as well. And we know that in order to do this, we will have to \ndeal effectively from the start with all the serious problems we'll \nface in meeting humanitarian needs, establishing law and order, and \nbeginning the reconstruction process there.\n  For the next six months, to cover the additional costs that are \nlikely to arise in the current fiscal year, the administration has \nrequested $2.4 billion for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. \nIt's an essential down payment, and I commend the administration for \nincluding this provision.\n  Many of us on both of the aisle feel that we need to send a strong \nsignal of our willingness to work with the UN in post-war Iraq, and put \nthe recent harsh divisions that erupted in the Security Council behind \nus.\n  President Bush said that that if military force is required to disarm \nIraq, the United States would ``quickly seek new Security Council \nresolutions to encourage broad participation in the process of helping \nthe Iraqi people to build a free Iraq.'' He also said that to achieve \nthe goal of a unified Iraq with democratic institutions, we will be \n``working closely with the international community, including the \nUnited Nations and our coalition partners.''\n  Lately, however, we read stories of a tug of war between the State \nDepartment and DoD over who will be in charge of the post-war effort \nand how. Secretary Powell has said that the UN has ``a role to play in \nmany different\n\n[[Page S4808]]\n\nways'' and that its involvement is needed to provide ``international \nlegitimacy'' to the post-war efforts.\n  As our key ally, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Great Britain said \nyesterday the post-war effort ``should not, in the end, be run by the \nAmericans, should not be run by the British, should not be run by any \noutside force. Iraq should be run, for the first time in decades, by \nthe Iraqi people.''\n  These are strong statements of the importance of cooperation among \nour friends and allies in the major challenges facing the region and \nthe world in the aftermath of this war.\n  They also make good sense. The UN will be essential in assessing, \ncoordinating and delivering humanitarian aid, and in defusing any rage \nin the region over a so-called U.S. occupation.\n  With the resumption of the UN's Oil for Food program last week, \nresources will start to become available to meet the food needs of the \nIraqi people. However, we still have to meet other needs, such as \nsanitation, health, shelter, the removal of landmines, and local \nemergency repairs to help civilians resume their daily lives as soon as \npossible. My amendment provides an additional $225 million to meet \nthese priorities and to prevent illness, disease, and death among the \nsurvivors of the war.\n  It also provides an additional $45 million for law enforcement. The \nrule of law--the sense of public security and safety--is something that \nwe often take for granted. As we learned in Kosovo, and again in \nAfghanistan, law and order are the indispensable cornerstones for \nbuilding a functioning society. Without it, everything else takes \nlonger, and costs more. Experts may doubt that Iraq will erupt into \nmajor civil conflicts, but most of them do expect local violence, \nrevenge killing, and power struggles if there is no clear transitional \nforce and stable government.\n  The bill before us contains funds for a civilian police force, but a \nfull judicial team has not been included. This was a significant \nproblem in Kosovo, and it can be avoided in Iraq by paying adequate \nattention to revising laws so that the effort to bring criminals to \njustice is not undermined. The immediate presence of a judicial team \nwill assist in expediting this process and begin to establish adequate \nrules on arrests, detention, trials, and other aspects of a new legal \nsystem.\n  Fair treatment of the people of Iraq in the immediate weeks and \nmonths after the war will obviously help to smooth the way to peace and \nencourage other nations to join in meeting this responsibility.\n  The final provision of this amendment addresses a separate ongoing \nneed. The Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund is our global \nfund for unforeseen refugee and migration emergencies. This program has \nbeen funded at $50 million, but its needs continue to outpace the \navailable resources. The United Nations refugee agency recently \nappealed to us for $29 million to assist the refugee emergency in the \nIvory Coast and another $29 million to finance the repatriation of \nAngolans.\n  The underlying bill provides an additional $75 million, but in the \nnext six months, new demands for these emergency funds are likely for \nAfghanistan, Sudan, and the Congo. It makes sense to provide the funds \nnow that we already know we will need for this account. With emergency \nrelief, it is not a question of if but when. The amendment will add $25 \nmillion to be sure that we have sufficient monies to respond to \nemergencies on the horizon. As we focus on the humanitarian needs in \nIraq, we cannot ignore the refugee crises in Africa and other regions \nof the world.\n  We know that the whole world is watching what we do. Reports of \nmassive anger in the Middle East and in other countries should be very \ntroubling to us all. We need to get the Iraq reconstruction effort \nright the first time. Its importance cannot be under-estimated, and we \ncan't afford to leave it underfunded.\n  These additional funds are a start, a downpayment on the longer \neffort. This bill may well not be enough even for the very short term \nof the next six months. Far more will be needed to meet our \nresponsibilities, and to win the peace. We ought to be planning and \npreparing to meet these reponsibilites now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank all Members for their patience and courtesy. And \nas the leader said, this is the last vote. We will handle the problem \nof moving this matter to third reading after this vote. There will be \nno further votes tonight. Have we adopted the managers' amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n522.\n  The amendment (No. 522) was agreed to.\n\n\n                      amendment no. 435, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, according to the Treasury Department, the \nstatutory limit on the national debt needs to be raised. The amendment \nI offered yesterday would have increased the debt limit so as to avoid \nthe risk of a default. I understand the concerns that have been raised \nabout this amendment by the other side, and I am willing to withdraw \nthe amendment if the majority can be assured that the Senate will pass \na freestanding bill to increase the debt limit with the cooperation of \nthe minority and without unnecessary delay, and there will be no \nnecessity to file cloture to bring this bill to a vote. I know the \ndistinguished Democratic whip has discussed this with the Democratic \nleader and others, and I would ask if he is able to give those \nassurances at this time.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee that he is correct: I have discussed this \nmatter with the Democratic leader and others, and we fully understand \nthe importance of ensuring that the borrowing authority of the Treasury \nis not impeded, and we appreciate the interest of the Senator from \nAlaska making certain that the full faith and credit of the United \nStates is never called into question. While we on this side cannot \ncommit to supporting a bill we have not seen, we do assure the Senator \nfrom Alaska that when a freestanding bill to increase the debt limit in \nthe usual form is brought to the floor, we will work with him to see to \nit that the bill is passed in a timely and orderly way, without any \nunncesssary delay. The Senator has our commitment on that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the cooperation of the Democratic whip, and \ngiven his assurances, I withdraw my amendment dealing with the debt \nceiling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 435 is \nwithdrawn.\n\n\n                                  ATAP\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to address Senator McConnell, the \nchairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, about \nthe Antiterrorism Training Assistance Program, or ATAP.\n  I note that the supplemental appropriations bill includes $52 million \nfor the State Department to establish the Center for Antiterrorism and \nSecurity Training (CAST) in Maryland. These funds were deferred from \nthe Consolidated appropriations Resolution for Fiscal Year 2003 with \nthe understanding that they would be included in an appropriate \nvehicle, which is this bill. CAST will be a central training academy \nfor the State Department.\n  It will be a while before the new center is operational, which makes \nit difficult for me to understand the actions of the State Department \nto eliminate and scale back existing antiterrorism training programs \nthat have been successfully carried out by Louisiana State University \n(LSU) and the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (New Mexico \nTech) for the past several years. In fact, LSU has been carrying out \nthis training for the State Department for over a decade. New Mexico \nTech has partnered with LSU since January 2000.\n  The State Department has relocated the Hostage Negotiations Program \nfrom New Mexico Tech to LSU, and it has advised New Mexico Tech that it \nwill relocate the Rural Border Operations Course to a facility on a \nmilitary base in Albuquerque.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my colleague from New Mexico in \nquestioning the State Department's actions on the ATAP training \nprograms. Both\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\nuniversities and the surrounding communities have made substantial \ninvestments in facilities, curriculum, and even diplomacy in welcoming \nforeign law enforcement officers to their communities and providing \nthem with training courses to help them combat terrorist and other \ncriminal activity. Yet it appears the State Department will pull all \nATAP training out of New Mexico Tech by this June. I can only guess \nthat the State Department has similar intentions for LSU in my State.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. Chairman, this makes no sense to me as this Nation \ncontiues to fight the war on terrorism and is now engaged in a war \nagainst Iraq. The antiterrorism training programs are more critical \nthan ever, and they should continue to be carried out at LSU and New \nMexico Tech, which have run successful programs for the Department of \nState for years.\n  Mr. Chairman, would you agree with me that it is premature to \nwithdraw current antiterrorism training assistance courses out of LSU \nand New Mexico Tech during these troubled times?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would agree with the Senator from New Mexico that \nthis seems to be an unusual time for the State Department to take such \nactions. The Foreign Operations Subcommittee has provided significant \nincreases for the ATAP Program through the regular appropriations bill \nand the supplemental appropriations bill last year, and the President \nproposes another $106 million for this program, an increase of nearly \n$42 million above the current level.\n  I believe these programs with law enforcement personnel from other \nnations are more important than ever, and there is a significant \nbenefit to the State Department in using the facilities at LSU and New \nMexico Tech to continue these training programs. I would concur that \nthe Department should continue to carry out these courses at these two \nuniversities.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chairman for his direction on this matter.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I can understand the concerns of the Senator from \nLouisiana and the Senator from New Mexico. I join the chairman of the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee in his view that the State Department \nshould continue to carry out ATAP courses at Lousiana State University \nand the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for their \ninterest in, and assistance on, this most important issue.\n\n\n                        Surplus Food Aid to Iraq\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago Ambassador Wendy Chamberlain \nof the U.S. Agency for International Development testified before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee that there is as little as a 1-month \nsupply of food available to Iraqi citizens. I am told that the \nadministration has had informal discussions with the Appropriations \nCommittee on how they plan to spend the $2.4 billion in the \nsupplemental for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund.\n  After hearing about these consultations with the administration, I am \nvery concerned to learn that there is virtually no new money in this \nbill for food aid. Rather, the money that is being requested will be \nused primarily to reimburse funds that were already borrowed from other \nfiscal year 2003 foreign operation accounts to pay for food aid or to \npay for logistics and distribution. The good news is that the Senate \nmay be working to increase the amount of food aid in this bill and the \nHouse version of the supplemental appropriates funds for food aid.\n  With this food aid, we have a chance to help not only the Iraqi \npeople, but also America's farmers. Many of America's farmers are \nexperiencing a surplus of commodities that could provide valuable \nnutrition to the Iraqi people while alleviating potential crop losses \nfor our Nation's farmers. Our high quality food products such as rice, \nbeans, raisings, dates, dried fruit and other relatively nonperishable \nitems are familiar foods in that region of the world and would be \nappropriate for inclusion in our relief supplies.\n  I am wondering if the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee could tell me if this additional food aid \nfunding can be used to purchase surplus agricultural commodities, which \nwould both help feed the Iraqi people and benefit American farmers?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, that use is entirely permitted. I agree that we \nshould do all that we can to help the Iraqi people and our farmers at \nthe same time.\n  Mr. KOHL. I think that this is an excellent suggestion, and I would \nsupport the use of a portion of these funds to purchase surplus U.S. \ncommodities that are appropriate to meet the dietary needs of the \naffected populations and that are currently authorized for inclusion \nunder these programs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleagues.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are currently engaged in a war \nwith Iraq. I strongly believe that our military must have every \nresource at its disposal to fully prosecute and win this war. I support \nthe Senate fiscal year 2003 supplemental appropriations bill because it \nprovides funding for the military functions of the Department of \nDefense as it prosecutes the war in Iraq. The bill also includes \nfunding for the reconstruction efforts in Iraq and funding to continue \nour anti-terrorism efforts. However, I am disappointed that the bill \ndoes not provide adequate funding to protect our homeland.\n  The bill provides more than $62 billion to prosecute the military \noperations in Iraq, including replenishing munitions that have been \nexpended and maintaining air, ground and sea operations critical to our \nwar effort. It also provides more than $7.8 billion to support the \nreconstruction of health services, sanitation, transportation and \ntelecommunications for the people of Iraq.\n  I also support the additional funds included in this bill to increase \nairline security. The bill provides $1 billion to reimburse airline \nsecurity costs, $100 million to assist airlines in upgrading cockpit \ndoors, and $375 million for airline operating and capital costs. I \nbelieve that this funding will help maintain the flying safety of the \nAmerican public.\n  I am grateful to both Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Byrd for \nproviding $150 million to the Department of Veterans Affairs for health \ncare services to veterans of the Iraq war. I worked with Senator Graham \non an amendment to help pay for the health care of returning service \nmembers who are released from the military. We are not meeting our \npromises to our veterans. The VA has consistently received inadequate \nresources to meet rising medical costs and a growing demand for its \nhealth services. This funding crisis has forced the VA health system to \nresort to short-term fixes, such as discontinuing outreach activities \nin an effort to reduce enrollment and instituting new regulations that \nrequire the rationing of health care. This veteran's health care crisis \nhas been exacerbated with the recent announcement that the VA would \nprovide free medical services to all veterans of the Iraq war for 2 \nyears. The additional funding included in the supplemental is crucial \nto insure that current veterans do not receive a further reduction in \nhealth benefits.\n  While this legislation contains an acceptable level of funding to \nhelp prosecute the war with Iraq, I am deeply concerned that this \nlegislation does not meet our Nation's homeland security needs. \nVulnerabilities exist in our homeland security infrastructure, and we \nshould not squander a single day addressing them. An independent task \nforce, chaired by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman, recently \nadvised that ``America remains dangerously unprepared to prevent and \nrespond to a catastrophic attack on U.S. soil.'' We must act to ensure \nthat the Federal and State agencies needed to better protect our \nborders, coasts, cities, and towns have sufficient resources to do so.\n  The bill includes approximately $4.6 billion for increased border and \nmaritime security to assist State and local governments in protecting \nour cities and our critical infrastructure from terrorism. But I \nbelieve that more should have been done to protect our homeland from \nthe risk of terrorism. That is why, I supported an amendment offered by \nSenator Schumer which would have provided $3 million in additional \nfunding for first responders and $1 billion for security in high-threat \nareas.\n  Last year I was very involved in the development of the new port \nsecurity law, which included new rigorous security requirements for our \nports. Given\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\nthe vulnerabilities that we know exist in our port security, I am \ndeeply disappointed that the Senate has thus far provided insufficient \nfunding to address these problems. I strongly supported a Hollings \namendment that would have provided $1 billion for port security and to \nscreen vessels for radioactive materials.\n  I also support an amendment offered by Senator Boxer that would \nprovide $30 million to the Department of Homeland Security for \nresearch, development and initial deployment of technology to protect \ncommercial aircraft from the threat posed by stinger missiles.\n  While I missed the votes on these amendments, I was recorded in \nsupport of each in the Record.\n  We must continue to fight both the war with Iraq and the war against \nterrorism and funding for these programs is a necessary component of \nthat fight.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am pleased that this supplemental appropriations bill \ncontains language proposed by Senator Stabenow and myself that will \nincrease security inspections of trucks hauling municipal solid waste \ninto Michigan from Canada. At a time when we are increasing security \nmeasures at all levels to protect our citizens, it doesn't make sense \nto allow 130 to 140 truckloads of waste cross into Michigan every day \nfrom Canada without inspection.\n  On January 1, 2003, the city of Toronto began shipping all of its \nmunicipal solid waste 1.1 million tons--to Michigan's landfills. As a \nresult, thousands of truckloads of waste cross the Blue Water Bridge \nand the Ambassador Bridge and travel through the busiest parts of Metro \nDetroit without inspection.\n  Even though Customs recently issued a memo announcing that it would \nincrease security measures for municipal solid waste trucks, citing \nsecurity concerns related to September 11, it reversed that decision on \nFebruary 7, 2003, the same day that the Homeland Security national \nthreat level was raised to level orange. Therefore, these trucks will \ncontinue to be treated as a low-risk commodity, which will allows these \ntrucks carrying tons of municipal solid waste to cross the Michigan-\nCanadian border with minimal scrutiny.\n  Our amendment, that has been included in this bill, will ensure that \nthese trucks are inspected before they cross the Ambassador and Blue \nWater Bridges. Further, the amendment provides that the Blue Water \nBridge will receive radiation detection equipment by May 1, 2003.\n  We cannot take the chance that harmful materials will be transported \ninto Michigan on one of these trucks. Our amendment will help to \nprevent that scenario by ensuring the inspection of these municipal \nsolid waste trucks at the border.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, reluctantly, I am voting for this \nsupplemental appropriations bill to provide funding for homeland \ndefense and our military campaign in Iraq. Like it or not, the war is \non and we owe it to our men and women in uniform to provide them with \nthe resources necessary to bring the war to a rapid and successful \nconclusion.\n  We have known for more than a decade that Saddam has chemical and \nbiological weapons, but there has been little concern that these \nweapons pose a direct threat to the United States. Since coming to \noffice, this administration has raised the specter that Iraq also has \nbeen developing nuclear weapons capable of causing great harm to the \nUnited States. It has focused a great deal of America's intelligence \nassets on the question of Saddam's capabilities, yet the administration \nhas not presented any evidence of an active nuclear program. In fact, \none of the key pieces of evidence provided to the United Nations by the \nadministration turned out to be a forged document. Moreover, \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency experts rejected the \nadministration's assertion that the aluminum tubing in Iraq's \npossession was evidence of a nuclear program. Two months of intrusive \ninspections by U.N. inspectors turned up no additional evidence of new \nIraqi possession or production of weapons of mass destruction. In the \nend, the administration has failed to demonstrate that possession of \nsuch weapons by Iraq would pose an imminent threat to the United \nStates.\n  My concerns with the administration's course of action are long-\nstanding and public. I voted against the resolution to give the \nPresident the authority to go to war because I did not believe that the \nthreat posed by Iraq was imminent. I do not believe that the \nadministration should have abandoned the U.N. inspection regime. Its \ninspectors were on the ground in Iraq and achieving concrete results in \nactively disarming Saddam's regime. Instead of allowing the inspection \nprocess to continue, the administration turned its back on \ninternational institutions and relationships built up over many decades \nand pursued a unilateralist course of action with a narrow coalition of \nallies.\n  As we all know, the military campaign in Iraq is now at a critical \njuncture. With countless examples of Saddam's troops using the Iraqi \npopulation as human shields, the prospect of devastating consequences \nlooms with the impending battle for Baghdad. In recognition of this \nfact, Gen Richard Myers today suggested that the United States \nmilitary, while consolidating its encirclement of Baghdad, might \nattempt to isolate Saddam Hussein and cut off his communication with \nthe rest of Iraq without bringing the military campaign into Baghdad. I \nurge President Bush to use this opportunity to turn to the \ninternational community, whether it be the United Nations or the Arab \nLeague, or any other suitable or appropriate entity, to make one last \neffort to seek the removal of Saddam Hussein and his cadre of \nsupporters. Time is fleeting, but I believe we must make this effort \nprior to exposing American lives, and the lives of untold numbers of \ninnocent Iraqis, to the potential devastation of a door-to-door \ncampaign in the streets and houses of densely populated Baghdad. \nAccordingly, I call on the administration to hold off for a period of 3 \nto 4 days on the invasion of Baghdad. During this time, the United \nStates and its military allies could continue building their forces \naround Baghdad and consolidating control across the rest of Iraq. \nHowever, this critical period would provide Saddam Hussein one last \nopportunity to spare his people the inevitable destruction and loss of \nlife that would result from the siege of Baghdad. Such an initiative \nalso would demonstrate to the international community, particularly to \nthe other nations in the region, America's continued commitment to \nseeking the removal of Saddam Hussein from power with the least \npossible loss of civilian life.\n  President Bush campaigned for President on a pledge that America \nwould be humble in its relations with other countries. However, on \nissue after issue of critical international importance, the Bush \nadministration has governed in a very different fashion. It rejected \nthe Kyoto Treaty, despite years of negotiation and worldwide agreement \non the dangers of global warming. It has refused to join worldwide \nefforts to bring into force the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, \ndespite the critical dangers posed by the spread of nuclear weapons \ntechnology. Instead of capitalizing on a Russian desire to reach \nagreement on deep cuts in nuclear weapons, and ensuring that Russian \nnuclear materials never fell into the hands of America's enemies, the \nPresident allowed his distaste for arms control to preclude agreement \non real cuts in nuclear weapons. In its place we got the charade called \nthe Moscow Treaty, a treaty that fails to remove even one nuclear \nwarhead from either country's arsenal.\n  A decade ago, the United States went to war with the United Nations' \nblessing, a united NATO, and a broad, diverse coalition of nations by \nits side. Today, the United States is at war without U.N. support, in \nthe face of direct opposition by longtime NATO allies, and with only a \nsmattering of other major nations aligned with it. A decade ago, \nAmerica's gulf war allies joined in the military action and funded the \nbulk of the war effort. Today, the administration has been forced to \nopen the vault, offering untold tens of billions of dollars to enlist \nthe support of allies that traditionally have stood by our side. And I \nam afraid the American people will be left picking up the tab for both \nthe military operation and the rebuilding of Iraq.\n  I urge the President to take this opportunity to avert more bloodshed \nand\n\n[[Page S4811]]\n\nto involve the international community in the Iraqi end-game and the \ncritically important job of rebuilding the political and economic \ninfrastructure of Iraq.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to support this important bill that \nwill provide $60 billion for our troops in Iraq. I am especially proud \nof the Nevada sons and daughters who have been deployed to the Middle \nEast as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. As many of you know, Nevada \nhas the finest military aviation training facilities in the world.\n  Nellis Air Force Base and Fallon Naval Air Station train the aviators \nserving on the front lines of this battle. Hundreds from Nellis--pilots \nand other mission critical personnel--are right now serving on the \nfront lines. Hundreds trained at Fallon are there too. When you see \nthose Navy fighters taking off from carriers in the Gulf, chances are \nthey were trained at Fallon.\n  Nevada's Guard and Reserve troops are also playing a significant \nrole. Nevada's percentage of Guard and Reserve call-ups and deployments \nhas been one of the highest in the Nation. I understand why so many \nNevadans have been called up. They are talented. They are heroes. When \nthis action started, I promised to do everything in my power to ensure \nthat Congress fully funds and supports the needs of our troops as this \nconflict proceeds. This bill provides more than $60 billion to make \ngood on the commitment that my colleagues and I made to support our \ntroops.\n  I am also encouraged by the efforts the administration made to \nprovide additional funds for protecting our frontline defenders here at \nhome--the emergency responders we depend on to respond to a terrorist \nattack. I believe we could have done more to give cities and counties \nin each of our states the resources they need to ensure our homeland is \nas secure as it can be. I am pleased that we were able to add an \nadditional $150 million for securing nuclear materials at home and \nabroad. This amendment will provide additional resources to keep \nterrorists from getting the ingredients they need to make a dirty bomb. \nI want to thank my colleagues for completing this bill in a timely \nmanner to help our troops as they help bring freedom to the people of \nIraq.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Do we have the yeas and nays on final passage? I am too \ntired. We are going to third reading. We are finished. I am going to do \nthat right now. We are done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the passage of \nS. 762, the bill be held at the desk; provided further that when the \nSenate receives the House companion bill to S. 762, the Senate proceed \nto its consideration, all after the enacting clause be stricken, the \ntext of S. 762, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof; provided \nfurther the bill then be read for a third time and passed, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, the Senate then insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate; finally, I \nask unanimous consent that passage of S. 762 be vitiated and it be \nplaced back on the calendar at that time and that the conferees be the \nentire Appropriations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, of course, the debate throughout the day \nhas been about the wise use of taxpayers' money. Yesterday in the Wall \nStreet Journal, there was an article entitled ``USAID Defends Secret \nBids to Rebuild Iraq.'' At the same time, there was an article in the \nWashington Post entitled ``Contracts to Rebuild Iraq Go to Chosen \nFew.'' ``No Bidding War on Contracts in Iraq.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two articles be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 2, 2003]\n\n     The Assault on Iraq--USAID Defends Secret Bids To Rebuild Iraq\n\n\nnational security is cited as reason few firms knew of $1.7 billion in \n                               contracts\n\n                           (By Neil King Jr.)\n\n       Washington.--Amid worries that preparations aren't moving \n     as fast as hoped, a top procurement official defended the \n     government's decision to approach only a handful\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\n     of U.S. companies to help rebuild postwar Iraq.\n       The U.S. Agency for International Development chose to put \n     out the bids in secret to a limited number of companies under \n     an exception that allows agencies to by-pass the usual \n     competitive bidding for national security reasons, said \n     Timothy Beans, the agency's chief of procurement.\n       ``Anytime you are in wartime condition you don't have the \n     four or five months to go out on the street for the kind of \n     competition you'd like,'' Mr. Beans said.\n       USAID began approaching preselected bidders for postwar \n     Iraq work as early as late January, when the possibility of \n     going to war with Iraq was still being hotly debated at the \n     United Nations. Requests for proposals went out for four \n     contracts in mid-February, with two more early last month. \n     Altogether, the work--including rebuilding highways and \n     bridges and rehabilitating Iraq's school system--is expected \n     to cost at least $1.7 billion.\n       Similar exceptions were made for reconstruction after the \n     recent antiterror campaign in Afghanistan and in the mid-\n     1990s after the war in Bosnia, Mr. Beans said. He conceded \n     that except for those three emergencies the restricted \n     contracting procedures are unusual.\n       USAID officials said last week that as many as six contract \n     awards would be announced soon, but final decisions may now \n     be put off until next week. Some companies competing for the \n     contracts say they are receiving conflicting signals over the \n     length and ambitiousness of the work.\n       Plans last month outlined an aggressive rebuilding \n     campaign, including sweeping changes to Iraq's education and \n     health systems, that would nonetheless last only 12 months. \n     Some U.S. officials now concede that any meaningful work will \n     take much longer than a year, but others in the \n     administration are wary of moving forward on anything that \n     would suggest a prolonged U.S. occupation of Iraq.\n       The uncertainty over how to proceed also reflects mounting \n     unease over the U.S.-led military campaign, which has so far \n     offered scant evidence that average Iraqis are ready to \n     embrace American control of their country.\n       Reconstruction officials within the administration had \n     planned to use the southern city of Basra as a test case for \n     the U.S. rebuilding effort. Iraq's second-largest city has a \n     dominant Shiite population that has long been at odds with \n     Saddam Hussein. But continued fighting there, and signs that \n     the local population might be less receptive than some \n     predicted, have put those plans on hold.\n       Competition for the big infrastructure-rebuilding contract, \n     valued at $600 million, was limited to seven large U.S. \n     engineering companies, several of which have now either been \n     dropped from the running or formed teams with other bidders. \n     People involved in the bidding say the lead competitors are \n     Bechtel Corp. and Parsons Corp, which has taken on \n     Halliburton Co.'s Kellogg Brown & Root as a subcontractor. \n     Halliburton announced Monday that its KBR division won't seek \n     to be the prime contractor for rebuilding Iraq's \n     infrastructure, but ``remains a potential subcontractor for \n     this important work.''\n       The administration's postwar plans for Iraq have stirred \n     charges in Europe that all major rebuilding work will go to \n     U.S. concerns. While none of the contracts will go to foreign \n     companies, those companies will be eligible to fill in as \n     subcontractors, Mr. Beans said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Contracts To Rebuild Iraq Go to Chosen Few\n\n                          (By Jackie Spinner)\n\n       KBR, the company the U.S. government picked this week to \n     put out oil-field fires in Iraq, has a long history of \n     working for the military on big projects in foreign hot \n     spots. The former Kellogg Brown & Root--a subsidiary of \n     Houston-based energy services firm Halliburton Co., which \n     Vice President Cheney headed from 1995 until 2000--developed \n     a contingency plan for extinguishing the fires as part of a \n     10-year Pentagon logistics contract it was awarded in 2001 \n     through a competitive bid, company officials said. So when \n     the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers needed a firm to douse fires \n     ignited by retreating Iraqi forces, the company was already \n     on the ground in Kuwait. ``KBR have been over there, and they \n     had an existing contract with the Army,'' said Scott \n     Saunders, a spokesman for the Corps of Engineers. ``Because \n     of that and because of that need to snuff those fires \n     quickly, KBR was sole-sourced.'' The work is being \n     subcontracted to Boots & Coots International Well Control \n     Inc. and Wild Well Control Inc.\n       The latest contract was awarded under a waiver the Bush \n     administration granted in January allowing government \n     agencies to handpick companies for Iraqi reconstruction \n     contracts. The U.S. Agency for International Development is \n     handling the bulk of the contracts. KBR is also on the short \n     list of companies the USAID invited to bid for the prime \n     contract to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure after the war, \n     including highways, bridges, airports and government \n     buildings. The others include Fluor Corp., Washington Group \n     Inc., Bechtel Group, Louis Berger Group and Parsons Corp. \n     That contract, for at least $900 million, could be awarded as \n     soon as today. The government is proposing to spend $2.4 \n     billion on humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Iraq.\n       Halliburton plans to put KBR and another subsidiary into \n     bankruptcy protection this summer as part of a plan to settle \n     outstanding asbestos-related claims for about $4 billion. But \n     KBR's government operations aren't part of that plan, \n     Halliburton said.\n       Some government contract experts said the latest KBR award \n     shows how companies with long-standing ties to the military \n     get dibs on new work. The company has been building ships, \n     mess halls and toilets at base camps around the world for six \n     decades, originally as Brown & Root. Over the past decade it \n     has won contracts to provide logical support to troops, most \n     recently in Somalia, Haiti and the Balkans.\n       But the experts said the problem is that not putting the \n     contracts out for bid allows critics to question the fairness \n     of the process and whether the most politically connected \n     companies have an edge in getting the awards.\n       ``The administration has made potential use of shortcuts \n     and exceptions that let it put literally billions of taxpayer \n     dollars in the hands of selected contractors,'' said Charles \n     Tiefer, a law professor at the University of Baltimore and \n     the author of a casebook on government contracting. \n     ``Naturally, a large credibility gap looms between the \n     administration's plausible excuses that tight deadlines and \n     exceptional security needs compelled it to forgo the usual \n     competitive safeguards and the critics' observations that it \n     is awfully convenient for juicy plums to land in the lap of \n     the vice president's former company.''\n       William H. Carroll, a government contract lawyer who also \n     teaches at American University's Washington College of Law, \n     said there is justification for getting the contracts out as \n     soon as possible. But he said it could come at a price.\n       ``Because of the intense nature of the need to do things \n     quickly, the work may not be as well defined, and the fact \n     that there isn't a competitor putting pressure on price, \n     these are probably going to be expensive contracts,'' Carroll \n     said. ``I don't think there's an evil intent. But our \n     procurement process relies on competition to determine what \n     is a fair and reasonable price.''\n       The General Accounting Office found in September 2000 that \n     the U.S. Army had not done enough to contain costs associated \n     with KBR's $2.2 billion work providing logistical and \n     engineering support in the Balkans.\n       Officials ``frequently have simply accepted the level of \n     services the contractor provided without questioning whether \n     they could be provided more efficiently or less frequently \n     and at lower cost,'' the report said. The company and the \n     Pentagon disputed the findings, which did not question the \n     quality of the work KBR had performed.\n       The Corps of Engineers said the value of the KBR contract \n     in Iraq will depend on the scope and number of fires it will \n     have to extinguish during and after a war that has not yet \n     ended. So far there are seven oil fires burning in Iraq. \n     Steven L. Schooner, co-director of the Government Procurement \n     Law Program at George Washington University's law school, \n     said KBR's track record is not in question.\n       ``They have won the hearts and minds and stomachs of the \n     military,'' he said. ``They have done a fabulous job, and our \n     troops are better off for it.''\n       Schooner said the Cheney connection to Halliburton should \n     not be an issue. But, he said, the non-competitive nature of \n     awarding the Iraqi reconstruction contracts has made it one.\n       ``Had these contracts not been awarded in a secretive \n     manner it would be easier to cut off the questions earlier,'' \n     he said.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, suffice it to say, the Senate missed an \nopportunity tonight to stand up for openness and competition in \ncontracting and to make sure there was an opportunity to spend \nprudently on the effort to rebuild Iraq. It seems to me that too much \ntaxpayers' money is at stake in rebuilding Iraq to allow Federal \nofficials to use a secret process to handpick companies to do this \nwork. There ought to be an open and full and competitive process to \nensure the prices charged are reasonable and the contractors selected \nare the most qualified.\n  Senator Collins of Maine and I worked for 48 hours on a bipartisan \nbasis to make it possible to offer an amendment that would ensure that \nthere be real openness in contracting and that there be an effort to \nmake sure that the billions of dollars that are going to be spent \nrebuilding Iraq be part of a contract process that is governed by \ncompetitive bid.\n  It is a very simple proposition. We ought to make sure it is out in \nthe open, it is transparent, that the public can see what is going on, \nand that contracts should not just go to a handful who have power and \ninfluence, particularly in this city.\n  Unfortunately, because of an objection, that amendment was not added \ntonight. I come to the floor to say that I intend to keep coming back \nuntil the Senate stands up for openness in Government contracting and \ncompetitive bidding so that the taxpayers' money is used well.\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\n  That is not what is happening with $1.7 billion worth of contracts \nfor rebuilding highways and bridges and rehabilitating Iraq's school \nsystem. Recently, the U.S. Agency for International Development \nhandpicked a selective group of companies to participate in a secret \nbidding process for awarding four separate contracts totaling $1.7 \nbillion. That is just one example of what is ahead with respect to how \ntaxpayers' money is going to be used.\n  In the past, the General Accounting Office has been very critical of \nthis kind of approach. The General Accounting Office has found that \ncontractors had not done enough to contain costs on projects involving \nengineering support in areas where the military was involved.\n  According to a September 2000 report by the General Accounting \nOffice, Federal officials said:\n\n       Frequently, they have had accepted the level of services \n     the contract provided without questioning whether they could \n     be provided more efficiently and more frequently and at lower \n     cost.\n\n  What could be more important for this Senate to stand up for? What \ncould be more important than to make these contracts involving billions \nof dollars be let in a way that is efficient and open?\n  The current plan to select contractors for reconstruction work in \nIraq without competitive bidding creates the potential for more of the \nsame, more of the same where noncompetitive contracting work is \nconducted by the Federal Government and we have a repeat of the \noverpriced contracts and less acceptable services that come about when \ncontracting is not competitive.\n  Given the enormous sums of taxpayer money that will be involved, \nthere ought to be competitive bidding across the board. Certainly there \nought to be competitive bidding unless someone shows a compelling \nnational security reason to do otherwise. I am of the view that if \nFederal agencies are not going to use full and open competition, at a \nminimum they ought to have the burden of demonstrating why competition \nis not the proper way to avoid the contracts.\n  Senator Collins and I wanted, tonight, with the very helpful counsel \nof Senator Clinton of New York, who also worked in this area, to offer \nan amendment to require the Federal agencies to make public the \ndocuments used to justify their decision to waive the normal \nrequirements for open and fully competitive bidding. Think about that \nproposition. Heaven forbid we actually make public the documents that \ndescribe why we are not having competitive bidding. That strikes me as \na very modest step when you are talking about billions of dollars' \nworth of taxpayer money.\n  But because there was an objection tonight, now we are not going to \nhave the refusal to go forward with competitive bidding even made \npublic. It seems to me the way to make sure the taxpayers get the best \nvalue for their money and we have companies that compete for this work \nis to make sure that the standards for exempting contracts from \ncompetition are strict and rigorous and are designed to protect the \nneeds of taxpayers and the national security.\n  Our amendment would have required agencies to make the justification \nand approval documents it used, if you were to have a contract exempt, \npublic. And it would ensure we have full and vigorous competition and \nwould have required other Federal agencies to make their justifications \npublic before they entered into any contracts to rebuild Iraq.\n  I don't think the Senate wants to sit by and see these kinds of \narticles in our newspapers day after day: USAID Defends Secret Bids to \nRebuild Iraq. Contracts to Rebuild Iraq Go To Chosen Few.\n  Unless we have the Wyden-Collins bipartisan amendment to open up this \nprocess, to promote competition, to have full disclosure, we are going \nto have articles like this in our newspapers day after day after day. \nIt is going to contribute to the cynicism and frustration that \ntaxpayers have in this country with respect to how their money will be \nused. It will be a long year. We are going to see these articles again \nand again.\n  I intend to come back to the Senate and stay at this. I wanted to \nmake sure we would have a bipartisan amendment on this effort and \nworked very closely with the bipartisan leadership throughout the day. \nI thought we were there. I thought we had this amendment in a fashion \nacceptable to both sides. It is very regrettable it has not been \naccepted. I will continue to work with my colleagues. The taxpayers of \nthis country ought to be angry about this kind of process used to let \ncontracts.\n  Certainly, if there is a national security reason or some sort of \ncontract that requires an expedited arrangement, that needs to be \ntreated in a way that protects our national security. That is not what \nis going on here. What we are seeing is businesses in Missouri, Oregon, \nMaine, and across the country not being part of the privileged circle. \nA lot of businesses are going to be angry about this because they are \nnot part of that hand-picked elite that will have a chance to get the \ncontracts. What is going on now is bad for business, it is bad for \ncompetition, it is bad for taxpayers, and I think it is bad for \nnational security. I don't think we will get the most for our money if \nwe continue to have the contracts, as the papers say, go to a chosen \nfew.\n\n  The Senate made a mistake. It is particularly unfortunate because two \nSenators worked for the last 48 hours in a bipartisan way to try to \nprevent the things we have seen in the last few days from happening \nagain and again. It will happen again and again. That is why I intend \nto come back to the Senate. It is unfortunate there was an objection \ntonight to our bipartisan legislation.\n  I look forward to seeing the Senate in the days ahead stand up again \non a bipartisan basis for a process that is open, a process that \npromotes competition, that is good for taxpayers, good for business, \nand good for our country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I join all who had the privilege to serve with our late \ncolleague, Senator Patrick Moynihan. Of the 24 years I have been here, \n22 were spent with him. While my heart has sadness, it is filled with \njoy for the recollections of a wonderful friendship and working \nrelationship we had in the Senate.\n  We shared a deep and profound love for the U.S. Navy. He served from \n1944 to 1947 and was a commissioned officer. I served from 1946 to 1947 \nas an enlisted man. Whenever we would meet, he would shout out, \n``Attention on deck,'' and require me to salute him as an enlisted man \nproperly salutes an officer. Then he would turn around and salute me, \nas I was once Secretary of the Navy, and he was consequently, at that \npoint in time, outranked.\n  That was the type of individual he was. He filled this Chamber with \nspirit, with joy, with erudition, and he spoke with eloquence. We shall \nmiss our dear friend.\n  I recall specifically serving with him on the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, of which he was chairman for a while. He \nhad a great vision for the Nation's Capital. Some of the edifices we \nenjoy today would not have been had it not been for this great \nstatesman. The landmarks would not be there had it not been for him. I \nam talking about the completion of the Federal Triangle. The capstone, \nof course, is the magnificent building today bearing the name of our \nPresident Ronald Reagan.\n  He was a driving force behind the completion of that series of \nGovernment buildings started in the 1930s, under the vision of Herbert \nHoover and Andrew Mellon. They were great\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\nfriends. They wanted to complete that magnificent series of buildings, \nbut the Depression came along and the construction stopped. Pat \nMoynihan stepped up and finished.\n  Many do not know that in Union Station, which today is a mecca for \ntransportation, a transportation hub--we have rail, the bus, and we \nhave the subway. Pat Moynihan was the one who saved that magnificent \nstructure for all to enjoy for years to come.\n  I suppose the capstone was the Judiciary Building. I remember full \nwell how he came before the committee and expressed the importance for \nthe third branch of Government to have its administrative offices and \nother parts of that branch of the Government encased in a building \nbefitting the dignity that should be accorded our third branch of \nGovernment. That building marks his genius.\n  In improving transportation, he was key in TEA-21, the landmark \nlegislation that provided so much return to the States for their \ntransportation needs, again, as chairman of Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  He had a strong commitment to addressing poverty in rural America and \nwas a strong supporter of the Appalachian Regional Commission which \ntouched the States of West Virginia, Virginia, and others.\n  We are grateful to him. He understood the people as few did. I say \ngoodbye to this dear friend. I salute him. I will always have joy in my \nheart for having served with this man who, in my humble judgment, had \nthe wit, the wisdom, and the vision of a Winston Churchill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, when Pat Moynihan retired from the \nSenate in 2000, following four terms of devoted and distinguished \nservice to the citizens of New York and indeed of the Nation, he left a \ngreat void; now, with his death, he leaves a greater void still. To \nparaphrase Thomas Jefferson, speaking of Benjamin Franklin when in 1784 \nhe took Franklin's place as the Ambassador of the new American \nRepublican in Paris, others may succeed him in the many different roles \nhe played in our national life, but no one will ever replace him.\n  No simple category was ever capacious enough to accommodate Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan. With justification he has been called an \nintellectual, a scholar, an academic, an author, an editor, a \npolitician, a diplomat, and a statesman. He has been known variously as \na scholarly politician and a political-minded scholar; certainly as \nNicholas Lemann has observed, ``he was more of a politician, by far, \nthan most intellectuals.'' He was a fierce partisan of cities and the \nurban landscape, but he was equally devoted to the urban and rural \nspaces of his State of New York. Born in Tulsa, he was a quintessential \nNew Yorker. He was also a proud citizen of this capital city, where he \nand Liz, his wife and partner in every endeavor for nearly 50 years, \nchose to live at the very center. He was at home in academic \ncommunities wherever he found them. He was equally expert in domestic \nand foreign policy.\n  Pat Moynihan grew up poor, and never, ever forgot the grinding, \ncorrosive effects of poverty; many years removed from poverty himself, \nhe characterized tough bankruptcy reform legislation as ``a boot across \nthe throat'' of the poor. As a child he earned money by shining shoes; \nlater he worked as a longshoreman. He served in the U.S. Navy. He went \nto college courtesy of the G.I. bill, earning his B.A. from Tufts \nUniversity and his M.A. from Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and \nDiplomacy. Some years later he earned his Ph.D. in international \nrelations at Syracuse University, but only after spending a year as a \nFulbright Scholar at the London School of Economics and working for a \ntime in the office of the Governor of New York.\n  From the time he left Syracuse for Washington in 1961 until he ran \nsuccessfully for the Senate in New York in 1976, Pat Moynihan held a \nchallenging succession of positions in public service and in the \nacademic world. Although over the years Pat represented New York in the \nSenate his colleagues became accustomed to that versatility, in \nretrospect it appears astonishing. He joined the Labor Department in \n1961, eventually becoming the Assistant Secretary for Policy Planning, \nbut left in 1965 to become director of the Joint Center for Urban \nStudies and a professor in the Graduate School of Education at Harvard. \nFour years later he returned to public life as an assistant to the \nPresident for urban affairs, only to return the following year to \nHarvard, only to be called upon to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to \nIndia and then to the United Nations. In those 15 years he served in \nfour different administrations and held six different positions. In \nevery one of them he served with distinction and his accomplishments--\nmany of them considered controversial at the time--are remembered \nrespectfully today. They will not soon be forgotten.\n  New York's voters first sent Pat Moynihan to represent them in the \nSenate in 1976, and returned him every 6 years for three additional \nterms; he declined to run again in 2000, after 24 years of service. It \nwas as though, in coming to the Senate, he had come home. He set his \nsights quickly on the Finance Committee, with its vital jurisdiction \nover Social Security, Medicare, and other social programs. In his third \nterm he rose to the chairmanship, the first New Yorker to chair that \ncommittee in nearly 150 years. In that capacity he worked to enact \nlegislation that proved to be the foundation for a period of economic \ngrowth that raised millions of Americans above the poverty level.\n  As a member of the Committee on the Environment and Public works he \nworked hard, often with spectacular success, to promote awareness and \nassure the preservation of many of the buildings, once seemingly \ndestined for demolition, that today we consider our priceless national \nheritage. For this the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1999 \nhonored him with the Louise DuPont Crowinshield Award, its highest \nhonor, noting, ``The award is made only when there is indisputable \nevidence of superlative lifetime achievement and commitment in the \npreservation and interpretation of the country's historic architectural \nheritage.'' Everyone who walks along Pennsylvania Avenue in this city \nor through New York's Pennsylvania Station is forever indebted to Pat \nMoynihan. He procured the necessary funding to save Louis Sullivan's \nGuarantee Building, in Buffalo, and promptly moved his district office \ninto it. In his brief chairmanship of the committee he shepherded \nthrough to enactment ground-breaking legislation, the Intermodal; \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, ISTEA, which recast our \nthinking about surface transportation.\n  Pat Moynihan's formal academic training was in foreign policy. Here \nhe will be remembered for his effective ambassadorship to India, his \nforceful and principled representation of United States interests in \nthe U.N. Security Council and his early conviction, little shared at \nthe time he expressed it, that behind the facade of Soviet military \nmight and empire lay a system in danger of collapse. He proved to be \ncorrect. He should also be remembered for his role as one of the ``Four \nHorsemen'' in the Congress, whose work often went unremarked. These \nfour Members, whose families had come to this country from Ireland, \nworked tirelessly together in support of efforts to bring peace to \nNorthern Ireland, and especially to steer United States policy in that \ndirection. That Northern Ireland is no longer torn apart by violence is \nin some significant measure due to their efforts.\n  Once we have catalogued all Pat Moynihan's many accomplishments, \nhowever, there remains the man himself. In everything he did he \nremained a teacher, with an amazing capacity to instruct and to \ninspire. He believed, with Thomas Jefferson, that ``Design activity and \npolitical thought are indivisible''--an elliptical idea to many of us, \nuntil we find ourselves in the presence of the architectural monuments \nhe helped to preserve. He brought to every undertaking an extraordinary \nhistorical perspective, and an astute appreciation of what he called, \nin his commencement address at Harvard just a year ago, ``our basic \nconstitutional design.'' In his turn of phrase and in his thought, he \nwas unabashedly himself--deeply self-respecting, just as he was \nrespectful of other people and other cultures. For all these reasons he \nremains a vivid part of our national life.\n  It is difficult to know just how to honor our former colleague, \nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, for his lifetime of service and his \nlegacy. In the\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\nend, our best tribute will lie not in the words of remembrance we speak \nbut rather his tangible achievements and his legacy. The best tribute \nwe can pay is not the words we speak but rather in our rededication to \nthe principles for which he fought.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate was enriched enormously by the \nservices of the late Senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  He was appreciated and respected for his intelligence, his sense of \nhumor, his seriousness of purpose, and the warmth and steadfastness of \nhis friendship.\n  His death last week saddened this Senator very much. His funeral \nservices at St. Patrick's Church here in Washington last Monday \nattracted a large crowd of friends, former colleagues, and staff \nmembers as well as his attractive family. This manifestation of \nfriendship reminded me why Pat Moynihan was such a successful public \nofficial. He liked people, and they liked him.\n  He took his job as U.S. Senator from New York very seriously. He \nworked hard for funding for the New York Botanical Gardens. He was also \nan active and effective member of the Board of Regents of the \nSmithsonian Institution where it was my good fortune and pleasure to \nserve with him.\n  He transformed the City of Washington, D.C. through his determined \nefforts to enhance the beauty and protect the architectural integrity \nof Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  His scholarly articles and books on the subject of the cultural and \nsocial history of our nation were informative and influential. The \ncorrectness of his assessment of the importance of the family unit in \nour society changed our attitudes about the role of federal government \npolicies.\n  His influence was also felt on tax policies as a member of the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  I convey to all the members of Pat Moynihan's family my sincerest \ncondolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4815-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4815-S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A NEW WAVE OF FALLEN HEROES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects to \nfour more Californians who have died in combat in Iraq, as well as to \nnine other Americans who were stationed in California and have made the \nultimate sacrifice in our efforts to liberate the Iraqi people. Most of \nthese men have left family in California.\n  So far, of the 44 Americans who have died, 10 were from California, \nwhile another 9 were stationed there. This accounts for around 45 \npercent of all those killed in action.\n  But first, I would like to take a moment to remind my colleagues \nabout the two servicemen killed and another wounded late last week in \nGeresk, Afghanistan, when they were ambushed by Taliban forces while on \na reconnaissance patrol.\n  As America focuses almost exclusively on the conflict in Iraq, we \nmust not forget the bravery and sacrifice of men such as SGT Orlando \nMorales, SSG Jacob Frazier, and others in America's larger, global war \non terror.\n  Of the four Californians I would like to recognize today, two of \nthem, members of the 1st Tank Battalion of 29 Palms, were killed when \ntheir tank plunged off a bridge near Nasiriyah, during a heavy \nsandstorm. Both of them were still legal residents.\n  LCpl Patrick T. O'Day: One of these was 20-year-old Patrick O'Day, \nwho was born in Scotland and came to the United States when he was just \n3. He learned to read around the same time and quickly impressed his \nfamily and surprised his kindergarten teacher.\n  He was captain of the wrestling team at Santa Rosa Middle School and \na 2001 graduate of Santa Rosa High School, where he met his future wife \nShauna. They were married in October of last year, and they are \nexpecting their first child in September.\n  His younger brother, Thomas, said that Patrick was ``always someone \nthat could make anyone in the room laugh. When he came into a room, \neveryone knew he was there. He could change the atmosphere very \nquickly. . . . He was just so much fun to be around.''\n  PVT Francisco A. Martinez Flores: Francisco Martinez Flores was also \nin the tank that plunged in the Euphrates River. He was born in \nGuadalajara, Mexico, and settled in Duarte, CA, when only a little boy.\n  He attended Maxwell Elementary School and graduated from Duarte High \nSchool in 2000, where he was a popular and outgoing football player \nwith a passion for fixing up old cars.\n  He had expressed a desire to be ``a great soldier'' ever since he was \na young boy. ``[The Marines] returned to me a true man,'' said his \nmother, Martha, who had gone back to Mexico to bury her father when her \nson was deployed to the gulf. She never had the opportunity to say \ngoodbye.\n  Francisco Martinez Flores was to become a U.S. citizen in 2 weeks. \nBut the 21-year-old marine was killed before he could take an oath of \nallegiance to the country he died fighting for.\n  LCpl Jesus Suarez del Solar: Just 20, Cpl Suarez had already served \nin Afghanistan, and was ready to returning to combat, this time in \nIraq. This past December, he had married his longtime girlfriend Sayne. \nThey had a baby boy, Erik.\n  ``I'm very proud of Jesus,'' said his father, Fernando. ``I want \nAmericans to know that immigrants that came to the United States, we \ndid not come to take their jobs. We came here to give them our blood, \nso they can have freedom and they can have a world free of terrorism. \nThat's why my son died.''\n  Known as something of a charmer and even a bit of a flirt, he \ngraduated in 2001 from Valley High School, in Escondido, a town about \n30 miles north of San Diego. His principal, Janice Boedeker, said that \n``Jesus wanted to become a marine from the time I met him, as a junior \nin high school. He was just a wonderful kid with maturity beyond his \nyears.''\n  ``He was so excited about being a part of the infantry and the Marine \nCorps,'' Boedeker said. ``I always ask kids about their goals what they \nwant to do. There was never a question with him. I remember he wrote in \nbig, capital letters: MARINES.''\n\n  One of his teachers, Tom Gabriella, remembered how Jesus ``felt he \ncould build a solid life around the Marine Corps. . . .Once, he gave a \npresentation to a class. He always had a big smile on his face.''\n  GySgt Joseph Menusa: Born in the Philippines, Joseph Menusa came to \nthe United States when he was 10 and grew up in San Jose. A veteran of \nthe first gulf war, he was killed in battle on Thursday, March 27. He \nwas a graduate of Silver Creek High, Class of '89.\n  He was working his way up the ranks and was in the process of gaining \nhis U.S. citizenship when he received his deployment orders to the \ngulf.\n  On the eve of his deployment, Sgt Menusa told his wife Stacy why he \nhad to go. ``He said he was in charge of these young kids and he was \nthe only one who had ever seen combat. He needed to be their guide.''\n  Capt Tuan Pham, who was born in Vietnam and worked with Sgt Menusa as \na Marine recruitment officer in San Francisco, had this to say about \nhis friend: ``We are both naturalized Americans and believe in the \nideals of what this country represents. He paid the ultimate price for \nsomething we all believe in--freedom.''\n  Of those Americans stationed in California, most were from the 1st \nMarine Expeditionary Force based at Camp Pendleton, in San Diego \nCounty. While from all across the country, these men were so much a \npart of the local community, where the mood is somber, yellow ribbons \nare everywhere, and the flags at half mast.\n  I would also like to commend the local newspaper, the San Diego Union \nTribune, for doing an impressive job of providing much of the \ninformation on those stationed at Camp Pendleton.\n  2Lt Therrel S. Childers, Harrison County, MS: While most youngsters \npick a new career more often than they outgrow their sneakers, Lt \nTherrel Childers, the son of a Navy Seabee, first decided he wanted to \nbe a marine when only 5 years old.\n  He joined the Marines a month after he graduated from high school; \nthey sent him to college and promoted him. 25 years after he first \nglimpsed his future, Second Lieutenant Childers was fatally injured on \na battlefield in Iraq.\n  ``We're proud of him,'' his mother said from her Powell, WY, home. \n``He died doing what he believed in.'' He approached his life with a \nunique intensity that made him successful both in his career and in the \nclassroom.\n  His professors at The Citadel, in Charleston, SC, saw the dedication\n\n[[Page S4816]]\n\nthat made him a good marine. ``When he decided to study French, he \nwanted to speak French perfectly,'' said one of his professors, Guy \nToubiana. ``It really bothered him if he was making a couple of \nmistakes.''\n  His intensity sometimes made him the butt of jokes, but somehow he \nremained a likable guy, perhaps because he maintained his sense of \nhumor. And despite his military surroundings, he still had a sensitive \nside. ``He was very warm,'' Toubiana said.\n  The 30-year-old spent his limited free time climbing mountains, \nrunning road races, and mountain biking. Perhaps he would be most proud \nthat marine friends remember him as someone they could count on.\n  John Bacon, who met Childers at The Citadel, said Childers would \nalways show up to help lift a heavy sofa on moving day. ``He was a type \nof person that would never let you down,'' Bacon said. ``The world lost \na great man.''\n  Marine Cpt Ryan Anthony Beaupre, St. Anne, IL: Cpt Ryan Beaupre, who \nwas single, abandoned an accounting career to join the Marines in 1996. \n``He always wanted to fly, but his parents wanted him to get a college \ndegree first,'' said Bob Themer, a friend of the family's.\n  Beaupre, who was from St. Anne, IL, and graduated from Illinois \nWesleyan University, and worked in accounting for a year. ``Then he \ncame home and told them he could do more as a marine,'' Themer said.\n  Beaupre lived in an Encinitas apartment overlooking the sea, where he \noften surfed, said neighbor Ron Holdsworth. He remembers a comment the \nmarine made after military helicopters flew by their building one day.\n  ``At the time, we were in Afghanistan fighting, and he said, `The \nthing about being a marine is you know when your brother marines are \nfighting, you can't sit still. You want to go help them.' ''\n  Navy Hospital Corpsman Michael Vann Johnson, Jr., Little Rock, AR: \nNavy corpsman Michael Vann Johnson, Jr., was killed Tuesday while \ntending to a marine wounded in battle in Iraq. He was hit in the head \nby shrapnel from a grenade and fatally injured, his sister, Janisa \nHooks, told the Associated Press in Little Rock, AR, where Johnson was \nborn and raised.\n  Only 25 years old, Johnson was a hospital corpsman who had been \nassigned to travel with Camp Pendleton-based marines in Iraq.\n  ``He provided medical care right up to the time he was killed,'' said \nDoug Sayers, spokesman for the San Diego Naval Medical Center, where \nJohnson had been stationed.\n  Johnson had worked at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot since June 2001, \nhelping oversee the health care of thousands of recruits, Sayers said. \n``A big hole has been ripped in the soul of the clinic down there,'' \nSayers said.\n  Johnson's mother Jana Norfleet said she had recently received a \nletter from her son saying that he was going to be all right. She said \nhe wrote that ``God had twisted a guardian angel around him.''\n  Marine Cpl Brian Matthew Kennedy, Houston, TX: ``He gave his life in \nan effort to contribute to the freedom of the Iraqi people,'' Mark \nKennedy of Houston wrote in a statement about his 25-year-old son, \nBrian. ``We are so very proud of him and his service to his country.''\n  But sitting at home, staring at a photograph of his handsome, \nathletic son in his marine dress uniform, reminiscing about Brian's \nlove of football and lacrosse, patriotism and pride seems overwhelmed \nby a father's pain. ``We just miss him terribly already,'' the father \nsaid. ``He was a wonderful man.''\n  Sgt Michael V. Lalush, 23, Troutville, VA: Sgt Michael Lalush--\npronounced LAW'-lish--was always busy trying to fix things, said Linda \nMcMillan, a family friend who knew the sergeant from birth. He always \nhad his hands in equipment, tinkering with lawnmowers and cars. As a \nteenager, he dragged home a pink 1965 Volkswagen Beetle, rebuilt and \nrepainted it, and in no time was driving it around the neighborhood.\n  Lalush moved to Virginia with his family in 1994 from Sunnyvale, CA, \nsettling in a quiet house on a hilltop overlooking farmland about 20 \nmiles north of Roanoke.\n  A tall, gangly boy who eventually sprouted several inches above his \nparents, Lalush was anything but the stereo typically domineering \nmilitary man, McMillan said. He was quieter, more sensitive, she said. \nHe loved his sister Danielle and depended on his family.\n  More than anything, Lalush wanted to be a pilot and he wanted to be a \nmarine. After graduating from Lord Botetourt High School, Lalush left \nfor boot camp at Parris Island in South Carolina. He was transferred to \nCamp Lejeune, NC, and then to Camp Pendleton.\n  SSgt Donald C. May, Jr. Richmond, VA: SSgt Donald May, Jr., followed \nboth parents into the Marine Corps and, just like his dad, became a \ntank commander. He disappeared in Iraq nearly a week ago and his mother \nlearned Monday he had been killed.\n  May and his crew were in the 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division, \nbased at the Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, \nCA.\n  He joined the Marine Corps the year he graduated from high school and \nspent 4 years in the military police, serving in the Middle East for \nthe last few months of the first gulf war in 1991. He left for 2 years, \nserving in the Reserves, then ``got back in as a tank commander, just \nlike his dad,'' his mother said.\n  May's wife Deborah is 7\\1/2\\ months pregnant with a boy, due May 16. \nShe went into premature labor Friday after learning that her husband \nwas missing, but doctors were able to halt the delivery.\n  Maj Kevin Nave, White Lake Township, MI: A veteran of the 1991 \nPersian Gulf war, Maj Kevin Nave is the first Michigan native reported \nkilled in the war with Iraq. He was from White Lake Township, about 20 \nmiles north of Detroit, where he used to fish in the river behind his \nhouse.\n  He and his wife Carrie lived at Camp Pendleton with their son \nAnthony, 6, and daughter, Maeve, who turned 5 Thursday.\n  Nave graduated in 1985 from Waterford Kettering High School where he \nwas on the school's varsity football and wrestling teams.\n  He was a very positive type personality, a school leader and a good \ncitizen,'' said Ronald Zeeman, dean of students and a math teacher \nduring Nave's years there. ``The whole Waterford Kettering staff was \nproud of him. To have something like this happen, it really hits \nhome.''\n  After high school, Nave went to the University of Michigan on a \nReserve Officer Training Corps scholarship. He graduated in 1989 with a \ndegree in political science and attended marine officer's school \nimmediately after college, said T.J. McCullough, a high school \nclassmate and ex-marine.\n  According to T.J. McCullough, a high school classmate and ex-marine, \n``He was motivated, focused and driven, but one of the nicest, most \neasygoing guys you'd ever want to meet,'' said McCullough. ``I know he \nfollowed his dream. He was a career marine.''\n  Marine LCpl William W. White, NY: A shy and quiet 24-year-old with a \nsweet and charming smile, Marine LCpl William W. White had grand plans \nfor his return from Iraq.\n  He had tested to become a New York City firefighter, a job that would \ntake him home to his native Brooklyn. White and his wife Mychaele 23, \nwanted to begin a family when they moved back east.\n  Instead, the Camp Pendleton marine, whose father fought with the Army \nin the 1991 Persian Gulf war, was killed when his Humvee overturned \ninto a canal and he drowned.\n  Along with his wife, White leaves behind two younger brothers and his \nparents in Brooklyn. According to his mother-in-law, Debra Gentry, ``He \nwas one of the sweetest, kindest guys. He always put himself last.''\n  SSgt Kendall Damon Waters-Bey, Baltimore, MD: A specialist in \nhelicopter maintenance, Sgt Kendall Damon Waters-Bey was assigned to \nthe Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron-268, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing.\n  Waters-Bey was among four United States Marines and eight British \nsoldiers killed when a CH-46 helicopter crashed Thursday in Kuwait, \nabout 9 miles from the Iraqi border.\n  He grew up in the rowhouse working-class neighborhood of northeast \nBaltimore, graduating from Northern High School where he excelled in \nswimming and track. At home, his sisters recalled, he excelled in jokes \nand cooking. ``He was always making faces,\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\nmaking people laugh,'' said his sister Michelle.\n  The oldest of five children, 29-year-old Waters-Bey had been living \nin California with his wife of 11 months, Angela, who serves in the \nNavy. He also leaves behind a 10-year-old son from a previous marriage.\n  Maj Jay Thomas Aubin, Waterville, ME: An 18-year marine veteran, 36-\nyear-old Maj Thomas Aubin was an instructor with Marine Aviation \nWeapons and Tactics Squadron 1 in Yuma, AZ, before deploying for war \nwith the Camp Pendleton force.\n  Aubin's hometown was Waterville, ME, where he was the first of 30 \ngrandchildren in a family that has been in that State for generations.\n  ``He was a very determined little boy,'' said his aunt, Kim Willette \nof Winslow, ME. ``He had big dreams. He always wanted to fly planes and \nknew he was going to, just like his dad--a private pilot. Jay would \nfall asleep in the back of the Cessna.''\n  ``There's no way to soften the blow, his aunt said. ``He prepared us \nfor this all the time,'' she said. ``But that doesn't make it any \neasier.''\n  He is survived by his wife Rhonda and children Alicia, 10, and \nNathan, 7.\n  SSgt James Cawley, Layton, UT: SSgt James Cawley, was a marine \nreservist and Salt Lake City police detective, was killed in a fire \nfight in Iraq Saturday.\n  ``He could have been anything but he chose to be a soldier and an \nofficer because of his strong beliefs,'' his family wrote in a prepared \nstatement distributed by the police department Sunday.\n  Cawley leaves behind a wife, Miyuki, an 8-year-old son, Cecil, and a \n6-year-old daughter, Keiko. He served for 12 years in the Marines, \ntraveling around the world. He met his wife Miyuki in Okinawa, Japan, \nwhile serving there.\n  He also served a proselytizing mission with the Mormon Church in \nFukuoka, Japan. ``He knew that his life was not the end and that we \nwill all be together again in a far greater place,'' the letter said.\n  Detective Mark Schuman, Cawley's partner on the Salt Lake City force \nfor 18 months and one of his closest friends, had just received a \nletter from Cawley a few days ago. At the time of his writing, Cawley \nwas in Kuwait, awaiting further instructions.\n  ``He was a loyal and trusting friend, and he was an outstanding \nofficer,'' Schuman said. ``He was a very patriotic man, and he loved \nthe Marine Corps, and he felt it was his duty to protect us and protect \nAmerica.''\n  As our troops move rapidly towards Baghdad, I continue to hope for a \nquick resolution to this conflict. I hope that the repressive regime of \nSaddam Hussein will soon collapse and the Iraqi people will be \nliberated. And I hope all of this can be done with as few casualties as \npossible, Iraqi, American and allied, civilian and military.\n  To those that have already fallen, we must never forget their \nsacrifice. They have given their future for that of our Nation--and we \nas a nation owe them and the others that have fallen our eternal \ngratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4817-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE CRACKDOWN ON PRO-DEMOCRACY ADVOCATES IN CUBA\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, tomorrow marks the anniversary of the \nassassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. King's life reminds \nAmericans of our unyielding commitment to freedom, justice, and \nequality for all. The peaceful civil rights movement that Dr. King \nlives and died for serves as a model for the ideals America promotes \nworldwide.\n  Today, just 90 miles off the shores of the United States, a desperate \ndictator is 2 weeks into a Stalinist-style crackdown on his country's \nnon-violent democratic movement and its leaders. One political \nprisoner, Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet, has often been compared to Dr. King \nfor his brave struggle to seek a non-violent transition to democracy in \nCuba. The International Republican Institute (IRI), of which I am \nchairman, recently awarded Dr. Biscet with its Democracy's People Award \nfor his courageous commitment to human rights, despite his imprisonment \nand the painful disease from which he suffers, and which remains \nuntreated.\n  In a severe crackdown that demonstrates the true and brutal character \nof Cuba's dictatorship, the Castro regime has imprisoned over 80 \nindependent journalists, human rights advocates, independent labor and \npro-democracy activists, and supporters of the pro-democracy Varela \nproject since March 18. Many of these activists are currently on trial. \nDr. Biscet, who was arrested on December 6, 2002, while organizing a \nhuman rights discussion for International Human Rights Day, may be \nsentenced to life in prison and has apparently been threatened with the \ndeath penalty. The founder of the Lawton Foundation for Human Rights, \nwhich carries out educational campaigns to end the death penalty and \nforced abortions, Dr. Biscet was formerly imprisoned from 1999-2002. \nDr. Biscet's wife, Elsa Morejon, had her house ransacked and her \ncomputer, phone, pictures and letters from her husband taken by the \nCuba government.\n  Freedom-loving people everywhere condemn the use of the death penalty \nagainst peaceful political opponents of Castro's rule. Rather than \nthreaten them with death, Fidel Castro should release all political \nprisoners in Cuba, which the State Department estimated to number \nbetween 230 and 300 before the current, massive crackdown.\n  The many brave Cubans who work and sacrifice every day for non-\nviolent and democratic Cuba ask only that their fundamental human \nrights be respected. Although world attention is focused on Iraq, it is \nimportant that we not lose sight of the continued, aggressive \nrepression of Cuba's democracy and human rights activists. The United \nNations Human Rights Commission is currently in Geneva preparing what I \nhope will be a strong and clear condemnation of these systematic \nviolations of fundamental freedoms. It is imperative that the Cuban \ngovernment be held accountable for this repressive crackdown.\n  One day soon, the political prisoners now held in Fidel's gulags will \nbe celebrated as the voices of conscience that finally brought freedom \nand justice to Cuba after decades of brutal dictatorship. Castro and \nhis regime cannot extinguish the flame of freedom and hope that burns \nin the hearts of Cubans, who will continue to peacefully seek liberty \nand justice--and will one day prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4817-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4817-S4818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, like so many of us in the Senate and the \nHouse, I try to get home as often as I can, not just because I miss the \nscenery, but because I would miss the opportunity to meet with my \nconstituents as they share their perspective with me on the issues that \nconcern them. I think of it as harvesting good old Wyoming common \nsense. After I get as much as I can, I bring it back with me to share \nwith my colleagues.\n  One of my constituents, Mr. Wallace Ulrich of Moose, WY gave me a \ncopy of his presentation on Operation Iraqi Freedom that he shared with \ntwo groups of High School students at Jackson Hole High School in \nJackson, WY.\n  In his remarks, Wally addresses several issues about the conflict and \nhis thoughts about them. To begin with, he correctly points out that no \none is pro-war, but that responsible nations are occasionally called to \nstep up and take action when a wrong cannot be solved or addressed \nthrough diplomatic measures.\n  Saddam Hussein created just such a situation when he failed to abide \nby the agreements signed by his government at the end of Operation \nDesert Storm and refused to fully comply with the terms of several \nUnited Nations resolutions. It was only when a long diplomatic effort \nfailed to produce the necessary results that the United States had to \nensure that Iraq was disarmed and no longer a threat to the peace \nloving world.\n  I hope all my colleagues will take a moment to read what Wally had to \nsay to our young people in Jackson, WY. He has an interesting point of \nview and he presents his position well. I ask unanimous consent that \nhis statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Statement by Mr. Wallace Ulrich\n\n       Good Day.\n       And thank you for that kindness. Some of you know that I am \n     also a ski patroller on Snow King--for the last thirty \n     years--and you've even been kind to me up there!\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\n       First, I want to say that I am here not as a spokesman for \n     any party or entity or organization or group. While I have \n     held elected positions I am here, just like you, a citizen \n     (only a lot older and a little grey in the hair).\n       I want you to know too, that I am neither a fan of nor a \n     practitioner of personal degradation when discussing issues. \n     I find it a sad trend in our politics. So you won't hear it \n     here from me.\n       I admire the way Casey Baux persisted; his gracious and \n     helpful demeanor should benefit us all today. The way Casey \n     helped this event become reality is really, how ``political \n     things'' get accomplished. Your teachers are also to be \n     commended and the administration.\n       It is a misnomer to be labeled pro war. Frankly, I don't \n     understand how anyone would take that position--but there \n     comes a time when despots who have the blood of hundreds of \n     thousands of people on their hands have to be stopped.\n       In the early decades of the 20th century, the Turks \n     annihilated the Armenians. They asked the world for help, but \n     got virtually nothing. When Hilter was determined to wipe out \n     the Jews, he referred back to the fact that no one remembered \n     the Armenian genocide.\n       Saddam Hussein wiped out the Sumerians. The culture no \n     longer exists.\n       When he lost the 1991 war he agreed as a condition of his \n     surrender to disarm Iraq. He would not. And that is what \n     generated this war.\n       A million Iranians are dead because of Saddam, 8000 Kurds \n     we know, his own people were gassed to death and his tortures \n     and barbarity continue unabated by international disgust.\n       It is always easier to do nothing. You know that. But while \n     we stand by, hundreds of thousands of people are being \n     tortured and killed.\n       Our country moving off the path of diplomacy that it has \n     traveled so long, personally touches me. My brother in law \n     and family live there, in the ``Scud Box'' zones of Saddam. \n     We speak almost daily about what they will do. But they're \n     some of the lucky ones. They can leave when it gets too \n     close.\n       I hold simple yet solid beliefs that one can make a \n     difference. I have learned through experience, my own in high \n     school, and with students over the years since, that given \n     opportunity and information you make good decisions.\n       I came today because my family has been deeply wounded by \n     war. I lost two uncles in WWII. My Uncle Wallace was one of \n     the first Wyoming casualties when the USS Houston was sunk. \n     The Japanese took prisoner the other when he was a year older \n     than some of you. Orral survived the cruel Battan Death \n     March. He was brutally tortured, bayoneted, and his gold \n     tooth removed, left alone and died on the compound dirt.\n       My family can never forget the horror of war, because it \n     touched us personally.\n       Yet, in 1960, President Eisenhower chose one of our large \n     fossil fish to be the National Gift of the American People of \n     the Japanese Emperor Hirohito. When our family sat at the \n     kitchen table to discuss whether we should accept the offer \n     given the damage to our family, My Father showed us what \n     courage and forgiveness was about in an eloquent explanation \n     of War and the difficulty of creating peace over time, one \n     family at a time.\n       The kitchen table was my great spring board, because there \n     we were all allowed our own thoughts, ideas, solutions we \n     were accepted, though often confronted by solid debate and \n     fact. I hope you have a kitchen table, a family that talks \n     and listens for that is the beginning which you carry to \n     friends and school and business and life.\n       You can be empowered to change public policy or to maintain \n     our policy. The system is simple and works.\n       Assure we practice mutual respect in our politics because \n     we are largely citizens in all phases, from citizen \n     legislator to citizen soldier.\n       I urge you to view and digest the remarkable objective \n     coverage of the Free American Press. And seek out the press \n     worldwide. One is always more enlightened by seeking \n     differing views and information.\n       Be skeptical, but avoid the despair of cynicism. They are \n     very different things.\n       Question. Ask questions. And listen.\n       Seek out all sides and all sources before you find your \n     view, and know it may have a spectrum as wide as Wyoming and \n     change as often as Wyoming's weather.\n       Travel. Travel the country, but more importantly travel the \n     world. You will be enlightened as to how well off we are.\n       Trust.\n       Trust that you will find your own truth about these \n     difficult times.\n       Trust that you will be alright.\n       Trust that just like those around you now as family, \n     teachers, police, forest rangers, on and on up the system \n     that Americans in leadership positions are decent, honest, \n     and caring--for you, our country, and others.\n       Know this too, from NY Democrat Charlie Rangel, of the U.S. \n     Congress; when asked about his criticism of the President and \n     policy days before the war he said: ``That's what I am \n     elected to do! But let me tell you, when that flag goes up, I \n     salute, I'm there.''\n       When at war observe that partisan politicians cease their \n     partisanship, that parents and brothers and sisters of \n     soldiers, and aviators, and sailors find solitude and prayer \n     to comfort their fear and the choking that comes in the night \n     from knowing that one's child is defending, by fighting with \n     their life, one nation, one people, made up of all the \n     peoples of Earth.\n       And I close my comment with a quote from my favorite non-\n     warrior Mahatma Gandhi. Said in 1931, ``Peace and disarmament \n     are not matter of reciprocity. When real peace and \n     disarmament come, they will be initiated by a strong nation \n     like America irrespective of the consent and cooperation of \n     other nations.''\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4818-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL TARTAN DAY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the fifth \nanniversary of National Tartan Day. While it is observed on April 6 of \neach year, I make this recognition today because the Senate is not \nexpected to be in session on that date. I want to remind my colleagues \nthat the resolution which establishes National Tartan Day was Senate \nResolution 155. It passed by unanimous consent on March 20 of 1998.\n  As an American of Scottish descent, I appreciate the efforts of the \nindividuals, clan organizations, and all the many other groups who were \ninstrumental in generating support for the resolution. These groups \nworked diligently to foster national awareness of the important role \nthat Americans of Scottish descent have played in the progress of our \ncountry.\n  The purpose of National Tartan Day is to recognize the contributions \nthat Americans of Scottish ancestry have made to our national heritage. \nIt also recognizes the contributions that Scottish Americans continue \nto make to our country. I look forward to National Tartan Day as \nanother opportunity to pause and reflect on the role Scottish Americans \nhave played in advancing democracy and freedom. It is my hope that this \nannual event will continue to grow in prominence, with ceremonies and \nactivities similar to those that have been held over the past few \nyears. Scottish Americans have helped shape this Nation. Their \ncontributions are innumerable. In fact, three-fourths of all American \nPresidents can trace their roots to Scotland.\n  In addition to recognizing Americans of Scottish ancestry, National \nTartan Day reminds us of the importance of liberty. It honors those who \nstrived for freedom from an oppressive government on April 6, 1320. It \nwas on that day that the Declaration of Arbroath was signed. It is the \nScottish Declaration of Independence. This important document served as \nthe model for America's Declaration of Independence.\n  In demanding their independence from England, the men of Arbroath \nwrote, ``We fight for liberty alone, which no good man loses but with \nhis life. `` These words are applicable today to the heroism of our \nAmerican veterans and active duty forces who know the precious cost of \nfighting for liberty--a fight that is taking place at this moment as a \ncoalition of military forces seeks liberation for the people of Iraq.\n  Senate Resolution 155 has served as a catalyst for the many States, \ncities, and counties that have passed similar resolutions recognizing \nthe important contributions of Scottish Americans. I would like to \nthank all those groups and individuals who have continued the work of \nreminding the world of the stand for liberty taken on April 6th almost \n700 years ago--in Arbroath, Scotland. A call for liberty which still \nechoes through our history and the history of many nations across the \nglobe.\n  I believe April 6 can also serve as a day to recognize those nations \nthat have not achieved the principles of freedom which we hold dear, \nand which we are fighting for even now. The example of the Scotsmen at \nArbroath--their courage--their desire for freedom--still serves as a \nbright beacon today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4818-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4818-S4819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ANDEAN COUNTERDRUG INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to express some \nconcern to the Appropriations Committee about the report language that \nwas included regarding the supplemental request for the Andean \nCounterdrug Initiative. The Senate report indicates that the committee \nconsiders their funding of the President's request as a downpayment on \nfunding for the next fiscal year.\n  I would like to ask the committee to reconsider taking this position \nwithout\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\na greater examination of both the 2004 request and how the supplemental \nfunding will be used. I believe penalizing the 2004 request because of \nneeded funds today will hamper the effectiveness of this program, \nparticularly when it seems we may be turning the corner.\n  This request is designed to support our current efforts in Colombia, \nwhich are occurring at a significantly higher operational pace than was \nanticipated when the current fiscal year budget was developed. Since \nthe fiscal year 2004 budget was created, we have seen a wave in urban \nbombings, the launch of a rescue mission for kidnapped American \ncitizens, a significant increase in the violent attacks against our \nspray aircraft, and an increase in the violent attacks against \nPresident Uribe and other top Colombian officials. These increased \nthreats need to be countered now, and require a revision in the \noriginal budget estimates on what will be spent both this fiscal year \nand next.\n  The supplemental funding is necessary to continue current operations \nat their current pace. By including the President's request in this \nbill, the committee is recognizing this need. But we should not \npenalize next year's efforts by counting this supplemental \nappropriations against the 2004 request. I strongly urge the committee \nto reconsider holding this needed supplemental funding for the Andean \nCounterdrug Initiative against the fiscal year 2004 request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4819-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GREG MASTEL\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Greg Mastel for his \nwork as the Finance Committee's chief trade adviser and chief economist \nduring the 107th Congress.\n  I asked Greg to rejoin my staff in early 2001 with two specific goals \nin mind--significantly expanding the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram and reinstating fast-track trade negotiating authority for the \nPresident. To me, these are the twin pillars of U.S. trade policy. If \nthe United States was to move beyond the logjam that had stalled \nprogress on trade for nearly a decade, both of these programs needed to \nbe in place.\n  Thanks in large part to Greg's hard work, both of those goals were \nachieved.\n  In August of last year, the President signed into law the Trade Act \nof 2002. Not only did it restore fast track to the President, it also \ncreated the largest expansion of Trade Adjustment Assistance in that \nprogram's history. And just for good measure, we renewed and expanded \nboth the Andean Trade Preferences Act and the Generalized System of \nPreferences.\n  The Trade Act of 2002 is the most significant piece of trade \nlegislation to come out of the Congress in over a decade. And it would \nnot have happened without the skilled guidance and steady hand that \nGreg showed every step of the way.\n  Getting there wasn't easy. There were a lot of long nights and more \nthan a few tense meetings. And for Greg, there were some personal \nchallenges that didn't make the job any easier, but made his \nperformance even more impressive.\n  Shortly before we went into conference with the House on the Trade \nAct, Greg suffered a nasty bicycling accident that left him with a \nbroken collarbone, badly bruised ribs, and more sore muscles than I \ncare to think about. But Greg was in the office every day, working \nthrough the pain and showing the same good humor that always made him \nsuch a pleasure to work with.\n  At the time, I called Greg ``the Lance Armstrong of the Trade \nWorld''--although he probably needs to hone those biking skills. I \nstand by those comments. In conference negotiations, it is always a \nchallenge to bridge the differences between Democrats and Republicans \nand between the Senate and the House. But to sit in a room negotiating \nthe finer points of U.S. trade policy at 2 in the morning while \nfighting through the pain of broken collarbone takes a special kind of \nstaffer.\n  Not only is Greg an expert on trade--he also understands the state of \nMontana. Greg is a true product of Montana. He grew up on a ranch \noutside of Missoula, where his childhood pursuits included hunting, \ncamping, and archery. He is a graduate of Hellgate High School in \nMissoula, where he was a star second baseman on their baseball team.\n  He has never forgotten his roots in Montana. I have always felt that \nGreg's experiences back home gave him a feel for policy issues that \ncannot be learned.\n  And Greg has a long history with my office. He began as an intern in \n1987, and within a few months became my youngest legislative \nassistance. His formal training as an economist made him a natural for \ncovering international trade issues, vital for a State that depends on \nexporting its goods and services to markets around the globe. I relied \non Greg to assist me with some of the most important issues to \nMontanans, including beef exports to Japan and wheat exports to China.\n  At various points, Greg has served as both my legislative director \nand my chief of staff. In each of these positions, he served with \ndistinction through many years of trying to convince Montanans that \ntrade was necessary and could be beneficial. He came up with the idea \nof trade missions and helped organize those to Asia and South America. \nThose missions did more to promote understanding than 100 speeches \ncould have.\n  Greg also became an expert on U.S. trade laws, including many which \nhe helped to draft. It was a natural that, after leaving my staff in \n1994, Greg moved on to a distinguished career in academia and public \npolicy. He is the author of three books dealing with China, United \nStates trade laws, and WTO negotiations, and has written a column for \nthe Journal of Commerce.\n  Somewhere along the way, Greg and his wife Lois found the time to \nraise two beautiful children--Alexander and Caroline.\n  I was lucky to be able to lure him back for the 107th Congress to \nserve as my chief trade adviser on the Finance Committee.\n  Greg has been a wonderful friend to me and my staff over the years. I \nthank him for all of this hard work and wish him the best of luck in \nall his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4819-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO VICTOR BAIRD\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I wish to speak on behalf of a \nman, Victor Baird, who, until recently, had probably one of the most \nthankless jobs in the Senate--Staff Director and Chief Counsel of the \nSenate Ethics Committee. In this position, Victor was charged with \npreserving the integrity of the Senate by policing the conduct of its \nMembers and ensuring that the Senators and their staffs adhered to the \nSenate's high ethical standards.\n  The nature of the Ethics Committee is that the work we do remains \nconfidential, except in the most egregious circumstances. Victor faced \nsome of these circumstances and his guidance in steering the committee, \nthe Senate, through them was invaluable. In general, though, most \npeople didn't hear that much about Victor or the work he did in his 16 \nyears on the committee, but to those of who sit on the committee or who \nhave ever sat on the committee, we know that a lack of public exposure \nfor the committee means that Victor was doing his job, and doing it \nwell.\n  As I mentioned before, Victor was a 16 year veteran of the Senate \nEthics Committee. He was first appointed to the committee by Senator \nHeflin in March 1987. He was acting Staff Director and Chief Counsel \nfrom October 1992 until March 1993 and became Staff Director and Chief \nCounsel from April 1993 until this January.\n  Before arriving in the Senate, Victor served in the United States Air \nForce and had a distinguished legal career in Georgia that included \nserving as an Assistant Attorney General in Georgia, as an \nAdministrative Law Judge for the Georgia Department of Natural \nResources, and on the Consumers' Utility Council of Georgia.\n  Victor's legal acumen, good nature, keen attention to detail, \nnonpartisan nature, and most of all, his integrity, all contributed to \nhis success in the Senate. He will be missed by many. I thank him for \nhis service to the United States Senate and to his country, and wish \nhim God speed in all his journeys ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4819-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4819-S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO ARKANSAS GUARD AND RESERVES\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Currently, there are 2,356 Arkansans activated in the \nGuard and Reserves, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. I \nwould like to ask that the attached list be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The sacrifices that these men and women are making protect our \nfreedoms, defend our liberties, and ensure regional and global \nstability.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 14, \n2001 in San Francisco, CA. An Australian software engineer was stabbed \nin the chest by someone who thought his friend, a man of Indian and \nHispanic heritage, was an Arab. The victims say the stabbing took place \nwhen they were passed by a group while crossing the street. A scuffle \nensued when the engineer was punched or bumped by one of the men. The \nassailant used racial slurs to describe the victims and said, ``We \ndon't like Arabs'' before stabbing the engineer.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4820-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4820-S4821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATIONS TO DR. THOMAS FRIST\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Dr. Thomas \nF. Frist, Jr., a cofounder of HCA and its former chairman and CEO, on \nhis induction into the Healthcare Hall of Fame. The Healthcare Hall of \nFame honors individuals who bring a legacy of enthusiasm, vision, and \nperseverance to the healthcare industry. I cannot think of a more \ndeserving recipient of this honor.\n  Dr. Frist began his hospital administrative career shortly after his \nservice as a military flight surgeon. In 1968, he founded HCA in \nNashville, with his father, the late Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Sr., and the \nlate Jack C. Massey. In 1977, Dr. Frist became president of HCA and \nsubsequently became chairman, president and chief executive officer in \n1987. When HCA merged with Columbia in February 1994, Dr. Frist served \nas chairman of the board and later as Vice Chairman, following the \ncompany's April 1995 merger with HealthTrust Inc. Dr. Frist returned as \nchairman and CEO of the company in 1997. He was chairman and CEO until \nJanuary 2001 and chairman until January 2002.\n  Not only is Dr. Frist a great physician and hospital administrator, \nhe is also a great benefactor to his hometown of Nashville. He served \nas vice president of the Vanderbilt University Board of Trust from \n1995-1997. He was chairman of the board of Governors of the United Way \nof America in 1995, and founded the United Way's Alexis de Tocqueville \nSociety. He was the 1999-2000 chair of the Nashville Area Chamber of \nCommerce. Currently, Dr. Frist is chairman of the board of The Frist \nFoundation and chairman of the board of the Frist Center for the Visual \nArts. Dr. Frist also serves on the board of Montgomery Bell Academy in \nNashville and is chairman of the Nashville Healthcare Council's 2002-\n2003 board of directors.\n  Dr. Frist is also the brother of our own majority leader, Dr. Bill \nFrist, a leader on healthcare issues in the Senate. Dr. Frist's father, \nthe late Dr. Thomas Frist, Sr., was also a member of the Healthcare \nHall of Fame. Dr. Frist's induction makes them the first Hall of Fame \nfather-son pair. All of us in Tennessee appreciate Dr. Frist's \ndedication and great work in the healthcare industry, and I would like\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\nto congratulate him today on this great honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4821-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNITION OF THE UMD LADY BULLDOGS FOR WINNING THE 2003 NCAA DIVISION \n               I NATIONAL WOMEN'S ICE HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Minnesota in recognizing the University of Minnesota \nDuluth Women's Ice Hockey Team for winning their third straight \nnational championship.\n  A Stanley Cup-winning professional hockey player said that ``when you \nstart a tournament, you stick with it.'' History has shown that the \nLady Bulldogs maintain this same principle. In 2001 at the inaugural \nFrozen Four, they took on St. Lawrence University and won 4-2. The \nfollowing year, they made it through the semifinals again, allowing \nthem the opportunity to face Brown University, who they defeated 3-2 \nfor their second title.\n  They entered this year's national tournament playing Dartmouth \nCollege in the semifinals, a game which was tied in the second period \nbefore UMD came back to win it 5-2.\n  Two days later, in the championship, they met No. 2 seeded Harvard \nUniversity in what has been referred to by some as the best women's \ncollege hockey game ever.\n  Knowing what makes a good hockey game, I would have to agree. There \nwas a near-capacity crowd; a first period ending score of 2-0, with \nDuluth in the lead; a solid return by Harvard in the second; and a \nscoreless first overtime, which resulted in a second where sophomore \nNora Tallus scored the winning goal at 4 minutes and 19 seconds.\n  This goal concluded the 84-minute game, giving the Lady Bulldogs \ntheir third and probably most memorable title, as it was won at home in \nfront of a near-capacity crowd at the Duluth Entertainment Convention \nCenter.\n  I am pleased to stand here today, commending the UMD Women's Ice \nHockey Team for winning the 2003 NCAA Division I National Collegiate \nWomen's Ice Hockey Championship and recognizing the achievements of all \nthe team's players, coaches, and staff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4821-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE POSTAL PENSION LIABILITY ACT, S. 380\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has taken \naction to pass S. 380, the Postal Pension Liability Act.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee for their effort in getting this bill passed, particularly \nSenator Collins and Senator Lieberman, chairman and ranking member, \nrespectively, as well as Senator Stevens and Senator Carper, who have \nprovided tremendous leadership in getting this bill through the Senate.\n  As my colleagues may know, the U.S. Postal Service, USPS, is required \nto pay into the Civil Service Retirement System, CSRS, an amount that \nequals the full cost of its obligation to CSRS. While the Postal \nService has done so, the money it has placed into this account has \nearned interest at a higher rate than previously thought. Thus, the \nOffice of Personnel Management estimated in November that the pension \nobligations for the USPS totaled $5 billion and not a previously \nestimated $32 billion.\n  This bill would correct the formula that overpays the Postal \nService's obligation to the civil service retirement fund. In addition, \nthis bill would stabilize postage rates through 2006 and help the \nPostal Service to pay down some of its debt. Stable postage rates will \nhelp keep shipping costs down as well as the indirect cost of all \nconsumer goods.\n  Without this bill, the U.S. Postal Service would continue to overfund \nits contribution to the Civil Service Retirement System fund. If it had \nnot been evaluated and corrected, the overpayment could have reached \ntens of billions of dollars in the decades ahead.\n  Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 380, I am pleased with the \nbipartisan manner in which the Senate has acted to pass this much-\nneeded ill. This spirit of cooperation is truly in the best interest of \nthe American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4821-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4821-S4822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIRED OFFICERS' COMMENTARY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there has been much discussion here in the \nSenate and in the press about retired military officers who have been \nappearing in the media throughout the coverage of the diplomatic \nefforts and the actual military operations to end the global threat \nposed by Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction.\n  My own opinion is that most of these retired officers have, in a very \nfair, constructive, helpful way, interpreted the complexity of modern \nmilitary operations, the highly technical range of military equipment, \nand have conveyed their positive observations of the courage and \nprofessionalism of our men and women in uniform--from the generals to \nthe privates.\n  In most presentations, these retired officers have shown professional \nresponsibility and prudent restraint in giving their views and \ninterpretations. But a few have added personal criticisms over the \nplanning and execution of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Professionals in the military have devoted their careers to \nprotecting our Constitutional freedoms. Among the most cherished of \nthese is freedom of speech. But that freedom has its legal, as well as \nethical, restraints, and requires the exercise of good judgment, common \nsense, and taking into accounts the likely impact of their criticisms \non servicemen and their families.\n  By and large, the retired officers have, through their careers of \ndedidated service, earned the admiration of the general public. \nConsequently, a special trust is accorded them by the families, the \nparents, the grandparents of those serving in uniform. Quite often, the \nfamilies take to heart what they say, even more so than the views of \nothers.\n  If retired officers have professional views and judgments at variance \nwith the active duty chain of command, they are, like all Americans, \nfree to speak their mind. But how to do it--publicly or privately?\n  They have ample opportunity to convey their views to their former \ncolleagues--today's military commanders--through private channels, and \nI know many do so through a variety of forums and through personal \ncommunications. Before making critical public statements during the \ncourse of military operations, I hope they carefully consider the \nconsequences of such statements and recall how they, and their \nfamilies, felt about unexpected public criticism when they were in the \n``trenches of conflict.''\n  The tradition followed by Presidents, especially in times of \nconflict, is a worthy precedent. A sitting President customarily \nreceives the views of past Commanders in Chief by way of private \ncommunication rather than through the media.\n  Mr. President, I expressed these points to members of the media after \na Capitol Hill meeting Tuesday evening with Secretary Rumsfeld and \nGeneral Meyers, and I ask unanimous consent that the excerpted text of \nmy remarks at that news conference, and those of the general, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Excerpt From Transcript, News Conference With Secretary of Defense \n   Donald Rumsfeld; General Richard Myers, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of \n Staff; Senator John Warner (R-VA); Representative Duncan Hunter (R-CA)\n\n       Sen. Warner.--We covered that very carefully. The general \n     gave us a complete briefing. And I think, Duncan, I believe \n     you will join with me, the consensus in our group just now is \n     that a good plan has been in place, it is being executed. It \n     is timely. Considerable progress has been made to date. And \n     we see no reason at this time for anyone to be in criticism \n     of this program.\n       And I want to talk a little bit about this retired \n     military. I've been associated with the military a half-\n     century or more. I think some of them have in a very \n     constructive way interpreted the complexity of military \n     operations today and the equipment, and I think they have \n     done a good job in portraying the courage shown by the men \n     and women who are executing this plan.\n       And if some have criticisms, we don't mean to stifle \n     freedom of speech, but I think they should follow the \n     tradition of President, the Commander in Chiefs. You do not \n     see former Presidents criticizing a sitting President during \n     a war. And in the same way, if they've got constructive \n     criticism at variance with the plan, I think they should \n     confidentially contact their own peers in the Pentagon and \n     share it that way rather than open.\n\n[[Page S4822]]\n\n       Question: But Senator Warner, what about current \n     commanders? It is reported this morning, Army--(inaudible)--\n     Army colonel--(inaudible)--concerned about doing this war--\n     (inaudible)--not bring enough--(inaudible)--\n       Sen. Warner. Well, there's always, during any conflict, \n     going back to George Washington, complaints among his forces. \n     I have personally been involved in the wars in Korea, and \n     Vietnam, and Panama, and Somalia--and I could go on for a few \n     more, and I think Duncan, you've been in them--but that's all \n     right, we'll take that in stride. I'm more concerned about \n     the very senior officers who by virtue of their training and \n     experience have a lot of credibility, and I think that if \n     they have criticism, fine. Call up the chairman----\n       General Richard Myers. You bet.\n       Sen. Warner: You'd take the call?\n       Gen. Myers: Absolutely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4822-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SACRED HEART ACADEMY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndear friend, William Canary, of Montgomery, AL. Bill Canary was \nrecently name president of the Business Council of Alabama.\n  While he now calls Montgomery, Al, home, Bill is a native of New York \nand attended the State University of New York at Oneonta. He also holds \na juris doctorate degree from the Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center at \nTouro College.\n  Bill came to BCA from the American Trucking Association, the national \ntrade and safety organization of the U.S. trucking industry. He began \nhis career at ATA nearly a decade ago, serving as counselor to the AT \npresident and CEO, Thomas J. Donohue. Over the years, he served ATA in \nvarious capacities including political advisor to the president and \nsenior vice president for State, Federation and Intergovernmental \nAffairs. In 2001, the ATA board of directors named him their president \nand CEO.\n  Prior to his service at the ATA, Bill served as a Special Assistant \nto President George H.W. Bush for Intergovernmental Affairs. From \nJanuary 1989 through June 1991, Bill served the White House as the \nPresident's liaison to local elected officials and mayors throughout \nthe Nation.\n  Bill has also served as chief of staff for the Republican National \nCommittee and as national political director for the Committee to Re-\nElect President Bush. During the 2000 Republican National Convention he \nserved as a senior advisor to the co-chairman, Andrew Card, currently \nchief of staff to President George W. Bush.\n  He is the coauthor of the public research product ``The Alabama \nPoll,'' and is a writer, commentator, and political analyst for several \nAlabama television programs.\n  In 2001, I was proud to recommend Bill's wife Leura to serve as the \nU.S. attorney for the Middle District of Alabama. Leura has served in \nthis position with distinction. Bill and Leura have a daughter, \nMargaret, and a son, Will.\n  Bill Canary is a good friend and a beloved family man. I offer him my \ncongratulations and best wishes in his new role as president of \nBCA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4822-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 522.

A concurrent resolution by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of New Hampshire relative to a \n     peaceful and rapid resolution of the conflict between India \n     and Pakistan relative to the state of Jammu and Kashmir; to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 16\n\n       Whereas, the people of the former Princely State of Jammu \n     and Kashmir have for the past 55 years been subjected to \n     documented and unspeakable human rights abuses, including the \n     execution of civilians, the rape and burning of women, the \n     immolation and mutilation of children, the deliberate \n     shelling of civilians by military artillery, and the torture \n     and murder of political detainees; and\n       Whereas, 2 wars between India and Pakistan, in 1965 and \n     1971, failed to justly resolve either the issue of self-\n     determination or the ongoing and egregious violations of \n     human rights; and\n       Whereas, the threat of nuclear war between India and \n     Pakistan has reached unprecedented levels because of the \n     volatility of the issues attendant to the accession of \n     Kashmir; and\n       Whereas, resolution of this conflict, the cessation of \n     atrocities, and the reduction of the threat of nuclear war is \n     unquestionably in the best interests of the people of the \n     state of New Hampshire, the United States of America, and the \n     world community of nations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring:\n       That the New Hampshire general court, fully mindful of the \n     sacred obligation embodied in our state motto, ``Live Free or \n     Die,'' respectfully requests that the United States Senate \n     and the United States House of Representatives immediately \n     initiate hearings to discern all relevant facts and \n     circumstances attendant to the Kashmiri conflict so as to \n     facilitate its just, peaceful, and rapid resolution; to bring \n     a cessation of atrocities against the people of Jammu and \n     Kashmir; and to minimize the threat of nuclear war in \n     Southwest Asia; and\n       That the New Hampshire general court hereby calls upon all \n     parties to this conflict to adhere to the principles of the \n     United Nations Charter on Human Rights forthwith, and grant \n     observers from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch \n     free and unrestricted access to the entire State of Jammu and \n     Kashmir to monitor the status of human rights therein; and\n       That copies of this resolution be sent by the house clerk \n     to the President of the United States, the Vice President of \n     the United States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the New Hampshire congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-73. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan relative to federal transit funding \n     for highways and transit programs; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, Michigan faces a difficult task in maintaining a \n     transportation network that meets the many needs of the \n     individuals and businesses of this state. This challenge is \n     made more difficult because of the fact that Michigan \n     receives in return from the federal government far less in \n     highway funding than we send to Washington; and\n       Whereas, under the provisions of the Transportation Equity \n     Act for the 21st Century, Michigan currently receives \n     approximately 90.5 cents in return for every highway dollar \n     we send to the federal government. While this is a notable \n     improvement\n\n[[Page S4823]]\n\n     from the amounts received in prior years, it remains \n     inadequate for our state's considerable overall \n     transportation needs. In the area of transit, the deficiency \n     of funding received from Washington is much more severe, with \n     Michigan receiving only about 50 cents for each dollar we \n     send through taxes; and\n       Whereas, this shortfall will present significant problems \n     to certain aspects of our transportation infrastructure. As \n     discussions take place on future funding mechanisms and the \n     next federal transportation funding bill, it is imperative \n     that a fairer approach be developed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate (the house of representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to establish a minimum rate of return of 95 percent of \n     Michigan's federal transportation funding for highway and \n     transit programs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-74. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan relative to the United States Coast Guard Cutter \n     Bramble; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, Since its launch in 1943, the United States Coast \n     Guard Cutter Bramble has served our nation in a variety of \n     capacities. Following its six decades of service, the 180-\n     foot buoy tender is scheduled for decommissioning in the \n     spring of 2003; and\n       Whereas, The people of Port Huron, the home port of the \n     Bramble since 1975, feel a strong sense of identity with the \n     vessel. As a result, local citizens are working hard to make \n     the cutter a permanent educational and historical resource of \n     Port Huron by securing title and ownership for the Port Huron \n     Museum of Arts and History. Members of the community have \n     expressed a commitment to renovating the Bramble for its new \n     role and maintaining it for the future; and\n       Whereas, The history of the missions undertaken by the \n     Bramble will serve as a visible reminder of the many ways the \n     Coast Guard serves our nation. The cutter's work during World \n     War II, its journey through Arctic waters and the Bering \n     Straits to the Atlantic in 1957, and its long years working \n     to secure navigation and safety along the Great Lakes will \n     provide invaluable lessons for visitors, especially children; \n     and\n       Whereas, Legislation has been introduced in Congress to \n     provide for the Coast Guard to convey the Bramble to the Port \n     Huron Museum of Arts and History after decommissioning: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to provide for the \n     United States Coast Guard to transfer ownership of the \n     decommissioned Coast Guard Cutter Bramble to the Port Huron \n     Museum of Arts and History; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-75. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of South Dakota relative to memorializing the \n     Congress to refrain from acquiring certain additional land \n     for Wind Cave National Park; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 1019\n\n       Whereas, the United States Congress is considering \n     legislation to add more than 5,500 acres to Wind Cave \n     National Park; and\n       Whereas, Wind Cave National Park, located in the southern \n     Black Hills, is the location of one of the longest and most \n     complex cave systems in the United States and includes 28,000 \n     acres of mixed-grass prairies and pine forests that provide \n     habitat for bison, deer, elk, and many other species; and\n       Whereas, the proposed addition would involve the purchase \n     of similar adjacent, private land; and\n       Whereas, residents of Custer and Fall River counties by a \n     large margin do not support the proposed purchase of \n     additional property for Wind Cave National Park; and\n       Whereas, the proposed purchase would reduce property tax \n     revenues to Custer County and the Hot Springs School \n     District, and federal payments in lieu of taxes would not be \n     sufficient to make up for the loss; and\n       Whereas, the National Park Service prohibits hunting in \n     Wind Cave National Park and would prohibit hunting in the \n     additional areas to be purchased, and the National Park \n     Service does not have a strong record in the area of wildlife \n     management; and\n       Whereas, the purchase price for the proposed additional \n     acres is higher than warranted and would drive the price of \n     land in the area beyond the reach of agricultural producers: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy-\n     eighth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate \n     concurring therein, That the South Dakota Legislature does \n     not support the proposed purchase of additional land for an \n     expansion of Wind Cave National Park currently under \n     consideration by the United States Congress. The Legislature \n     urges Congress to refrain from making the purchase and to \n     allocate the resources intended for the purchase to more \n     appropriate purposes.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-76.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 774. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe use of completed contract method of accounting in the case of \ncertain long-term naval vessel construction contracts; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce \nlegislation to simplify and restore fairness to the tax accounting \nrules under which our six major U.S. naval shipyards determine their \ntax liability on the naval ship contracts they are awarded by the Navy.\n  Quite simply, this legislation would permit naval shipyards to use a \nmethod of accounting under which shipbuilders would pay income taxes \nupon delivery of a ship rather than during construction. Under current \nlaw, profits must be estimated during the construction phases of the \nshipbuilding process and taxes must be paid on those estimated profits, \na process known as the ``Percent of Completion Method'' of accounting.\n  The major shortcoming of this method is that shipbuilders must report \nprogress payments as ``revenue'' rather than as a source of financing, \nwhich had been recognized and permitted for the 64 years between 1918 \nand 1982. Additionally, it creates a ``legal fiction'' of an ``interim \nprofit,'' when in reality a profit or loss is not reasonably known \nuntil after a ship is completed. This places a financial burden on \nshipbuilders during the critical construction phase; reduces the \nresources available to invest in facilities and processes to reduce \nconstruction costs; places a burden on the cash flow management of the \nshipbuilder; and weakens the financial health of the defense \nshipbuilding industrial base.\n  The legislation being proposed would simply allow naval shipbuilders \nand their team members to use a modified ``Completed Contract Method'' \nof accounting, under which the shipbuilder would pay taxes when the \nship is actually delivered to the Navy. In other words, the delivery of \neach ship would be treated as the completion of the contract for \n``Completed Contract'' purposes, regardless of how many ships are built \nunder a contract.\n  Prior to 1982, Federal law permitted shipbuilders to use this method \nbut the law was changed due to abuses by Federal contractors in another \nsector, having absolutely nothing to do with shipbuilding. Moreover, \nnon-government shipbuilding contracts are already allowed to use this \nmethod of accounting, and this legislation contains provisions designed \nto prevent the types of abuses witnessed in the past. Specifically, the \nbill would restrict shipyards from deferring tax payments for a period \nbeyond the time it takes to build a single ship.\n  This bill would not reduce the amount of taxes ultimately paid by the \nshipbuilder. It simply would defer payment until the profit is actually \nknown upon delivery of the ship. I believe that this is the most fair \nand most sensible accounting method. It is the method that naval \nshipbuilders employed in the past. It is the method which commercial \nbuilders are permitted to use to this day. This legislation has the \nstrong support of the major shipyards that build for the Navy. As such, \nI strongly urge my colleagues to join me in a strong show of support \nfor this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n\n  S. 775. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to make private, nonprofit medical facilities \nthat serve industry-specific clients eligible for hazard mitigation and \ndisaster assistance; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould allow private, non-profit medical facilities which service \nindustry-specific clients to be eligible for hazard mitigation and \ndisaster assistance. Under the current law, institutions such as these \nare limited in their ability to receive the Federal funds needed for \nboth preparedness and response in the case of emergencies.\n  In particular, I speak today of the Motion Picture & Television, \nMPTF, Hospital, located in the earthquake-prone San Fernando Valley. \nSet up more than 80 years ago to provide members of the entertainment \nindustry with vital medical care and social services, the MPTF Hospital \nis the only institution of its kind in the United States.\n  With an acute care hospital, six outpatient facilities staffed with \nprimary care physicians, a children's center, retirement facilities, \nand programs for the elderly, the MPTF Hospital provides comprehensive \ncare for a significant sector of the population of the greater Los \nAngeles community. It is the only non-profit institution providing \nindustry-specific health and human services to the entertainment \nindustry and to the general public.\n  This legislation is important because in the aftermath of the \nNorthridge Earthquake of 1994, considered one of the worst natural \ndisasters in U.S. history, the MPTF Hospital was unable to receive \nfederal assistance to repair structural and equipment damages suffered \nfrom the earthquake. Furthermore, that same year, the California Senate \nenacted legislation requiring all hospitals to be seismically \nretrofitted by 2010. The costs of both the reparations and structural \nupgrades are enormous, and the MPTF Hospital cannot receive federal \nfunds because as an institution serving an industry-specific clientele, \nit does not qualify under the current definition of a ``private, \nnonprofit facility'' within the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act of 1988, Stafford Act.\n  To address this problem, this legislation broadens that definition to \ninclude tax-exempt facilities that provide medical services to specific \noccupational or industry segments of the general public.\n  Under this change, facilities such as the MPTF Hospital would have \nthe opportunity to apply for federal assistance under the Stafford Act, \nalongside other private, nonprofit institutions.\n  There is no up-front cost stemming from this amendment to the \nStafford Act. This bill simply puts the MPTF Hospital on equal footing \nwith other critical care facilities when applying for Federal disaster \nassistance.\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\n  This legislation is timely and necessary. Hospitals such as the MPTF \ndeserve an opportunity to apply for Federal funding, and desperately \nneed this financial assistance in order to both meet California's 2010 \ndeadline for seismic retrofitting and respond adequately to future \ndisasters. I call on this body to enact this legislation promptly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n\n  S. 776. A bill to amend chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States \nCode, to authorize payments to certain trusts under the Social Security \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould amend Title V of the United States Code. It authorizes the Office \nof Personnel Management, OPM, to make payments to a disability trust or \na pooled trust which is set up for a disabled dependent of a Federal \nworker in a way that would allow him or her to continue to receive \nMedicaid benefits.\n  My bill would put disabled dependents of federal workers on a par \nwith disabled dependents of those in the private sector. In 1993, \nCongress passed a statute allowing disabled persons to have trusts. \nAnd, in 1999, the Supplemental Security Income, SSI, statute was \namended to conform with the basic Medicaid law. But, as current law is \ninterpreted, these protective trusts cannot be set up for disabled \ndependents of federal workers in a way that allows them to keep their \nother benefits.\n  This oversight can cause devastating and confusing circumstances for \ndisabled dependents and their guardians. In Colorado, Lisa Neikirk, a \nDowns Syndrome child, became entitled to a small civil service \nretirement annuity from her father when he died in 1994. This benefit \nin the amount of $310 per month was just high enough to push her off \nSSI and Medicaid and she lost her benefits at that time.\n  Because Congress had recently passed a Medicaid statute allowing \ndisabled people to have trusts, Lisa's mother created a trust for her. \nHowever, the Social Security Administration took the position that OPM \nstatutes do not permit Lisa's benefit to be assigned to a trust without \nnegating her Medicaid benefits. The Social Security Administration \naccepts these trusts with other assets but the OPM statute preexisted \nthe 1993 law and would not allow benefits to be assigned to these \ntrusts without this change. Lisa's situation is only one of several \nsuch cases throughout the country.\n  The bill I am introducing would grant to OPM the discretion to pay a \nretirement annuity to a disability trust which is set up for a person \nin a way which would allow them to continue to receive Medicaid \nbenefits. This policy change has been very carefully drafted so that it \ncannot be abused. It stipulates a trust that is qualified under \nMedicaid law and adheres to two Medicaid statutes.\n  I believe it is important that we better protect disabled children of \nFederal workers. We need to make it clear that disabled dependents of \nFederal workers are protected by laws that now protect people in the \nprivate sector. In today's uncertain world, I believe dependents of \nfederal workers need all the protection that is available to them under \nthe law. We must not let outdated federal statutes put federal workers \nand their dependents at a disadvantage.\n  This legislation provides another step toward making our laws fair \nfor the disabled in our country. I urge my colleagues to support its \npassage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objective, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 776\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the impact aid program under the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act of 1965 to improve the delivery of payments \nunder the program to local educational agencies; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to make \nthe Impact Aid Program a Federal entitlement.\n  Impact Aid is one of the oldest Federal education programs, dating \nfrom the 1950's, and is meant to compensate a local school district for \nfinancial losses resulting from Federal properties or lands in that \ndistrict. Congress met its obligation of fully funding Impact Aid until \nthe 1970's. When the funding was cut in 1971, many districts that \ngreatly depend on Impact Aid began to suffer. In the past few years, \nthe Impact Aid payment formula has become increasingly complex, causing \ngreat funding disparities for the same types of students in different \ndistricts.\n  I have consistently supported increased appropriations for Impact Aid \nbecause it not only provides an essential revenue source for impacted \ndistricts, but it is also a Federal obligation. Often, close to 90 \npercent of a local school's funding is comprised of the local tax base. \nWhen the presence of the Federal Government in a community takes away \nfrom this tax base, we must compensate for this loss. When we do not \nfulfill our obligation by adequately funding Impact Aid, our children \nsuffer the consequence such as lower test scores, lower attendance \nrates, crowded classrooms, and fewer and older facilities.\n  Although funding for Impact Aid has increased over the past few \nyears, it still remains under-funded. Today, I am taking the first step \nto correct this inequity. My bill will require Congress to meet its \nduty to these children and schools that have been under-funded for so \nlong. I urge my colleagues to join me in fulfilling our obligation by \npermanently fully funding the Impact Aid program.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague Senator Inhofe in introducing a bill that will make a real \ndifference in schools on or near military bases, Indian reservations, \nand other Federal lands. Our bill will make the Impact Aid Program a \nFederal entitlement.\n  We require public schools to accept all children from military \nfamilies and tribal reservations. It is the right thing to do. But \nfamilies in Federal housing or on reservations do not pay local \nproperty taxes, a traditional revenue source for school districts. \nWhile Impact Aid was designed to make up the difference, we have not \nmet our obligation to public schools. Instead, we have let the Impact \nAid Program fall prey to the annual appropriations process. This means \nthat payments to Impact Aid schools are never guaranteed, are usually \nunderfunded, and rarely arrive on time. In fact, Impact Aid has not \nbeen fully funded since the early 1980s. The result of this \nunderfunding can been seen in Impact Aid schools in States across the \ncountry. Schools are cutting programs and staff, not buying new books \nand materials, and deferring maintenance on buildings to help cover \nclassroom costs. As a result, schools like Hays Lodge Pole School in \nMontana cannot teach their students and maintain their school facility; \nin the last couple of years, the Hays Lodge Pole School has been \nsusceptible to electrical fires and other structural hazards.\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\n  I am so proud of the students, teachers, and administrators that \nlearn and work in our Impact Aid districts. They have gone above and \nbeyond to make due with scant resources. In many cases, however, we \nhave stretched school districts to the breaking point. We have an \nobligation to our schools and the students. We can and must do better \nthan we have in the past.\n  The bill that Senator Inhofe and I are introducing today will make a \ndifference. It requires the Federal Government to meet its obligation \nto these schools. As a result, districts will know when and how much \nthey will receive. The guesswork will vanish, and school leaders will \nbe able to focus on student achievement instead of budget games.\n  I recognize that creating a Federal entitlement program is not an \neasy task. But Impact Aid is not like other discretionary programs. It \nwas set up to compensate school districts for the ``substantial and \ncontinuing financial burden resulting from Federal activities.'' It is \nnot a program that supplements local programming. It is the only game \nin town, and when we do not meet our Federal obligation, there is no \nother program to pick up the slack. Other Federal education programs, \nsuch as title I, supplement insufficient local resources.\n  Importantly, Impact Aid is a Federal program that addresses Federal \nneeds. Our bill recognizes that providing Impact Aid resources on time \nand in full helps federally impacted students learn and achieve. It \nalso recognizes that Impact Aid funds are better spent in our schools \nthan on plane tickets and expenses for Impact Aid officials to come to \nWashington to fight for dollars that they inherently deserve.\n  Finally, I want to say a little about my personal perspective on \neducation. I honestly believe there is nothing more important than \ngiving our children the best opportunities to succeed in life. That is \na principle I hold very deeply. Nothing we can do for our children will \nmake a bigger difference in their lives than giving them a solid \neducation. Education provides greater advantages in the workplace, and \ngreater personal enrichment; both of which lead to future personal and \nprofessional success. I have always believed that a quality public \neducation system is not only the right of every child, but also the key \nto smart economic development. The investments we make in our education \nsystem today will provide our children with the skills and knowledge to \nbe successful in the 21st century economy.\n  Our bill recognizes the importance of education and makes sure that \nour federally impacted school districts receive the money they deserve. \nMore importantly, our bill makes sure that students in federally \nimpacted schools will have an education that will prepare them for \npersonal and professional success.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. \n        Inhofe):\n  S. 778.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nimprove protection of treatment works from terrorist and other harmful \nand intentional acts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Lautenberg, \nGraham of Florida, and Lieberman to introduce the Wastewater Treatment \nWorks Security and Safety Act. This legislation provides for the safety \nand security of our Nation's wastewater treatment works by providing \nneeded funds to conduct vulnerability assessments and implement \nsecurity improvements. In addition, this bill will ensure long-term \nsafety and security by providing funds for researching innovative \ntechnologies and enhancing proven vulnerability assessment tools \nalready in use.\n  Since the terrible events of September 11, we have taken several \ncomprehensive steps to protect our water supplies and infrastructure. I \nhave spoken on the many initiatives taking place on the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works and at the Environmental Protection Agency \nto protect our Nation's critical water infrastructure. I am pleased to \nsay that we have made some progress.\n  EPA worked with State and local governments to expeditiously provide \nguidance on the protection of drinking water facilities from terrorist \nattacks. Based on the recommendations of Presidential Decision \nDirective 63, issued by President Clinton in 1998, the Environmental \nProtection Agency and its industry partner, the Association of \nMetropolitan Water Agencies, established a communications system, a \nwater infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center, designed \nto provide real-time threat assessment data to water utilities \nthroughout the Nation.\n  Last year, Senator Smith and I worked to include the authorization of \n$160 million for vulnerability assessments at drinking water facilities \nas part of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and \nResponse Act of 2002. Despite our hard work during the conference, we \nwere unable to include a provision in that bill for wastewater \nfacilities due to jurisdictional issues in the House.\n  While these initial efforts are essential, our task is by no means \nfinished. We cannot forget the vital importance of protecting our \nNation's wastewater facilities. Everyday we take for granted the \nhundreds of thousand of miles of\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\npipes buried underground and the thousands of wastewater treatment \nworks that keep our water clean and safe. Like all our Nation's \ncritical infrastructure, the disruption or destruction of these \nstructures could have a devastating impact on public safety, health, \nand the economy.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will take us one step further \nby authorizing support of ongoing efforts to develop and implement \nvulnerability assessments and emergency response plans at wastewater \nfacilities.\n  Using existing tools such as the Sandia Laboratory's vulnerability \nassessment tool or the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage \nAssociation's Vulnerability Self-Assessment Tool, treatment works will \nbe able to securely identify critical areas of need. With the funds \nprovided by this bill, EPA will also ensure that treatment works remedy \nareas of concerns. Using the results of the vulnerability assessment, \ntreatment works will develop or revise emergency response plans to \nminimize damage if an attack were to occur.\n  This bill authorizes $180 million for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 \nfor grants to conduct the vulnerability assessments and implement basic \nsecurity enhancements. The bill also recognizes the need to address \nimmediate and urgent security needs with a special $20 million \nauthorization over 2004 and 2005.\n  In my home State of Vermont, we have only three towns of over 25,000 \npeople. The small water facilities serving these communities have been \nparticularly challenged to meet today's new homeland security \nchallenges. Many times, water managers operate the town's water \nfacilities as a part-time job or even as a free service. We must ensure \nthat they are afforded the same consideration under this act as the \nmedium and large facilities. This bill authorizes $15 million for \ngrants to help small communities conduct vulnerability assessments, \ndevelop emergency response plans, and address potential threats to the \ntreatment works. It also instructs the Administrator of the EPA to \nprovide guidance to these communities on how to effectively use these \nsecurity tools.\n  To ensure the continued development of wastewater security \ntechnologies, the Wastewater Treatment Works Security and Safety Act \nauthorizes $15 million for research for 2004 through 2008. It also \nprovides $500,000 to refine vulnerability self-assessment tools already \nin existence.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation and \nother efforts to enhance the security of our Nation's water \ninfrastructure in the weeks, months, and years to come. We truly have \nsomething to protect--clean, safe, fresh water is worth our investment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN.\n  S. 784. A bill to revise the boundary of the Petrified Forest \nNational Park in the State of Arizona, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nauthorize expansion of the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. \nI'm pleased that Representative Rick Renzi will introduce companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  The Petrified Forest National Park is a national treasure among the \nNation's parks, renowned for its large concentration of highly colored \npetrified wood, fossilized remains, and spectacular landscapes. \nHowever, it is much more than a colorful, scenic vista, for the \nPetrified Forest has been referred to as ``one of the world's greatest \nstorehouses of knowledge about life on earth when the Age of the \nDinosaurs was just beginning.''\n  For anyone whom has ever visited this park, one is quick to recognize \nthe wealth of scenic, scientific, and historical values of this park. \nPreserved deposits of petrified wood and related fossils are among the \nmost valuable representations of Triassic-period terrestrial ecosystems \nin the world. These natural formations were deposited more than 220 \nmillion years ago. Scenic vistas, designated wilderness areas, and \nother historically significant sites of pictographs and Native American \nruins are added dimensions to the park.\n  The Petrified Forest was originally designated as a National Monument \nby former President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 to protect the important \nnatural and cultural resources of the Park, and later re-designated as \na National Park in 1962. While several boundary adjustments were made \nto the Park, a significant portion of unprotected resources remain in \noutlying areas adjacent to the Park.\n  A proposal to expand the Park's boundaries was recommended in the \npark's General Management Plan in 1992, in response to concerns about \nthe long-term protection needs of globally significant resources and \nthe Park's viewshed in nearby areas. For example, one of the most \nconcentrated deposits of petrified wood is found within the Chinle \nencarpment, of which only thirty percent is included within the current \nPark boundaries.\n  Increasing reports of theft and vandalism around the Park have \nactivated the Park, local communities, and other interested entities to \nseek additional protections through a proposed boundary expansion. It \nhas been estimated that visitors to the Park steal about 12 tons of \npetrified wood every year. Other reports of destruction to \narchaeological sites and gravesites have also been documented. Based on \nthese continuing threats to resources intrinsic to the Park, the \nNational Parks Conservation Association listed the Petrified Forest \nNational Park on its list of Top Ten Most Endangered Parks in 2000.\n  Support for this proposed boundary expansion is extraordinary, from \nthe local community of Holbrook, scientific and research institutions, \nstate tourism agencies, and environmental groups, such as the National \nParks Conservation Association, NPCA. I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter of support from the National Parks Conservation Association be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                    National Parks\n\n\n                                     Conservation Association,\n\n                                                   March 20, 2003.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I wish to express the appreciation of \n     the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) for your \n     reintroduction of the Petrified Forest National Park \n     Expansion Act. Every day that passes without adequately \n     protecting the remarkable resources adjacent to this gem of \n     the National Park System places them and the park at greater \n     risk. NPCA strongly agrees with the National Park Service's \n     1992 findings that the park should be expanded. Now, with \n     your leadership and with private landowners within the \n     proposed expansion area anxious to sell their land, we \n     believe the time has come to pass this important legislation.\n       It is hard to imagine a better example of an outdoor \n     classroom than Petrified Forest National Park. This boundary \n     expansion will ensure long-term protection of globally \n     significant paleontological resources outside the park, which \n     are believed even to surpass those within the present park \n     boundary. Only 30 percent of the 22-mile long Chinle \n     escarpment, known to constitute the best record of Triassic \n     period terrestrial ecosystems found anywhere in the world, is \n     protected within the park. The opportunities for \n     schoolchildren in Arizona and elsewhere, for the scientific \n     community, and others to learn from the 225 million-year old \n     record entombed in these lands is truly incredible. The \n     lessons locked within Petrified Forest and the proposed \n     expansion lands can give us important perspectives about how \n     modern day challenges like global warming and biodiversity \n     relate to historical changes in the earth's climate and \n     environment, dating back to prehistoric times. And they can \n     excite the next generation of scientists the nation will need \n     to compete in the 21st century.\n       In addition to the Chinle, the expansion would protect \n     major ancestral puebloan archaeological sites dating as far \n     back as 7,000 years, and the incredible vista from the park's \n     Blue Mesa. It will also alleviate the threat of encroaching \n     incompatible development and will greatly enhance the \n     National Park Service's capability to protect the resources \n     from vandalism and illegal pothunting.\n       I have had the opportunity to discuss this expansion \n     proposal with Arizona's new governor, Janet Napolitano and \n     her staff and am very encouraged by their strong interest. \n     NPCA looks forward to working with you, your able staff, the \n     Arizona delegation, the new governor, and the park service to \n     build upon the progress we made in last year's negotiations \n     on the bill.\n       Expanding Petrified Forest National Park will be a gift the \n     American people will appreciate for generations to come. In \n     addition, I can think of no more fitting tribute to the \n     park's late superintendent, Michele Hellickson, than saving \n     the resource she fought to protect for so many years. Because\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\n     it provides such a compelling explanation about why this \n     expansion is so important, I am attaching an article by David \n     Gillette, the Colbert Curator of Paleontology at the Museum \n     of Northern Arizona, which was published in our magazine last \n     fall. Thank you for advancing this important proposal to \n     protect a truly remarkable resource for our nation and the \n     rest of the world.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Craig D. Obey,\n                            Vice President for Government Affairs.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today is intended to serve as a \nplaceholder bill for further development of a boundary expansion \nproposal. The legislation is identical to the version introduced in the \n107th Congress. Several key issues remain that require resolution, \nincluding the exact definition of the expanded boundary acreage as well \nas the disposition and possible acquisition of private and State lands \nwithin the proposed expansion area.\n  It's encouraging to note that the four major landowners within the \nproposed boundary expansion area have expressed interest in the Park \nexpansion. Other public landowners, primarily the state of Arizona and \nthe Bureau of Land Management, have recognized the significance of the \npaleontological resources on its lands adjacent to the Park. The \nArizona State Trust land Department closed nearby State trust lands to \nboth surface and subsurface applications. Additionally, the Bureau of \nLand Management has identified its land-holdings within the proposed \nexpansion area for disposal and possible transfer to the Park.\n  Other issues involving additional private landholders and State trust \nland must still be resolved. In particular, the State of Arizona has \nspecific requirements which must be addressed as the legislation moves \nthrough the process, particularly with regard to compensation to the \nstate for any acquisitions of State trust lands by the Secretary of the \nInterior, in keeping with the requirements of State law.\n  I fully intend to address these issues in consultation with affected \nentities and resolve any additional questions within a reasonable time-\nframe. A historic opportunity exists to alleviate major threats to \nthese nationally significant resources and preserve them for our \nposterity.\n  On a personal note, I'd like to acknowledge the former Park \nSuperintendent of Petrified Forest National Park, Michele Hellickson, \nwho recently lost a battle with cancer a few months ago. She served as \nPark Superintendent for nine years, from 1993 to 2002, and was one of \nthe most ardent supporters to protect the resources of this Park.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe payment of dividends on the stock of cooperatives without reducing \npatronage dividends; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a very important \npiece of legislation to modify the cooperative dividend allocation \nrule. I would like to thank Senator Grassley and my other colleagues \nthat have signed on the bill for their support for correcting this \nrule.\n  America's agriculture industry has not had it easy in recent years. \nIn Montana and other areas of the country, drought, low prices and the \neconomic downturn have hit our farms and ranches hard. Over the past \nfew years Congress has worked diligently to help our Nation's smaller \nagriculture producers. However, there is more work to be done.\n  Senator Grassley and I recently introduced ``The Tax Empowerment and\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\nRelief for Farmers and Fisherman Act'', TERFF, with the intention of \ngiving farmers the tools to help themselves. One provision within that \nAct deals with the payment of dividends on cooperatives' stock. Today \nwe are introducing that provision on its own to emphasize the \nimportance of changing the dividend allocation rule.\n  Currently, the dividend allocation rule reduces patronage income when \na cooperative pays a dividend on capital stock from non-patronage \nearnings. This reduces the amount cooperatives can pay back to their \nfarmer patrons and inhibits their ability to equity-finance operations.\n  Modifying this rule will make farmer cooperatives more competitive \nand provide better access to capital. This piece of legislation will \nhelp revitalize farmer cooperatives by providing more accurate tax \ntreatment for patronage and non-patronage income.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the critical \npiece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 785\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON STOCK OF COOPERATIVES \n                   WITHOUT REDUCING PATRONAGE DIVIDENDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 1388 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to patronage dividend \n     defined) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     sentence: ``For purposes of paragraph (3), net earnings shall \n     not be reduced by amounts paid during the year as dividends \n     on capital stock or other proprietary capital interests of \n     the organization to the extent that the articles of \n     incorporation or bylaws of such organization or other \n     contract with patrons provide that such dividends are in \n     addition to amounts otherwise payable to patrons which are \n     derived from business done with or for patrons during the \n     taxable year.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to distributions in taxable years beginning after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Dividend Allocation Rule, DAR, is \nthe result of several old court cases and subsequent IRS interpretation \nthat applies only to cooperatives which are corporations. When a non \ncooperative corporation pays a dividend to its shareholder the \ncorporation pays tax on the dividend issued and the shareholder pays a \ntax on the dividend received, so they pay two levels of taxation. In \nfact, under the President's dividend exclusion proposal as presented to \nthe U.S. Congress, the President of the United States makes a \ncompelling argument that being taxed twice is inherently unfair and it \nwould be good for the Nation's economy that only one level of tax \nshould be paid by the corporation and that the shareholder would \nreceive the dividend tax free.\n  Well--if two levels of taxation on corporations and their \nshareholders is unfair and adverse to the creation of capital and the \neconomy--how would you like to try to operate as a fiscally sound \nbusiness entity if you had to figure out every day how you were going \nto generate enough cash flow to pay THREE levels of taxation.\n  Current law requires corporate cooperatives to treat income from \ntheir member-owners, patrons, separate from income of their non-members \nmoney. Contributions and earnings used by the cooperative to operate is \ntypically called retained patronage. The member, unlike a shareholder, \nhas to pay income tax on that amount even if the Cooperative retains \nthe money for operation expenses. Then, because of the IRS' rules, when \nthe Cooperative returns money to its non-members it loses its corporate \ndeduction which in turn reduces the return of earnings that the patron \nhas already paid taxes on--the result is a triple layer of tax. This \nrule is inherently unfair to our corporate cooperatives.\n  Now is the time to finally correct this injustice. The Congress \npassed this bill in 106th Congress, but it was subsequently vetoed by \nthe President. It was a part of a bill I sponsored the ``Tax \nEmpowerment and Relief for Farmers and Fishermen, TERFF, Act'' in the \n107th, and now it is time for the Senate to pass it again in the 108th. \nAs Chairman of the Finance Committee, I am proud to join with my \nRanking Member Max Baucus to introduce the bill to repeal the Dividend \nAllocation Rule. We have been joined by many of our farm States' \nSenators in a truly bipartisan effort to correct this financial \ninjustice.\n  The time to act is now and this bi-partisan legislation will \neliminate the adverse tax problem and will help rejuvenate over 100 of \nour farmer cooperative networks in Iowa and nearly 3000 of our \ncooperatives across the America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 786. A bill to amend the temporary assistance to needy families \nprogram under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act to provide \ngrants for transitional jobs programs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Business \nLinks Act, on behalf of myself, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Breaux.\n  The Business Links Act is a companion bill to the Education Works \nAct, which I introduced a short time ago. Both of these bills address \nthe need to support State efforts to use welfare to work strategies \nthat combine work with a flexible mix of education, training and other \nsupports. The Business Links Act, more specifically, provides resources \nto States seeking to implement one of the most effective of these types \nof programs: transitional jobs programs. These programs provide \nsubsidized, temporary, wage-paying jobs for 20 to 35 hours a week, \nalong with access to job readiness, basic education, vocational skills, \nand other barrier-removal services based on individualized plans. The \nBusiness Links Act would provide states with funding to implement these \ntransitional jobs programs and other training and support programs such \nas Business Links.\n  Existing transitional jobs programs are achieving great outcomes. \nResearch has shown that 81 percent to 94 percent of those who completed \ntransitional jobs programs went on to unsubsidized jobs with wages, and \nthat most of these individuals moved into full-time employment. \nTransitional jobs can be particularly effective for the hardest to \nserve welfare recipients. For people who face barriers, or who lack the \nskills or experience to compete successfully in the labor market, paid \nwork in a supportive environment, together with access to needed \nservices provides a real chance to move into stable, permanent \nemployment. Transitional jobs not only help individuals, but \ncommunities as well. In providing work opportunities for hard-to-employ \nindividuals, these programs reduce pressure on local emergency systems \nand decrease government expenditures on health care, food stamps, and \ncash assistance.\n  Our legislation also supports ``business link'' programs that provide \nindividuals with fewer barriers and those who have historically found \nonly very low wage employment with intensive training and skill \ndevelopment activities designed to lead to long-term, higher paid \nemployment. These programs are based on partnerships with the private \nsector. In my home State, just such a program is producing great \nresults the Teamworks program. During a 12-week course, participants \nare provided with training in life and employment skills, necessary \nsupports such as childcare and transportation, assistance in their job \nsearch efforts and ongoing support for 18 months after job placement. \nImpressively, the average wage of those completing the program is $1.50 \nper hour higher than other programs and job retention rates are 20 \npercent higher.\n  Additional Federal support for transitional job and business link \nprograms is sorely needed. The Welfare-to-work funds that have \npreviously been used to support these programs are nearly exhausted. In \naddition, in a period of rising caseloads and state budget crises such \nas we are now facing, funding transitional jobs solely with existing \nTANF funds will be very difficult.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Business Links Act, \nwhich will provide States with the tools they need to implement \nprograms that work. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 786\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the fair treatment of the Federal \njudiciary relating to compensation and benefits, and to instill greater \npublic confidence in the Federal courts; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n[[Page S4840]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Kerry and I are pleased to \nintroduce the ``Fair and Independent Judiciary Act of 2003.'' This \nlegislation arises from our belief that we must remain steadfast in our \ncommitment to preserving the vitality of our third branch of \ngovernment. Ensuring a fair and independent judiciary is critical to \npreserving the system of checks and balances established in our \nConstitution. The Fair and Independent Judiciary Act includes measures \nto respond to the shortfall in real judicial compensation, to repeal \nthe link of judicial pay to congressional pay, to improve survivorship \nbenefits, and to instill greater public confidence in our courts.\n  The National Commission on Public Service, a blue-ribbon panel of \nexperts headed by Paul Volcker, recently concluded that Congress' \nbudgetary treatment of this co-equal branch threatens its ability to \nperform its essential mission. This legislation addresses a problem \nthat the Chief Justice has repeatedly brought to our attention--the \ndecline in real judicial salaries.\n  As a member of both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the \nJudiciary, I have worked hard to help preserve a fair and independent \njudiciary. I was very disappointed that the Continuing Resolutions \napproved by Congress failed to give the Federal judiciary a cost-of-\nliving adjustment, COLA, for fiscal year 2003.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Hatch and I were joined by Senator DeWine \nand Senator Specter to cosponsor legislation in the Senate to provide \nthe Federal judiciary with a COLA for the present fiscal year. House \nJudiciary Chairman Sensenbrenner was joined by that Committee's Ranking \nDemocratic Member, Congressman Conyers, and others to introduce \nidentical legislation. Congress eventually passed a measure to give the \nJudiciary their cost of living adjustment for fiscal year 2003 but this \neffort failed to compensate the judiciary for many other previously \nskipped COLAs.\n  The Fair and Independent Judiciary Act would correct the earlier \nfailures to provide COLAs and prevent this situation from happening \nagain.\n  It is important to put our budgetary treatment of this co-equal \nbranch in historical context. In 1975, Congress enacted the Executive \nSalary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, intended to give judges, Members \nof Congress and other high-ranking Executive Branch officials automatic \nCOLAs as accorded other Federal employees unless rejected by Congress. \nIn 1981, Congress enacted Section 140 of Public Law 97-92, mandating \nspecific congressional action to give COLAs to judges.\n  Five times in the last decade Congress failed to provide the \nJudiciary with a COLA. We believe that this treatment was unfair to the \njudiciary and that we should restore their salaries to what they would \nbe had the COLAs been granted. In order to have their salaries reflect \nthe current cost of living we should unlink the salaries of Members of \nCongress and Members of the Judiciary by repealing Section 140.\n  In their thorough report, the Volcker Commission recommended that \nCongress unlink judicial salaries from those of Members of Congress. \nThe Commission explained that due to ``the reluctance of members of \nCongress to risk the disapproval of their constituents . . . Congress \nhas regularly permitted salaries to fall substantially behind cost-of-\nliving increases.'' Urgent Business for America: Revitalizing the \nFederal Government for the 21st Century, January 2003, Recommendation \n10. Therefore, the Commission found that ``executive and judicial \nsalaries must be determined by procedures that tie them to the needs of \nthe government, not the career-related political exigencies of members \nof Congress.''\n  The Fair and Independent Judiciary Act would restore the skipped cost \nof living adjustments that occurred in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2002 \nso that the salaries of our judges and justices are not outpaced by \ninflation.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist has called judicial pay ``the most pressing \nissue'' facing the courts.\n  We look forward to Senate consideration of the Fair and Independent \nJudiciary Act to restore previously skipped cost of living adjustments \nfor the Justices and judges of the United States. We hope we can all \nwork together to preserve the vitality of our third branch of \ngovernment and to instill even greater confidence in our federal \ncourts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the January 6, 2003 editorial from the \nWashington Post, and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and additional material was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                         Mr. Rehnquist's Pleas\n\n       Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist made two pleas in his \n     year-end report. Neither is much of a surprise, because on \n     both judicial salaries and the process by which judges get \n     nominated and confirmed Mr. Rehnquist has spoken before. Yet \n     familiarity should not obscure the importance of the \n     subjects. The chief justice is correct, and the failure year \n     after year of the political branches to remedy the problems \n     of which he complains is harmful.\n       Mr. Rehnquist once again stressed that the need to increase \n     judicial salaries is ``the most pressing issue'' facing the \n     courts. There is something demeaning about the chief justice \n     of the United States having to beg for the same cost-of-\n     living adjustments for judges that other federal employees \n     get as a matter of course. Congress's frequent failure in \n     recent years to increase judicial compensation contravenes \n     the promise it made in 1989, when it banned judges from \n     making outside income and promised regular raises in \n     exchange. Between 1969 and 2000, according to one study, real \n     salaries for lower-court judges declined by 25 percent. And \n     while judges got a raise last year, this year's cost-of-\n     living increase is, Mr. Rehnquist notes, very much in doubt.\n       The problem is that Congress has irrationally linked \n     judicial pay to the salaries of members of Congress, who face \n     a political problem whenever they seek to jack up their own \n     paychecks. The judges end up hostage to congressional \n     cowardice. This disparity between their salaries and other \n     lawyer compensation is enormous and growing. This encourages \n     judges to leave the bench, and provides a substantial \n     disincentive for first-rate people to become federal judges \n     in the first place.\n       Mr. Rehnquist also gave a timely reminder that the judicial \n     nominations process needs work. The chief justice is one of \n     the few people who has advocated for a reasonable process \n     irrespective of which party controls the presidency or the \n     Senate. So Mr. Rehnquist speaks with unusual moral authority \n     on this subject. And while he notes approvingly the 100 \n     judges the 107th Congress confirmed, he warns that the \n     problem has not gone away. Having unified government may \n     temporarily ease the vacancy problem, he writes, but `there \n     will come a time when [unified government] is not the case, \n     and the judiciary will again suffer the delays of a drawn-out \n     confirmation process.'' Mr. Rehnquist rightly urged that the \n     political branches use this respite to ``fix the underlying \n     problems that have bogged down the . . . process for so many \n     years.'' On both pay and nominations, one can only wonder how \n     many more years the chief justice will have to repeat himself \n     before reason prevails.\n\n                                 S. 787\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enable the United States to maintain its leadership \nin aeronautics and aviation; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to address a crucial issue \nthat is affecting our competitiveness in the world economy. Since that \nfirst flight in 1903 when the Wright brothers took off on our great \njourney, the United States has piloted the course of aerospace and \naviation technology development. Now that leading role is being \nthreatened. The European Union has embarked on an ambitious plan to \ndominate the industry that historically we have led. Last year, for the \nfirst time, Airbus surpassed Boeing, by grabbing 54 percent of the \nmarket share in terms of aircraft units.\n  Air travel is critical to our competitiveness in the global economy. \nThe movement of passengers and goods throughout our nation feeds \nAmerican business and keeps us close to our families and friends. The \nimpact of civil aviation on the U.S. economy exceeds $900 billion a \nyear, which is 9 percent of\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\nthe Gross National Product. In terms of jobs, civil aviation employs 11 \nmillion Americans. We can not sit idle as this important industry is \nthreatened.\n  To compete we must have the most advanced and safest technology; yet \nthe Air Traffic Management System in the United States is still reliant \non ground-based technology that was developed over 30 years ago. \nCongress, FAA, NASA and the aviation industry must work together to \nupdate this system to accommodate future aviation demand and to take \nadvantage of satellite navigation and advances in aircraft avionics. \nHistorically upgrades to air traffic management have been slow and \noften come in over budget. We must focus on creating the next \ngeneration of air traffic management technology in a more efficient and \neffective manner that will enhance safety and increase capacity.\n  Aerospace and aviation advancement are also dependent upon a well-\ntrained and skilled workforce. According to the Commission Report on \nAerospace, 26 percent of the science, engineering and manufacturing \nworkforce will be eligible to retire in the next five years. New \nentrants to the aerospace industry are at a historical low as the \nnumber of layoffs have increased. In order to maintain our dominance in \naerospace, we must continue to foster a qualified workforce.\n  Our international competitors have been persistent in providing \ngovernment support to aerospace research and aeronautical advancement. \nThe subsidies offered by our foreign competitors, hinder the U.S. \ncompanies that often bear the majority of the burden for research and \ndevelopment. In order to give our companies a competitive advantage and \nto ensure that advances in aviation and aerospace technology continue, \nCongress must invest ample resources in fundamental aeronautical \nresearch. The President's FY 04 budget proposal cuts investment in FAA \nand NASA research, engineering and development. This will only hasten \nour descent in this industry. During this time of competing interests \nfor the Federal dollar we cannot be too quick to divest ourselves from \nneeded research that will renew our aviation business and maintain our \nglobal dominance.\n\n  To turn an idea into a product, the process is often tedious and \nlong. NASA and FAA must promote technological advancement and enable \nAmerican industry to bring their products to market. Collaboration with \ngovernment and industry is critical to ensure that research efforts \nlead to viable products that will enhance our aerospace and aviation \nindustry.\n  As we reflect on the last 100 years of advancement in the aviation \nand aerospace fields we cannot help to be proud of our accomplishments. \nBut, we cannot afford to be content with those successes. We must look \nhigher, faster, and farther than we have before--that is the American \nprerogative. And so with the help of my colleagues Senators Brownback, \nRockefeller, Inouye, Cantwell and Kerry, I have crafted legislation to \nincrease aeronautical research, nurture our industry's workforce, and \nensure a collaborative partnership between government and private \nindustry with the goal of ensuring the ``Second Century of Flight'' is \nas exciting and awe inspiring as the first.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Nelson of Florida (for himself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 789. A bill to change the requirements for naturalization through \nservice in the Armed Forces of the United States; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON, of Florida. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and \nMrs. Boxer to introduce the Citizenship for Service Members Act of \n2003. This legislation reduces the waiting period for service members \nduring peace time from 3 years to 2 years, waives all fees related to \nnaturalization, and allows for naturalization proceedings to occur \noverseas.\n  Everyday now we see our young men and women fighting and dying in \nIraq and Afghanistan to protect freedom and democracy. One of the \nstrengths of our military has always been its diversity. From the birth \nof our Nation, our military has attracted people from all walks of life \nincluding people who have immigrated to the United States to pursue \nfreedom, prosperity, and security.\n  Young men and women join the military in the hopes of achieving a \nbetter life while serving our country in the most difficult and \nhonorable way. These young people enjoy various benefits for \nvolunteering to protect American citizens such as assistance with \ncollege tuition, a secure and rewarding career in the military, and for \nsome, the hope of gaining American citizenship.\n  Non-citizens fighting in our military side by side with American \ncitizens is a tradition that dates back to the Civil War, when recently \narrived Irish immigrants fought for the Union. After World Wars I and \nII over 140,000 legal permanent resident participants gained \ncitizenship. Currently there are 3,400 legal permanent residents in the \nMarines alone who have been deployed overseas. Further, Miami, FL and \nLos Angeles, CA contribute the second and third highest number of legal \npermanent residents to the military.\n  Under current law, in the absence of an Executive Order eliminating \nthe time of service requirement altogether, men and women may apply for \ncitizenship after completing three years of service. This legislation \nwould shorten that period to 2 years making it more likely that the \nservice member will gain citizenship prior to finishing his first \nenlistment. Additionally, this legislation waives all fees related to \nnaturalization eliminating a possible financial barrier. Finally, this \nbill allows for service members to complete the naturalization process \noverseas eliminating the sometimes unnecessarily lengthy and expensive \ntrips back to the United States.\n  Citizenship is a momentous honor and the ultimate goal of nearly \nevery person who immigrates to the United States. Naturalization is \nespecially critical to the thousands of young men and women who are \nplacing their lives at risk every day to defend the citizens and ideals \nof the United States. These men and women desire citizenship so that \nthey can become a recognized member of the country that they have \nchosen to defend.\n  In addition, citizenship confers certain benefits upon servicemen and \nwomen. For example, while a legal permanent resident may enlist in the \nUnited States military, he or she is barred from becoming a \ncommissioned officer, obtaining positions that require security \nclearances, becoming a part of any aircrews or rising to the level of \nspecial operations.\n  We continue to see the great sacrifices these young men and women \nmake on a daily basis. There is no greater show of patriotism than to \njoin our armed forces and fight under the American flag. Over 30,000 \nmen and women from countries ranging from Canada to Japan to Cuba have \nvolunteered to put their lives on the line to defend the United States. \nWe owe it to these brave men and women to help them obtain the \ncitizenship they have clearly earned.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 789\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

COMPLEX FOREIGN CONTINGENCIES.\n\n       (a) Purposes.--The President should ensure that assistance \n     provided to address complex foreign crises is designed to \n     respond on an urgent, flexible basis, including at the \n     outset, to mitigate without regard to scale of the crisis, \n     but taking account of the gravity of the crises, political \n     crises threatening democratic institutions, food, \n     agricultural or health crises, fiscal or economic crises \n     affecting countries, regions or ethnic groups. The response \n     should be designed to best serve United States foreign policy \n     interests, including the restoration or maintenance of peace \n     and security.\n       (b) Whenever the President determines it to be important to \n     the national interest he is authorized to furnish on such \n     terms and conditions as he may determine assistance under \n     this section for the purpose of responding to complex foreign \n     crises.\n       (c) There is hereby established a United States Complex \n     Foreign Contingency Fund to carry out the purposes of this \n     section. There is authorized to be appropriated to the \n     President from time to time such amounts as may be necessary \n     for the fund to carry out the purposes of this section, which \n     may be made available notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law. Amounts appropriated hereunder shall remain available \n     until expended.\n\n                           SECTIONAL ANALYSES\n\n                TITLE I--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS\n\n     SEC. 101. ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.\n\n       This section authorizes appropriations under the heading \n     ``Administration of Foreign Affairs'' for fiscal years 2004 \n     and 2005. It includes funds for executive direction and \n     policy formulation, conduct of diplomatic relations with \n     foreign governments and international organizations, \n     effective implementation of consular programs and its border \n     security component, the acquisition and maintenance of office \n     space and living quarters for the United States missions \n     abroad, provision of security for those operations, and \n     information resource management.\n       In particular, this section provides authorization of \n     appropriations for the necessary expenses of the Department \n     of State and the Foreign Service, not otherwise provided for, \n     including expenses authorized by the State Department Basic \n     Authorities Act. These expenses include an authorization for \n     worldwide security upgrades. This section also includes \n     authorization of appropriations for the conduct of U.S. \n     public diplomacy programs, capital investment, \n     representation, protection of foreign missions and officials, \n     emergencies in the diplomatic and consular service, \n     repatriation loans, and payment to the American Institute in \n     Taiwan. This section includes the funding for the final year \n     of the Department's Diplomatic Readiness Initiative aimed to \n     hire 1158 additional employees beyond attrition over a three-\n     year period to fill our staffing gaps (particularly in \n     critical overseas positions), provide a ``personnel \n     complement'' to allow for training, and respond quickly to \n     crises and emerging policy priorities.\n\n     SEC. 102. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CONFERENCES.\n\n       This section authorizes appropriations for fiscal years \n     2004 and 2005 under the heading ``International Organizations \n     and Conferences.'' It authorizes the necessary funds for U.S. \n     contributions of its assessed share of the expenses of the \n     United Nations and other international organizations of which \n     the United States is a member. In addition, provision is made \n     for assessed contributions to international peacekeeping \n     activities under United Nations auspices.\n       This section also authorizes such sums as may be necessary \n     for each of the fiscal years 2004 and 2005 to offset adverse \n     fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n     SEC. 103. INTERNATIONAL COMMISSIONS.\n\n       This section authorizes appropriations for fiscal years \n     2004 and 2005 under the heading ``International \n     Commissions.'' It authorizes funds necessary to enable the \n     United States to meet its obligations as a participant in \n     international commissions, including those dealing with \n     American boundaries and related matters with Canada and \n     Mexico, and international fisheries commissions.\n\n     SEC. 104. MIGRATION AND REFUGEE ASSISTANCE.\n\n       This section authorizes appropriations for fiscal years \n     2004 and 2005 under the heading ``Migration and Refugee \n     Assistance'' to enable the Secretary of State to provide \n     assistance and make contributions for migrants and refugees, \n     including contributions to international organizations such \n     as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the \n     International Committee for the Red Cross, through private \n     volunteer agencies, governments, and bilateral assistance, as \n     authorized by law.\n\n     SEC. 105. CENTERS AND FOUNDATIONS.\n\n       This section authorizes appropriations for fiscal years \n     2004 and 2005 for the East-West Center, the National \n     Endowment for Democracy, and the Asia Foundation.\n\n        TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF STATE AUTHORITIES AND ACTIVITIES\n\n     SEC. 201. REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR AIRLIFT SERVICES PROVIDED TO \n                   THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.\n\n       The Department of Defense provides a variety of airlift \n     support for official Secretary of State overseas travel on a \n     reimbursable basis. The airlift mission involves, for \n     example, transporting armored vehicles necessary to provide a \n     safe environment for the Secretary, when such vehicles are \n     not available in country. The Department of Defense has a \n     two-tiered rate structure for charging for such support. At \n     present the Department of State is paying the higher rate, \n     which is nearly twice as much as the lower. This section \n     would authorize the Department of State to pay the Department \n     of Defense for airlift services at the Department of Defense \n     rate.\n       Legislation has already been enacted under which the CIA \n     receives the Department of Defense rate on missions, which \n     the Secretary of Defense has determined to be related to \n     national security objectives (10 U.S.C. 2642). The Secretary \n     of State's travel is similarly aimed at national security \n     objectives, and similar treatment is therefore warranted. \n     This section would therefore amend 10 U.S.C. 2642 to add the \n     Department of State.\n\n     SEC. 202. GRANT AUTHORITY TO PROMOTE BIOTECHNOLOGY.\n\n       The Department plays a critical role in U.S. Government \n     efforts to ensure that foreign governments consider \n     biotechnology and its applications in agriculture/food on the \n     basis of science. Currently, the Department does not have \n     grant authority for funds that the Bureau of Economic and \n     Business Affairs (EB) receives for biotechnology policy \n     programs and for the Business Financial Incentive Fund. \n     Unlike a contractual arrangement, where a contractor provides \n     a good or service to the governmental agency in return for \n     payment, the grant process allows the government and the \n     grantee to enter into a partnership to achieve a shared \n     objective that serves the public good. Grant and cooperative \n     agreement authority would enable the Department to use these \n     funds more effectively, permitting it to work more directly \n     with universities, non-governmental organizations, \n     international organizations, private voluntary organizations, \n     scientific groups, and private sector associations. It is \n     anticipated that grants and cooperative agreements, as well \n     as contracts, would be used to support public-private \n     partnerships, workshops, seminars, media events, speaker \n     programs, and publications. The Department will implement \n     this authority in compliance with applicable statutory and \n     regulatory guidelines governing grants and cooperative \n     agreements. This section provides for up to $500,000 in grant \n     authority each fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 203. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FACILITIES.\n\n       In recent years, the Department has experienced a need to \n     stand up a diplomatic facility on very short notice to \n     achieve urgent, high-visibility foreign policy objectives. \n     The most dramatic cases were the situations in Nairobi, \n     Kenya, and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, immediately after the \n     1998 bombings. A recent example is the immediate temporary \n     facilities in Kabul in the aftermath of the war. Other \n     circumstances demanding immediate action would include, for \n     example, destruction or incapacitation of a U.S. diplomatic \n     facility by a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, or a war \n     or insurrection to which the U.S. is not a party. To ensure \n     that the Department has the flexibility to respond rapidly in \n     emergency situations, this section would provide that not to \n     exceed $15,000,000 of the funds appropriated under the \n     heading ``Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance'' \n     may be reprogrammed to provide immediate response facilities \n     without having to provide advance congressional notification \n     pursuant to any other provision of law, including but not \n     limited to section 34(a) of the State Department Basic \n     Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2706). In such instances \n     where advance notification would otherwise be required, the \n     Department is required to notify and provide an explanation \n     of the circumstances requiring the deployment of immediate \n     response facilities to the Committee on Appropriations and \n     the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations and the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate as soon as \n     practicable, but not later than 3 days after the obligation \n     or expenditure of such funds. This post-notification \n     procedure is similar to the one provided for in Section 34(c) \n     of the Basic Authorities Act of 1956 for situations involving \n     substantial risk to human health or welfare.\n       This authority will not be used to circumvent advance \n     notification where a facility is not an immediately-needed \n     response to an urgent situation. It will be used for existing \n     posts or facilities, but not to stand up a new post or commit \n     initial funds toward a long-term project, such as \n     construction of a New Embassy Compound. Thus, for example, \n     had this authority existed at the time of the war in \n     Afghanistan, it would have been appropriately used for the \n     Phase 1 immediate temporary facilities, but not for the Phase \n     2 embassy annex and reconstruction.\n\n     SEC. 204. MINE ACTION PROGRAMS GRANT AUTHORITY.\n\n       The Department, through its Office of Mine Action \n     Initiatives and Partnerships (PM/MAIP), is actively working \n     with non-governmental organizations, foundations, and \n     companies to raise awareness and resources for mine action. \n     In particular, the\n\n[[Page S4850]]\n\n     Department has developed over two dozen public-private \n     partnerships which promote mine clearance; survivors \n     assistance, education programs, and research and development \n     of promising technologies for finding and destroying \n     landmines. To maximize the effectiveness of these public-\n     private partnerships, it is important that the Department \n     have the ability to enter into grants and cooperative \n     agreements. Unlike a contractual arrangement, where a \n     contractor provides a good or service to the governmental \n     agency in return for payment, the grant process allows the \n     government and the grantee to enter into a partnership to \n     achieve a shared objective that serves the public good. This \n     section provides for up to $450,000 in grant authority each \n     fiscal year.\n       By being able to provide grants and enter into cooperative \n     agreements with organizations participating in the public-\n     private partnership program, the Department would be able to \n     provide support to such private sector projects as training \n     demining personnel and mine-detecting dogs; developing \n     training materials and mine risk education materials that \n     teach children and adults about how to recognize, report, and \n     avoid landmines; and research and development into new \n     technologies to increase the effectiveness and speed of \n     detecting and removing landmines. To the maximum extent \n     feasible, grants and cooperative agreements would be used to \n     support mine action activities of non-governmental \n     organizations. The Department will implement this authority \n     in compliance with all statutory and regulatory guidelines \n     governing grants and cooperative agreements.\n\n     SEC. 205. THE U.S. DIPLOMACY CENTER.\n\n       This section would provide necessary authorities for the \n     operation of the new U.S. Diplomacy Center at the Department \n     of State. As envisioned, this Center would be dedicated to \n     creating a better understanding of the history and practice \n     of United States diplomacy. The Center would organize and \n     sponsor educational and outreach programs, including \n     conferences, seminars, and educational materials. It would \n     also include a museum area, focusing on the history of U.S. \n     diplomacy in safeguarding U.S. security, searching for peace, \n     increasing prosperity, promoting U.S. values, and protecting \n     U.S. lives abroad. As is customary in connection with such \n     activities, the Center should include appropriate visitor \n     services such as a museum shop, and should be able to pay for \n     reasonable expenses in connection with conferences and \n     outreach activities, such as refreshments and travel of \n     participants. This legislation would provide clear statutory \n     authority in these areas. Authority is also provided to \n     retain fees to support the Center's activities. It would also \n     include authority to dispose and lend museum artifacts and \n     materials, similar to the authority already provided to the \n     Department of State for the Diplomatic Reception Areas on the \n     seventh and eighth floors of the Harry S Truman Building. \n     Consistent with the Code of Ethics for Museums of the \n     American Association of Museums, the legislation provides \n     that proceeds from disposition of museum holdings can only be \n     used for collection purposes. This section also provides \n     that, except as may be identified subject to reprogramming \n     procedures, the Bureau of Public Affairs may not expend more \n     than $950,000 in fiscal year 2004 and such sums as may. be \n     necessary in fiscal year 2005 for the U.S. Diplomacy Center.\n\n     SEC. 206. PUBLIC AFFAIRS GRANT AUTHORITY.\n\n       The Department is actively pursuing outreach programs \n     designed to educate the American public about foreign affairs \n     issues and the development and implementation of foreign \n     policy. In particular, the Bureau of Public Affairs is \n     working with a number of nonprofit organizations (such as \n     academic institutions of higher learning, \n     organizations representing associations of American \n     educators, local organizations or community groups, and \n     broadcasting entities) in order to reach different sectors \n     of the domestic audience.\n       In certain situations, a grant or cooperative agreement is \n     a more appropriate vehicle than a contractual agreement to \n     meet the Department's goals. Unlike a contractual \n     arrangement, where a contractor provides a good or service to \n     the governmental agency in return for payment, the grant \n     process allows the government and the grantee to enter into a \n     partnership to achieve a shared objective that serves a \n     public good. In this case, the shared purpose is to educate \n     the American public on foreign affairs matters in a factual \n     and fair manner.\n       The Department would continue to use its existing contract \n     authority for many activities and would exercise authority to \n     enter into grants and cooperative agreements only in those \n     limited instances where appropriate. The Department will \n     implement this authority in compliance with applicable \n     statutory and regulatory guidelines governing grants and \n     cooperative agreements.\n\n    TITLE III: ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n\n     SEC. 301. COST OF LIVING ALLOWANCES.\n\n       The proposed changes to the education allowance in 5 U.S.C. \n     5924(4) would: (1) allow for educational travel to the United \n     States for children in kindergarten through 12th grade, when \n     schools at post are not adequate; (2) allow for educational \n     travel to a school outside the United States for children at \n     the secondary and college level; (3) provide for educational \n     travel at the graduate level for children who are still \n     dependents; (4) permit payment of fees required by overseas \n     schools for successful completion of a course or grade; and \n     (5) allow the option of storing a child's personal effects \n     near the school during their trip home, rather than \n     transporting it back and forth.\n       Currently, when families are serving in a post without \n     adequate local school facilities, the law allows for \n     transportation of children in kindergarten through 12th grade \n     to the nearest place where there is adequate education. For \n     instance, if an employee is assigned to Guinea-Bissau, \n     transportation for his/her dependents is calculated based on \n     hub-points in Europe (London and Rome). This causes \n     significant financial hardships for families, who are often \n     serving in the most difficult overseas assignments, and whose \n     children are in school in the United States. By changing the \n     wording of the law to allow transportation back to the United \n     States, the transportation component will ensure that parents \n     can afford to send their children to the United States for an \n     American education.\n       On the other hand, when a child has reached the secondary \n     or post-secondary level, aside from a limited exception, \n     current law allows payment for travel only to and from a \n     school in the United States. This amendment would permit \n     transportation to schools outside the United States as well. \n     It would also allow educational travel at the post-\n     baccalaureate level, when a child is still a dependent but \n     has graduated from college. This would be consistent with \n     what is allowed for military member dependents.\n       Overseas schools frequently require participation in \n     programs that would not fall into the category of \n     expenses considered ``ordinarily provided without charge \n     in the United States,'' as described in 5 U.S.C. \n     5924(4)(A). For example, students may be required to \n     participate in a cultural studies program that may include \n     mandatory field trips. The proposed amendment would allow \n     associated costs to be paid with the education allowance.\n       Finally, the proposed amendment would allow for local \n     storage of a child's effects in lieu of transporting them \n     back and forth during school closings for students in \n     kindergarten and elementary school as well as higher levels \n     of education, provided that payment for local storage would \n     not exceed the cost of transport. Section 319 of the FY 2003 \n     Foreign Relations Authorization Act (P.L. 107-228) added this \n     option for educational travel under 5 U.S.C. 5924(4)(B), and \n     this amendment would extend the option to educational travel \n     under 5 U.S.C. 5924(4)(A).\n       In addition, this section makes technical amendments \n     including Puerto Rico as part of the ``United States,'' \n     eliminating language referring to the Canal Zone, and \n     removing a reference to an irrelevant statute.\n\n     SEC. 302. WAIVER OF ANNUITY LIMITATIONS ON RE-EMPLOYED \n                   FOREIGN SERVICE ANNUITANTS.\n\n       Foreign Service annuitants hired on a full-time basis have \n     their annuities terminated. Those employed on a parttime, \n     intermittent or temporary basis face a cap on the total sum \n     of their salary and their retirement annuity. The ``dual \n     compensation restrictions'' on Foreign Service annuitants, \n     many of whom have unique experience and talents, hamper the \n     Department's ability to hire these individuals to meet \n     mission needs. This section amends the Foreign Service Act to \n     allow the Secretary of State and heads of other relevant \n     agencies to waive these restrictions for positions for which \n     there is exceptional difficulty in recruiting or retaining a \n     qualified employee.\n       Section 824(g) of the Foreign Service Act was last amended \n     in 1988 to authorize the Secretary to waive the annuity \n     limitations on re-employed Foreign Service annuitants on a \n     case by case basis if the annuitant is reemployed on a \n     temporary basis due to an emergency involving a direct threat \n     to life or property or other unusual circumstances. This \n     amendment extended to the 10 Foreign Service a waiver \n     authority that had existed and currently exists for the Civil \n     Service.\n       Subsection (a) again seeks to amend section 824(g) of the \n     Foreign Service Act, and again to extend a waiver authority \n     to the Foreign Service that already exists for the Civil \n     Service. It would provide the Secretary authority to waive \n     the annuity limitations for annuitants reemployed on a \n     temporary basis in positions for which it is exceptionally \n     difficult to recruit or retain qualified employees. This \n     authority, which we do not expect to be used very often, \n     would better enable the Department to recruit and retain. \n     highly qualified persons necessary, for example, to meet our \n     mission needs in the war on terrorism and in our public \n     diplomacy efforts.\n       Subsection (b) indicates that effective October 1, 2005, \n     section 824(g) will revert to its current form.\n\n     SEC. 303. FELLOWSHIP OF HOPE PROGRAM.\n\n       This section clarifies the authority underlying a current \n     exchange program between the foreign affairs agencies of the \n     United States, the European Union, and its member states, \n     created to promote collaboration among its young leaders. \n     Under this very successful program, Foreign Service officers \n     are identified on an annual basis to serve one-year details \n     at the European Union in Brussels and designated European \n     foreign ministries. After the Foreign Service Officers \n     complete the details at the EU or in the foreign ministries, \n     they are assigned to a position in the U.S. embassy in the \n     relevant\n\n[[Page S4851]]\n\n     European capital. Conversely, the State Department also will \n     receive members of the diplomatic corps from the European \n     Union and designated foreign ministries. While the present \n     program is limited to EU members, it may be that this program \n     could be extended to other designated countries.\n       This provision renders moot a potential legal concern under \n     the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution (Article 1, section \n     9, clause 8). The Emoluments Clause provides that no person \n     holding an office of profit or trust under the United States \n     may, without the consent of Congress, accept an emolument \n     from a foreign state. Under the Fellowship of Hope program, \n     diplomats from the Commission and designated foreign \n     countries accept an emolument from a foreign state through \n     the course of compensation by their own government. \n     However, these diplomats are also holding an office of \n     profit or trust in the U.S. government. Explicit \n     Congressional authority for the exchange program would \n     obviate any issue regarding the Emoluments Clause.\n       The Secretary will be responsible for administering this \n     program consistent with the national security and the foreign \n     policy interests of the United States. In particular, it \n     should be noted that information security considerations have \n     been carefully considered in the implementation of this \n     exchange program. Moreover, the Secretary will consult with \n     the Department of Justice or the Central Intelligence Agency, \n     as appropriate, to meet these responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 304. CLAIMS FOR LOST PAY.\n\n       This section clarifies the Department's authority to make \n     technical corrections or enter into settlements of claims or \n     grievances brought by its employees involving lost pay, \n     allowances, or differentials. These complaints may involve \n     simple technical ``glitches'' in the payment of salary or \n     benefits, for which the Department (like other agencies) \n     routinely retroactively corrects the payment or makes a \n     payment as appropriate. Administrative adjustments also may \n     be required in order, for example, that a member of the \n     Foreign Service is made whole in connection with a \n     retroactive promotion.\n       In addition, the Department routinely settles non-Title VII \n     claims brought by Civil Service employees before the Merit \n     Systems Protection Board, or those brought by Foreign Service \n     employees before the Foreign Service Grievance Board. In \n     settling or compromising such claims, the normal authority \n     for the payment of back pay would be the Back Pay Act (5 \n     U.S.C. 5596). However, as is the case with most settlements, \n     the Department does not usually make any admission as to \n     liability, and therefore does not make a finding of an \n     unwarranted or unjustified personnel action under the \n     provisions of the Back Pay Act. This section would make clear \n     that no such finding would be necessary in the event of a \n     settlement or compromise of a claim or grievance which \n     otherwise is in accordance with all provisions of the Back \n     Pay Act.\n       The Department is seeking this provision as clarification \n     to resolve back pay claims consistent with the spirit of \n     conciliation that underlies settlements generally. This \n     provision is not meant to question the current ability of \n     agencies to settle claims without admitting fault.\n\n     SEC. 305. SUSPENSION OR ENFORCED LEAVE.\n\n       This amendment brings the Foreign Service into parity with \n     the Civil Service. Current statutes, in particular, 5 U.S.C. \n     7512 and 7513, permit an indefinite suspension or enforced \n     leave of an employee during an investigation into the \n     revocation of a security clearance, where a security \n     clearance has been suspended, where there is reasonable cause \n     to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a \n     sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, or for such other \n     cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. The due \n     process requirements in this amendment are the same as those \n     afforded Civil Service employees.\n       ``Reasonable cause'' may include, but is not limited to, an \n     indictment or circumstances attendant to an arrest or \n     investigation conducted by the Department or criminal law \n     enforcement authorities. The Board is substantially \n     constrained in what it may review with respect to suspensions \n     and enforced leave authorized by this amendment. The Board \n     will not, for example, have the authority to review the \n     merits of any security clearance revocation investigation, \n     which triggers a suspension under this amendment. In \n     reviewing any suspension or enforced leave under this \n     amendment, it is the Department's expectation that the \n     considerable body of law interpreting 5 U.S.C. sections 7512 \n     and 7513 will guide the Board. Decisions as to whether or not \n     to grant the employee back pay upon the resolution of the \n     underlying matter will be at the discretion of the \n     Department. Under no circumstance may the Board grant \n     prescriptive relief with respect to an indefinite suspension \n     or enforced leave.\n\n     SEC. 306. HOME LEAVE.\n\n       This section reduces the time period for eligibility for \n     home leave from 18 to 12 months. In addition, this amendment \n     provides that members may take authorized rest and \n     recuperation travel under section 4081(6) even if they take \n     accrued, unused home leave authorized by this amendment. \n     This would ensure that eligibility for R would not be \n     affected if someone took home leave while on other travel \n     to the United States.\n       The effect of these two amendments will be to facilitate \n     members to take home leave during tours of duty (including at \n     R posts) rather than at the end of their tours of duty as \n     is the Department's current practice. The Department does not \n     plan, however, to change its current policies related to the \n     authorization of home leave travel, i.e., that members take \n     home leave normally at the end of a two-year tour or at the \n     midpoint of a four-year tour. This amendment simply provides \n     some flexibility.\n\n     SEC. 307. OMBUDSMAN FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.\n\n       In section 172 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, \n     FY 1988 and 1989 (P.L. 100-204), the Congress expressed its \n     objective that the contributions of Civil Service employees \n     to the Department of State would not be overlooked and would \n     be adequately protected. It therefore established an \n     Ombudsman for Civil Service Employees in the Office of the \n     Secretary. This section is intended to enhance the \n     responsibilities of the Ombudsman to better serve the \n     Department's mission.\n       This provision further ensures that the Ombudsman would \n     continue to report directly to the Secretary, and will have \n     the ability to participate in meetings regarding management \n     of the Department in order to be able to protect the \n     interests of all Department employees.\n\n     SEC. 308. REPEAL OF RECERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT FOR SENIOR \n                   FOREIGN SERVICE.\n\n       This section repeals the provision in the Foreign Service \n     Act that requires the Secretary to establish a \n     recertification requirement for members of the Senior Foreign \n     Service (SFS) that is equivalent to the recertification \n     process for the Senior Executive Service (SES).\n       In section 1321 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. \n     107-296), the Congress repealed the recertification 14 \n     requirements for SES employees contained in title 5 of the \n     United States Code. The rationale was that these periodic \n     recertification requirements for the SES did not serve a \n     useful purpose. We believe the same rationale applies to the \n     SFS.\n\n                 TITLE IV--INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS\n\n     SEC. 401 RAISING THE CAP ON PEACEKEEPING CONTRIBUTIONS.\n\n       This provision would set at 27.1% for calendar years 2004 \n     and 2005 the cap on UN peacekeeping assessments. This would \n     allow the United States to pay its peacekeeping assessment in \n     full in 2004 and 2005. This provision will allow us to avoid \n     accruing future peacekeeping arrears.\n\n                TITLE V--SUPPORTING THE WAR ON TERRORISM\n\n     SEC. 501. DESIGNATION OF FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       Overview: This section amends section 219 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA'') (8 U.S.C. 1189), \n     authorizing the Secretary of State, in consultation with the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury (the \n     ``Secretary''), to designate foreign terrorist organizations \n     (``FTOs''), in order to improve the statutory designation \n     procedures. It eliminates the statute's redesignation \n     provision, requiring the Secretary instead to review FTO \n     designations regularly, and it adds a procedure for amending \n     designations.\n       Amending the Redesignation Requirement: The Duration of \n     Designation provision removes the requirement for the \n     Secretary to redesignate FTOs every two years for \n     designations to remain in effect. It permits an FTO \n     designation to remain in effect until it is revoked by an Act \n     of Congress or by the Secretary or set aside by the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n       The Review of Designation upon Petition provision requires \n     the Secretary to review the designation of an FTO if a \n     designated organization petitions the Secretary for \n     revocation once two years have elapsed from the date of its \n     designation. It also requires such review if an organization \n     files another petition once two years have elapsed from the \n     date of its last petition. This provision requires the \n     Secretary to issue a determination on a petition for \n     revocation within 180 days. It also permits an organization \n     to petition for judicial review of the Secretary's \n     determination within 30 days after that determination is \n     published in the Federal Register.\n       The Other Review of Designation provision requires the \n     Secretary to review the designation of each FTO at least once \n     every four years in order to determine whether it should be \n     revoked, even if the organization does not submit a petition \n     for revocation. Absent such a petition, this automatic review \n     would be completed according to procedures to be developed by \n     the Secretary, and there would be no judicial review. This \n     periodic review is intended as an 17 automatic check on the \n     continued vitality of a designation, even in the absence of a \n     petition for revocation by the designated organization.\n       With 36 FTOs designated as of March 2003, and others on the \n     way to designation, the demands that the current statutory \n     requirement to redesignate organizations every two years \n     imposes on the interagency counterterrorism workforce are \n     great. Each redesignation requires an interagency review \n     process and preparation of an administrative record that can \n     take months. The time demands associated with proving \n     repeatedly\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\n     that terrorist groups have retained their character as \n     terrorists significantly drain resources from other pressing \n     counterterrorism work, including the pursuit of additional \n     designations pursuant to section 219 of the INA, section \n     212(a)(3)(B) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182) (designation of \n     terrorist organizations for immigration purposes), and \n     Executive Order 13224 (terrorist financing).\n       The proposed changes would streamline the current \n     procedures and permit a more effective use of USG resources, \n     while ensuring that the Secretary would regularly review an \n     organization's designation to determine if it should be \n     revoked. The terrorist threat we face has increased greatly \n     since section 219 was enacted in 1996, and now more than \n     ever, the USG needs to marshal its counterterrorism resources \n     as efficiently as possible.\n       Aliases: Section 219 does not contain any explicit \n     statutory authority or guidance for making additional alias \n     designations after an organization is designated as an FTO. \n     In designating FTOs, the Secretary of State routinely lists \n     the names of the designated entities together with their \n     aliases, a practice that has been upheld by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. \n     Recently, certain groups that have been designated as FTOs \n     have changed their names in an effort to evade asset freezing \n     and other consequences of designation. Some FTOs have \n     dissolved and reconstituted themselves under a different name \n     or names, or merged with other organizations, even while \n     retaining the capability and intent to engage in terrorist \n     activity or terrorism. The difficulty of identifying all of \n     an organization's aliases also can slow down the process of \n     designating an organization as an FTO, creating unnecessary \n     delays that weaken an otherwise powerful tool for combating \n     international terrorism.\n       This section would enhance the effectiveness and efficiency \n     of the designation process by adding explicit, streamlined \n     procedures for adding new aliases to an underlying \n     designation. It would allow the Secretary, or the Secretary's \n     designee if the Secretary subsequently delegates that \n     authority, to amend the existing administrative record for an \n     organization's designation, rather than requiring the \n     Secretary to create an additional administrative record in \n     support of the amendment.\n       This section would require the Secretary of State (or the \n     Secretary's designee if the Secretary delegates that \n     authority) to make amendments in consultation with the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury (or their \n     designees if they delegate that authority), ensuring that \n     amendments reflect the expertise of Justice and Treasury. \n     Because it is a criminal offence to provide material support \n     or resources to a designated FTO, and because of the asset \n     blocking consequences of FTO designation, it is important \n     that designations be made in consultation with Justice and \n     Treasury. An organization covered by any such amendment also \n     would have the ability to seek judicial review of the \n     amendment or submit a petition to the Secretary for \n     revocation of an amendment.\n\n                     TITLE VI--SECURITY ASSISTANCE\n\n     SEC. 601. RESTRICTIONS ON ECONOMIC SUPPORT FUNDS (ESF) FOR \n                   LEBANON.\n\n       The annual restriction that $10M of the ESF designated for \n     Lebanon be withheld from central government until the \n     President certifies their armed forces effectively assert \n     authority over Lebanon's southern border accomplishes little \n     beyond reducing the amount of ESF available to that country. \n     Since none of our ESF assistance monies go directly to the \n     government, but rather to NGOs, this restriction serves \n     neither as a carrot nor a stick from the perspective of the \n     Lebanese government. Rather, this provision restricts our \n     ability to promote democracy and economic development \n     precisely when we have a strong interest in helping Lebanon \n     rebuild its institutions. We believe that using this money in \n     water projects in southern Lebanon will help defuse Lebanese-\n     Israeli tensions and would directly support USG efforts to \n     assure careful management of scarce water resources. Amending \n     this section to allow this funding to be used for water \n     projects would provide more transparency to Lebanese water \n     management and thereby more comfort to Israel, than would be \n     done by keeping this funding in escrow.\n\n     SEC. 602. THRESHOLDS FOR CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION OF FMS \n                   AND COMMERCIAL ARMS TRANSFERS.\n\n       This section reflects the need for meaningfully increasing \n     the congressional notification thresholds for arms sales and \n     exports beyond the relatively modest increases for NATO and \n     Japan, Australia and New Zealand enacted in section 1404 of \n     the FY 2003 Foreign Relations Authorization Act. These recent \n     increases will only minimally reduce the number of \n     congressional notifications required and will, therefore, \n     result in the continued notification of what are often rather \n     insignificant sales of defense articles or services, \n     particularly since the recent threshold increases apply to so \n     few countries.\n       The proposed revision would in effect repeal the modest \n     increases enacted last year and substitute in their place new \n     notification thresholds for defense sales and \n     exports applicable to all countries as follows: \n     $100,000,000 for Major Defense Equipment; $200,000,000 for \n     other defense articles and services; and, $500,000,000 for \n     design and construction services, sold via Foreign \n     Military Sales. The Administration plans to enhance its \n     process for consultation on cases of lesser value that may \n     nonetheless be sensitive in order to ensure an opportunity \n     for Congressional input and oversight. In that regard, the \n     Administration would be prepared to an exchange of letters \n     with the chairs and ranking members of the SFRC and the \n     HIRC, indicating that we would notify cases of concern to \n     the committees even though they might be of a lesser value \n     than the higher thresholds proposed by in this amendment.\n\n     SEC. 603. BILATERAL AGREEMENT REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO \n                   LICENSING OF DEFENSE EXPORTS.\n\n       The Security Assistance Act of 2000 converted into a legal \n     requirement the policy which set as a prerequisite for a \n     foreign country qualifying for a country exemption from \n     defense export licensing that the country have entered into a \n     binding bilateral agreement committing it to apply specific \n     defense export controls comparable to those of the United \n     States. Fundamental differences between U.S. law and the \n     legal regimes of the two countries with which the U.S. \n     commenced negotiations in July 2000, Australia and the U.K., \n     have proven that the specific commitments required by the law \n     are in many instances too strict or specific, making it very \n     difficult, if not impossible, to conclude an agreement that \n     will satisfy all the Act's requirements.\n       To overcome this undue constraint on the President's \n     otherwise extremely flexible authorities to control \n     commercial defense trade, it is imperative, at very least, \n     that appropriate legislative relief be provided. The \n     amendment would allow the President to waive any of the law's \n     specific requirements for the agreement. This would give the \n     Administration, in this case the State Department, latitude \n     to conclude the best agreements that are achievable, and that \n     represent in its judgment sufficient significant improvements \n     in a country's defense export regulatory regime so as to \n     justify extending an exemption from U.S. defense export \n     licensing requirements. A second proposed revision would \n     narrow the scope of the commitments required of a foreign \n     country, to comport more with reasonable expectations that a \n     country would be 21 required to apply its enhanced defense \n     export controls mainly to U.S. origin defense items that are \n     exempt from U.S. licensing, which are harder to keep track \n     of, versus those items in that country that are subject to \n     U.S. licenses.\n\n     SEC. 604. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Subsection (a) authorizes $4,414,000,000 for fiscal year \n     2004 and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2005 \n     for Foreign Military Financing (``FMF'').\n       Subsection (b) authorizes $91,700,000 for fiscal year 2004 \n     and such sums as may be necessary for Fiscal Year 2005 for \n     the International Military Education and Training (IMET) \n     program. This requested level of funding for 2004 is an \n     increase of $6,700,000 over the Congress' authorization of \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2003 and reflects the \n     Administration's strong support for the IMET program.\n       Subsection (c) authorizes $385,200,000 for fiscal year 2004 \n     and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2005 for \n     ``Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining, and Related \n     Programs.''\n\n     SEC. 605. COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION PERMANENT WAIVER.\n\n       This section provides a permanent annual waiver for the \n     restrictions contained in subsection (d) of 22 U.S.C. 5952 \n     and the requirements of section 502 of the Freedom Support \n     Act (Public Law 102-511). Section 1306 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for FY 2003 (Public Law 107-314) \n     provided authorization for an annual waiver only for Fiscal \n     Years 2003 through 2005. This permanent annual waiver would \n     ensure continuity for program planning purposes.\n\n     SEC. 606. CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION FOR COMPREHENSIVE \n                   DEFENSE EXPORT AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       This provision amends section 36(d) of the Arms Export \n     Control Act to require congressional defense export \n     notifications for comprehensive defense export \n     authorizations. Specifically, the existing procedures for \n     such notifications of commercial defense exports \n     applicable under section 36(c) shall now apply in the case \n     of comprehensive defense export authorizations set forth \n     in section 126.14 of the International Traffic in Arms \n     Regulations where the estimated total value of the \n     transfers anticipated at the time of application meets the \n     value thresholds of subsection (c) (1). The amendment \n     addresses a Congressional concern that the congressional \n     notification provided by the Administration for the Global \n     Project Authorization, a type of comprehensive defense \n     export authorization provided for in the above mentioned \n     regulation, may not have necessarily been viewed to be \n     covered by section 36(c), despite the willingnesss to \n     provide such notification. This amendment will clarify \n     that such notifications are to be provided, pursuant to \n     the statute.\n\n     SEC. 607. EXPANSION OF AUTHORITIES FOR LOAN OF MATERIAL, \n                   SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT FOR RESEARCH AND \n                   DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES.\n\n       The amendment would expand the scope of the authority under \n     section 65 of the Arms Export Control Act to loan items for \n     cooperative research and development beyond the current NATO \n     and major non-NATO ally recipients to include ``friendly \n     foreign countries'' as that term is used in section 27(j)(2) \n     of the Act. It would permit the loan authority to be used in \n     a manner that corresponds\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\n     to that for the countries with which cooperative activities \n     may be conducted under section 27.\n\n     SEC. 608. ESTABLISH DOLLAR THRESHOLD FOR CONGRESSIONAL \n                   NOTIFICATION OF EXCESS DEFENSE ARTICLES THAT \n                   ARE SIGNIFICANT MILITARY EQUIPMENT.\n\n       This proposal seeks to establish the same dollar limit for \n     advance notification to Congress for all excess defense \n     articles. Currently, Congress requires advance notification \n     of all transfers of excess defense articles that are \n     Significant Military Equipment (SME), whereas Congress only \n     receives advance notification for those transfers of other \n     excess defense articles valued at $7 million or more. SME are \n     articles for which special export controls are warranted \n     because of their capacity for substantial military utility of \n     capability. This proposal would apply the $7 million advance \n     notice threshold to transfers of all excess defense 23 \n     articles, including SME. This would reduce the number of \n     congressional notifications sent annually to Congress.\n\n     SEC. 609. WAIVER OF NET PROCEEDS RESULTING FROM DISPOSAL OF \n                   U.S. DEFENSE ARTICLES PROVIDED TO A FOREIGN \n                   COUNTRY ON A GRANT BASIS.\n\n       This proposal allows the President to waive the requirement \n     that net proceeds resulting from the disposal of defense \n     articles provided to a foreign country on a grant basis be \n     paid to the United States. Existing law limits the waiver \n     authority to items delivered before 1985. This proposal \n     supports the goal of reducing the volume of defense articles \n     worldwide, and reduces the potential that Defense articles \n     inadvertently may fall into the hands of parties hostile to \n     the United States. This legislation would retain the \n     requirement that the net proceeds greater than 5 percent of \n     the original acquisition value needs to be paid to the United \n     States Government, absent a Presidential determination that a \n     waiver is in the national interest of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 610. TRANSFER OF CERTAIN OBSOLETE OR SURPLUS DEFENSE \n                   ARTICLES IN THE WAR RESERVE STOCKPILES FOR \n                   ALLIES TO ISRAEL.\n\n       This proposal provides the United States increased \n     authority to transfer obsolete or surplus defense items to \n     Israel, in exchange for concessions to be negotiated by the \n     Secretary of Defense. Section 514 of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act (FAA) of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321h) provides that defense \n     articles included in DoD War Reserve Stocks (WRS) be \n     transferred to foreign governments only through Foreign \n     Military Sales (where the foreign government buys the \n     articles) or through grant military assistance (where the \n     value of the article is counted against military assistance \n     appropriations provided for the recipient country). The DoD \n     maintains a WRS stockpile in Israel. This is a separate \n     stockpile of U.S.-owned munitions and equipment set aside, \n     reserved, or intended for use as war reserve stocks by the \n     U.S. and which may be transferred to the Government of Israel \n     in an emergency, subject to reimbursement. The DoD now seeks \n     authority from Congress to transfer to Israel certain of \n     these WRS stocks to Israel. In return for transferring these \n     stocks to Israel, the U.S. would negotiate equivalent value \n     concessions from the Government of Israel. This initiative is \n     not without precedent. During 1995-96 pursuant to section \n     509 of the FY94/FY95 Foreign Relations Authorization Act \n     (P.L. 103-236), the U.S. Government provided $66.62M (fair \n     market value) of WRS equipment to the Republic of Korea \n     (ROK) for equivalent value concessions. This proposal \n     would allow the U.S. to receive fair market value \n     consideration, relieve the U.S. Government of storage and \n     other stockpile maintenance costs, and avoid millions in \n     cost to demilitarize, destroy, or retrograde munitions and \n     equipment back to the U.S.\n\n     SEC. 611. ADDITIONS TO U.S. WAR RESERVE STOCKPILES FOR \n                   ALLIES.\n\n       This proposal would allow the United States to transfer \n     excess items to the DoD War Reserve Stock in Israel. Section \n     514(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, provides \n     for DoD War Reserve Stockpiles in a host country that remain \n     the property of the U.S. government. These stockpiles enable \n     equipment and supplies to be prepositioned in key parts of \n     the world to enhance U.S. and host country defense readiness. \n     DoD maintains a War Reserve Stockpile in Israel that directly \n     supports the U.S. European Command's strategy for the defense \n     of Israel. This proposal is necessary to allow the U.S. to \n     transfer excess items to the War Reserve Stockpile in Israel. \n     The transfer allows excess assets to remain under U.S. title \n     but shifts the costs for maintenance, storage, \n     transportation, and demilitarization of the excess munitions \n     to Israel. By agreement with Israel, the U.S. does not pay \n     for the storage, maintenance, transport, and warehousing of \n     assets designated as War Reserve Stockpile, although the \n     assets remain under U.S. title.\n\n     SEC. 612. PROVISION OF CATALOGING DATA AND SERVICES.\n\n       The United States provides cataloging data and services to \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and member \n     governments on a reciprocal basis. The United States also \n     provides such services to several non-NATO countries, such as \n     Australia and New Zealand, but on a reimbursable basis under \n     foreign military sales. There are instances when the \n     interests of the United States would best be served if such \n     data and services could be provided to a non-NATO country \n     under a reciprocal agreement. This section would authorize 25 \n     the President to provide such services to non-NATO countries \n     on a reciprocal basis.\n       For almost 50 years, the NATO Codification System, which is \n     based on United States standards for naming, describing and \n     numbering items of supply, has served as the cornerstone for \n     interoperability between the United States and its NATO \n     allies. Many non-NATO countries that participate in joint \n     exercises and deployments with the United States have adopted \n     the NATO Codification System. Facilitating the provision of \n     United States cataloging data for materials produced in the \n     United States has been and continues to be in the Nation's \n     strategic interest. This is especially true in light of \n     contingency operations that have and may be initiated in the \n     war on terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 613. PROVISION TO EXERCISE WAIVERS WITH RESPECT TO \n                   PAKISTAN.\n\n       This amending legislation would extend the authority \n     contained in P.L. 107-57 to make inapplicable for FY 2004 \n     foreign assistance restrictions relating to coups with \n     respect to Pakistan and. would waive for FY 2005 any coup \n     restrictions applicable in that year so long as the President \n     exercised that authority prior to October 1, 2005, the \n     amended and extended date of expiration of this amendment. It \n     would also make inapplicable foreign assistance restrictions \n     relating to debt with respect to Pakistan through fiscal year \n     2005. With respect to missile sanctions, the amendment would \n     extend the authority of current law waiving the notification \n     period for a missile sanction waiver with respect to any \n     sanctions imposed on foreign persons in Pakistan. It would \n     also continue the reduced notification period for drawdowns \n     and transfer of excess defense articles.\n       The coup waiver of section 508 of the Foreign Operations \n     Appropriations Act in Section 1 is most critical for \n     Pakistan. Section 1(b)(1), as amended, would legislatively \n     extend the authority to waive coup-related sanctions for \n     Pakistan for FY 2004 and FY 2005--the President has waived \n     the sanction for FY 2003 under the current authority. Five \n     (5) days advance notice to Congress required under P.L 107-57 \n     is continued. Section 2, as amended, would waive the \n     requirement for a 45 day advance notification to Congress \n     prior to waiving the missile 26 sanctions imposed on Pakistan \n     pursuant to section 73 of the AECA with respect to any such \n     sanctions imposed on foreign persons in Pakistan (versus \n     waiving only with respect to those sanctions imposed prior to \n     January 1, 2001, which would have already expired in any \n     event). Section 3 exempts Pakistan from foreign assistance \n     prohibitions in section 512 of the Foreign Operations \n     Appropriations Act relating to loan defaults by foreign \n     nations and similar restrictions contained in the Foreign \n     Assistance Act through fiscal year 2005, the period through \n     which the exemptions or waiver authority with respect to the \n     coup sanctions would be extended by these amendments.\n\n  TITLE VII--INTERNATIONAL PARENTAL CHILD ABDUCTION PREVENTION ACT OF \n                                  2003\n\n       General: The International Parental Child Abduction \n     Prevention Act of 2003 would amend Section 212(a)(10)(C) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and is proposed to \n     provide additional tools to deter international parental \n     child abduction and/or wrongful retention, and to create \n     incentives for the return of children abducted from or \n     wrongfully retained outside the United States by their \n     foreign national parent or others., This measure's efficacy \n     in particular cases of international child abduction will \n     necessarily depend in large part on the degree to which the \n     taking parent and/or their family members desire to travel to \n     the United States and apply for a visa. Unlike legislation \n     proposed last year in the Government Reform Committee, this \n     measure would not adversely affect the lives or travel of \n     innocent adult American citizens. This legislation also \n     seeks. to avoid certain counterproductive definitional \n     difficulties from which the earlier proposals suffered, while \n     achieving many of the same results intended.\n       Section 702(a)(3). This provision would expand the range of \n     persons who could be designated inadmissible by the Secretary \n     of State in international child abduction and wrongful \n     retention cases, even though those individuals were not \n     culpable in the abduction or wrongful retention. This would \n     be accomplished by amending existing subclause (III) of INA \n     212(a)(10)(C)(ii) to include a wider range of persons who \n     could be designated inadmissible based on their familial \n     connections to an abducting alien.\n       Sections 702(a)(4) and (5). This language specifies the \n     circumstances under which inadmissibility based on any one of \n     subclauses I, II, or III of INA 212(a)(10)(C)(ii) will \n     terminate. It also makes a purely technical amendment to \n     clarify that the concluding clause of (C)(ii) is the \n     operative provision for subclauses (C)(ii)(I), (II), and \n     (III). As originally enacted, the concluding clause is \n     erroneously printed as if it were part of subclause (III), \n     when it in fact clearly applies to each of subclauses (I)-\n     (III). Finally, the concluding clause is amended to provide \n     that inadmissibility based on (C)(ii) would terminate with \n     the return of the abducted child or the child's attainment of \n     age 21.\n       Section 702(b). This would create new subsections (iv)-\n     (vii). Subsection (iv) would (1) make explicit the Secretary \n     of State's authority to cancel designations of \n     inadmissibility applicable to relatives of abductors,\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\n     and (2) make clear that inadmissibility pursuant to \n     subclauses (I) and (II) (which is not discretionary) will \n     expire only on occurrence of the events specified in INA \n     212(a)(10)(C)(ii) (the return of the abducted child or the \n     child reaching age 21). These amendments will maximize the \n     leverage available to the Department when inadmissibility is \n     used to encourage relatives to place pressure on abductors \n     for the return of abducted children.\n       New subsection (v) would require the Department of State to \n     identify the persons potentially inadmissible under clause \n     (ii) of INA 212(a)(10)(C) .\n       New subsection (vi) would require the Department to enter \n     the names of persons inadmissible or potentially inadmissible \n     for a visa under subsections (i) or (ii) of INA 212(a)(10)(C) \n     into the visa lookout system. Together these requirements \n     would codify what the Department does through its intake \n     procedures to ensure that individuals who may be inadmissible \n     under the provisions of subsections (C)(i) and (ii) are \n     identified and that their names are entered into the visa \n     lookout system.\n       New subsection (vii) defines ``child'' in a way that is not \n     inconsistent with the word's meaning throughout the INA while \n     taking account of concerns about abducted or wrongfully \n     retained children who marry at very young ages, often against \n     their will. The definition proposed seeks to avoid the \n     unintended consequences of potential alternatives. For \n     example, H.R. 5715, introduced last session, would have \n     effectively created a class of permanent children for \n     purposes of the visa ineligibility laws, frustrating the \n     Department's efforts to promote reconciliation and contact \n     within what are often multinational families. The effect of \n     the definition proposed in H.R. 5715 would have been to \n     compromise the rights normally accorded adult U.S. citizens \n     to travel while doing little to promote the return of \n     abducted or wrongfully removed children. This subsection also \n     changes the definition of ``sibling'' to include step- and \n     half-siblings.\n       Section 702(c). Finally, this Title includes a requirement \n     that the Department of State report to Congress annually for \n     five years with a description of the operation of \n     212(a)(10)(C), including data on the number of visas denied \n     and names entered into the visa lookout system on the basis \n     of the statute. The report will provide Congress with \n     information useful to its ongoing communication with the \n     Department about the effectiveness of efforts to deter \n     international parental child abductions and to promote the \n     return of abducted and wrongfully retained American children \n     to the United States.\n\n                  TITLE VIII--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n            Subtitle A--Streamlining Reporting Requirements\n\n     SEC. 801. REPORTS ON BENCHMARKS FOR BOSNIA.\n\n       This section would eliminate reporting requirements on \n     progress toward achieving the benchmarks for a sustainable \n     peace process in Bosnia that must be done as long as U.S. \n     ground combat forces continue to participate in the SFOR. \n     Significant reductions in U.S. and allied troops have \n     continued regularly since 1998. Regular briefings to \n     congressional staff (and Members, as desired) are sufficient \n     to address continuing concerns. This is a very timeconsuming \n     report for the Departments of State and Defense.\n\n     SEC. 802. REPORT CONCERNING THE GERMAN FOUNDATION \n                   ``REMEMBRANCE, RESPONSBILITY, AND THE FUTURE.''\n\n       This section would repeal this semi-annual report required \n     by section 704 of the FY 2003 Foreign Relations Authorization \n     Act. The State Department, in particular the office of the \n     Special Envoy on Holocaust Issues, offers regular formal and \n     informal briefings to Members and staff on this issue. This \n     report duplicates the information conveyed at these \n     briefings. Moreover, we have no authority to require the \n     ``Eagleburger Commission'' (the International Commission on \n     Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, or ICHEIC) or the Conference \n     on Jewish Material Claims against Germany to supply the data \n     needed for this report.\n\n     SEC. 803. REPORT ON PROGRESS IN CYPRUS.\n\n       This report is currently due every two months. This section \n     would change it to a semi-annual requirement. The \n     Administration is in regular contact with Congress on the \n     Cyprus situation. Generally, the situation does not change \n     rapidly in two months. If it did, the Administration would \n     brief Congress immediately.\n\n     SEC. 804. REPORTS ON ACTIVITIES IN COLOMBIA.\n\n       This section repeals the two reports required by section \n     694 of the FY 2003 Authorization Act (P.L. 107-228).\n       Section 694(a) requires the Secretary, not later than 180 \n     days after the enactment of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, and annually thereafter \n     to report to Congress on the status of activities funded or \n     authorized, in whole or in part, by the Department or the \n     Department of Defense in Colombia to promote alternative \n     development, recovery and resettlement of internally \n     displaced persons, judicial reform, the peace process, and \n     human rights. This report duplicates material from a number \n     of other reports on Colombia:\n       USAID includes much of the information that Section 694(a) \n     requires in the Congressional Budget Justification it submits \n     annually. For each program area, USAID provides progress on \n     implementation.\n       Although it does not specifically address U.S.-funded \n     activities, the Department's annual Country Reports on Human \n     Rights Practices contain detailed information concerning \n     human rights and internally displaced persons in Colombia.\n       Although not specifically required to report on internally \n     displaced persons, judicial reform, the peace process, and \n     general human rights matters, a number of other reports \n     typically include information on these issues:\n       Pursuant to section 564(c) of the FY 2003 Foreign \n     Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-7), the Secretary is required to \n     submit two reports and certifications to Congress in \n     conjunction with the obligation of funds for the Colombian \n     Armed Forces describing actions taken by the Colombian Armed \n     Forces to meet the human rights conditions on the provision \n     of assistance in section 564(a).\n       Pursuant to section 3204(e) of the Military Construction \n     Appropriations Act, 2001 (P.L. 106-246), the President is \n     required to report to Congress semiannually through Fiscal \n     Year 2005 on costs incurred by any department, agency, or \n     other entity of the executive branch during the two previous \n     quarters in support of Plan Colombia. Each of those reports \n     includes information on subobligations of funds by the \n     Department of State in support of Plan Colombia.\n       Pursuant to section 3204(f) of P.L. 106-246, the President \n     provides a bimonthly, classified report to Congress on the \n     aggregate number, locations, activities, and lengths of \n     assignments for all U.S. military personnel and U.S. \n     individuals civilians retained as contractors involved in the \n     antinarcotics campaign in Colombia. These reports include \n     certain information on contract personnel who are \n     participating in U.S.-funded efforts to promote alternative \n     development, recovery and resettlement of internally \n     displaced persons, judicial reform, the peace process, or \n     human rights.\n       Finally, it is burdensome and inefficient to require the \n     Department of State to report on activities of the Department \n     of Defense.\n       Section 694(b) requires an annual report on the activities \n     of U.S. businesses that have entered into agreements in the \n     previous 12-month period with the Departments of State or \n     Defense to carry our counternarcotics activities in Colombia. \n     Information responding to some of the information sought in \n     this report is available in the classified report we submit \n     to the Congress bimonthly pursuant to section 3204(f) of P.L. \n     106-246. We also cannot easily track and report on DOD's \n     contract activities.\n       We are also concerned that recurrent, public reporting of \n     the names of businesses under contract to the Department of \n     State to support counternarcotics activities is likely to \n     increase the security risks to these businesses and their \n     employees both in Colombia and the United States. The \n     Department finances contracts for counternarcotics support in \n     Colombia expressly because the Colombian National Police \n     cannot meet the need for all services. P.L. 106-246, as \n     amended by the FY 2002 Foreign Operations Act (P.L. 107-115), \n     already provides limitations on the numbers of U.S. contract \n     personnel permitted in Colombia in support of \n     counternarcotics programs. Moreover, the Department is making \n     every effort to minimize the number of U.S. citizen personnel \n     employed by its contractors. The U.S. Embassy in Colombia \n     continually assesses the potential for U.S. businesses to be \n     involved in hostilities, and the risks to personal safety of \n     their personnel. These risks vary widely from day to day and \n     week to week. A report at any given moment in time would not \n     have general applicability.\n\n     SEC. 805. REPORT ON EXTRADITION OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS.\n\n       This section repeals Section 3203 of the 2001 Military \n     Construction Appropriations Act. This section requires the \n     Secretary of State to report biannually during the period \n     Plan Colombia resources are made available on extradition of \n     narcotics traffickers from any country receiving assistance \n     in support of Plan Colombia from the U.S. This reporting \n     requirement is burdensome and duplicative of other required \n     reports. For instance, section 696 of the FY 2003 Foreign \n     Relations Authorization Act requires the Secretary of State \n     to submit a report on extradition practice between the United \n     States and governments of all foreign countries with which \n     the United States has an extradition relationship that \n     contains numerous similar requirements. This section 696 \n     report includes: an aggregate list, by country, of the number \n     of extradition requests made by the United States to that \n     country in 2002; the number of fugitives extradited by that \n     country to the United States in 2002; an aggregate list, by \n     country, of the number of extradition requests made by that \n     country to the United States in 2002 and the number of \n     fugitives extradited by the United States to that country in \n     2002; any other relevant information regarding difficulties \n     the United States has experienced in obtaining the \n     extradition of fugitives; and a summary of the Department's \n     efforts in 2002 to negotiate new or revised extradition \n     treaties and its agenda for such negotiations in 2003. \n     Additionally, the Department's annual International Narcotics \n     Control Strategy Report also contains certain information \n     about extradition from countries worldwide with which we have \n     extradition treaties in force. We would also be happy to \n     brief members of Congress or their staffs on any issues of \n     particular concern.\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\n     SEC. 806. REPORT ON TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN WHICH UNITED STATES \n                   CIVILIANS WERE KILLED AND RELATED MATTERS.\n\n       This section would eliminate this semi-annual report. The \n     information is already available elsewhere: the Americans \n     killed overseas in terrorist attacks are prominently listed \n     in the Introduction to the Department's annual Patterns of \n     Global Terrorism report to Congress, and the names are \n     available on the State Department's Rewards for Justice \n     web-site. PLO activities are also covered in the semi-\n     annual PLO Compliance with Obligations Under the Oslo \n     Accords Report. Moreover, the names and details of \n     Americans killed overseas in terrorist attacks are well \n     covered in the press. The separate compilation and \n     preparation of a report specifically on American \n     casualties diverts scarce manpower resources from other \n     activities to fight terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 807. REPORT AND WAIVER REGARDING EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM.\n\n       This section would make the waiver and accompanying report \n     an annual, rather than semi-annual, requirement. The \n     Jerusalem Embassy Act prohibits obligation of more than our \n     annual overseas building acquisition and maintenance \n     appropriation unless the Secretary reports to Congress that \n     we have opened an embassy in Jerusalem. This prohibition may \n     be waived for successive six-month periods on ``national \n     security interest'' grounds; each waiver must be accompanied \n     by a report detailing progress made during the preceding six \n     months on moving our embassy to Jerusalem. Although the \n     reports have not significantly varied from one another, they \n     still require a significant amount of work to draft and \n     clear.\n\n     SEC. 808. REPORT ON PROGRESS TOWARD REGIONAL \n                   NONPROLIFERATION.\n\n       This section repeals section 620F(c) of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 which addresses efforts made by the \n     United States to achieve regional agreement on nuclear \n     nonproliferation in South Asia and a list of obstacles to \n     such an agreement. The report is duplicative, since South \n     Asia nonproliferation issues are covered extensively in other \n     classified and unclassified reports by State and the CIA. For \n     example, India and Pakistan are included in the major \n     nonproliferation report done annually pursuant to section \n     1308 of the FY 2003 Foreign Relations Authorization Act and \n     in the CIA's annual ``721 Report'' on proliferation \n     activities.\n\n     SEC. 809. REPORT ON ANNUAL ESTIMATE AND JUSTIFICATION FOR \n                   SALES PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 25(a) requires the President to submit a report to \n     the SFRC, HIRC, and the House and Senate Appropriations \n     Committees by February 1 of each year listing all FMS and \n     commercial sales of military hardware anticipated in the \n     coming year. Preparation of this report is extremely labor-\n     intensive, as security assistance officers at U.S. embassies \n     around the world must begin compiling data in October. \n     Unfortunately, while this report grows in size and complexity \n     each year, its value and utility are increasingly \n     questionable. Since the report includes all possible U.S. \n     sales of military equipment (760 in 2002) and has a dollar \n     threshold for reporting sales that is half that required for \n     congressional notification of actual sales, it includes a \n     large number of potential sales that are too minor to have \n     genuine military significance, or, in fact, never \n     materialize. In recent years, less than 20% of the entries on \n     the report (58 pages long in 2002) result in actual sales \n     during the reporting year. It is also redundant as a \n     reporting channel. The congressional committees that receive \n     this report also receive similar data for FMS sales on a \n     quarterly basis from reports provided under DSCA under \n     section 36(a)(6) of the AECA which cover all projected FMS \n     sales through the end of the year. Furthermore, \n     prenotification consultations assure that congressional staff \n     are advised of potentially controversial transfers well in \n     advance of formal notification.\n\n     SEC. 810. REPORT ON FOREIGN MILITARY TRAINING.\n\n       This section seeks to bring the military training report \n     required by section 656 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     into conformity with a very similar report required in the \n     annual Foreign Operations Appropriation Acts (FOAA) and to \n     eliminate those portions of the current section 656 \n     requirement that make it necessary to classify major portions \n     of the report. We intend to seek a similar amendment to the \n     FOAA requirement.\n       To bring the section 656 requirement into conformity with \n     that of the FOAA, this amendment ``excludes training provided \n     through sales'' from the reporting requirement and changes \n     the date upon which the report is due to the Congress from \n     January 31 to March 1.\n       To eliminate the portions of the report that must be \n     classified due to foreign policy or force protection reasons, \n     this amendment would eliminate the requirement to report on \n     projected training (i.e., ``training proposed for the current \n     fiscal year''), training locations, the U.S. military units \n     providing the training, and training provided through sales. \n     With these changes, a completely unclassified report could be \n     produced that would be accessible to a wider public audience.\n\n     SEC. 811. REPORT ON HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BY IMET \n                   PARTICIPANTS.\n\n       This section would repeal the report on human rights \n     required by section 549 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (added by section 1212 of the FY 2003 Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act). This report requires the Secretary of \n     State to submit an annual report ``describing, to the extent \n     practicable, any involvement of any foreign military or \n     defense ministry civilian participant in . . . [the IMET \n     program] in a violation of internationally recognized human \n     rights.'' This provision sends the very dangerous signal that \n     the USG will be tracking anyone enrolled in IMET thereafter. \n     This will deter people from participating in IMET and, thus, \n     damage U.S. national security interests. Moreover, while the \n     Bureau of Democracy and Human Rights maintains data necessary \n     to prepare the annual Human Rights Report, data is not \n     systematically collected on individual human rights \n     violators. As a result, if the department were required to \n     report on human rights violators who attended IMET courses \n     prior to the enactment of the Leahy Laws, we would be forced \n     to rely on the records and memories of security assistance \n     officers in U.S. embassies around the world which would \n     likely be of uneven quality.\n\n     SEC. 812. REPORT ON DEVELOPMENT OF THE EUROPEAN SECURITY AND \n                   DEFENSE IDENTITY (ESDI) WITHIN THE NATO \n                   ALLIANCE.\n\n       The provision in section 1223 (22 U.S.C. 1928 note) \n     requires the Secretary of Defense to provide Congress with \n     various reports on the development of the European Security \n     and Defense Identity (ESDI) within the NATO Alliance. The \n     ESDI would enable the Western European Union, with the \n     consent of the NATO Alliance, to assume the political control \n     and strategic direction of specified NATO assets and \n     capabilities. This report is obsolete and provides \n     information of limited utility. The requested information is \n     no longer relevant and does not reflect the shift in focus \n     between the European Union and NATO.\n\n     SEC. 813. REPORT ON TRANSFERS OF MILITARY SENSITIVE \n                   TECHNOLOGY TO COUNTRIES AND ENTITIES OF \n                   CONCERN.\n\n       The provision in section 1402(b)(2) (22 U.S.C. 2778) \n     requires the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central \n     Intelligence, to provide Congress with an assessment of the \n     cumulative impact of licenses granted by the U.S. for exports \n     of technologies and technical information with potential \n     military applications during the preceding 5-calendar year \n     period on the military capabilities of such countries and \n     entities, and countermeasures that may be necessary to \n     overcome the use of such technologies and technical \n     information. This report is redundant with reports already \n     submitted to Congress by the Department of State, the \n     Department of Commerce, and the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\n                       Subtitle B--Other Matters\n\n     SEC. 814. NUCLEAR REPROCESSING TRANSFER WAIVER.\n\n       This section would amend section 102(a) of the Arms Export \n     Control Act so as to permit Presidential waivers to be \n     granted once again on a one-time, rather than fiscal year, \n     basis. When the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 \n     (NPPA) folded section 670 of the Foreign Assistance Act (the \n     so-called ``Glenn Amendment'', dealing with nuclear \n     reprocessing transfers) into the Arms Export Control Act as a \n     new section 102(a), the NPPA modified the waiver authority \n     originally in section 670. This change eliminated the \n     President's ability to grant one-time waivers from sanctions \n     (cutoff of U.S. economic and military assistance) and \n     replaced it with a requirement that any waivers may only be \n     granted in the fiscal year to which they will apply. The \n     ramifications of this change only became clear after there \n     were real cases to deal with. Specifically, any country, \n     having once been determined by President to have violated \n     section 102(a), is placed in an enduring and \n     unchangeable state of annual jeopardy of a U.S. aid \n     cutoff. This is the case even where the activity that \n     triggered the violation was subsequently terminated, the \n     countries involved are not proliferation threats, and the \n     U.S. is fully satisfied with these countries' current \n     nuclear nonproliferation policies and practices. We do not \n     believe that this was the intent of Congress when it made \n     the waiver provision change.\n       The re-establishment of the authority for the President to \n     grant one-time waivers under section 102(a) would not \n     eliminate our nuclear nonproliferation leverage under this \n     section since the President has the authority to impose \n     sanctions should any resumed or new activities occur. More \n     importantly, the processing of annual waivers from section \n     102(a) sanctions for situations long since satisfactorily \n     resolved is not a constructive use of this and future \n     Presidents' time and has a continuing potential to be an \n     irritant to our relations with these countries. The President \n     has no authority to put this situation to rest once and for \n     all absent a change in the law to allow, once again, one-time \n     waivers for Glenn Amendment violations.\n\n     SEC. 815. COMPLEX FOREIGN CONTINGENCIES.\n\n       This section authorizes the President to provide assistance \n     to quickly and effectively respond to or prevent unforeseen \n     complex foreign crises. This authority will be used to \n     provide assistance for a range of foreign assistance \n     activities, including support for peace and humanitarian \n     intervention operations to prevent or to respond to foreign \n     territorial disputes, armed ethnic and civil conflicts that \n     pose threats to regional and international peace, and acts of \n     ethnic cleansing, mass killing or genocide. Use of this \n     authority will require a determination\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\n     by the President that a complex emergency exists and that it \n     is in the national interest to furnish assistance in \n     response. These authorities will not be used to fund \n     assistance activities in response to natural disasters \n     because existing contingency funding is available for that \n     purpose. This section authorizes appropriation of such sums \n     as may be necessary.\n\n\n                                          Department of State,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am pleased to transmit proposed \n     legislation to authorize appropriations for the Department of \n     State to carry out its authorities and responsibilities in \n     the conduct of foreign affairs for fiscal years 2004 and \n     2005.\n       The attached FY 2004-2005 Foreign Relations Authorization \n     Bill also contains provisions related to Department of State \n     authorities and activities, organization and personnel, \n     international organizations, security assistance, child \n     abduction prevention, and other miscellaneous provisions.\n       Key sections for the Department, in addition to the FY \n     2004-2005 authorization of appropriations, would raise the \n     peacekeeping assessment cap, provide for a permanent annual \n     CTR waiver, and provide for greater flexibility in our \n     administration of security assistance. Also included is an \n     emergency fund for complex foreign crises which may be \n     important to operations in Iraq.\n       Title VII of the proposed legislation, the International \n     Parental Child Abduction Prevention Act of 2003, is designed \n     to deter international abductions and unlawful retentions and \n     pressure an abductor to return a child to the parent with \n     lawful custody. This could provide an important new lever in \n     addressing child abductions worldwide.\n       The FY 2004 Budget contains the first step toward a capital \n     security cost sharing program that will ensure that all \n     agencies and departments pay a fair share of the cost of new, \n     secure diplomatic and consular facilities. The full program \n     implementation is now under development, and a legislative \n     proposal may be forwarded at a later date. Other provisions \n     may be submitted in the near future in a supplemental \n     package.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to \nbe determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to Calendar\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\nNo. 22, S. 476, the CARE Act, and it be considered under the following \nlimitation: there be 4 hours of general debate, equally divided in the \nusual form; provided that the only amendments in order be the \nfollowing: a managers' amendment, which will be at the desk; a Nickles \namendment, conservation; provided further, that there be 30 minutes of \ndebate on the amendments, equally divided in the usual form. I further \nask consent that following the disposition of the above amendments, the \nbill be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage \nof the bill, as amended, with no intervening action or debate. I \nfinally ask consent that no points of order be waived by virtue of this \nagreement, and that following passage of the bill, it be held at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving my right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. If the majority leader would respond, we had the \nopportunity to talk about this particular piece of legislation. Senator \nSantorum has taken out elements of the legislation that do not apply to \nthe tax rules. And we discussed, and I think reached an understanding, \nthat those charitable choice items that would pose significant issues \nwith respect to church and state have been eliminated from the \nunderlying bill.\n  The bill we will consider is from the Finance Committee with simple \ntax provisions. And I know that Senator Santorum has indicated he would \nuse his efforts, and your efforts presumably, in the conference to \nprevent the addition of those elements to which we have objected.\n\n  And I would assume that despite your best efforts, if such elements \nwere included within the bill when it came back in the form of a \nconference report, this Senate would not take up such a conference \nreport. Is that a fair understanding?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island is correct in \nthe nature of the discussion between the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nmyself, and the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Further reserving my right to object, I notice that in the \nmanagers' amendment there is language with respect to the Compassionate \nCapital Fund, which is not a tax-financed provision. It essentially is \nauthorizing a program that was begun in the appropriations bill a few \nyears ago.\n  Questions have been raised with the use of these funds, et cetera. I \nwonder, in order to expedite this, if that particular provision of the \nmanagers' amendment could be either deleted or it could be placed in a \nposition where a possible amendment could be raised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, what I would prefer to do is refer that \nquestion to the manager of the bill because I am not familiar with that \naspect of it. That will be Mr. Santorum, the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, again, I am also operating on some \nknowledge, but not complete knowledge, of why this provision is in the \nmanagers' amendment. I am prepared to accept the underlying agreement; \nI just have this one question which I find, at this point, important \nwith respect to this Compassionate Capital Fund.\n  But as far as your assertions, which I appreciate, and the underlying \nlegislation, I have no problem with this consent; it is just that one \npoint about the managers' amendment.\n  I don't know what you would like to do to try to resolve that, \nthough.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am not in a position now to withdraw that \namendment at this juncture. I am simply not familiar enough with it. I \nunderstand there was an agreement that it be there as part of it. I \nthink we can continue the discussion on Monday when we are back in. But \nright now, I am not in a position to withdraw that.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If I could direct a question to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland: Is this the understanding the Senator had with the Senator from \nPennsylvania?\n  Mr. REED. The understanding I had with the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nto be fair and accurate, did not reach the contents of the managers' \namendment. It was my impression that the managers' amendment would \nsimply be tax amendments with respect to the Internal Revenue Code and \nthe jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  I am a bit surprised, frankly, coming this evening and seeing \nsomething that is not within the traditional scope of the Finance \nCommittee. Perhaps I might be wrong. This is something I didn't expect, \nbut I must be very fair and accurate that this was not an issue we even \ndiscussed.\n  My presumption was that all the amendments would be strictly related \nto tax provisions and not to this Compassionate Capital Fund. I must \nsay, I understand that the funds have been appropriated under the \ncontext of this Compassionate Capital Fund. This is an attempt to \nprovide legislative language. I have not had a chance to look at the \nlanguage. It is included within a managers' amendment without any \nopportunity to amend the managers' amendment. I am in an awkward \nposition.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could make a suggestion: If we could \nmodify the leader's request that there be a motion to strike in order \nif the Senator from Pennsylvania can't work this out with the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, this one provision.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we can check on that. It is my \nunderstanding that this has been available to the other side, that this \nhad been agreed to. If not, at this juncture I am just not in a \nposition to agree to a motion to strike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, once again, reserving my right to object, I \nthink both the majority leader and the Senator from Pennsylvania have \nbeen operating completely in good faith, have made sincere efforts to \nrespond to our concerns. At this juncture, I would hope we could work \nout, through an amendment to the consent, a provision at least to give \nus the opportunity to look at it. I, frankly, having just seen this, \nthis evening, I don't know if this simply codifies what is already \noperating and is, in a sense, innocuous or something more. It is not my \nintention to try at this point to upset the agreement because I think \nit was reached after much effort on both sides. It is a good-faith \nagreement.\n  I wonder if there is some way we can maintain the opportunity to look \nat this, agree to the consent this evening, look at it, and if it is \nsomething highly objectionable, at least have the opportunity to \nstrike.\n  I think the suggestion by the Senator from Nevada is a good one. \nFrankly, I must say I am not prepared at this moment to offer a \nconclusion as to whether this should be here or not. I am just \nsurprised that a nontax item is included in the managers' amendment \nalong with others that are relatively noncontroversial.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to the leader. If I could make a suggestion, I \nknow how deeply the Senator from Pennsylvania feels about this \nlegislation. I am confident he wouldn't do anything that was untoward \npurposely. So I hope the Senator from Rhode Island will accept this \nagreement, and we will work with Senator Santorum to see if something \ncan be done. I will personally work with Senator Santorum to see if he \nwould allow us a motion to strike, but that is not part of this deal.\n  Mr. REED. If I may reclaim my time, again, both the leader and the \nSenator have been extremely cooperative and helpful in trying to reach \nthis point. I understand that once this legislation is passed by the \nSenate, it will be placed on the desk, and there are procedural \nopportunities there, I believe, to try to address this at least to \nsomehow get an opportunity to look at this measure. Also with the \nopportunity to look at this over the course of the next few days, my \napprehensions might be misplaced and we can proceed forward. But I \nthink, again, the intention and the understanding we had have been met. \nI am just surprised about the inclusion of this particular position in \nsomething like a technical managers' amendment. Given the commitment \nthe majority leader has made, certainly, about the overall status of \nthis legislation, should it return from the other body,\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\nthen I would not object to the consent at this time.\n\n  Hopefully, over the next few days we will learn a little bit more \nabout this compassionate fund and perhaps even deal with it if it is a \nproblem on Monday.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, my response is that we will work in good \nfaith with the Senator from Rhode Island as well as the assistant \nDemocratic leader. I hesitate at this juncture to speak on behalf of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania. Again, we are committed on both sides to \nworking in good faith. We have been able to do that to date. So I would \nask once again for the unanimous consent as propounded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to state how much I appreciate the \ncooperation of the ranking member and the chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. It took a few minutes to do this, but it \nhas taken weeks to get to this point. I express my appreciation to all \nSenators involved. It was very hard to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/03/senate-section/article/S4881-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA DULUTH BULLDOGS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 104, submitted \nearlier today by Senator Dayton and Senator Coleman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 104) commending the University of \n     Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs for winning the 2002-2003 National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association Division I National \n     Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today with my colleague \nfrom Minnesota, Senator Coleman, to pay tribute to the University of \nMinnesota Duluth Women's Ice Hockey Team, who just won their third \nconsecutive National Collegiate Athletic Association championship. The \nBulldogs defeated an outstanding Harvard team, 4 to 3, in the second \nsudden-death overtime.\n  I was once a hockey goalie, back in the days when we used dinosaur \nbones for goalie sticks. So I have experienced firsthand the incredible \nintensity and pressure of overtime in hockey. It truly is ``sudden \ndeath.'' For the Bulldogs to win their third straight national \nchampionship under that pressure, in front of their families, friends, \nand many fans in Duluth, is an extraordinary achievement.\n  I congratulate all the players on the University of Minnesota Duluth \nteam, their head coach, Shannon Miller, who has spearheaded this \nincredibly successful hockey program, and UMD Chancellor Kathryn \nMartin. They have accomplished more than anyone could have imagined \njust 3 years ago, and they have made all Minnesotans exceptionally \nproud of them.\n  Senator Coleman, Representative Jim Oberstar, and I have written to \nPresident Bush and asked him to invite the team to the White House. Two \nyears ago, after the Bulldogs' won their first national championship, I \nread that the NCAA men's championship team had been invited to the \nWhite House. We asked the President then that the UMD women's team be \nso honored. The President graciously extended that invitation to the \nBulldogs team and personally hosted them at the White House.\n  Last year, we had the additional thrill of attending a White House \nceremony honoring both the men's and women's NCAA hockey champions: the \nUniversity of Minnesota Duluth women's champions and the University of \nMinnesota men's champions. Since the Gophers men's team is now in the \nsemifinals of their national tournament, I am hopeful that we will \nexperience that same thrill again this year. Regardless of that \noutcome, the UMD women's team are again the National Champions. A \n``Threepeat!'' Awesome! Congratulations, Bulldogs!\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, without intervening action or debate; and that any \nstatements relating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
