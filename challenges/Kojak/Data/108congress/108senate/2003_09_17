Under the previous order, the time until \n10:30 a.m. will be equally divided between the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, and the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer, or their designees.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague for agreeing to a time split this \nmorning where I will speak for 30 minutes and, at the end of that time, \nSenator Santorum will speak for 30 minutes, and then we each expect to \nhave other Senators speaking. We will figure out at that point how to \ndivide the time.\n  We are here this morning because there is a strong disagreement \nbetween the House and the Senate on the issue of Roe v. Wade, a Supreme \nCourt decision that occurred in 1973 which ruled that it was \nunconstitutional to take away a woman's right to choose and that found \na privacy right in the Constitution.\n  The Senate has gone on record several times supporting the Roe \ndecision. In S. 3, the bill that was brought to us by the Senator from \nPennsylvania and others, which for the first time banned an approved \nmedical procedure--the first time ever--without a health exception, \nSenator Harkin added an amendment to support Roe. I will show you what \nthat amendment was and what the debate is about.\n  Senator Harkin's language in S. 3 that was disagreed to by the House \nis the following:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade--\n\nAnd it cites the ruling--\n\n     was appropriate and secures an important right; and\n       (2) such decisions should not be overturned.\n\n  This is the simple language that the Senator from Iowa, who spoke \nquite eloquently last night, made part of S. 3.\n  The Senate had a debate about the Harkin amendment. It was an \nextensive debate about why it is important that a woman's right to \nchoose remain the law of the land, why it is important that the Court \nnot overturn it.\n  The House, which says it very much wants to ban the procedure that is \nbanned in S. 3 without a health exception, could have simply taken the \nSenate bill and sent it off to the President, and we would have had the \nargument about this underlying bill in the Supreme Court, where it is \ngoing to go, by the way, where I believe it will be ruled \nunconstitutional because the centerpiece of Roe is that a woman's \nhealth and life must always be protected.\n  Let's look at the language in Roe which provides for the woman's \nhealth to always be protected and why, to those of us who believe Roe \nv. Wade was rightly decided, it is so important.\n  The important point about Roe, which people sometimes don't get, is\n\n[[Page S11590]]\n\nthat it is a very modest decision, a very moderate decision. It \nbalances all the interests in a way that is fair. It says that in the \nearly stages of a pregnancy, a woman has a right to decide whether to \ncarry this child to term. She makes that decision after searching her \nsoul, talking to her family, her doctor, her God.\n  Guess what. Government isn't in the picture, Senators are not in the \npicture, Congresspeople are not in the picture, Senator Boxer is not in \nthe picture, when a woman is making this decision. Neither is Senator \nSantorum nor Senator Frist nor Senator Stevens nor Senator Daschle. As \nfar as this Senator is concerned--and I represent the largest State in \nthe Union--that is the way it should be.\n  I support everyone making their own decision as Roe states they \nshould have the right to do in the early stages of a pregnancy. In the \nlate stages of a pregnancy, after viability--that is when a fetus can \nlive outside the womb--this is what the Court said in Roe:\n\n       The State, in promoting its interest in the potentiality of \n     human life, may, if it chooses, regulate, and even \n     proscribe--\n\nMeaning ban--\n\n     abortion, except where it is necessary, in appropriate \n     medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health \n     of the mother.\n\n  It is a very sensible law. After viability, any State in the Union \ncan ban abortion but always making an exception for the life and health \nof a woman.\n  We have a decision, that I believe was very carefully thought out, \nthat balances everyone's views, or let's say the majority of views, and \nindeed the majority of the people support Roe. In my particular State, \nit is overwhelming, but it is a strong majority across the country.\n  Here is why it is so important. I guess my colleagues said: Why is \nSenator Boxer having us vote to disagree with what the House did? The \nHouse tossed out the support of Roe in S. 3 and said: We don't want it. \nTherefore, the two bodies will go to conference.\n  Why do I want to take the time and have a debate about Roe? First of \nall, it is a very serious worry to many people in this country that \nwith the Supreme Court at roughly a 5-to-4 vote on Roe, we could lose \nthis right, and with the Senate now only having 52, 53, or 54 people in \nfavor of Roe, which is diminishing, this is a problem. With the House \nanti-choice, this is a problem. They believe that making sure people \nunderstand what Roe actually did, what the decision actually did, is \nvery important. So I think for that reason, to remind all of us what \nRoe v. Wade actually said and actually did, it is important.\n  The other reason is, the underlying bill goes completely against Roe. \nWhy? Because Roe v. Wade said, yes, the State--meaning the Government--\ncan even go so far as banning abortion but always having an exception \nfor the life and health of the mother. This bill makes no exception for \nthe health of the mother.\n  Now, why is this important? What could happen to a woman if she \ncannot have the particular procedure that is being banned, as Members \nof the Senate and the House play doctor, and for the first time decide \nthat they are going to outlaw a procedure?\n  Let us look at what could happen to a woman's health. The night \nbefore last I put in documentation, letters, that laid out these \nproblems. This is what doctors tell us could happen if the procedure \nthat is banned in this bill cannot be used to save the health of a \nwoman. I want everyone to think about whether they want their wife, \ntheir daughter, their sister, their friend, their aunt, or anyone else \nthey love to go through this.\n  A woman might have a hemorrhage, a hemorrhage that could get worse \nand worse and could lead to serious, long-term damage. Her uterus could \nrupture, meaning she may well never have another child. She could get \nblood clots, and everyone knows how serious that is. She could have an \nembolism, a stroke, damage to nearby organs, even paralysis. This is \nwhat doctors tell us.\n  We do not have one OB/GYN in the Senate. The OB/GYNs tell us these \nare the things that could happen if a safe procedure that is recognized \nis not available to a woman, and yet this bill, S. 3, bans this \nprocedure, does not give a whit about this in the end because there is \nno health exception. Believe me, my colleagues tried to offer very \ntight health exceptions and oh, no, the other side would not give an \ninch--no health exception.\n  This is what could happen to a woman, and the only saving grace of S. \n3 is that it has the Roe language in it that we support in Roe. What \ndoes that say? It says to the Supreme Court across the street that even \nthough the Senate passed S. 3 and banned a procedure, it also at the \nsame time said, do not overturn Roe. Roe has a clear statement that the \nhealth of the mother must always be protected.\n  I hope everyone on the other side votes for this. I have heard it is \npossible because there is a technicality here. If this amendment or \nthis motion to disagree goes down, then there will be no conference and \nthe bill cannot go forward. I hope all my colleagues on the other side \nvote for this, I really do, because I want a strong signal to go out \nthat this Senate disagreed with what the House did when they said strip \nout the Roe language.\n  If everyone on the other side, or a lot of my colleagues on the other \nside, vote with us and we get a strong vote, that sends a message to \nthe conferees that most of the people wanted to keep the Roe language. \nI trust they will come back after conference with the Roe language. \nSend this bill into conference with a strong vote for Roe, and we \nexpect Roe will come back in the bill.\n  I think it is important to look at what happened before Roe so I am \ngoing to read a couple of statements. Dr. Douglas Black, Concord, NH, \nwas then--pre-Roe, pre-1973--an OB/GYN. He did his specialty training \nin New York City from 1959 to 1963. During that time he saw hundreds of \nbotched back-alley abortions, and many women died. But that was only \nthe tip of the iceberg. For every one woman who died, there were many \nothers who were rendered pelvic cripples. He said it was not a pretty \nsight, and he remembers doing hysterectomies on 13-year-old girls. \nAlso, he and others were often unable to treat women until the women \ntold police where they had gotten the abortion.\n  Dr. Black says:\n\n       I can vividly remember pot-bellied, cigar-chomping \n     detectives picking on some young, very sick kid, bleeding \n     excessively, with shaking chills of fever and a high \n     temperature.\n\n  That is what it was like pre-Roe. That is why Senator Harkin offered \nthis amendment. That is why the Senate voted for it and that is why we \ndisagree with the House stripping out this amendment supporting Roe.\n  Let me read another one. This one is from Philadelphia, PA, Dr. Louis \nGerstley. Dr. Gerstley has been an obstetrician and gynecologist since \nthe early 1950s. From 1956 through 1967, he worked at the Philadelphia \nGeneral Hospital, where a 32-bed ward was kept purely for the end \nresults of badly botched abortions. Imagine that, they had beds set \naside for women who had to go to the back alleys and sneak and pass \ndollar bills across a table to some back-alley abortionist. The beds \nwere constantly filled, and Dr. Gerstley saw women who were sick, who \nwere dying, and who died.\n  He remembers one 22-year-old woman in particular who came into the \nward suffering from septic shock from a botched abortion. He and others \nworked on her for 6 hours and finally decided to give her a \nhysterectomy to save her life. The procedure was performed without \nanesthesia because she had no blood pressure and no pulse. The patient \ndied. Dr. Gerstley has said:\n\n       I never want to see that again.\n\n  He opposes the criminalization of abortion. That is why we are here, \nbecause we want a strong vote going into conference that Roe v. Wade \nshould not be reversed.\n  Let us look at Senator Harkin's language again. It is very temperate, \nvery clear, and very important. It is worth a debate. I appreciate the \nfact that we have a debate about Roe.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the decision of the \n     Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade was appropriate and secures an \n     important right; and such decisions should not be overturned.\n\n  It is very simple, very elegant.\n  We do not want back-alley people, who are not doctors, who are not \ntrained, to touch a young girl in trouble, or anyone who deserves to \nhave their health protected. Their health must be protected. That is \nwhy Roe is so important.\n\n[[Page S11591]]\n\n  Dr. Robert Prince from Dallas, TX, has been an OB/GYN since 1958. At \nthe end of his third year of medicine, he did a research fellowship in \nNashville, TN. One of his duties was to perform autopsies. Since \nabortions were illegal, any death attributed to an abortion required an \nautopsy. In his own words:\n\n       My first case was that of a 20-year-old college student, \n     who had been brought into the emergency room by her boyfriend \n     for vaginal bleeding. She had gone to a nurse's aide, who had \n     attempted to place a catheter in the cervix to effect an \n     abortion. A vital blood vessel was damaged, and the patient \n     was in shock when she arrived at the emergency room. . . . In \n     a clinic setting, this patient would have survived in spite \n     of the injury . . . if abortions were legal, she would have \n     survived. How often did this happen in the pre-Roe years? \n     Multiply the scenario by a thousand.\n\n  Rollyn Carlson, Austin, TX, was 20 years old in the summer of 1971 \nand pregnant. She decided to have an abortion and found an office in \nMexico on the other side of the Texas border. After the abortion, she \nbled heavily and ran a high fever for 3 days. She was one of the lucky \nones. She married and had two children. She now has a teenage daughter \nand is concerned about her. What if she got pregnant? What if she \nneeded an abortion? Rollyn worries that if abortion is illegal, her \ndaughter would have to have an illegal abortion and could die.\n  Here is the point. People in our country can make their own decisions \nin a personal, private, difficult moral, sometimes religious, decision. \nSome will decide to have the child, to keep the child, to love the \nchild. Some will decide to put the child up for adoption. Some will \ndecide to have a legal abortion in the early stages.\n  Under Roe v. Wade, if a person waits until the end, that is a time \nwhen the State can step in, always, and say, no--but always protecting \nthe health and the life of the woman. Again, that is why Roe is so \nimportant. That is why being pro-choice is so important, because it \nsays that I respect you. I will do anything I can to protect your right \nto decide however you want to decide. I will not force you to decide \nthe way I want you to decide.\n  I wasn't elected to be God. I am a Senator. I was elected to respect \nyou and respect your freedom and to pass laws that balance your rights \nwith other rights. Roe v. Wade was that type of decision. It is very \nimportant that it not be overturned. It is very important that it be \npart of this law that is in front of us because the law that is in \nfront of us makes an exception for the health of a woman.\n  If we have the Roe language, we are sending a signal that, yes, a \nmajority wants to ban this procedure. They couldn't get the votes to \nhave an exception for health, but we still support Roe. That is why \nthis is important. This is not some technical matter that we voice \nvote. This is a moment in time where we can discuss and debate the \nwisdom of the Harkin amendment, which is very clear and simply says Roe \nis important.\n  I want to read this. Some of the stories are very hard. This woman's \nname is Romanita, from Pittsburgh, Pa. Romanita married and had three \nchildren, one, her daughter Norma, with spinal bifida. Her husband was \na heroin addict and had left the home. One day he showed up and he \nraped her. He then disappeared and she found that she was pregnant. She \nsought an illegal abortion and experienced bleeding for 2 weeks. She \nlived to tell the tale.\n  Again, our being here is not frivolous. I hope the other side will \nnot paint it as such. We have so many issues facing our country today \nthat are so important. We have an economy that has lost 3 million jobs \nin the last couple of years. We have deficits as far as the eye can \nsee. We have to deal with that. We have environmental laws that have \nbeen rolled back. We have to deal with that. We have our young men and \nwomen in Iraq in terrible danger, without much help from the \ninternational community, unfortunately. We have a request for $87 \nbillion. We have to deal with that. We have to work that out in a way \nthat protects the troops and yet makes sure we have some kind of exit \nstrategy and we are not turning our back on the needs of our own \npeople. We want to make sure procurement reform is done, so when Iraq \nis rebuilt it is done in a way that is fair.\n  All those issues are before us. I don't come to the floor in a \nfrivolous manner because I am working on all those issues. I have an \nimportant hearing today that involves a big industry in my State that \nis in some kind of trouble. We are having a hearing about that. So, no, \nI have come here early in the morning because I want to make the case \nto my colleagues as to why we are calling for a vote on this issue of \nRoe v. Wade. We are asking our colleagues to strongly disagree with \nwhat the House did when they stripped out the Harkin language. We want \nto send a strong message--hopefully, a very large number of votes will \ncome our way on this one--to the conferees: Keep the Harkin language in \nthe bill, please. We know we differ with the House. But we are right on \nthis one.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania for being so gracious as to allow me to open this debate. \nI know he will have a vigorous dissent, and I respect that. I suspect \nwe will dissent on this matter many times in the future if we are both \nhere to be able to do that. Of course that is up to the people of our \nStates.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would like to ask a question of the Senator from \nCalifornia. I know she has to leave, so I will not take long. The \nSenator from California and the Senator from Iowa for the last few days \nhave been using the figure 5,000 women a year who died from abortion \nprior to Roe v. Wade. I have before me, which I will enter into the \nRecord, a chart titled ``Maternal Mortality, Vital Statistics of the \nUnited States, 1942 to 1974.'' This chart tracks the total maternal \ndeaths in the country and total abortion deaths in the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     TABLE 2.--MATERNAL MORTALITY: VITAL STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES,

Not yet available\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Statistics in Table 2 are published by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Department of HEW in Vital Statistics of the United\n  States, Part II--Mortality. These figures are derived from death certificates.\n\\1\\ In 1962 and 1963 New Jersey did not report race classification. The white and non-white figures do not include the state of New Jersey, but the\n  totals for each category do.\n\\2\\ Beginning in 1972 CDC in Atlanta has kept records on abortion-related maternal mortality (figures in parentheses). The CDC figures are slightly\n  higher because of special investigative work into particular cases and causes. For the years 1972, 1973, and 1974 these figures are subdivided into\n  legal at, respectively, 21, 24 and 23; illegal at 40, 19 and 6; and spontaneous at 22, 8, 18. See CDC Abortion Surveillance, 1973, Figure 6; CDC\n  Abortion Surveillance, 1974 (in press).\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In the year prior to Roe v. Wade, 1972, the total \nmaternal deaths in the United States--total maternal deaths from all \ncauses--was 612. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the \ntotal abortion-related deaths were 83. So I ask the Senator from \nCalifornia how they can continue to use the number 5,000, when the \nofficial statistics of the United States say the total number of \nmaternal deaths in the country were 612, and those related to abortion \nwere 83?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to my friend, one death is too many, if it is \nyour wife. We could debate the numbers. I gave you cases, cases, cases \nhere. A woman who was raped and had to go get an illegal abortion. I \nhave so many more of these.\n  I have the data and I have the sources. I will, before the end of the \nmorning, have them printed in the Record. But, again, there are varying \nestimates. I have never heard the one, 83, as being a serious estimate.\n  Be that as it may, Roe v. Wade says that you always protect the life \nand health of a woman. That is a basic disagreement you and I have.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate the basic disagreement. I think we are \nallowed to disagree on our opinions. We are not allowed to argue and \ndisagree with the facts. The facts are what they are. This is from the \nCenters for Disease Control. These are numbers out of the abstract. I \nwill be happy to give them to the Senator. But these are from the \nNational Center for Health Statistics of the Department of HEW. This \nwas in 1975, so that is from the Department of Health, Education and \nWelfare at the time. These were the official statistics of the United \nStates.\n  Again, I am not challenging the remarks of the Senator that every \nlife is important. But I think presenting accurate evidence is also \nimportant if we are going to have a discussion about what the case was. \nLet's look at the case of abortion-related deaths. In 1942 there were \n1,231; total maternal deaths were 7,267. Every single year, without \nfail, every single year, the total number of maternal deaths went down \nbecause medicine improved. The total number of abortion-related deaths \nwent down. Why? Every year, I believe, without fail--there are 1 or 2 \nyears where it popped back up and dropped back down--it went down \nalmost in a direct line and was continuing to go down. So the idea that \nRoe v. Wade is saving even--in 1973 there were 36. The bottom line is \nthat very few--given the number of pregnancies that were occurring in \nthose years--very few women died as a result of ``botched'' abortions. \nThe idea that thousands and thousands were--well, I will quote for you \nBernard Nathanson, who was an abortion doctor at that time. He says:\n\n       How many deaths are we talking about when abortion was \n     illegal? In NARAL [that's the National Abortion Rights Action \n     League] we generally emphasize the drama of the individual \n     case.\n\n  You heard the Senator from California come back when I said the \nstatistics are wrong.\n\n       We talk about the individual case, not the mass statistics. \n     But when we spoke about the latter it was always 5,000 to \n     10,000 deaths a year. I confess I knew these figures were \n     totally false and I suppose the others did too if they \n     stopped to think about it. But in the morality of our \n     revolution it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go \n     out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?\n\n  The bottom line is we are making a policy decision based on, \nhopefully, factual evidence. I want to make that clear.\n  A couple of other things about what the Senator from California said \nand last night the Senator from Iowa said, that a majority of Americans \nsupport Roe v. Wade. Maybe if you asked the question, ``Do you support \nRoe v. Wade?'' a majority of Americans would say, ``Yes, it is the law \nof the land.'' Most people, if it is the law, generally comply with the \nlaw and so most people say it is probably fine, although if you \ndescribe what the law is without saying it is Roe v. Wade and ask if \nthey agree, you find that a majority of Americans do not agree with Roe \nv. Wade.\n  In fact, there was a study done a couple of months ago by the Center \nfor the Advancement of Women. Faye Wattleton, a very well known \nabortion rights advocate, formerly affiliated with Planned Parenthood--\nI believe the head of Planned Parenthood--instituted a study this \nsummer, and they asked the question about abortion to women--not to \nmen, to women. They found that 17 percent of women in America--this is \na pro-choice group--17 percent of women in America said abortion should \nbe banned, period--never legal. Another 34 percent said it should be \nagainst the law except in the case of rape, incest, and life of the \nmother. If you add 17 and 34--I will get one of the pages to add that \nup for me--it is 51; 51 percent of American women are either against \nabortion, period, or only in the case of rape, incest, and life of the \nmother, which if you ask people in this Chamber if you are against \nabortion except in the case of rape, incest, and life of the mother, \nyou are considered pro-life. Most people in this Chamber who are pro-\nlife are for the exception of rape, incest, and life of the mother.\n  So the majority of American women, according to an abortion rights \ngroup--who, by the way, described the results of this as \n``disappointing''--don't agree with Roe v. Wade. A majority of American \nwomen do not agree.\n  Let me broaden that even further. They asked this question, as an \noption: It should be available but under stricter limits than now. In \nother words, it should be less available than Roe v. Wade allows. Add \nanother 17 percent to that. Now we are up to 68 percent of women in \nthis country who believe Roe v. Wade is wrong; 68 percent of women \ndisagree with Roe v. Wade.\n  Now, the fourth category was: It should be generally available to \nthose who want it. This is a very tricky thing. It should be generally \navailable. It did not say, it should be what Roe v. Wade is, the law: \nIt shall be available for any reason at any time. That is what Roe v. \nWade is. This idea that this is a moderate, reasonable provision, Roe \nv. Wade, is nonsense.\n  Roe v. Wade and its subsequent decisions have established an absolute \nright to an abortion at any point in time. The Senator from California \nsays the State can prohibit abortions, late-term abortions. I asked the \nSenator, and I have asked her more than once in these debates, and \ntoday--she has not provided any evidence--I asked her to give me one \nexample where an abortion was stopped in this country under Roe v. \nWade, an example where someone wanted an abortion and, because of the \nSupreme Court decisions, was barred. It does not happen. Why? The \nSenator says, well, there is this health exception that is very \nimportant. There always has to be a health exception.\n  Look at the Supreme Court cases that define what a health exception \nis.\n\n[[Page S11593]]\n\nAccording to Doe v. Bolton, the companion case to Roe v. Wade, health \nmeans any health: Mental health, physical health, economic health, \nstress, distress. Anything that could possibly affect mental or \nphysical health is a health exception.\n\n  What does that mean? This is an exception that swallows the rule. The \nhealth exception means that abortion is legal, period, up until the \nmoment that the child is completely separated.\n  The point of the partial-birth abortion debate is the child is all \nbut separated. The child is completely delivered except for the head. \nAnd you do not believe Roe v. Wade is extreme? Under Roe v. Wade, this \nSupreme Court said that 3 inches from separation still is covered by \nRoe v. Wade. At 38 weeks, 3 inches from being born, you can still kill \nyour child.\n  It was interesting, when the Senator from California went through the \ndifferent options a woman has. She said you can deliver your child and \ntake it home, you can deliver your child and give it up for adoption, \nor you can terminate the pregnancy. She did not say--she used the term \n``child'' in the first two instances, but in the third instance it is \n``terminated pregnancy,'' as if the child does not exist.\n  The third option is to kill your child. That is the option. It is \nvery stark. It sounds rather cold, chilly, but it is.\n  In the extreme nature of Roe v. Wade, if really known by the American \npublic, these numbers I have been reading would be even higher--this 30 \npercent that says it should be generally available.\n  If you ask the question, Should it be available for all circumstances \nat any time up to the moment of separation, including up to 39\\1/2\\ \nweeks, I daresay the number of people who would be supportive of Roe v. \nWade, which is the law, would be in the very low double digits and, I \nwould hope, single digits. But I don't know that. I have not seen any \npolling on that because no pollster asks the question of what the law \nreally is. They put it in fuzzy terms to gather more people. But even \nwith this fuzzy language, even written in a way for the pro-choice \ngroups to get the best number they possibly can, two-thirds of the \nAmerican people oppose Roe v. Wade.\n  I find it remarkable the Senator from Iowa last night got up and \ncalled my opposition to this extreme when two-thirds--I said of people, \ntwo-thirds of American women--say what the Senator from Iowa is doing \nis extreme, is wrong, is not what they believe. He does not represent \nthem. His extreme views--and they are extreme, not by my definition, \nnot by my morality, not by my theology, but looking at what the \nAmerican public believes. Extreme means out of the mainstream, on the \nedge.\n  If you look at the polling data now on abortion, Roe v. Wade is on \nthe edge; it is not where the American public is. One of the reasons \nfor that, I happen to believe, is medical science. I saw a TV \ncommercial the other day of what I think is called the 4-D sonogram, \nwhere you can actually see these 3- or 4-D images--I don't know what \nthey are--but color images of a child in the womb. I saw an article in \nthe paper talking about how they can see a baby in the womb smile and \nhave facial expressions. It gave rise to a study or discussion as to \nwhether children of the womb feel pain, or how much.\n  It is very hard for the American public--and I know this is a battle \nthat people usually internalize, and most people do not talk about \nabortion--when they see those images, see this little baby in the womb. \nThere is a commercial. It is a GE commercial, and I thank them for the \ncourage to run the commercial. I know it was incredible the amount of \nheat they got. From whom? From these organizations that call themselves \nwomen's rights organizations, pressuring General Electric to pull the \nad.\n\n  These are women's rights organizations that don't want women to know \nwhat is going on within their own body, but they are women's rights \norganizations. They want to hide facts from the very people they want \nto, ``give rights to.'' They don't want them to see. They want to keep \nthe deception to the very people whose rights they say they are \nprotecting.\n  But General Electric, to their credit, kept the ad about this \nincredible new technology. At the end of the ad, you see this closeup \nof this baby in the womb--this little face--and then it dissolves into \nthe face of the baby, subsequently, after the baby is born--the same \nface. It is not a different baby. It is not one baby in the womb and \nanother baby in its mother's arms a couple months later. It is the same \nbaby.\n  But the other side, the ``women's rights'' organizations, don't want \nyou to know that. They don't want you to see that. They don't want you \nto understand what abortion is.\n  The reason I have been so passionate about the issue of partial-birth \nabortion is because, for a long time in this country, the whole debate \nabout abortion was about the rights of women only--only. You never saw \nthe baby because in an abortion, you do not see the baby. In partial-\nbirth abortion, you cannot miss the baby. It is a baby. It is moving. \nThis baby would otherwise be born alive because of the late-term nature \nof when these abortions are done. We are being called extreme because \nwe do not want to allow a procedure which allows the baby--who would \notherwise be born alive, who in 99 percent of the cases is healthy, \nwith a healthy mother--to be delivered in a breach position, and have a \npair of scissors thrust into the back of the baby's head, when they are \nliterally inches away from being born? We are extreme if we want to \nstop that?\n  George Orwell, in 1984, could not have thought we could twist the \nEnglish language so much that such horrendous actions would be twisted \nto somehow we would be the extremists in trying to defend the rights of \nthese little children not to be treated in such a horrible fashion.\n  No. No. We are going to proceed. And we are going to proceed with \nthis debate on the motion to disagree with House amendments. And I make \na request of every one of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to \nvote to disagree with the House amendment. Why? Because that is the way \nyou get to conference.\n  This is a procedural motion. I never, in my 9 years, recall that we \never had a debate about what is strictly a procedural motion to go to \nconference. But some point is trying to be made, which, frankly, \nescapes me, that somehow if we vote for the disagreement, somehow we \nare arguing that we are for the Senate version versus the House \nversion. What we are for is a bill that will be passed by both Chambers \nand signed by the President, and that will be the original contents of \nS. 3, which I suspect will pass here and pass, hopefully, by a very \nlarge margin.\n  I want to go through some of the points the Senator from California \nmade. She talks about the medical evidence, and she put a chart up of \nall of the things that could go wrong with a woman in the cases of not \nhaving a partial-birth abortion available. I think we just need to \nreview the facts. Again, you are entitled to your own opinion. You are \nnot entitled to your own facts.\n\n  Five thousand people dying from abortion prior to Roe v. Wade a \nyear--factually incorrect, unsupportable. We have people who were \ninvolved in the movement, as I commented earlier, who said they made up \nthe number. Yet 30 years later, they are still using the number in \nspite of the National Center for Health Statistics, the Federal agency \nat the time that was responsible for keeping track of the number of \nmaternal deaths, deaths of mothers due to abortion, saying--actually, \nthere were two organizations. One was the Center for Disease Control. \nThey said 83. They just began that year keeping track. And then the \nNational Center for Health Statistics said 70. So somewhere between 70 \nand 83, not 5,000.\n  You are not entitled to your own facts to influence the \ndecisionmaking of the American public or Members of Congress. If you \nare going to make your argument, you are entitled to your opinion. I \ncan respect your opinion. A lot of people hold that opinion in this \ncountry, and it should be represented here, but it should be \nrepresented honestly. It should be an honest debate about what the case \nwas before Roe v. Wade, and an honest debate as to what the case is \nnow. I would argue that neither has been put forward by the other side.\n  They exaggerate claims of what was going on before. They minimize \nwhat is going on now. They minimize the real\n\n[[Page S11594]]\n\neffects of Roe v. Wade. You never hear them talk about the 1.3 million \nabortions a year that go on. I am not talking about 5,000 or 83. I am \ntalking about 1.3 million children die from abortion in this country--a \nthird of all pregnancies; somewhat less than a third now. Thankfully, \nit has come down. But for roughly a third of all children conceived in \nthis country, their lives end before they have a chance to enjoy the \nfreedoms this country provides.\n  Last night, I had a discussion of how this country on this issue is \nout of whack, how we have put the liberty rights of a woman above the \nlife rights of her child. As I said last night, the last time we did \nthat in this country was back in the early 1800s. We put the liberty \nrights of the slave owner above the life rights of the slave.\n  I refer and have referred to the Roe v. Wade decision as Dred Scott \nII because it is the second time in the history of this country we have \ntaken the fundamental premise of our country--the founding document of \nour country, the Declaration of Independence, which said, ``We hold \nthese truths to be self-evident''--back then we actually used very \nlofty terms such as ``truths,'' absolute things that we all agreed on, \nthe truth. They believed there was a truth and that you could actually \nfind what that truth is.\n  We said: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are \ncreated equal--all--and that they are endowed by our Creator with \ncertain inalienable rights. And they listed three--the three \nfoundational rights upon which this country was founded--life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness--not liberty, happiness, life; not \nhappiness, life, liberty--life, liberty, happiness. Why? Because it \nsounded better? Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness sounds better than \nhappiness, liberty, life? Is that why they did that? It sounded better? \nJefferson was good at writing, and he just said: Boy, this sounds \nbetter. I will put life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. That sounds \nnice?\n  How many people think that is the reason they did it that way?\n  Of course not. He wrote it that way because that is the way you have \nto write it. You can't have happiness without freedom and liberty. How \ncan you truly be happy, how can you truly pursue what God has called \nyou to do in this life if you are not free to do it, if someone tells \nyou what you must do or what you must say, what you must believe. \nLikewise, how can you be free, how can you have liberty if you are dead \nor the equivalent of dead in the case of the slave? They are there for \na reason, and they are in that order for a reason. Roe v. Wade \nscrambles them, just like Dred Scott scrambled them. It was wrong then. \nIt is wrong now. It was legal then. Why? Because the Supreme Court said \nso. It is legal now. Why? Because the Supreme Court said so.\n  Back then a bunch of people stood up on this very floor and said no. \nMillions of people across America said no. We had great leaders in our \ncountry, including President Lincoln, who said no. Remember the \nmainstream view was, who are we to tell others how they should live \ntheir life? Who are we? I am not God. How can I tell a slaveholder they \ncan't do something they did in the Bible, own slaves? That has been the \ntradition of this country. Who am I to make those choices for other \npeople? I trust them. I trust their judgment. I trust their morality. \nHow dare you not trust these people that they are not treating these \npeople kindly, that they aren't doing the right thing for them? How \nuneducated of you to feel that way.\n  Do these arguments have a somewhat familiar ring to them? It is the \nsame debate. It is just as wrong. For it is our job here to say what is \nright and what is wrong. That is what laws are. Laws are the reflection \nof the collective morality of our country. Roe v. Wade was a usurpation \nof that collective morality. It was a hijacking of the collective \nmorality of this country by nine Justices of the Supreme Court who \ndecided they would play God. Now we just follow along as so many did in \nthe early 1800s. They just followed along. Why? Because it was the law. \nAnd who are we to judge these people who own these slaves? Who are we? \nWho are we? That is a question all of us need to ask: Who are you? How \nmuch are you standing up for what you believe is right and what, in \nmany cases, we know is right, and how often do you just sort of turn \naway and say: Well, that is the law? It is an uncomfortable issue and \nwe will just leave it alone. And so we pass language, sense-of-the-\nSenate language that says this law, Dred Scott II, is something that \nshould continue in America.\n  I believe, as much as I believe that I am standing right here today, \nthat this law will be overturned, not by the courage of Senators, not \nby the courage of Governors or judges, but by the wisdom of the \nAmerican people. We are seeing it happen. The more people find out \nabout the injustice that abortion is and the extremeness of Roe v. \nWade, people are changing. That is why there is this desperate attempt \nto hang on, to codify Roe v. Wade or to support Roe v. Wade, to prop it \nback up, this wretched decision that is affecting so much of society.\n  We are going to have a chance in a few weeks, once we pass this \nresolution of disagreement, to vote on the conference report on S. 3, \nwhich is the partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. We will have an \nopportunity--I hope it will not be filibustered--to vote straight up or \ndown on whether to send this bill to the President, which he said he \nwill sign, and send it across the street. That is where it is going \nto end up. Across the street from the Senate happens to be the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. They will have another opportunity to look \nat this procedure based on the factual record.\n\n  Again, I challenge any Member on either side of the aisle to come \nforward with a reason why this procedure needs to be legal for the \nhealth of the mother. Not one piece of evidence has been entered in the \nrecord ever that this procedure was ever necessary to protect the \nhealth of the mother. No one even makes an argument that it protects \nthe life of the mother, but there has never been a case introduced that \nhas not been refuted 30 different ways that suggests that this \nprocedure is necessary for health. So the health exception of Roe v. \nWade, as a result, is not applicable here because there is no medical \nreason why this procedure needs to be legal.\n  In addition, we have tightened the language. The other concern in the \nCourt was that it was vague and could have included other late-term \nabortion procedures. There are many in this Chamber who would like to \nban all late-term abortion procedures. That is not what this bill does. \nIt simply bans a procedure which the vast majority of the American \npublic, anywhere from 70 percent to 80 percent, believe should be \nbanned. By the way, if you are with 70 or 80 percent of the American \npublic, you are hardly on the extreme. By definition this can't be \nextreme if 70 to 80 percent of the American public support what you are \ndoing.\n  We have tightened the language to ban a procedure, just one--this \none. So there is no doubt now that the Court had before, because of the \nlanguage in the Nebraska statute, that we might include other abortion \ntechniques. We are including one technique, this one, a technique that \nis never used to protect the health or life of the mother. Roe v. Wade \nis as expansive a right as there exists today. Let me repeat that: The \nright to an abortion in America is more absolute than the right of free \nspeech, than the right of freedom of assembly, than the right of \nfreedom of the press. Under constitutional interpretation, there is no \nlimitation on the right to abortion--none--where these others all have \nlimits. I would argue not great limits, but they are all limited in \nsome fashion by the Court and by statutes that have been found \nconstitutional by this Court. Except abortion, there is no limit. There \nis no practical limitation on the right to an abortion.\n  This--candidly and unfortunately, in some respects--is not a \nlimitation on abortion either because if it were a limitation on \nabortion, the Court would find it unconstitutional. But it is not.\n  It is a rogue procedure that candidly is unhealthy. We have mountains \nof evidence from experts in the maternal field of medicine who say this \nprocedure is the least healthy option for women. Obviously, it is the \nmost horrendous and brutal to the child.\n  That is our plea. It is a modest one. It is so modest that many \npeople do not understand why we are even pursuing it on both sides of \nthis issue.\n\n[[Page S11595]]\n\nThey ask, Why are you suggesting this? It is not going to do anything. \nIt will bar one procedure that is not used very much--a few thousand \ntimes a year. But, as the Senator from California says, every life \nmatters. Every case is a tragedy. So we should do it if we can. We \nshould, and we will, hopefully in a few weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much. I have gone to one \nmeeting. And I have another hearing. I appreciate my colleague from \nPennsylvania being so gracious as to work the time so I could continue \nto come back and forth.\n  Before I left the floor, I promised him I would put in the Record the \nvarious publications that have stated that approximately 5,000 women a \nyear died from illegal abortions before Roe.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. In a moment.\n  The Senator read from the CDC figures. I realized as I left the floor \nthat at the time women were having these illegal botched abortions and \nwere dying--it made some of them infertile, and they were suffering \nfrom trauma--they were not supporting the CDC or any government entity \nbecause they would have been put in prison because abortion was \nillegal. Any claim that the CDC would know the accurate number of \nillegal abortions just flies in the face of all common sense. Women \nwere not cooperating with the Government. They were in fact standing up \nto the Government which had outlawed the procedure.\n  I am glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In how many States in 1972 were abortions illegal?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I could tell you it was illegal in my State. I will be \nhappy to give you all of that. That isn't the point. At the point in \ntime when the CDC was collecting these numbers, many of the women were \nhaving abortions. In my State--probably the most populous State at that \ntime--they were not reporting these things.\n  My friend challenged me. I come back with the fact that I don't \nbelieve the Senator could say the United States Government knew. But I \nwill tell you who did know.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a book that has stated that number.\n  I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I can't imagine that--first of all, this number was \nderived from death certificates. If a person is dead, they are not \ngoing to report an abortion. There is no concern about a woman \nreporting her own death because she fears being prosecuted. These \nnumbers were derived from death certificates from hospitals and the \ncause of death of the women who died. It has nothing to do with self-\nreporting. They are dead. The idea that somehow these women aren't \nreporting because they are afraid of being prosecuted--with all due \nrespect, they are dead.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am talking about the number of illegal abortions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is not the number used. The Senator used the \nnumber of 1,000 deaths.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Excuse me. I don't interrupt the Senator, if he would \nallow me to respond.\n  I am saying to the Senator that the collection of data at that time \nwould not be done by someone who feared prosecution. If a person dies, \nI can tell you that right now doctors weren't reporting these things. \nFamilies didn't want to say their child did something illegal. The \nSenator is the only one I have ever met in the movement to outlaw Roe \nwho would put the number of deaths at 83. But I want to tell the \nSenator that 83 deaths of women--and I have read stories and my friend \nhas heard them, and they are brutal stories about 13-year-old girls, \nand women who were raped who were afraid--these people died. You can \ntake your number of 83 which is the CDC and which would, I say, make no \nsense because people were afraid to death, frankly, and families were \nafraid to report that. Or you can take the number of 5,000 which has \nbeen written about quite a bit in science magazines, or you can take \nsome other number in the middle. My friend can pick whatever number he \nwants. He has chosen the number of 83 women who died. That is 83 \nfamilies destroyed. But you can belittle. That is fine.\n\n  The bottom line is that Roe v. Wade said the Government has a right \nafter viability to ban abortions. But there is always an exception for \nthe health of the woman.\n  My friend can sugar-coat his bill any way he wants. But the fact is \neven the people who want to ban abortions have written--and I just read \nan account today where one gentleman who was a big leader in this \nmovement to overturn Roe said this bill is unconstitutional.\n  That is the reason why it is important for us to say we support Roe, \nbecause this Senate shouldn't be reporting language that is \nunconstitutional and which jeopardizes the health of a woman.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield for one more question. I appreciate having a \nchance to finish my remarks.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to clarify and put a question to the Senator. \nUsing my numbers--these are not my numbers; these are the numbers from \nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare back in 1975. The Senator \nsays people didn't want to report that. I want to clarify for the \nRecord that these are figures derived from death certificates. My \nquestion is, Is the Senator suggesting that doctors lied on death \ncertificates about the reason for the death? That is what the Senator \nis suggesting.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am suggesting to my friend that when people could go to \nprison because a woman had an abortion in the early stages of her \npregnancy--this is my opinion--I don't believe there is going to be \naccurate reporting. I think it had a terrible impact on people. People \nwere so frightened.\n  We have testimony from a doctor who said that while a woman was on \nthe table bleeding to death, the doctor was afraid to perform an \nabortion because--he was allowed to do it because the woman was raped, \nbut he was afraid until the police cleared it.\n  The bottom line is this was a period in our history where women were \nmade to feel like criminals. I remember those days. Women's lives were \nlost. The number of illegal abortions is hard to determine. It is hard \nto determine the cause of death. The fact of the matter is I don't know \ntoo many people who believe the number of 85. There are people who \nlived in those days who saw how many women were having these abortions. \nPerhaps they were raped. Perhaps it was a situation where they wanted a \nfamily, and that wasn't to be. Whatever the reason, it was happening. \nThey weren't reported, and I don't believe the deaths were accurately \nreported.\n  The point is, Why are we here having this debate? Would I still be \nstanding here if I believed that ``only'' 85 women a year died? Yes, I \nwould be, because that is too many deaths, if it is your friend, if it \nis your mother, if it is your sister, or if it is your aunt.\n  The question isn't only how many illegal abortions there were and how \nmany women died. The Senator made no reference to how many women became \ninfertile. Then the Senator says something that is totally untrue--that \nwe have never placed into the Record at all any statement that shows \nthat by banning this procedure which is banned in this bill with the \nhealth exception there could be health damage.\n  There is testimony of Anne Davis before a hearing of the Subcommittee \non the Constitution of the House Judiciary Committee. She is a \nphysician licensed to practice medicine in New York, and she is a \nboard-certified OB/GYN. She got her education at Columbia. She is a \nfellow of the American College of OB/GYN.\n\n  With all due respect to my colleague from Pennsylvania--and I totally \nrespect his right to his opinion and would fight for his right to have \nit--I trust an OB/GYN more than I do him on matters pertaining to a \nwoman's health and her body.\n  She says this bill will severely limit physicians' ability to provide \nthe best medical care to their patients. She says it is confusing; it \nis contradictory; it would be difficult for physicians to interpret. \nAnd she says she believes after reading it, the bill appears to ban \nsafe and common abortion procedures\n\n[[Page S11596]]\n\nused well before fetal viability. By the way, this was another ground \non which the Supreme Court overturned a similar Nebraska statute. It \nsaid it was vague.\n  She says the bill leaves physicians with an untenable choice of not \nbeing able to provide the appropriate medical care and, she says, it \nposes grave risks to the patient. Let me repeat that. My colleague said \nthere was not one bit of evidence that the procedure that is banned--\nnot one bit of evidence--that it could hurt a woman and that I put none \nin the Record.\n  I refer to my colleagues the testimony of Anne R. Davis, M.D., before \nthe House Subcommittee on the Constitution on March 25, 2003.\n  Mr. President, she says it puts patients at risk, and she goes on \nabout it. She goes into great detail. I will not take the Senate's time \nbecause it is highly technical and it has to do with medicine, and this \nis not, as I said, a doctor's office. It is the Senate floor.\n  It goes on for pages and pages. The bottom line is, she is saying \nthere are times when this procedure that is banned is the one that is \nnecessary to protect women. As a matter of fact, she has a whole \nsection titled: ``The bill lacks necessary exceptions to protect \nwomen's health and their lives.'' And she goes through that.\n  This is the first document for the Record. It is 11 pages. I hope \nSenator Santorum will take the time to look at that.\n  Then I have a very important letter from another OB/GYN. As a matter \nof fact, she is an adjunct professor in the Department of Obstetrics, \nGynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at UC-San Francisco where she \ndirects the Center for Reproductive Health Research and Policy. She \nsays she represented the United States at the International Conference \non Population and Development. She served on a number of boards of \norganizations that promote emergency contraception and new \ncontraceptive technologies and supports reducing teen pregnancy. I hope \nmy friends agree that is a good idea. Her area of expertise is family \nplanning and reproductive health.\n  Very clearly in her four-page letter to us--again, a lot of which is \ntechnical--she lists these very problems of what could happen to a \nwoman if there is no health exception in the bill. Here is what she \nsays: Death, infertility, paralysis, coma, stroke, hemorrhage, brain \ndamage, infection, liver damage, and kidney damage.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania said I never put anything in the Record \nthat said if they cannot use this procedure that is banned in this bill \nthere would be problems. Here is another, Felicia Stewart, M.D., with \nthe highest qualifications you would ever want to have if you ever \nneeded to go to an OB/GYN, which none of my male colleagues would ever \nhave to do, but my female colleagues would have to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    March 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I understand that you will be \n     considering Senate S. 3, the ban on abortion procedures, soon \n     and would like to offer some medical information that may \n     assist you in your efforts. Important stakes for women's \n     health are involved: If Congress enacts such a sweeping ban, \n     the result could effectively ban safe and common, pre-\n     viability abortion procedures.\n       By way of background, I am an adjunct professor in the \n     Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive \n     Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, \n     where I co-direct the Center for Reproductive Health Research \n     and Policy. Formerly, I directed the Reproductive Health \n     program for the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and served \n     as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs for the \n     United States Department of Health and Human Services. I \n     represented the United States at the International Conference \n     on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, Egypt, and \n     currently serve on a number of Boards for organizations that \n     promote emergency contraception and new contraceptive \n     technologies, and support reducing teen pregnancy. My medical \n     and policy areas of expertise are in the family planning and \n     reproductive health, prevention of sexually transmitted \n     infections including HIV/AIDS, and enhancing international \n     and family planning.\n       The proposed ban on abortion procedures criminalizes \n     abortions in which the provider ``deliberately and \n     intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus . . . for the \n     purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will \n     kill the partially delivered living fetus. . . .'' The \n     criminal ban being considered is flawed in a number of \n     respects: it fails to protect women's health by omitting an \n     exception for women's health; it menaces medical practice \n     with the threat of criminal prosecution; it encompasses a \n     range of abortion procedures; and it leaves women in need of \n     second trimester abortions with far less safe medical \n     options; hysterotomy (similar to a cesarean section) and \n     hysterectomy.\n       The proposed ban would potentially encompass several \n     abortion methods, including dilation and extraction (dtx, \n     sometimes referred to as ``intact d), dilation and \n     evaculation (d), the most common second-trimester \n     procedure. In addition, such a ban could also apply to \n     induction methods. Even if a physician is using induction as \n     the primary method for abortion, he or she may not be able to \n     assure that the procedure could be effected without running \n     afoul of the proposed ban. A likely outcome it this \n     legislation is enacted and enforced is that physicians will \n     fear criminal prosecution for any second trimester abortion--\n     and women will have no choice but to carry pregnancies to \n     term despite the risks to their health. It would be a sad day \n     for medicine if Congress decides that hysterotomy, \n     hysterectomy, or unsafe continuation of pregnancy are women's \n     only available options. Williams Obstetrics, one of the \n     leading medical texts in Obstetrics and Gynecology, has this \n     to say about the hysterotomy ``option'' that the bill leaves \n     open:\n       Nottage and Liston (1975), based on a review of 700 \n     hysterotomies, rightfully concluded that the operation is \n     outdated as a routine method for terminating pregnancy. \n     (original in bold). Cunningham and McDonald, et al, Williams \n     Obstetrics, 19th ed., (1993), p. 683.\n       Obviously, allowing women to have a hysterectomy means that \n     Congress is authorizing women to have an abortion at the \n     price of their future fertility, and with the added risks and \n     costs of major surgery. In sum, the options left open are \n     less safe for women who need an abortion after the first \n     trimester of pregnancy.\n       I'd like to focus my attention on that subset of the women \n     affected by this bill who face grievous underlying medical \n     conditions. To be sure, these are not the majority of women \n     who will be affected by this legislation, but the grave \n     health conditions that could be worsened by this bill \n     illustrate how sweeping the legislation is.\n       Take for instance women who face hypertensive disorders \n     such as eclampsia--convulsions precipitated by pregnancy-\n     induced or aggravated hypertension (high blood pressure). \n     This, along with infection and hemorrhage, is one of the most \n     common causes of maternal health. With eclampsia, the kidneys \n     and liver may be affected, and in some cases, if the woman is \n     not provided an abortion, her liver could rupture, she could \n     suffer a stroke, brain damage, or coma. Hypertensive \n     disorders are conditions that can develop over time or spiral \n     out of control in short order, and doctors must be given the \n     latitude to terminate a pregnancy if necessary in the safest \n     possible manner.\n       If the safest medical procedures are not available to \n     terminate a pregnancy, severe adverse health consequences are \n     possible for some women who have underlying medical \n     conditions necessitating a termination of their pregnancies, \n     including: death (risk of death higher with less safe \n     abortion methods), infertility, paralysis, coma, stroke, \n     hemorrhage, brain damage, infection, liver damage, kidney \n     damage.\n       Legislation forcing doctors to forego medically indicated \n     abortions or to use less safe but politically-palatable \n     procedures is simply unacceptable for women's health.\n       Thank you very much, Senator, for your efforts to educate \n     your colleagues about the implications of the proposed ban on \n     abortion procedures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Felicia H. Stewart, M.D.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have another letter from the American \nPublic Health Association. The American Public Health Association \nopposes the bill because it fails to include adequate health exception \nlanguage and where certain procedures may be determined by a physician \nto be the best way to preserve the health of the woman.\n  There we go, the American Public Health Association is concerned \nabout women's health.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the American Public \nHealth Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            American Public Health\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 2003.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Public \n     Health Association (APHA) the largest and oldest organization \n     of public health professions in the nation, representing more \n     than 50,000 members from over 50 public health occupations, I \n     write to urge your opposition to H.R. 760, the Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act of 2003.\n       APHA has long-standing policy regarding the sanctity of the \n     provider-patient relationship and has long advocated for a \n     woman's\n\n[[Page S11597]]\n\n     right to choose from a full range of reproductive health \n     options. We believe that a physician in consultation with the \n     patient should make the decision regarding what method should \n     be used to terminate a pregnancy.\n       We are opposed to H.R. 760 because we believe this and \n     other legislative and judicial restrictions to safe, \n     medically accepted abortion procedures severely jeopardize \n     women's health and well-being. APHA also opposed the bill \n     because it fails to include adequate health exception \n     language in instances where certain procedures may be \n     determined by a physician to be the best or most appropriate \n     to preserve the health of the woman. We urge members of the \n     House of Representatives to oppose this legislation.\n       Thank you for your attention to our concerns regarding the \n     negative effect this legislation would have to a woman's \n     right to a safe, legal abortion.\n           Sincerely\n                                    Georges C. Benjamin, MD, FACP,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have another letter from Lynn Epstein, \npresident of the American Medical Women's Association in Alexandria, \nVA. They strongly oppose this ban, and they say it fails to protect the \nhealth and safety of women and their children. So that is another.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          American Medical Women's\n\n\n                                            Association, Inc.,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Jerrold Nadler,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Nadler: The American Medical Women's \n     Association (AMWA) strongly opposes HR 760, the ``Partial-\n     Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.'' While the Association has \n     high respect for each member and their right to hold whatever \n     moral, religious and philosophical beliefs his or her \n     conscience dictates, as an organization of 10,000 women \n     physicians and medical students dedicated to promoting \n     women's health and advancing women in medicine, we believe HR \n     760 is unconscionable.\n       AMWA has long been an advocate for women's access to \n     reproductive health care. As such, we recognize this \n     legislation as an attempt to ban a procedure that in some \n     circumstances is the safest and most appropriate alternative \n     available to save the life and health of the woman. \n     Furthermore, this bill violates the privilege of a patient in \n     consultation with her physician to make the most appropriate \n     decision regarding her specific health circumstances.\n       AMWA opposes legislation such as HR 760 as inappropriate \n     intervention in the decision-making relationship between \n     physician and patient. The definition of the bill is too \n     imprecise and it includes non-medical terminology for a \n     procedure that may ultimately undermine the legality of other \n     techniques in obstetrics and gynecology used in both abortion \n     and non-abortion situations. At times, the use of these \n     techniques is essential to the lives and health of women. The \n     potential of this ban to criminalize certain obstetrics and \n     gynecology techniques ultimately interferes with the quality \n     of health and lives of women. Furthermore, the current ban \n     fails to meet the provisions set forth by the Supreme Court \n     in Steinberg v. Carhart, a ruling that overturned a Nebraska \n     statute banning abortion because it contained no life and \n     health exception for the mother.\n       AMWA's position on this bill corresponds to the position \n     statement of the organization on abortion and reproductive \n     health services to women and their families.\n       AMWA believes that the prevention of unintended pregnancies \n     through access to contraception and education is the best \n     option available for reducing the abortion rate in the United \n     States. Legislative bans for procedures that use recognized \n     obstetrics and gynecological techniques fails to protect the \n     health and safety of women and their children, nor will it \n     improve the lives of women and their families.

Mr. President, here is another letter from the Physicians \nfor Reproductive Choice and Health. They are located in New York. They \nsay the legislation is dangerous because it is vague and there is no \nhealth exception. They also add something I think they are absolutely \nright on about. Politicians should not legislate medicine.\n  This is the first time any Congress has ever outlawed a medical \nprocedure that is supported by the medical community. You may find a \nfew doctors who don't, but the organizations all do. They are very \nconcerned that women's health is not being respected or cared about.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this letter from Physicians for \nReproductive Choice and Health in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Physicians for Reproductive\n\n\n                                            Choice and Health,\n\n                                     New York, NY, March 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: We are writing to urge you to stand in \n     defense of women's reproductive health and vote against S. 3, \n     legislation regarding so-called ``partial birth'' abortion.\n       We are practicing obstetrician-gynecologists, and academics \n     in obstetrics, gynecology and women's health. We believe it \n     is imperative that those who perform terminations and manage \n     the pre- and post-operative care of women receiving abortions \n     are given a voice in a debate that has largely ignored the \n     two groups whose lives would be most affected by this \n     legislation: physicians and patients.\n       It is misguided and unprincipled for lawmakers to legislate \n     medicine. We all want safe and effective medical procedures \n     for women; on that there is no dispute. However, the business \n     of medicine is not always palatable to those who do not \n     practice it on a regular basis. The description of a number \n     of procedures--from liposuction to cardiac surgery--may seem \n     distasteful to some, and even repugnant to others. When \n     physicians analyze and debate surgical techniques among \n     themselves, it is always for the best interest of the \n     patient. Abortion is proven to be one of the safest \n     procedures in medicine, significantly safer than childbirth, \n     and in fact has saved numerous women's lives.\n       While we can argue as to why this legislation is dangerous, \n     deceptive and unconstitutional--and it is--the fact of the \n     matter is that the text of the bill is so vague and \n     misleading that there is a great need to correct the \n     misconceptions around abortion safety and technique. It is \n     wrong to assume that a specific procedure is never needed; \n     what is required is the safest option for the patient, and \n     that varies from case to case.\n\n\n                               the facts\n\n       (1) So-called ``partial birth'' abortion does not exist.\n       There is no mention of the term ``partial birth'' abortion \n     in any medical literature. Physicians are never taught a \n     technique called ``partial birth'' abortion and therefore are \n     unable to medically define the procedure.\n       What is described in the legislation, however, could ban \n     all abortions. ``What this bill describes, albeit in non-\n     medical terms, can be interpreted as any abortion,'' stated \n     one of our physician members. ``Medicine is an art as much as \n     it is a science; although there is a standard of care, each \n     procedure--and indeed each woman--is different. The \n     wording here could apply to any patient.'' The bill's \n     language is too vague to be useful; in fact, it is so \n     vague as to be harmful. It is intentionally unclear and \n     deceptive.\n       (2) Physicians need to have all medical options available \n     in order to provide the best medical care possible.\n       Tying the hands of physicians endangers the health of \n     patients. It is unethical and dangerous for legislators to \n     dictate specific surgical procedures. Until a surgeon \n     examines the patient, she does not necessarily know which \n     technique or procedure would be in the patient's best \n     interest. Banning procedures puts women's health at risk.\n       (3) Politicians should not legislate medicine.\n       To do so would violate the sanctity and legality of the \n     physician-patient relationship. The right to have an abortion \n     is constitutionally-protected. To falsify scientific evidence \n     in an attempt to deny womens that right is unconsicionable \n     and dangerous.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, \n     representing 45,000 obgyns, agrees: ``The intervention of \n     legislative bodies into medical decision making is \n     inappropriate, ill advised and dangerous.''\n       The American Medical Women's Association, representing \n     10,000 female physicians, is opposed to an abortion ban \n     because it ``represents a serious impingement on the rights \n     of physicians to determine appropriate medical management for \n     individual patients.''\n\n\n                              The Science\n\n       We know that there is no such technique as ``partial \n     birth'' abortion, and we believe this legislation is a \n     thinly-veiled attempt to outlaw all abortions. Those \n     supporting this legislation seem to want to confuse both \n     legislators and the public about which abortion procedures \n     are actually used. Since the greatest confusion seems to \n     center around techniques that are used in the second and \n     third trimesters, we will address those: dilation and \n     evacuation (D), dilation and extraction (D), \n     instillation, hysterectomy and hysterotomy (commonly known as \n     a c-section).\n       Dilation and evaculation (D) is the standard approach for \n     second-trimester abortions. The only difference between a D \n     and a more common, first-trimester vacuum aspiration is that \n     the cervix must be further dilated. Morbidity and mortality \n     studies acquiring valuable information regarding hereditary \n     illness or fetal anomaly; and there is a decreased risk of \n     injury to the woman, as the procedure is quicker than \n     induction and involves less use of sharp instruments in the \n     uterus, providing a lesser chance of uterine perforations or \n     tears and cervical lacerations.\n       It is important to note that these procedures are used at \n     varying gestational ages.\n\n[[Page S11598]]\n\n     Neither a D nor a D is equivalent to a late-term \n     abortion. D and D are used solely based on the size of \n     the fetus, the health of the woman, and the physician's \n     judgment, and the decision regarding which procedure to use \n     is done on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n                            The Legislation\n\n       Because this legislation is so vague, it would outlaw D \n     and D (and arguably techniques used in the first-\n     trimester). Indeed, the Congressional findings--which go into \n     detail, albeit in non-medical terms--do not remotely \n     correlate with the language of the bill. This legislation is \n     reckless. The outcome of its passage would undoubtedly be \n     countless deaths and irreversible damages to thousands of \n     women and families. We can safety assert that without D and \n     D, that is, an enactment of S.3, we will be returning to \n     the days when an unwanted pregnancy led women to death \n     through illegal and unsafe procedures, self-inflicted \n     abortions, uncontrollable infections and suicide.\n       The cadre of physicians who provide abortions should be \n     honored, not vilified. They are heroes to millions of women, \n     offering the opportunity of choice and freedom. We urge you \n     to consider scientific data rather than partisan rhetoric \n     when voting on such far-reaching public health legislation. \n     We strongly oppose legislation intended to ban so-called \n     ``partial birth'' abortion.\n           Sincerely,\n     Natalie E. Roche, MD,\n       Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New \n     Jersey Medical College.\n     Gerson Weiss, MD,\n     Professor and Chair, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and \n     Women's Health, New Jersey Medical College.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, here is another one. Senator Santorum said \nwe had no documentation that the ban would hurt women's health. This is \ntestimony of Vanessa Cullins, vice president of Medical Affairs of \nPlanned Parenthood. She is a board-certified OB/GYN with a master's \ndegree in public health and business administration. She talks about \nthe fact that this bill prevents doctors from exercising necessary \ndiscretion and how that is dangerous. She says it outlaws techniques \nthat are critical to the lives and health of American women.\n  Mr. President, I refer to my colleagues the testimony of Vanessa \nCullins, M.D., before the House Subcommittee on the Constitution on \nMarch 25, 2003.\n  Mr. President, then there is the UCSF Center for Reproductive Health \nResearch and Policy. Their first objection to the bill: It fails to \nprotect women's health by omitting an exception for women's health.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         University of California, Center for Reproductive Health \n           Research & Policy\n                                 San Francisco, CA, March 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I understand that you will be \n     considering Senate S. 3, the ban on abortion procedures, \n     soon, and would like to offer some medical information that \n     may assist you in your efforts. Important stakes for women's \n     health are involved: If Congress enacts such a sweeping ban, \n     the result could effectively ban safe and common, pre-\n     viability abortion procedures.\n       By way of background, I am an adjunct professor in the \n     Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive \n     Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, \n     where I co-direct the Center for Reproductive Health Research \n     and Policy. Formerly, I directed the Reproductive Health \n     Program for the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and served \n     as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs for the \n     United States Department of Health and Human Services. I \n     represented the United States at the International Conference \n     on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, Egypt, and \n     currently serve on a number of Boards for organizations that \n     promote emergency contraception and new contraceptive \n     technologies, and support reducing teen pregnancy. My medical \n     and policy areas of expertise are in family planning and \n     reproductive health, prevention of sexually transmitted \n     infections including HIV/AIDS, and enhancing international \n     and family planning.\n       The proposed ban on abortion procedures criminalizes \n     abortions in which the provider ``deliberately and \n     intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus . . . for the \n     purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will \n     kill the partially delivered living fetus . . .'' The \n     criminal ban being considered is flawed in a number of \n     respects: It fails to protect women's health by omitting an \n     exception for women's health; it menaces medical practice \n     with the threat of criminal prosecution; it encompasses a \n     range of abortion procedures; and it leaves women in need of \n     second trimester abortions with far less safe medical \n     options: hysterotomy (similar to a cesarean section--and \n     hysterectomy.\n       The proposed ban would potentially encompass several \n     abortion methods, including dilation and extraction (d, \n     sometimes referred to as ``intact d''), dilation and \n     evacuation (d), the most common second-trimester procedure. \n     In addition, such a ban could also apply to induction \n     methods. Even if a physician is using induction as the \n     primary method for abortion, he or she may not be able to \n     assure that the procedure could be effected without running \n     afoul on the proposed ban. A likely outcome if this \n     legislation is enacted and enforced is that physicians will \n     fear criminal prosecution for any second trimester abortion--\n     and women will have no choice but to carry pregnancies to \n     term despite the risks to their health. It would be a sad day \n     for medicine if Congress decides that hysterotomy, \n     hysterectomy, or unsafe continuation of pregnancy are \n     women's only available options. Williams Obstetrics, one \n     of the leading medical texts in Obstetrics and Gynecology, \n     has this to say about the hysterotomy ``option'' that the \n     bill leaves open: ``Nottage and Liston (1975), based on a \n     review of 700 hysterotomies, rightfully concluded that the \n     operation is outdated as a routine method for terminating \n     pregnancy.'' (Cunningham and McDonald, et al., Williams \n     Obstetrics, 19th ed., (1993), p. 683.)\n       Obviously, allowing women to have a hysterectomy means that \n     Congress is authorizing women to have an abortion at the \n     price of their future fertility, and with the added risks and \n     costs of major surgery. In sum, the options left open are \n     less safe for women who need an abortion after the first \n     trimester of pregnancy.\n       I'd like to focus my attention on that subset of the women \n     affected by this bill who face grievous underlying medical \n     conditions. To be sure, these are not the majority of women \n     who will be affected by this legislation, but the grave \n     health conditions that could be worsened by this bill \n     illustrate how sweeping the legislation is.\n       Take for instance women who face hypertensive disorders \n     such as eclampsia--convulsions precipitated by pregnancy-\n     induced or aggravated hypertension (high blood pressure). \n     This, along with infection and hemorrhage, is one of the most \n     common causes of maternal death. With eclampsia, the kidneys \n     and liver may be affected, and in some cases, if the woman is \n     not provided an abortion, her liver could rupture, she could \n     suffer a stroke, brain damage, or coma. Hypertensive \n     disorders are conditions that can develop over time or spiral \n     out of control in short order, and doctors must be given the \n     latitude to terminate a pregnancy, if necessary, in the \n     safest possible manner.\n       If the safest medical procedures are not available to \n     terminate a pregnancy, severe adverse health consequences are \n     possible for some women who have underlying medical \n     conditions necessitating a termination of their pregnancies, \n     including: Death (risk of death higher with less safe \n     abortion methods), infertility, paralysis, coma, stroke, \n     hemorrhage, brain damage, infection, liver damage, and kidney \n     damage.\n       Legislation forcing doctors to forego medically indicated \n     abortions or to use less safe but politically-palatable \n     procedures is simply unacceptable for women's health.\n       Thank you very much, Senator, for your efforts to educate \n     your colleagues about the implications of the proposed ban on \n     abortion procedures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Felicia H. Stewart, M.D.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here you go. We have all of these documents that clearly \nsay the problem with this bill is it makes no health exception; it is \nvague; it is dangerous for women.\n  The fact is, the bill passed the Senate. We had these arguments and \nthe bill passed the Senate, but the great news about that debate is \nthat Tom Harkin offered his amendment, and that is the subject of the \nvote we are going to have, where I hope everyone votes to disagree with \nwhat the House did because what the House did is it stripped out of the \nbill this very important language that deals with Roe v. Wade.\n  What did it say? The decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade was \nappropriate and secures an important right and such decisions should \nnot be overturned.\n  It just shows you the real desire of the anti-choice Members of the \nCongress. They could have taken this language, which has no force of \nlaw--it is a basic statement, an important statement, a crucial \nstatement, in my opinion, but it has no force of law. It doesn't say we \nsay Roe v. Wade shall never be overturned and we pass legislation which \nembodies Roe. We have not done that. I wish we could, I hope\n\n[[Page S11599]]\n\nwe will, and I think some day we will. I think it is going to take a \npro-choice President, but I think some day we will make Roe a law that \nis actually signed rather than just a court decision. I have offered \nbills to do that. We have not moved forward because we have had to \nfight off so many other attempts to restrict Roe.\n  Indeed, the House could have taken the bill which bans this procedure \nwithout a health exception with this language, and it would have been \non the President's desk. But they are so against Roe--that is what this \nis all about--that they had to strip it out, even to slow down the \nbill.\n  That is what we are here today discussing: whether the House was \nright to strip out this sense-of-the-Senate Harkin amendment. We have \nhad a good debate so far. We have some time left. Senator DeWine is \ngoing to speak for the rest of the time this morning, and we will have \nmore time to finish our debate, whether it is before the storm comes or \nafter the storm comes. I don't know how we will resolve that situation.\n  We will have more debate. It is a very important debate. It is an \nimportant debate because before Roe became the law of the land, women \ndied. One could argue how many. I am not going to get into the \nargument. I have evidence it was 5,000. Senator Santorum says his \nevidence is it is 85. One is too many.\n  Abortion should be legal in the very early stages, as Roe says. After \nthat, the State should be able to come in and set rules and to say \nafter viability one cannot have any abortion, except to save the life \nand health of the woman. That is the bottom line of Roe, and that is \nwhy we are arguing so strongly that this Senate should go on record \ndisagreeing with what the House did so that when this bill goes over \nacross the street to the Supreme Court they can look at this record, \nwhich we will make sure they look at, and see that the Senate, while \nvoting to ban this procedure without a health exception, also said do \nnot overturn Roe.\n  To me, that is a signal to the Supreme Court that they should rule \nthe bill unconstitutional. We would have been happy to vote for that \nbill with the health exception. I do not understand why a group that \ncalls itself pro-life will not stand up for the life and health of a \nwoman. I do not understand it.\n  Look, I respect it because this is America and everyone has a right \nto his or her opinion, as strong as it may be. I do not mind that. I \nthink it is great. It is what makes our democracy great, that we can \nhave these debates and discussions, but I do not understand how a \nmovement that calls itself pro-life can be that disinterested in the \nhealth and the lives of women.\n  Women are not just vessels that carry babies to term. Women are human \nbeings who deserve to be respected, admired. They need dignity. A woman \ndoes not just say, oh, I woke up one morning; I do not want this baby \nat the late stage; I think I will change my mind. If my colleagues \nthink that about women, they do not know women. We are the nurturers.\n  Roe v. Wade was a decision that weighed the rights of women with all \nthe other rights that compete, and it came up with what I consider to \nbe a very wise and moderate decision, which is before viability a woman \nhas the right to choose and Senator Boxer, Senator DeWine, Senator \nSantorum, no Senator, no matter how powerful, no House Member, no \nPresident has a right to get involved in the decision that she makes \nwith her doctor, her God, and her loved ones.\n  We are not her loved ones. I know we want to be loved by everyone--\nmost politicians do--but I can guarantee, we are not. We do not belong \nin the lives of our citizens at a point where the Court has clearly \nstated that they have the right and respect to make that choice \nthemselves.\n  So what did Senator Harkin do? He said: Let us have an amendment that \nsays Roe v. Wade should not be overturned. We did it. We passed it and \nthe House stripped it out. We are saying we want to vote to disagree \nwith the House. This is Roe:\n\n     . . . the preservation of the life or the health of the \n     mother--\n\n  Must always be considered.\n  I am very happy I was able to place into the Record the scientific \narticles which stated that, in fact, there were 5,000 women who died \nevery year of illegal abortions. I pointed out that I do not trust \nnumbers from the Government when the Government was about prosecuting \npeople who had abortions. So I do not trust those particular numbers at \nthat time.\n\n  I also was able to place into the Record a number of articles, a \nnumber of letters, testimony from doctors who deal with these issues \nevery day, not Senators who make up and do this for politics but \ndoctors who take the Hippocratic oath to do no harm to their patients, \nwho are telling us, please, do not go down this path; you are \njeopardizing the lives of women.\n  The Supreme Court is going to get this case, but I hope the Supreme \nCourt also will note that we voted overwhelmingly to disagree with what \nthe House did by stripping out the Harkin amendment that simply says \nRoe should not be overturned.\n  I yield back my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, as well as Senator Brownback, \nSenator Graham of South Carolina, and Majority Leader Frist for their \nunending and unwavering efforts to put a permanent end to this horrible \npartial-birth abortion procedure.\n  During the time we have served together in this body, they have never \ngiven up hope that this Congress and this country would put an end to \nthis barbaric procedure.\n  Let me also thank my colleague from the State of Ohio, Congressman \nChabot, for his tremendous work in this area as well. He has remained \ndedicated and continues to be focused on this effort.\n  It is time that this Senate, this Congress, this country banned a \nprocedure that is inhumane and that has absolutely no medical purpose \nand that is, quite simply, morally reprehensible. There is no debate \nabout these facts. There is no debate about what takes place during a \npartial-birth abortion. I submit to my colleagues that the more we know \nabout this procedure, the worse it is. The more we know about it, the \nclearer it is that we must oppose it. The more we know about it, the \neasier it is to ban it once and for all.\n  This is a procedure in which the abortionist pulls a living baby feet \nfirst out of the womb and into the birth canal, except for the head, \nwhich the abortionist purposely keeps lodged just inside the cervix. As \nmany of us have explained in detail on this Senate floor before, the \nabortionist then punctures the base of the baby's skull with a long \nscissors-like surgical instrument and then inserts a tube into the womb \nremoving the baby's brain with a powerful suction machine. This causes \nthe skull to collapse, after which the abortionist completes the \ndelivery of the now-dead baby.\n\n  These are the essential facts. No one has ever come to the Senate \nfloor to dispute these facts. This is what a partial-birth abortion is. \nNo one can deny the facts. I can think of nothing more inhumane and \nindifferent to the human condition.\n  Every year the tragic effect of this extreme indifference to human \nlife becomes more and more apparent as the procedure is performed all \nover this country. It is also, of course, performed in my home State of \nOhio and actually performed within 20 miles of my home in Ohio. I have \nspoken on the Senate floor many times before about two particular \npartial-birth abortions that occurred in Ohio, and I will take a few \nminutes to recount these tragedies again. They were two typical \npartial-birth abortions, typical except for the way they turned out.\n  On April 6, 1999, in Dayton, OH, a woman entered the Dayton Medical \nCenter to undergo a partial-birth abortion. This facility was and \ntragically continues to be operated by Dr. Martin Haskell, one of the \nmain providers of partial-birth abortions in this entire country. \nUsually, the partial-birth abortion procedure takes place behind closed \ndoors where it can be ignored, where people do not really know much \nabout it, but in this particular case the procedure was different. \nThere was light shed upon it.\n  This is what happened, and this is how light was shed upon it: This \nDayton abortionist inserted a surgical instrument into the woman to \ndilate her\n\n[[Page S11600]]\n\ncervix so the child could eventually be removed and then killed. We \nhave to understand that this procedure usually takes 3 or 4 days. This \nis not a quick procedure. It takes 3 days to do it. The woman went home \nto Cincinnati, expecting to return for the completion of the procedure \nin 2 or 3 days.\n\n  In this case, though, her cervix dilated too quickly and, as a \nresult, shortly after midnight of that day she was admitted to the \nBethesda North Hospital of Cincinnati, in her hometown, and the child \nwas born. The medical technician pointed out the child was alive but, \nsadly, apparently the chance of the baby's survival was slim and after \n3 hours and 8 minutes the baby died.\n  The baby was named Hope. On the death certificate, of course, there \nis a space for cause of death or method of death. In the case of baby \nHope, the method of death is listed as ``natural.''\n  We, of course, know that is not true. We know all the facts. There \nwas nothing natural about the events that led to the death of this tiny \nlittle child because baby Hope did not die of natural causes. Baby Hope \ndied the victim of a barbaric procedure that is opposed by the vast \nmajority of the American people. In fact, a Gallup poll conducted in \nJanuary of this year shows well over 70 percent of the American people \nwant to see this procedure permanently banned because the American \npeople know it is wrong. They feel strongly about it. We as a Senate, \nMembers of the Congress, should listen to the American people. But more \nimportantly, besides listening to the American people, we need to \nlisten to our own conscience. We know this is wrong.\n  To almost underscore the inhumanity of this procedure, 4 months later \nit happened again; again in Ohio, again with the same abortionist. This \ntime, though, something quite different occurred. Once again, in \nDayton, this time on August 18, 1999, a woman who was 25 weeks pregnant \nwent to Dr. Haskell's office for a partial-birth abortion. As usual, \nthe abortionist performed the preparatory steps for this barbaric \nprocedure by dilating the mother's cervix. The next day, the woman went \ninto labor and was rushed to Good Samaritan Hospital--again, not what \nwas expected.\n  Remember, the procedure normally takes 3 full days, but she was \nrushed there in labor. This time, however, despite the massive trauma \nto this baby's environment, a miracle occurred and, by the grace of \nGod, this little baby survived and, quite appropriately, she is today \ncalled baby Grace.\n  These types of tragedies have been recounted by medical professionals \nwho have been shocked by the events. There are other stories I would \nlike to tell the Members of the Senate.\n  Brenda Pratt Shafer, a registered nurse, was assigned to an Ohio \nabortion clinic in the early 1990s. She was assigned to the same Dr. \nHaskell abortion clinic.\n  Nurse Shafer observed Dr. Haskell use the procedure, this procedure, \nto abort babies. In fact, she testified about it before our Senate \nJudiciary Committee in 1995. I would like to share with my colleagues \nwhat she said because she gave--this nurse did--very gripping, very \ntelling testimony. Nurse Shafer described a partial-birth abortion she \nwitnessed on a child of 26\\1/2\\ weeks. This is what she observed:\n\n       The young woman was 18, unmarried, and a little over 6 \n     months pregnant. She cried the entire 3 days she was at the \n     abortion clinic. The doctor told us I am afraid she is going \n     to want to see the baby. Try to discourage her from it. We \n     don't like them to see their babies.\n\n  Nurse Shafer continues:\n\n       Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's \n     legs and pulled them down into the birth canal. Then he \n     delivered the baby's body and arms, everything but the head. \n     The doctor kept the head right inside the uterus. The baby's \n     little fingers were clasping and unclasping, his little feet \n     were kicking. The baby was hanging there and the doctor was \n     holding his neck to keep his head from slipping out. The \n     doctor took a pair of scissors and inserted them into the \n     back of the baby's head and the baby's arm jerked out with a \n     flinch, a startle reaction like a baby does when he thinks he \n     might fall. The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-\n     powered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's \n     brains out.\n       Now the baby went completely limp. He cut the umbilical \n     cord and delivered the placenta. He threw the baby into a pan \n     along with the placenta and the instruments he had just used. \n     I saw the baby move in the pan. I asked the other nurse and \n     she said it was just reflexes. The baby boy had the most \n     perfect angelic face I think I have ever seen in my life.\n       When the mother started coming around, she was crying. ``I \n     want to see my baby,'' she said. So we cleaned him up and put \n     him into a blanket. We put her in a private room and handed \n     her the baby. She held that baby in her arms, and when she \n     looked into his face, she started screaming: ``Oh, my God, \n     what have I done? This is my baby. This is my baby.''\n\n  It is my prayer that there will come a day when I don't have to \nretell Nurse Shafer's story, that there will come a day when my \ncolleagues, like Senator Santorum and Senator Brownback, the Presiding \nOfficer, Majority Leader Frist, and the rest of us who have fought this \nbattle will not have to come to the Senate floor and talk about \npartial-birth abortion. Nobody wants to talk about this. But until that \nday comes when this procedure has been outlawed in our country once and \nfor all, we will have to continue to fight against this ghastly \nprocedure.\n  Now is the time to ban this awful procedure. It simply is the right \nthing to do. This Senate must do that.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWine pertaining to the introduction of S. 1629 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to have the time until Senator \nBoxer returns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am pleased to join with Senators Boxer and Harkin in \nthe debate to reaffirm the protections guaranteed to women in the \nlandmark Roe v. Wade decision.\n  Let's be clear: The Republican leadership is trying to do something \nextraordinary on the Senate floor, something everyone who cares about \nthe Constitution and women's rights should pay attention to. They have \nalready done it in the House. The Senate, now, is the last line of \ndefense.\n  It is helpful if we look at the history of this debate to see why the \nRepublican approach is a threat to women's constitutionally protected \nrights. Earlier this year, the Senate debated the so-called partial-\nbirth abortion ban. I joined with many of my colleagues in speaking \nagainst that proposal. I noted the bill was unconstitutional based on \nthe Supreme Court's ruling in Stenberg v. Carhart. In that case, the \nSupreme Court struck down a similar law in Nebraska because it was too \nbroad and because it did not include an exception for women's health.\n  We made that case in the Senate, but we were repeatedly turned back. \nWe also offered reasonable amendments to make sure this legislation \nwould not threaten the lives or the health of women and to reduce the \nnumber of abortions in America. Opponents rejected almost all of our \namendments. That showed me their real goal was not to reduce the number \nof abortions or to protect women but to use the power in Congress to \noverturn Roe v. Wade.\n  As the debate continued in the Senate, my suspicion was confirmed. \nFor example, I introduced a prevention amendment to reduce the number \nof abortions. My amendment would have provided contraceptive equity in \nhealth plans, expanded education about emergency contraceptives, made \nemergency contraceptives available in the emergency rooms for victims \nof rape, and would have offered CHIP health insurance coverage to \nprotect women. My amendment was defeated on a budget point of order.\n  Senator Feinstein offered an amendment to protect the health of a \nwoman. That amendment was defeated as well. That brings us now to the \nHarkin-Boxer amendment and the reason we are having a debate today. \nThat amendment reaffirmed the Senate's support for the Roe v. Wade \ndecision. It passed the Senate with a bipartisan vote of 52 to 46. The \nSenate was firmly on the record supporting the Roe decision. \nEventually, that so-called partial-birth abortion bill passed the \nSenate, including the language supporting Roe.\n  Then something happened, something completely undermined the will of \nthis Senate. The Republican leadership tried to bring up the House \nversion of the bill and send it to conference. Many Members objected. \nThat is why we are here today, to completely disregard the will of the \nSenate. To disregard the fundamental rights afforded\n\n[[Page S11601]]\n\nall women in this country by the United States Supreme Court is \nunacceptable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion and send the amendment \nback to conference. The Senate needs to send the right message to the \nSupreme Court and to women across this country--that their inherent \nright of privacy and their right to make reproductive health care \ndecisions will not be jeopardized. This is another attempt to \ncircumvent the Supreme Court's ruling in the Stenberg v. Carhart case. \nThe authors of this bill tried to get around the law of the land by \ninserting a section of congressional findings in their unconstitutional \nbill. These findings dispute the basis for the Supreme Court's \ndecision, and they state that Congress finds the partial-birth abortion \nban legislation to be constitutional.\n  The authors of this legislation claim that congressional findings are \nall that is necessary to ensure a law is constitutional. That is a bit \noptimistic on their part, and it ignores past congressional findings \nthat were ignored by the Court.\n  The Court struck down the Nebraska law for one reason. It did not \ncontain any consideration for the health of the woman as prescribed in \nthe original Roe decision.\n  Telling the Court that Congress does not find women's health to be \nimportant does not meet the constitutional test.\n  It is somewhat surprising that opponents of this motion would now \nargue that talking about Roe or the constitution protections provided \nin Roe is not relevant.\n  One of the reasons I opposed S. 3, the so-called Partial Birth \nAbortion Act, was because I know this legislation is unconstitutional. \nIt simply does not meet the constitutional test that requires providing \nsome consideration for the health of the woman.\n  The Court has been extremely clear on this point.\n  We are voting to ban a legal, safe medical procedure that is used to \nsave the life and health of women. Proponents of this legislation will \nargue that S. 3 does not undermine Roe, that it does not jeopardize a \nwoman's life or health, and that it simply bans one procedure. I think \nwe all know the true objective here. It is to overturn Roe piece by \npiece.\n  The other side claims they are not seeking to overturn Roe but, \nrather, to protect women and the unborn. If they really believe this \nand they are not concerned with a constitutional challenge, they should \nsupport the Harkin-Boxer amendment. This amendment should be part of \nany final legislation.\n  I think it is important to discuss what Roe did and did not say.\n  I often hear that Roe allows for abortion on demand at any stage of \nthe pregnancy. That is simply not true. The Justices worked very hard \nto achieve a balance between the privacy of the woman and the interests \nof the state. They found this balance by distinguishing between pre- \nand post-viability. The underlying issue in Roe was privacy.\n  The Roe case built on the precedent established in Griswold v. \nConnecticut, which outlawed State laws that criminalized or hindered \nthe use of contraception because they violated the right to privacy.\n  In the Roe decision, the Supreme Court used this same right of \nprivacy to prohibit laws that banned abortions performed before \nviability. After viability, the Court did rule that the State does have \na prevailing interest to restrict abortion, which is why so few \nabortions are performed late in pregnancy. Eighty-eight percent of \nabortions are performed before the end of the first trimester of \npregnancy, and 98 percent occur during the first 20 weeks.\n  What the Court said regarding post-viability is that the State could \nrestrict access, but the law must include a health and life exception. \nThe Supreme Court found that the State's right to restrict or regulate \nabortion could not--and let me repeat, could not--jeopardize the life \nor health of the woman.\n  It is disheartening to me that efforts to overturn or restrict the \nrights afforded in the Roe decision often exclude any consideration for \nthe life or health of the woman.\n  I have heard supporters of S. 3 claim that so-called partial-birth \nabortions jeopardize a woman's health and are never necessary to \nprotect the health of the woman. If anyone doubts that Roe was not \nimportant for the life and health of a woman, they should consider the \nworld before Roe.\n  In 1973, abortion, except to save a woman's life, was banned in \nnearly two-thirds of our States. An estimated 1.2 million women each \nyear were forced to resort to illegal abortion, despite the risks \nassociated with unsanitary conditions, incompetent treatment, \ninfection, and hemorrhage.\n  Because the procedure was illegal, there is no exact figure on the \nnumber of deaths caused by illegal abortions in the U.S. One estimate \nthat was made before 1973 attributed 5,000 deaths a year to illegal \nabortions.\n  According to a 1967 study, induced abortion was the most common \nsingle cause of maternal mortality in California. The number of deaths \nper 100,000 legal abortion procedures declined from 4.1 percent to 0.6 \npercent between 1973 and 1997. The choices women had prior to 1973 were \noften the choice between life and death.\n  The Roe decision, coupled with the Griswald decision that gave women \nthe right to contraceptives, finally gave women full and just \nreproductive choice.\n  But again the Roe decision does not allow for abortion on demand. The \ndecision placed the appropriate restrictions on late-term abortions \nwithout forcing women into the back alleys.\n  Currently, 41 States have laws that restrict or ban post-viability \nabortions, except to save the life and health of the woman. This is \nconsistent with Roe. Clearly, Roe did not result in abortion on demand \nat any stage in the pregnancy.\n  today we are ready to turn back much of what was achieved in Roe by \nbanning a safe medical procedure at any stage of the pregnancy \nregardless of the threat to the woman. S. 3 removes any consideration \nof the health of the woman. Personally, I believe the Court will strike \ndown this misguided legislation when it passes. However, we should send \nthe right message to the Court that the U.S. Congress supports the Roe \ndecision and believes that the right of privacy is an important \nprotection for all Americans.\n  I am fortunate to represent a State that has twice voted to reaffirm \nRoe and to protect a woman's right to reproductive choice. In fact, in \n1998, a similar effort to ban a safe and legal abortion procedure was \ndefeated in Washington State. People in Washington State understand the \nneed to provide for the health and the life of a woman.\n  In fact, a recent ABC News poll shows a majority of Americans support \na health exception for the woman for late-term abortion. The poll--\nwhich was just conducted in July--asked, if a late-term abortion would \nprevent a serious threat to the woman, should it be legal? Twenty \npercent said it should be legal in all cases, 41 percent said it should \nbe legal if health is threatened--a total of 61 percent. This poll \nshows what many of us believe, that a woman's health is an important \nfactor and consideration.\n  This motion will give Members the chance to cast their vote either in \nsupport of Roe or in support of overturning this landmark decision. If \nyou believe that women in this country should be afforded full \nreproductive choice, then you must vote to ensure that the Harkin-Boxer \namendment remain part of any final conference agreement on S. 3. If you \noppose this amendment, you are saying that you do not believe that the \nConstitution provides women with the right of privacy and that there \nshould be no consideration for the health and life of the woman.\n  I hope we don't turn back the clock on the floor of the Senate and \nplace women in this country at risk again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11601-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11601-S11605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ROE ROE. V. WADE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I express my cooperation, sense of \nsolidarity with my colleague from California, Mrs. Boxer, and others \nunder very unusual procedural circumstances. In my almost 24 years in \nthe Senate, I cannot recall ever rising to speak on a motion to \ndisagree with a House amendment on a Senate bill and request a \nconference. As all of my colleagues know, these motions are rarely if \never debated. They are routinely adopted. And\n\n[[Page S11602]]\n\nwhile this particular motion may well be adopted today or tomorrow \nthere is nothing routine about it, because what we're discussing is one \nof the most divisive issues this country has ever faced--the issue of \nabortion, and specifically, the issue of whether or not the decision \nreached in Roe v. Wade should be the prevailing law of the land.\n  When this legislation was initially before the Senate, Senators \nHarkin and Boxer introduced a simple sense of the Senate amendment that \nstated Roe v. Wade was a fair and balanced affirmation of a woman's \nconstitutional right to privacy and self-determination. Of course, as \nSenator Boxer has pointed out, a woman's right to choose is not \nunlimited. As Roe v. Wade held, once a fetus becomes viable from a \nmedical point of view, abortions may be regulated, although States must \nallow abortions when necessary to preserve a woman's life or health. \nPerhaps that's why a majority of Americans continue to support Roe v. \nWade. Most Americans believe that this most difficult of decisions is, \nas an initial matter, best made in private by a woman and those with \nwhom she chooses to share in the making of her decision--her doctor, \nher family, and her loved ones.\n  Most Americans believe that politicians are ill-equipped to \nunderstand the unique, complex, and often wrenching factors that so \noften bear on whether or not a woman decides to terminate a pregnancy. \nAnd most Americans believe that abortion should be as it has \nconsistently been for the past 30 years--safe, legal, and rare.\n  There are those among my colleagues in the House and Senate who do \nnot support the Harkin-Boxer language because they do not support Roe \nv. Wade. That is certainly their right, and they are entitled to the \nviews they hold. In this Senator's view, however, eroding Roe v. Wade \nor repealing it outright would be a mistake of historic proportions, \nwith devastating consequences for American women.\n  The history of our Nation is one of securing and protecting freedoms \nand inalienable rights that we are all entitled to as American \ncitizens. Eviscerating the rights annunciated by Roe v. Wade would run \ncounter to this historic trend in our Nation's life. I look back on \nhistory and think about other times when attempts were made to repeal \ncivil and privacy rights our citizens possessed. Obviously, prohibition \ncomes to mind. We all know it was a social failure that resulted in the \nunregulated production of distilled spirits and other alcoholic \nsubstances that jeopardized the health of countless Americans. I think \nof the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, when tens \nof thousands of citizens were taken forcibly from their homes and \nlivelihoods, and stripped of nearly all their possessions simply \nbecause of their ethnicity. And, of course, I think of our country in \nthe aftermath of the Civil War, when the thirteenth, fourteenth, and \nfifteenth amendments to the Constitution--promising the full blessings \nof equality to all Americans regardless of race--were followed by a \ncentury of Jim Crow laws designed to deny those blessings to tens of \nmillions of Americans.\n  Surely, eroding or repealing Roe v. Wade would be considered a step \nof equal gravity and error because it would deprive half our population \nof a right that, while not unlimited, is fundamental to being an \nAmerican.\n  What would the implications of denying this right be? One need not \nlook further than when abortions were deemed illegal in this country--\nbefore Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. Women were forced to seek \nabortions in back alleys and basements. Women were forced to seek \nabortion by many people wholly unqualified to perform the procedure. \nAnd we all know the results were disastrous to women in this country--\nuntold numbers of whom suffered sickness, permanent disability, and \ndeath.\n  Surely, this not the kind of America we want for the women of our \ncountry, nor is it the kind of America we want for men who have wives, \ndaughters, sisters, and nieces. Therefore, as this bill moves forward, \nI hope a majority of our colleagues will continue to support the \nconstitutional protections given to women under Roe v. Wade.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, earlier this year, the Senate passed S. \n3, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. I opposed that bill and instead \nsupported a constitutionally sound alternative offered by my colleague, \nSenator Durbin. The Durbin alternative would ban post-viability \nabortions unless the woman's life is a risk or the procedure is \nnecessary to protect the woman from grievous injury to her physical \nhealth.\n  I understand that people on all sides of this issue hold sincere and \nstrongly held views. I respect the deeply held views of those who \noppose abortion under any circumstances. Like most Americans, I would \nprefer to live in a world where abortion is unnecessary. I support \nefforts to reduce the number of abortions through family planning and \ncounseling to avoid unintended pregnancies. I have always believed that \ndecisions in this area are best handled by the individuals involved, in \nconsultation with their doctors and guided by their own beliefs and \nunique circumstances, rather than by Government mandates.\n  I support Roe v. Wade, which means that I agree that the Government \ncan restrict abortions only when there is a compelling State interest \nat stake. I feel very strongly that Congress should seek to regulate \nabortions only within the constitutional parameters set forth by the \nU.S. Supreme Court. That is why I supported the inclusion of language \nin S. 3 reaffirming the Senate's commitment to Roe and its belief that \nRoe should not be overturned. The Senate had a straight up-or-down vote \non the Harkin amendment, and a majority of the Senate agreed to support \nthe Harking amendment.\n  The House was wrong to remove this language during its consideration \nof the bill. I sincerely hope that the final version of this bill that \ngoes to the President's desk for his signature contains this important \nreaffirmation of Roe v. Wade.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nbill before us, S. 3. I voted against this bill and I do not intend to \nsupport the House position.\n  When the Senate passed this bill, we added an important amendment \noffered by our colleague Senator Harkin. The amendment reaffirmed \nsupport for the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. The only \ndifference between S. 3 as the Senate passed it and then as the House \npassed it is Senator Harkin's amendment. The House stripped Senator \nHarkin's amendment from the bill.\n  Since the Harkin amendment was a sense of the Senate and does not \nhave the force of law, I must ask, why did the House remove this \nlanguage? It does nothing to fix the harmful policy the underlying bill \nwould establish.\n  The Republican leadership and their anti-choice friends would like \nyou to believe that removing the Harkin language is just a procedural \nmotion. Don't be fooled. Stripping S. 3 of the Harkin amendment \nreaffirming Roe v. Wade shows us what the President and his anti-choice \nallies are really after. They want to overturn Roe v. Wade; S. 3 puts \nthem on that path.\n  A woman's right to choose is in greater danger now than it has been \nat any other time since the Supreme Court issued Roe v. Wade 30 years \nago. The House's action neatly comports with an overtly anti-choice \nadministration striving to undermine reproductive freedom.\n  I thank Senator Boxer for offering the motion to disagree to the \nHouse action so that, at a minimum, we have an opportunity to talk \nabout what is really going on.\n  The underlying bill makes a pretense of protecting women but really, \nwhat we have here is a bill that takes away rights while doing nothing \nto help anyone. There is no such medical term as ``partial-birth'' \nabortion, and that is intentional. The anti-choice zealots who drafted \nthat term want the bill to be ambiguous so it will have a chilling \neffect on physicians.\n  If S. 3 is ultimately passed and President Bush signs it into law--he \nwill become the first U.S. President to criminalize safe medical \nprocedures.\n  Nobody is fooled by the real objective of S. 3 to chip away at a \nwoman's right to choose, to criminalize legal and safe abortion \nprocedures.\n  This bill isn't even constitutional. There is no exception for the \nhealth of the mother. When we debated this bill back in March those of \nus who are pro-choice said we will accept this bill if\n\n[[Page S11603]]\n\nyou make an exception for the life and health of the mother. Yet \nsponsors have repeatedly resisted pro-choice lawmakers' attempts to \ninclude a health exception such as the Feinstein substitute, which was \ndefeated.\n  Five members of the current Supreme Court have invoked Roe to \ninvalidate a State ban on so-called partial-birth abortions.\n  During last night's debate, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania \ncharacterized the Harkin amendment--a reaffirmation of current law--as \nextreme. That is absurd. Not being will to protect a woman's health is \nextreme. It is extreme and it is wrong.\n  Taking away the freedom of women to make choices about their own \nreproductive health--that sounds like one of the reasons why we kicked \nthe Taliban out of Afghanistan.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this ill-disguised attempt to overturn \nRoe v. Wade.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Harkin/\nBoxer motion and the Roe v. Wade decision that was made by the Supreme \nCourt over 30 years ago.\n  The Supreme Court's acknowledgment of the fundamental ``right to \nprivacy'' in our Constitution gave every woman the right to decide what \nto do with her own body. Since that historic day, women all across the \ncountry and the world have had improved access to reproductive health \ncare and services.\n  In March, the Senate passed a resolution supporting Roe v. Wade \nduring the debate of the partial birth abortion bill. The resolution \nshould be retained in the bill during conference. The Roe v. Wade \ndecision is important to women's rights, women's health and public \nhealth.\n  Because efforts have been made over the years to educate and inform \nwomen about their choices, unwanted pregnancies are at their lowest \nlevels since 1974. Teenage pregnancies have declined almost 50 percent \nsince 1987.\n  While Roe v. Wade is still the law of the land today, it has been \nsystematically challenged and weakened. What stands today is a hollowed \nversion of one of our Nation's most important accomplishments for \nwomen. What keeps Roe from vanishing altogether is our unwavering \ncommitment to protect a women's right to choice.\n  I strongly support a woman's right to choose and have fought to \nimprove women's health during the more than two decades I have served \nin Congress. Whether it is establishing offices of women's health, \nfighting for coverage of contraceptives, or requiring Federal quality \nstandards for mammography, I will continue the fight to improve women's \nhealth.\n  I believe that this bill is the first step in a plan by the \nleadership of this Congress to overturn Roe v. Wade. Congress must \nprotect a woman's freedom of choice that was handed down by the Supreme \nCourt over 30 years ago.\n  This Congress must not turn back the clock on reproductive choice for \nwomen. I urge my colleagues to retain the resolution in support of Roe \nv. Wade in the final bill.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the motion \nto proceed to conference on the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. We \npassed the legislation to ban this barbaric procedure on March 13, \n2003, by a vote of 64 to 33, and I am shocked that we are back on the \nSenate floor in September, still debating whether to send this bill to \nconference. Just imagine the number of lives we could have saved if we \nhad sent this bill to the President 6 months ago, when we first passed \nit.\n  The subject of partial-birth abortion is not a new one for me. Eight \nyears ago, when I was Governor of Ohio, we were the first State to pass \na partial-birth abortion ban, which was unfortunately struck down by \nthe courts. Subsequent to that, I watched the partial birth abortion \nban make its way through the 104th and 105th Congresses, only to be \nvetoed by President Clinton. After I arrived in the Senate in the 106th \nCongress, I gave a speech in support of a partial birth abortion ban \nthat passed both Chambers, but never made it to conference. We cannot \nlet this happen again. Now is the time to get this done.\n  During debate on this bill, I listened to my colleagues quote \nstatistics and spout off facts about medical necessity and the health \nof the mother. We can all quote different statistics, but the bottom \nline is that there is no need for this procedure. Most of these partial \nbirth abortions are elective. They take 3 days to complete and are \nnever medically necessary. If a mother really needs an abortion, she \nhas alternatives available to her that are not as torturous as partial \nbirth abortion.\n  The victims of the partial birth abortions are human beings. I find \nit interesting that they are sometimes called living fetuses. Whether \nthey are called babies or fetuses, no one seems to dispute the fact \nthat they are living. In fact, they are human babies and they can feel \npain. When partial birth abortions are performed, these babies are just \n3 inches away from life and, for that matter, seconds away.\n  I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote to send this bill to \nconference and stand up against what I refer to as human infanticide. \nThis is not a vote on Roe v. Wade. This is a vote to eliminate a \nhorrible procedure that should be outlawed in this country. In his \nState of the Union Address this year, President Bush again pledged to \nsupport the legislation and said, ``We must not overlook the weakest \namong us. I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of their birth \nand end the practice of partial birth abortion.''\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this motion so we can send a \nbill to the President that will finally ban partial birth abortions in \nthe United States of America.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the issue of \nprotecting a woman's right to choose. I am here to reiterate what the \nmajority of us in the Senate clearly expressed this spring on behalf of \nwomen when we voted on an amendment to S. 3, sponsored by the good \nSenator from Iowa, my colleague Senator Harkin.\n  That amendment--in no uncertain terms--reaffirmed the sense of the \nSenate that No. 1, abortion has been a legal and constitutionally \nprotected medical procedure throughout the United States since the \nSupreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade; and No. 2, the 1973 Supreme \nCourt decision in Roe v. Wade established constitutionally based limits \non the power of States to restrict the right of a woman to choose to \nterminate a pregnancy.\n  Furthermore, the amendment firmly laid out the sense of the Senate \nthat the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade was appropriate \nand secures an important constitutional right and that the decision \nshould not be overturned.\n  Let me repeat that. A majority of my colleagues voted for the Senator \nHarkin amendment. That the House remove the amendment from S. 3 is a \ntravesty and I must vehemently disagree with that action. It is \nincumbent upon the majority of those of us in this chamber who affirm \nthe constitutional right to choose to send a clear message to the House \nas the bill goes to conference that Roe is still--and will continue to \nbe--the supreme law of the land. My colleague from the State of \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, has been a true champion on this issue. She \nis an unwavering and tireless advocate for women, the country--and the \nworld over. On Monday, she revisited how we found ourselves in the \nposition we are now. As Senator Boxer explained, the House returned S. \n3 to the Senate without the Harkin amendment affirming Roe.\n  Because S. 3 is at the heart of this issue, I would like to spend \nsome of my time speaking to this underlying bill, which is undoubtedly \nand unfortunately going to end up on the President's desk and which the \nPresident will most assuredly sign.\n  If the President signs S. 3, he will be signing an unconstitutional \nmeasure into law. As I have said before, and at the risk of sounding \nlike a broken record, Roe v. Wade held that women have a constitutional \nright to choose. However, after the point of viability--the point at \nwhich a baby can live outside its mother's body--States may ban \nabortion as long as they allow exceptions when a woman's life or health \nis in danger. Yet the legislation that comes before us and will go to \nthe President lacks that important health exception and, therefore, \nfails to provide for a woman when her health or her life is in danger.\n  In June 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced the importance of \nthis health exception in Stanberg v. Carhart, which determined that a \nNebraska law banning the performance of\n\n[[Page S11604]]\n\nso-called ``partial birth'' abortions violated the Roe ruling by the \nSupreme Court.\n  The Supreme Court has stated unequivocally that every abortion \nrestriction, including bans on so-called ``partial birth abortion,'' \nmust contain a health exception. The Court emphasized that, by failing \nto provide a health exception, the Nebraska law would place a woman's \nlife in danger.\n  That is exactly what the legislation before us today does as well: It \nplaces a woman's life in danger.\n  Despite the Supreme Court's very clear mandate, this underlying \nlegislation does not provide an exception for the health of the mother. \nFor this reason, this legislation, like the measure that was struck \ndown in Stenberg, is unconstitutional.\n  Moreover, this legislation imposes an undue burden on a woman's \nability to choose by banning abortion procedures at any stage in a \nwoman's pregnancy. This bill does not only ban post-viability \nabortions, it unconstitutionally restricts women's rights regardless of \nwhere the woman is in her pregnancy.\n  I fundamentally believe that private medical decision should be made \nby women in consultation with their doctors--not politicians. These \ndecisions include the methods by which a physician chooses to treat his \nor her patients. Why should we decide that here on the Senate floor? \nCongressional findings cannot possibly make up for medical consultation \nbetween a patient and her doctor, but this will would undermine a \nphysician's ability to determine the best course of treatment for a \npatient.\n  Physicians must be free to make clinical determinations, in \naccordance with medical standards of care, that best safeguard a \nwoman's life and health. Women and their families, along with their \ndoctors, are simply better than politicians at making decisions about \ntheir medical care. And I don't want to make those decisions for other \nwomen.\n  Three States, including my home State of Washington, have considered \nsimilar bans by referendum. All three failed. We considered this debate \nin my home State in 1998. The referendum failed decisively--by a vote \nof 57 to 43 percent.\n  These so-called ``partial birth'' abortion bans--whether the \nproposals that have been before the Senate in the past or the one \nbefore us today--are deliberately designed to erode the protections of \nRoe v. Wade, at the expense of women's health and at the expense of a \nwoman's right to privacy.\n  The Supreme Court, during the 30 years since it recognized the right \nto choose, has consistently required that when a State restricts access \nto abortion, a woman's health must be the absolute consideration. This \nlegislation does not only disavow the Supreme Court's explicit \ndirective, but the advice of the medical community, and the will of the \nAmerican people. We must continue to ensure that the woman of America \nhave the right to privacy and receive the best medical attention \navailable.\n  I urge my colleagues to disagree with the actions of the House and \ndemand that the amendment expressing the Sense of the Senate that Roe \nv. Wade was rightly decided be included in S. 3.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the motion to \ndisagree with the House message accompanying S. 3, the late-term \nabortion bill, and to speak today about a very important Supreme Court \ndecision: Roe vs. Wade.\n  A provision was included in the late-term abortion bill that passed \nthe Senate in March recognizing the importance of Roe v. Wade in \nsecuring the constitutional right to choose and stating that this \ndecision should not be overturned.\n  This provision was a simple Sense of the Senate resolution. Let me \nread its exact language:\n\n       (1) the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade (410 \n     U.S. 113 (1973)) was appropriate and secures an important \n     constitutional right; and\n       (2) such decision should not be overturned.\n\n  I am pleased that this amendment was added on a strong bipartisan \nvote of 52 to 46.\n  Unfortunately, though, the similar House-passed late-term abortion \nbill lacks this language. Indeed, the House refused to agree to it.\n  While I oppose both the House and Senate late-birth abortion bills \nbecause I believe that they are too broadly written, lack an exception \nfor women's health, and are flagrantly unconstitutional, I strongly \nsupport the Roe v. Wade language we added to the Senate-passed bill. \nThat is why I plan to vote for the motion to disagree today.\n  The past 30 years, since the Supreme Court upheld a woman's right to \nchoose, have brought a great deal of change for women in America. Some \nof that has been good, while some has not been so good.\n  But now, in 2003, the right to choose is under attack--and more so, I \nbelieve, than any other time during the last 30 years. It's easy to \ntake the right to choose for granted. For many women, it is all they \nhave ever known. The option has always been available. I lived during a \ntime, however, when an estimated 1.2 million women each year resorted \nto illegal, back-alley abortions despite the possibility of infection \nand death. I remember that time very vividly. In college during the \n1950s, I knew young women who found themselves pregnant with no \noptions. I even knew a woman who committed suicide because she was \npregnant and abortion was illegal in the U.S. I also remember the \npassing of a collection plate in my college dormitory so that another \nfriend could go to Mexico for an abortion.\n  Later, in the 1960s, I spent 8 days a year for 5 years sentencing \nwomen to California prisons. I even sentenced individuals who performed \nabortions because, at that time, abortion was still illegal in my \nState.\n  I remember these cases particularly well. I remember the crude \ninstruments used. I remember women who were horribly damaged by illegal \nabortions. In fact, the only way a case really came to the attention of \nthe authorities was if the woman getting the abortion died or was \nseverely injured.\n  I will never forget one woman whom I sentenced to 10 years--the \nmaximum sentence because she had been in and out of State institutions \nseveral times. I asked her why she continued to perform abortions. She \nsaid,\n\n       Because women are in such trouble and they have no other \n     place to go, so they came to me because they know I would \n     take care of them.\n\n  Not a year has gone by since I became U.S. Senator that some \nlegislator hasn't proposed legislation that would compromise this \nright--that would return us to the days of the 50s, 60s, and early 70s. \nBut, fortunately, we have been able to beat back many of these \nattempts, either in Congress or in the courts.\n  What concerns me the most about the debate we are having today about \nRoe v. Wade is that it is the beginning of a long march to take women \nback 35 years, back to the passing of the plate at Stanford, back to \nthe back-alley abortions and trips to Mexico, and back to the time when \nwomen could not control their own bodies.\n  What we are hearing today is that some Senators are so uncomfortable \nwith the right to choose that they want to strip out language that \nrecognizes the importance of Roe v. Wade and that States, consistent \nwith current Supreme Court jurisprudence and settled caselaw, that the \ndecision should not be overturned.\n  But it is because of Roe--and only because of Roe--that women have \nbeen able to decide over the past 30 years, in consultation with their \ndoctors, about whether to terminate a pregnancy in the first trimester \nwithout interference from the state or federal government.\n  Let me talk a little about this landmark opinion.\n  In 1973, in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decided that a woman's \nconstitutional right to privacy includes her qualified right to \nterminate her pregnancy.\n  The Court also established a trimester system to govern abortions. In \nthat system, in the first 12 to 15 weeks of a pregnancy--when 95.5 \npercent of all abortions occur and the procedure is medically the \nsafest--the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the \nwoman and her doctor.\n  In the second trimester, when the procedure in some situations poses \na greater health risk, States may regulate abortion, but only to \nprotect the health of the mother. This might mean, for example, \nrequiring that an abortion be performed in a hospital or performed by a \nlicensed physician.\n\n[[Page S11605]]\n\n  In the later stages of pregnancy, at the point the fetus becomes \nviable and is able to live independently from the mother, the state has \na strong interest in protecting potential human life. States may, if \nthey choose, regulate and even prohibit abortion except where necessary \nto preserve the life or health of the woman.\n  In 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court \nspecifically reaffirmed Roe's standard for evaluating restrictions on \nabortion after viability but eliminated Roe's trimester framework by \nexplicitly extending the state's interest in protecting potential life \nand maternal health to apply throughout the pregnancy.\n  Thus, under Casey, regulations that affect a woman's abortion \ndecision that further these state interests are valid unless they have \nthe ``purpose or effect'' of ``imposing a substantial obstacle'' in the \nwoman's path.\n  However, the bottom line is that in Casey the Court retained the \n``central holding'' of Roe v. Wade. As a result, women in all 50 States \nstill enjoy the constitutional right to choose.\n  The challenge for American men and women who support a pro-choice \nagenda will be to continue to make their voices heard in an environment \nthat appears focused on nullifying all reproductive rights and trying \nto overturn Roe after 30 years.\n  Roe v. Wade secured an important constitutional right--a right I \nstrongly support.\n  I am deeply concerned about passing a late-term birth abortion bill \nthat doesn't include language recognizing the importance of Roe. That \nis why I believe that we should disagree with the House message \naccompanying S. 3.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to support the language in the Senate-\npassed version of S. 3 regarding the importance of Roe v. Wade. We \ncannot--we must not--go back to a time without choice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the \nInterior and related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004. \nIn dollar terms, this is a modest bill compared to many of the \nappropriations bills we tackle in this body. It totals about $19.6 \nbillion in discretionary budget authority. But in terms of its direct \nimpact on the lives and livelihoods of the people and communities \nthroughout this country, it is a critical bill, and it is of particular \nimportance to the Western States, such as my State of Montana, where \nthe Department of the Interior and the Forest Service either own or \nmanage in trust vast acres of land.\n  These are lands where my constituents live. This is where they graze \nlivestock, where they mine, where they hike, hunt, fish, and timber. \nWhat we do in this bill affects all of those activities.\n  It is not just a public lands bill. It is also a bill that provides \neducation, health care, and other core services for the Native \nAmericans of America.\n  It supports energy research and development that fosters economic \ngrowth, strengthens our national security posture, and improves the \nquality of our environment. And it supports the treasured cultural \ninstitutions, such as the Smithsonian and the National Endowment for \nthe Humanities--institutions that help tell the story of America and \nthat remind us who we are as a people.\n  As I suspect is the case with many of my colleagues who have chaired \nappropriations subcommittees, the more I learn about the agencies \nfunded in this bill, the harder it gets to make tough choices that have \nto be made, particularly in the current fiscal climate.\n  The President's fiscal year 2004 budget request for the Interior bill \nwas $19.56 billion in discretionary budget authority, a modest increase \nover the comparable level for fiscal year 2003.\n  While the budget request included increases for several activities \nthat have considerable merit, it also proposed severe reductions in a \nnumber of critical programs that have broad support within the Senate. \nWith an allocation that is effectively the same as the President's \nrequest, we had to make some tough choices.\n  That said, with the help of Senator Dorgan, my good friend and \nneighbor from North Dakota, we have been able to fashion a responsible \nbill that does a number of very positive things.\n  The bill provides increases for the core operating programs of the \nland management agencies, including $72 million for our National Park \nSystem and $31 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service. The funds \nprovided for the park system include $20 million over the budget \nrequest to increase the base operating budgets of individual parks.\n  The bill also increases funding for Bureau of Land Management \noperations by $27 million and adds $34 million to the President's \nrequest for Forest Service activities.\n  From the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the bill appropriates $511 \nmillion. This includes $222 million for Federal land acquisition, an \nincrease of $35 million over the budget request and more than double \nthe House total of $100 million. As is always the case, there was great \ninterest in increasing funding for the land, water, and conservation \nprograms, but I think the amount provided is reasonable given the \nconstraints of the subcommittee allocation and the many other demands \non this bill.\n\n  The Interior bill also supports several grant programs. I won't go \nthrough all the numbers, but among\n\n[[Page S11606]]\n\nthe highlights is a $30 million increase over the budget request for \npayments in lieu of taxes; a $15 million increase for State wildlife \ngrants; and an increase of $9 million for the Historic Preservation \nFund. The bill also restores a proposed $16 million cut in the \nAbandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund.\n  Let me explain PILT, payment in lieu of taxes. This is the money that \ngoes directly to the counties to support their activities where a large \namount of Federal land is found--BLM land, anyway.\n  As I mentioned previously, the Interior bill is a vitally important \nbill for Native American communities. It increases funding for the \nIndian Health Service by $88 million over the enacted level, for a \ntotal of $2.9 billion.\n  It includes $574 million for Indian education programs which fully \nfunds the budget request for Indian school replacement. It also \nprovides an increase of $6 million for tribal community colleges. This \nis a subject that is of particular interest to both Senator Dorgan and \nme and one we may discuss further as we progress with this legislation.\n  The bill also provides $243 million for the Office of Special Trustee \nto continue the administration efforts to improve the management of \nIndian trust assets. This is an increase of $95 million over the \nenacted level.\n  While I strongly believe Congress must support trust reform, let \nthere be no mistake that reform is coming at a very significant cost in \nterms of money, personnel, and management focus. Vital concerns in \nIndian country are being shortchanged because trust reform and related \nlitigation are draining both funds and morale.\n  We would all like there to be a simple solution, but there just isn't \none. Settling the case may ultimately be the answer, but at this stage, \nthe plaintiffs and the administration do not appear ready to have \nproductive negotiations. Even if we settle on any past damages, the \nquestion remains as to how we manage Indian trust assets in the future. \nThis bill continues to support the Department's reform efforts to the \ngreatest extent possible.\n  I will continue to work closely with the Department, with the \nauthorizing committees, and with Indian country to advance the reform \neffort so we can get ourselves out from under this immense cloud.\n  The Interior bill also supports an important piece of our Nation's \nenergy portfolio, including research on fossil energy and energy \nefficiency, the operation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This bill \nprovides $1.67 billion for Department of Energy programs, including \n$862 million for energy conservation and $594 million for fossil energy \nresearch and development.\n  Among the cultural programs supported by this bill, the Smithsonian \nwill receive an additional $10 million to prepare for the opening of \ntwo new museums, the Air and Space Museum extension near Dulles \nAirport, and the National Museum of the American Indian on The Mall. \nThe National Endowment of the Arts will get $117 million and the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities will get $142 million. This is an \nincrease of $15 million for the NEH, for an American history \ninitiative.\n  This has been something the new Member of this body, Senator \nAlexander from Tennessee, has worked on very hard ever since his \narrival in the Senate and something he and I have discussed many times. \nI know Senator Alexander and his staff have been meeting with \nadministration officials and the authorizing committees to discuss ways \nof aligning the administration's American history proposal with his \nown.\n  It is my understanding those discussions are going well.\n  Certainly we should all be pulling in the same direction on an issue \nsuch as this. I am excited about this initiative, and I want to applaud \nour good friend from Tennessee for his hard work.\n  Finally, I want to talk about funding of wildland fire management. \nThis is a subject we find ourselves discussing again and again. The \nreason is this: The current system we have for the fire suppression \nbudgeting is broken. Again and again we find ourselves in a situation \nwhere both the Forest Service and the Department of Interior are forced \nto borrow massive amounts of money from other budget accounts to fight \nthe fires. Those accounts are inside their own agencies.\n  This is a reasonable mechanism when the amounts being borrowed are \nrelatively modest, when the borrowing occurs only during particularly \nbad fire years, and when sufficient surplus carryover funds are readily \navailable. But the borrowing has become routine and the amounts \ninvolved are massive. We no longer have large carryover amounts in \nother accounts. This carryover has disappeared in many accounts with \nthe decline of the timber program and the revenues it produced.\n  Last year, we borrowed heavily from a number of Forest Service and \nInterior accounts, causing both agencies to stop conducting certain \nactivities until those amounts were repaid or replaced. In the end, \nhowever, we only repaid about 60 cents of every dollar borrowed, which \nis the amount proposed by the administration in its supplemental \nrequest.\n  As a result of this shortfall, a large number of congressionally \napproved projects have either been cancelled or reduced in scope. This \nyear we find ourselves in the same situation. Prior to the recess, my \ncolleagues may recall I was very upset that the House sent us a \nsupplemental appropriations bill that did not include the fire funds \nrequested by the administration. Those funds were desperately needed in \nAugust when my State of Montana was suffering from dozens of \nsignificant fires. The presence of smoke was almost constant during the \ntime I spent in Montana over the recess. In fact, two airports had to \nbe closed for a period of time because of smoke.\n\n  In a way, I am glad we did not act then. I say this because the $289 \nmillion that is under discussion in the legislative branch \nappropriations bill is totally inadequate. I would not want anybody to \nbelieve that this amount begins to take care of our problem. The \nDepartment of Interior has already borrowed $130 million from other \naccounts to fight fires this summer. It expects to borrow $30 million \nmore before the end of the fiscal year. The Forest Service has already \nborrowed--and get this figure--$595 million and is contemplating \nanother $100 million transferred to get us through this fiscal year. \nRoughly speaking, we will borrow $850 million from other accounts \nbefore the end of the fiscal year.\n  Simply providing the $289 million in the pending administration \nrequest does not do the trick. These funds, for the most part, have \nalready been spent.\n  There are not options at this point. We need to repay those accounts \nsoon and we need to repay them in full. Sixty cents on the dollar this \ntime around would be devastating to a wide variety of programs. They \nrange from endangered species monitoring to facilities construction, \nfrom acquisition to processing even the simplest forms of grazing \npermits. It would amount to a de facto rescission of funds that this \nCongress voted to appropriate when it approved the 2003 bill.\n  My colleagues will hear more from me later on this issue, and I will \nlikely have an amendment to offer at some point, but for now I want to \nuse this opportunity to tell my colleagues this is not just a problem \nfor those States where there has been fire. It is a problem for every \nState in this country, because the funds are effectively borrowed from \nevery State, including the projects and programs that were funded at a \nspecific request of Members in this body. So I call on the \nadministration to send up another supplemental request, one that fully \nreflects the amounts that will be spent on fire suppression this fiscal \nyear.\n  I thank my friend, Senator Dorgan, and his staff. They have been \ngreat to work with. Of course, we come from almost the same part of the \ncountry--in fact, we are neighbors--so it was very easy for neighbors \nto get together and to roll up our sleeves and put this bill together. \nHis input has been very valuable. We have tried to fashion a bill that \nreflects the priorities of the Senate as a whole. I think this bill \ndoes just that.\n  So I urge my colleagues who have amendments to get them to me or to \nmy staff as quickly as possible so we can deal with them and get this \nbill to conference. I caution, however, that we have allocated the \nentire amount of the subcommittee's allocation. Any amendment that \nprovides additional\n\n[[Page S11607]]\n\nfunds will have to be fully offset, and I think I can speak for Senator \nDorgan in saying we will take a dim view of amendments that propose to \nuse across-the-board reductions or unspecified administrative savings \nas offsets.\n  I ask the support of this Senate for this bill. I would hope we can \nhave this bill done by tomorrow, and move on and get this bill into \nconference. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  If I can get the attention of my good friend from North Dakota, I \nlook forward to working with him on this issue and I appreciate his \ngood help and his input on this bill.\n\n  I yield the floor to my good friend from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Burns. Senator \nBurns is the chairman of this appropriations subcommittee. I have been \nvery pleased to work with him. I think his leadership and his work on \nthis subcommittee is exemplary.\n  This is my first year on this subcommittee. I moved to this position \nfrom another subcommittee and so it is the first year I have had the \nopportunity to work with Senator Burns, but we have had an excellent \nworking relationship.\n  This is a very large appropriations subcommittee bill, and I shall \nnot repeat that which Senator Burns has already described in any great \ndetail, but I do want to make some points. I will go through a couple \nof the items.\n  Senator Burns mentioned this bill deals with the BLM, Bureau of Land \nManagement, and the funding for their programs, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, \nthe National Park Service, and a number of smaller agencies as \nwell. There is the Office of Surface Mining, Minerals Management \nService, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Indian Affairs--I am \ngoing to speak a little bit about that in a couple of minutes--and then \nthe larger departmental offices down at the Interior Department that \nincludes the Forest Service, which is a very large agency, the \nDepartment of Energy--a portion of the Department of Energy funding is \nin this--the Indian Health Service, Smithsonian, National Gallery of \nArt, Kennedy Center, National Endowment for the Humanities, National \nEndowment for the Arts, and more.\n\n  As you can see, these are very important public functions for which \nwe provide funding. I think we have done as good a job as is possible \nto do, given the restraint on financing many of these functions. I \nthink Senator Burns would probably agree there are a number of issues \nthat are presented in this appropriations bill for which we would like \nto provide additional funding but could not. But that is the process \nthese days, trying to find ways to stretch limited resources over \nunlimited wants that are expressed to the committee.\n  Let me mention a couple of issues specifically. First of all, payment \nin lieu of taxes. My colleague, Senator Burns, mentioned that. For \nthose who do not understand this issue, it is called P-I-L-T. Payment \nin lieu of taxes is a payment the Federal Government makes on land it \nowns that otherwise would have borne a property tax but, because it is \nin Federal hands, does not pay a property tax. So payment in lieu of \ntaxes is the payment the Federal Government makes to these counties \nthat makes up what they should have collected in property taxes had \nthat land been in private hands.\n  As you know, in most cases property around this country has to bear a \nresponsibility to help raise the funds for our school systems. Yet if \nyou have a substantial amount of Federal land, it doesn't pay property \ntaxes and therefore you don't have the revenue coming off that land to \nsupport the school system and other governmental functions. That is \nwhat the payment in lieu of taxes is about.\n  I am pleased Senator Burns and I were able to increase that amount \nthis year. It is very important. The administration had suggested that \nit be decreased a bit. We have actually appropriated, in this bill, $30 \nmillion above that which the administration requested. I think that is \nsomething important to highlight.\n  I want to spend a couple of minutes talking about Indian issues \nbecause, while that is not the largest part of this bill, it is a very \nimportant set of issues. I want to talk a bit about it and then I want \nto talk about grazing permits and a couple of other smaller items.\n  Let me talk about the Indian issues for a very specific reason. We \nhave trust responsibility in this Government for Indian education, \namong other things. That trust responsibility is not something we have \nbeen able to shed. That is a responsibility we have. It is a \nresponsibility we must meet. I believe we have, on Indian reservations \nin this country, bona fide crises in health care, education, and \nhousing. This bill deals with two of those--education and health care.\n  Let me talk about how it deals with education first of all. The \nadministration request on Indian education suggested that we zero out \nfunding for the United Tribes Technical College in North Dakota and \nalso the Crown Point Technical College in New Mexico. Both of them \nare vocational/technical schools that are wonderful opportunities for \nIndian men and women, children, to learn and to get a college \neducation. I am pleased that Senator Burns and I were able to restore \nfunding to both of those important institutions.\n\n  In addition to that, we are restoring some funding that is much \nneeded for the 28 tribally controlled community colleges in our \ncountry. These are tribal colleges that have been remarkably \nsuccessful. Once again, there was a requested cut. We are actually \nincreasing funding over last year. Senator Burns and I have talked \nabout trying to do more. We hope to be able to do that as we work \nthrough this process on the floor of the Senate.\n  I thought it would be useful, instead of speaking in the abstract, to \nread a letter from someone because I have visited many tribal colleges. \nI said there is a bona fide crisis in education, health care, and \nhousing on our reservations. If one doesn't believe that, I encourage \nyou to visit and then ask yourself whether that is what we want to \nconfine Indian children to, or the adults who live on those \nreservations, with respect to access to health care, access to good \neducation, and more.\n  Let me read a letter from a woman who wrote to me some while ago \ndescribing the value of tribal colleges in her life. I think it is an \ninstructive letter. As I said, I have visited many tribal colleges and \nthis letter says it very well. She says:\n\n       I grew up poor and considered backward by non-Indians. My \n     home was a two-room log house in a place called the ``bush'' \n     on North Dakota's Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. I \n     stuttered. I was painfully shy. My clothes were hand-me-\n     downs. I was like thousands of other Indian kids growing up \n     on reservations across America.\n       When I went to elementary school I felt so alone and \n     different. I couldn't speak up for myself. My teachers had no \n     appreciation for Indian culture. I'll never forget that it \n     was the lighter-skinned children who were treated better. \n     They were usually from families that were better off than \n     mine. My teachers called me savage. Even as a young child I \n     wondered . . . What does it take to be noticed and looked \n     upon the way these other children are?\n       By the time I reached 7th grade I realized that if my life \n     was going to change for the better, I was going to have to do \n     it. Nobody else could do it for me. That's when the dream \n     began. I thought of ways to change things for the better--not \n     only for myself but for my people. I dreamed of growing up to \n     be a teacher in a school where every child was treated as \n     sacred and viewed positively, even if they were poor and \n     dirty. I didn't want any child to be made to feel like I did. \n     But I didn't know how hard it would be to reach the \n     realization of my dream. I almost didn't make it.\n       By the time I was 17 I had dropped out of school, moved to \n     California, and had a child. I thought my life was over. But \n     when I moved back to the reservation I made a discovery that \n     literally put my life back together. My sisters were \n     attending Turtle Mountain College, which had just been \n     started on my reservation. I thought that was something I \n     could do, too, so I enrolled. In those days, we didn't even \n     have a campus. There was no building. Some classes met at a \n     local alcohol rehabilitation center in an old hospital \n     building that had been condemned. But to me, It didn't \n     matter. I was just amazed I could go to college. It was life-\n     changing.\n       My college friends and professors were like family. For the \n     fist time in my life I learned about the language, history \n     and culture of my people in a formal education setting. I \n     felt honor and pride begin to well up inside me. This was so \n     unlike my prior school experience where I was told my \n     language and culture were shameful and that Indians weren't \n     equal to others. Attending a tribal college caused me to \n     reach into my inner self to become what I was meant to be--to \n     fight for\n\n[[Page S11608]]\n\n     my rights and not remain a victim of circumstance or of \n     anybody. In fact, I loved college so much that I \n     couldn't stop! I had a dream to fulfill . . . or perhaps \n     some would call it an obsession. This pushed me on to \n     complete my studies at Turtle Mountain College and to \n     ultimately earn a Doctorate in Education Administration \n     from the University of North Dakota.\n       I've worked in education ever since, from Head Start \n     teacher's aide to college professor. Now I'm realizing my \n     dream of helping Indian children succeed. I am the Office of \n     Indian Education Programs' superintendent working with nine \n     schools, three reservations, and I oversee two educational \n     contracts with two tribal colleges. My life would not have \n     turned out this way were it not for the tribal college on my \n     reservation.\n       My situation is not unique and others feel this way as \n     well. Since 1974, when Turtle Mountain College was chartered \n     by the Turtle Mountain tribe, around 300 students have gone \n     on to earn higher degrees. We now have educators, attorneys, \n     doctors and others who have returned to the reservation. \n     They--I should say, we--are giving back to the community. \n     Instead of asking people to have pity on us because of what \n     happened in our past, we are taking our future into our own \n     hands. Instead of looking for someone else to solve our \n     problems, we are doing it.\n       There's only one thing tribal colleges need. With more \n     funding, the colleges can do ever more than they've already \n     achieved. We will take people off the welfare rolls and end \n     the economic depression on reservations. Tribal colleges have \n     already been successful with much less than any other \n     institutions of higher education have received. That is why I \n     hope you will continue to support the American Indian College \n     Fund.\n       I'm an old timer. The College Fund didn't exist when I was \n     a student. I remember seeing ads for the United Negro College \n     Fund and wishing that such a fund existed for Indian people. \n     We now have our own Fund that is spreading the message about \n     tribal colleges and providing scholarships. I'm so pleased. I \n     believe the Creator meant for this to be. But so much more \n     must be done. There still isn't enough scholarship money \n     available to carry students full time. That is my new dream . \n     . . to see the day when Indian students can receive four-year \n     scholarships so they don't have to go through the extremely \n     difficult struggle many now experience to get their \n     education.\n       I hope you'll keep giving, keep supporting the College \n     Fund, so that some day this dream becomes reality. I know it \n     can happen because if my dream for my future came true, \n     anything is possible. Thank you.\n\n  Let me describe to you the signature. The signature is: ``Loretta De \nLong, Ed.D.''\n  This is a woman from North Dakota who has done wonderful things in \nthe field of education. She describes the circumstance that allowed her \nto get this education, the presence of a tribal college that gave her \nhope and opportunity. We need to fund them and we are not funding them \nadequately. The per-pupil burden that exists on tribal colleges and the \nreimbursement we provide to meet that burden is not equal at all to \nthat which we do for public community colleges. In fact, it is \nsomewhere very close to half. I have the numbers here. The support per \nstudent for public community colleges is $8,900 and the public support \nfor tribal colleges is just under $4,000.\n  One final point. I know this is not a major part of this bill, but I \nhave spent a lot of time working on tribal college issues. I just want \nto tell you one other story about going to a tribal college graduation. \nWhen I spoke at the graduation, I asked who was the oldest graduate. \nAnd they said: That's her over there. And I went over to say hello.\n  This was a woman who was in her early forties. Here is her story.\n  I asked her: ``What is your story? `` She was a janitor. She was \ncleaning the hallways and the toilets of the community college. She had \nfour children, her husband had left her, and she was working at low \nwages cleaning the hallways and the bathrooms of the community college. \nShe thought to herself: I would like to be a graduate of this college. \nSomehow, by the grace of God, through Pell grants, or through all of \nthe support we offer to give people opportunity, the day I was there \nthis woman was not cleaning the hallways or cleaning the bathrooms of \nthis college, she was graduating, wearing a cap and gown, and wearing a \nsmile--something no one will ever take from her because she did it \nherself with the help of what we put together to provide opportunity to \npeople.\n  But, once again, it enriches people's lives. Education is the way up \nthe steps, up out of poverty.\n  I spoke about tribal colleges just because I care a lot about them. \nThese in many instances are places in our country that look like Third \nWorld parts of the globe. Yet they exist in this country with people \nterribly disadvantaged. It is the route of progress. Education provides \nthe opportunity for these people who want opportunity, those who live \non Indian reservations. This woman is an example of that, and there are \nso many others. I have a whole list of them here which I could talk \nabout today.\n  My hope is that in the time we are on the floor of the Senate, \nSenator Burns and I can continue to work on this issue, and we intend \nto do that.\n  I will speak just for a moment about Indian health care. The fact is, \nif you visit Indian reservations and take a look at the amount of money \nspent on Indian health care, you will decide that there is something \nfundamentally wrong. This is about young children and others who do not \nhave adequate health care. Go and find a reservation with 5,000 people \nliving on it with one dentist working out of a trailer house and ask \nyourself: What kind of care for those people exists with respect to \ndentistry? Go to a reservation, for example, and take a look at the \nfunding through the Indian Health Service and through the BIA, \nespecially with respect to protecting Indian children against sexual \nabuse.\n  I had a hearing on that in Bismarck, ND. A woman came to the hearing \nto testify. On this Indian reservation, she was in charge of the social \nservices and trying to protect these children. She said to me: I have a \nstack of files on my floor a foot and a half high. These are files of \nallegations of child sexual abuse and abuse of children. They have not \neven been investigated. Why? Because there is no money to investigate \nthem. She said: Even when I just have to find a way for somebody to \ncome and take a child to the biggest town 10 miles away, to the \nhospital off the reservation, I have to beg to try to borrow a car, to \nput a young kid in a car to take them to the hospital or the clinic.\n  At that point, she broke down and began weeping, at a public hearing. \nShe just couldn't continue. She said it is just too sad. The fact is we \nare not doing what we should do to protect these children.\n  I have this story about some years ago learning of a young lady named \nTamera Damirez. She was a 3-year-old. She was on an Indian reservation. \nShe was a child from a very difficult set of circumstances. She was put \ninto foster care by a woman who was handling 150 cases. You get a \nsocial worker handling 150 cases, and do you think that social worker \nis going to inspect the home where she assigns that child to foster \ncare? She didn't. This young girl was sent to foster care at age 3. \nThere was a drunken party at that foster care residence. Her nose was \nbroken, her arm was broken, her hair was pulled out by the roots--at \nage 3. Why? Because there was not enough money to fund enough social \nworkers to inspect the house where you were going to send a 3-year-old \nchild.\n\n  I fixed that problem. There is more money there now. There are more \nsocial workers there. They are inspecting where they are sending \nchildren. But this should not happen, and it is happening today across \nthis country because we are not adequately funding Indian education and \nIndian health care by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  Part of it is the bureaucracy of BIA, I might also say. I don't want \nto suggest that the BIA is an agency that functions very well in many \ncircumstances. I have a lot of grievances with the BIA as well.\n  My point is that we have spent a lot of money on a lot of aspects of \nthis Government. None is quite so important to me as protecting \nchildren. I visit places in this country where I just shake my head and \nwonder why it is that these children are not a priority for this \ncountry. This bill is one bill where we have a responsibility to do \nmore, and we need to keep working and fighting and funding ways to do \nmore.\n  Let me mention just a couple of other items as we proceed.\n  Before I finish that piece of my discussion, I know I am taking one \npiece out of this large bill and talking about it some. It is because I \nfeel so strongly about it. I know my colleague, Senator Burns, does as \nwell. The dilemma and the disappointment is that we have limited \namounts of money. We need more. We need more to address these issues \nwith children, particularly on reservations, and address the issues of \neducation and health care.\n\n[[Page S11609]]\n\n  Let me talk just for a moment about an issue in the Forest Service \ndealing with grazing permits for ranchers. We have a requirement as a \nresult of a previous Federal law that says those who graze on public \nlands and have grazing permits with which to graze cattle on public \nlands, in order to get a renewal of the grazing permit when the permit \nreaches its end, have to have a NEPA--the National Environmental Policy \nAct--evaluation of that permit.\n  It was easy enough, I suppose, for the previous administration and \nthe previous Congress to say this should be done. But it has proven \nmuch more difficult for it to be done.\n  The Forest Service has done precious little in moving forward on the \nNEPA evaluations of the grazing permits. Ranchers out there who are \ntrying to make a living grazing cattle on public lands don't have the \nfoggiest idea of whether at the end of this year they will get an \nextension of their existing grazing permit because the NEPA evaluation \nhas not been done. That is not their fault. That is the Forest \nService's fault. The Congress hasn't funded it. The Forest Service \nhasn't done it. As a result, the rancher is wondering whether they will \nget an extension of their permit.\n  In recent years, we have extended it a year. This bill extends it a \nyear. But at end of each year we are in the same situation.\n  I believe we ought to do a couple of things: No. 1, we ought to say \nto the Forest Service: Do this. No. 2, we ought to fund it to get them \nto do it, and we ought to stop holding ranchers hostage on the \ncompletion of these duties.\n  Until we decide to do that, it isn't going to be done this year \nbecause adequate funding does not exist to do what the law would \nrequire with respect to NEPA evaluations on grazing permits. I think we \nought to do more than extensions of 1 year. We don't know exactly what \nit should be. We ought to be talking about that during the discussion \nof this bill.\n  Frankly, we should not say to those ranch families out there who have \ncattle grazing on public lands: By the way, at end of each year you are \ngoing to be threatened with the loss of the permit. The law says the \nNEPA evaluation must be done, but we know it is not being done.\n  Let us decide either it gets done and provide the resources to do \nthat or at least have reasonable extensions so ranchers aren't held \nhostage at the end of each year by actions of an appropriations \ncommittee each year. Let us find a way to do that if we can. I hope we \ncan talk about that as we move along.\n  I will mention one other concern. I have not talked to my colleague \nfrom Montana about this. He talked about the We The People Project. I \nam a strong supporter of the National Endowment for the Humanities and \nthe National Endowment for the Arts. I think both enrich our country. \nBoth are programs that are excellent. Visit Europe and see what remains \nfrom the 15th century. It is not some fossilized, arthritic, calcified \nhuman being. It is their art. It is this wonderful art that enriches \nEurope and tells us something about the 12th century and the 15th \ncentury. So, too, are the arts important to our culture. I think these \nare very important--arts and humanities.\n  But I must say that doing a new start of We The People--no one, in my \njudgment, would say that We The People--whatever that acronym attaches \nto; in this case, it attaches to the study of history--no one would say \nthat is unimportant. It is very important. But we have added money \npreviously to the Department of Education for this. To the extent we \nare going to do something new, I really would prefer that it be in the \nDepartment of Education, or some other device, rather than starting a \nnew program in the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n  I think history is critically important. The issue of how we are \ngoing to enhance the learning and the teaching of history is really a \nfunction of doing so in the classroom.\n  I will not object to it being here this year, but the problem with \nall these things, once they stick, it is kind of like Velcro. It gets \nstuck in here and next year it will be here and it becomes a permanent \nprogram. I think this program belongs somewhere in an education piece \nof legislation. I understand $100 million was added in an amendment by \nSenator Byrd for that purpose and I prefer we do that.\n  Those who are pushing for the enrichment of the education of history \nin our school system, absolutely, I fully support it. We have spent a \nlot of time talking about the maths and sciences, which I think is \nimportant. It is very appropriate to say we want kids coming out of our \nschools to have a great sense of the history of this wonderful country \nof ours. But I don't believe the place to do that in terms of nurturing \nthat is in the National Endowment for the Humanities. I believe, as \nSenator Byrd has appropriately pushed, the right place to do it is over \nin the education legislation. I know we have colleagues who feel very \nstrongly about that. I hope they can perhaps work with Senator Byrd and \nwith us so next year we do not have to have this as another continuing \nand building program in the National Endowment for Humanities.\n  Having said that, I know there are some who think, boy, this is a \nterrific expansion of National Endowment for the Humanities. I am \nsomeone who supports the National Endowment for the Humanities. I think \nit is important. But I also believe this particular piece that is now \nadded to it is more appropriate with the Department of Education, if we \nare going to do this, and I believe we should do this initiative to \nenhance and stimulate the education of the history of this wonderful \ncountry in our school system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, our staff and the staff of Senator \nAlexander and the Department of Education and the administration did \nget together. They are moving to an agreement. I agree maybe the \nDepartment of Education is where it should be and those funds be \nallocated to be used there.\n  But what the Senator from Tennessee was trying to do was highlight \nsomething of national interest that is happening in North Dakota and \nMontana now. As I said, the Dakota territory and Montana was the heart \nand soul of the book that was written, ``Undaunted Courage.'' Now that \nwe are approaching the 200th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase and \nthe trek of Lewis and Clark, there is a lot of interest in our part of \nthe country. What was started in the humanities, the interest of Lewis \nand Clark, the interest of the Louisiana Purchase and the impact it had \non this country, has been very positive for all of us out there and all \nof America.\n  Some of the original 13 States got the idea that maybe this country \nis big enough right where it is. If you read another book, ``A \nWilderness So Immense,'' you get an idea--this was before our \nConstitution was ratified--some of the events that went on in the \nhistory of the Louisiana Purchase. It is very interesting.\n  That is why we are very supportive of history initiatives. We have \nyoung people coming out of our schools who do not have a sense of \nhistory. They do not know who they are, why they are, or how they got \nhere. This initiative is very important.\n  In regard to the Forest Service permit, it is fire suppression money \nthat was taken from the accounts that would enable them to issue the \npermits and to complete the NEPA studies. We have to understand that \nand how important these funds are to be replaced in the accounts of the \nBLM and the Forest Service so this work can be completed. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota is exactly right. These do not have to be done on a \nyearly basis. There should be a longer term with monitoring. I like the \n10-year lease. That is the way it used to be. We find now everywhere we \nhad grazing we did not have fires, which is something we should take a \nlook at as far as fire prevention and fire suppression and the use of \nthe land.\n\n  The other day, I will even tell my good friend from North Dakota, I \nsaw a truckload of sheep being unloaded in Missoula County, Montana. \nThey were paying the sheep man to run his sheep on public lands for \nweed control, spotted nap weed, and of course earlier in the spring, we \nhad the spurge problem. But I thought, what a novel idea. I wished I \nhad thought of it.\n  We will let that program go to the benefit of the land and also to \nthe people who graze the land and make their living and are in the \nbusiness of feeding and clothing.\n  Those are the challenges we have ahead of us. This bill impacts a \nlot.\n\n[[Page S11610]]\n\n  I have a few clarifications of items in the committee report that I \nwould like to have printed in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent those corrections be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Clarifications of Committee Report\n\n       On page 28 of the Committee report, the table includes $3 \n     million for ``Independence Square site rehabilitation''. The \n     $1.25 million provided in addition to the budget request is \n     for landscaping improvements to Independence Mall.\n       On page 40 of the Committee report under ``Other Recurring \n     Programs'', the reference to the ``Dry Prairie Rural Water \n     System'' should have been to the ``Assiniboine and Sioux \n     Rural Water System.''\n       On page 52 of the Committee report, the amount provided for \n     Forest Health Management is $82,073,000, as displayed in the \n     table on that page.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I remind Senators to get their amendments down here. We \nwant to complete this bill by noon tomorrow so we can watch the rain. \nThose folks are worried about forest fires. I don't think anyone on the \nEast Coast has to worry about that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am tempted to talk about the intelligence of sheep and \nenjoying munching on leafy spurge, but I will not do that.\n  My colleague describes the real serious problem with spurge and nap. \nWe have known in North Dakota when you put sheep on the land, baby \nspurge and leafy spurge is gone and the sheep seem happy.\n  Having said that, I go back to make a point on this issue of, we, the \npeople. We have Lewis and Clark money to celebrate the bicentennial in \na number of different places in legislation in several different \nappropriations bills. It was a wonderful expedition, perhaps the \ngreatest expedition certainly in the history of this country, perhaps \never. The greater the education and the bigger the celebration of that, \nthe better for our country and the better for our children to \nunderstand the richness of that history, as well.\n  My only point is, as we think through this in the longer term, this \nmoney is in the bill and I would like to see if we can find a way with \nthe administration to put it where I think it really belongs, and that \nis education.\n  The other point I would make in terms of priorities, if we have $15, \n$20, $25 million here and there, we have urgent priorities, especially \ndealing with Indian health, that we need to find some additional \nresources for.\n  I did not mention in my opening statement something my colleague from \nMontana mentioned, and that is the forest fire issue. Fire suppression \nmoney has been borrowed from every account. It is the wrong way to do \nbusiness. What we should do--and we talked about this in the spring \nwhen we received the budget request; we traditionally get a budget \nrequest that does not ask for the money that all of us know will be \nnecessary and then when the need comes for fire suppression money, they \ntake it from virtually every corner and come back with a request for \nemergency funding.\n  We ought to understand that forest fires are events that cause a lot \nof television cameras to record them, and cause a lot of angst for \npeople who are in the way, but they happen every year. This isn't like \nsome big typhoon some place that happens every 10 or 15 years. We know \nwe are going to have forest fires every year. We know about what it is \ngoing to cost us if we have a moderate season of forest fires, or more \nforest fires than a moderate season, and we just as well ought to begin \nto plan for it. Both the administration and the Congress should; \nfrankly, neither have.\n  I fully support the comments made by my colleague from Montana. We \nneed to find a way to come at this up front, in the spring of the year \neach year, to put in sufficient money. In some cases, it may not be \nenough, if we have an extraordinary season of massive forest fires, but \nin most cases we could put money in to cover the kind of year that we \nwould have in most situations in this country. So I hope we can do \nthat.\n  Let me also say, we have some folks on this side of the aisle who \nwill have amendments. As my colleague has indicated, I would prefer if \nthey would just bring them over and offer them. And let's deal with \nthem quickly. We do have a little rain coming to the east coast. It \nwould be nice to be able to finish this bill.

Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues a \nfew thoughts on the subject of Iraq, if I may. I begin by thanking the \nPresident for speaking to the Nation on September 7. President Bush, my \ncolleagues will recall, addressed the American people about the subject \nof Iraq. He happens to be one of the very few members of his own \nadministration to begin to tell the American people the facts of life \nabout our involvement in Iraq: That it is going to be very difficult \nfor our troops and civilian personnel to be successful in standing up a \ndemocratic government out of the ashes of a crushed and totally \ndiscredited dictatorship, and it is going to be very expensive as well, \nthe President pointed out--very expensive. In the President's own \nwords, this undertaking is going to be ``difficult and costly.''\n  President Bush also explained in simple terms U.S. policy objectives. \nHe said in that speech that our objectives are to destroy terrorists, \nenlist the support of other nations for a free Iraq, and help Iraqis \nassume responsibility.\n  He was far less clear on how he intends to achieve those objectives \nor to mitigate the cost to the American public--the cost in dollar \nterms and also in terms of human lives.\n  Our military has, I think all of us would agree, done an exemplary \njob in\n\n[[Page S11611]]\n\nwinning the military conflict in Iraq. All of us extend our highest \ncommendations to the men and women in uniform for the job they have \nachieved. But they also need help winning the peace, and I think all of \nus understand that as well.\n  Our forces are stretched thin. Our troops are very tired. There are \nquestions as to whether they have been adequately equipped for the \ncircumstances that they now confront. I believe they are involved in a \nguerrilla war. There is no other way to describe it. Their lives, as we \nall know, painfully, are in great danger from hostile irregular forces, \nif you want to call them that, and from a very hostile environment \ngrowing worse every day by growing civil dissent in the country.\n  Tragically, more than 280 American soldiers have now died in Iraq, \nand more than 1,200 are wounded; 159 of those deaths have occurred \nsince the President declared the end of major military action on May 1 \nof this year. Every single day since then almost 10 Americans have been \nofficially declared wounded in action.\n  Our troops are not the only ones at risk. Hanging in limbo is, of \ncourse, the future of the Iraqi people. Millions of innocent civilians \nsuffered for decades under the brutal rule of Saddam Hussein. When our \nforces entered Iraq, we took on the mission of providing peace and \nsecurity for all Iraqis. But during the past several weeks we have \nwitnessed a surge of attacks with many Iraqis themselves victims, \nsubject to the attacks of these hostile forces within Iraq.\n  Car bombings have claimed the lives of more than 120 people over the \nlast number of weeks. The U.N.'s Iraqi headquarters were bombed and \ntheir top envoy, Sergio Vieira de Mello, was killed, as we all know. An \nattack at the mosque at Najaf killed more than 80 people, including a \nprominent moderate Shiite leader. Only a week ago, a track bomb killed \nan Iraqi police officer and wounded 27 others, including Baghdad's \nchief of police. On Monday, the chief of police of another community \nwas gunned down in his automobile.\n  This goes on every single day. What does the situation tell us? I \nbelieve it tells us that the Iraqi people are far from secure. If they \nare not secure, it is a safe bet our forces will continue to remain in \ndanger and our own security and the security we are trying to achieve \nas a result of a rise in terrorism is also at risk.\n  I listened last week as well to Vice President Cheney and Secretary \nRumsfeld, our Secretary of Defense, go over the old ground of defending \nthe administration's justification for going to war in Iraq. And with \nall due respect to Secretary Powell, I do not believe his most recent \nremarks to the effect that the use of chemical weapons by Saddam \nHussein in 1988 explains why this administration decided in the year \n2003, some 15 years later, that Saddam Hussein had to go. Frankly, I \nbelieve the administration should spend far less time trying to justify \npast decisions or explain away errors of judgment and far more time \nshould be spent figuring out what to do next about this difficult and \ncostly challenge our troops are facing every day, day in and day out, \nin Iraq.\n  I hope the recent rhetoric is simply a diversion, because the \nadministration doesn't have a plan, in my view, for restoring \nsecurity--a comprehensive strategic plan for the eventual drawdown of \nU.S. forces, a comprehensive strategic plan for turning political \ncontrol of the country of Iraq over to the Iraqi people where it \nbelongs. We need a strong strategic plan, a concrete plan and a \ntimetable for these events. We need a comprehensive strategic plan and \ntimetable for establishment of an Iraqi government and for the \npreparation of a constitution for the holding of free elections. We \nneed to stick to that plan so the Iraqi people can have a sense of \nconfidence that the end goal remains an independent Iraq governed by \nIraqis.\n  The Congress of the United States, of course, supported President \nBush last year when he sought authority to use all necessary means to \nsecure Iraq's compliance with United Nations resolutions. I was one who \nvoted for Senate Resolution 1441 which empowered the President to \nforcibly remove Saddam Hussein from power. And I would do so again, \nbecause I believe Saddam Hussein posed a threat to our security and to \nthe security of our allies in the region.\n  At the time I voted for that resolution, I expressed concern that the \nadministration may not have adequately prepared for winning the peace \nonce military options had deposed Saddam Hussein. I think the concern I \nexpressed, as well as many others, clearly has been well placed. The \ntime has come for our President and his top advisors to listen to the \nCongress and, more importantly, to the American people, when we say our \ncurrent policy is off course. If they don't heed the concerns being \nexpressed by Democrats and Republicans in both this body and in the \nother, then they risk an even more costly and far more difficult \nengagement in Iraq, and they risk the administration losing the support \nof the American people for this policy which is absolutely critical for \nthe long-term success.\n  The $87 billion emergency appropriations request the President will \nsoon transmit to the Congress of the United States presents a very \nimportant opportunity for us to consider a midcourse correction on our \nIraqi policy. It will require all of us in this Chamber and the \nadministration and others to work very hard to effectuate that kind of \nchange.\n  I will say here and now I am prepared to support all of the funds the \nPresident has requested to equip and protect our military troops in \nIraq and Afghanistan. So long as they are in harm's way, they need \nwhatever military commanders deem necessary to get the job done as \nsafely as possible. The resources ought not be the subject of our \ncorrections.\n  However, I do not believe we can or should continue to give the \nadministration a blank check with respect to the reconstruction money. \nThis is a ripe opportunity now for us to work together in common \npurpose and common cause to offer some new ideas and new direction to \nget this policy on track. We simply cannot afford to continue the road \nwe are following. Even before the administration's supplemental \nrequest, the Congressional Budget Office calculated the annual budget \ndeficit would reach some $480 billion--the largest in our history. Over \nthe past 3 years, 3.2 million Americans have lost their jobs--44,000 \nalone in the month of July.\n  I don't need to remind my colleagues of these statistics. They know \nthem in their own States. We are facing a tremendous problem in our own \ncountry. Layoffs are continuing as Americans lose their jobs. And they \nare losing something equally important--the ability to provide for \ntheir families. Neither are the schools receiving the funds necessary \nto ensure our children receive the education they deserve. Many are \ncutting back on the school week and on critical services and programs.\n\n  Thus far, U.S. funds have been expended to open and equip Iraq's \n12,000 primary and secondary schools, to return 240,000 \ntelecommunications lines to operation, and to begin the process of \nvetting and training some 30,000 Iraqi police officers. The job is far \nfrom done. Baghdad's International Airport remains closed to commercial \ntraffic. Many key bridges and roads are in desperate need of major \nrepairs. That nation's rail system will need significant capital \ninfusions to make it operational again.\n  The American people, in my view, are facing their own difficulties \nhere at home, and those kind of pressures in the absence of a clear \npolicy are going to create the kind of pressure-cooker environment \nwhich will place the policy in Iraq in jeopardy, our soldiers' lives in \njeopardy, and the Iraqi people's security in jeopardy. The great effort \nthat was undertaken to change a brutal dictatorship and bring peace and \ndemocracy to those people is clearly in further jeopardy. In the midst \nof all of this, we need to come together and change the course of \ndirections.\n  I remember the administration's mantra some months ago that ``Iraq is \na rich country'' and its oil revenues would be available to rebuild \nIraq's infrastructure. Just weeks ago, Ambassador Bremer amended that \nstatement to say that ``tens of billions of dollars'' in additional \nfinancial assistance will be needed to accomplish that task.\n  It now appears that oil revenues once thought to be more than \nsufficient or\n\n[[Page S11612]]\n\nof sufficient magnitude that they could finance the rebuilding of the \ncountry of Iraq are now expected to barely cover the operating costs of \nIraq's government ministries and the expenses of the Interim Council.\n  What more evidence do any of us need to be convinced that the time \nhas come for other governments to be welcomed as participants in \nrebuilding Iraq and to reach out and to ask them to join in that \neffort?\n  I strongly believe it is time for the Congress to weigh in and to \nrequire the administration to address two basic questions: How do \nadministration officials plan to minimize American death and \ncasualties? How do they intend to minimize the expenditures of American \ntax dollars that will have to be diverted to this cause at the expense \nof other critically important programs in our own Nation, such as to \nassist first responders in keeping us secure at home, programs to \nprovide for prescription drugs for our seniors, and programs to improve \nour schools so no child is truly left behind?\n  If history is any guide, the only way the administration will feel \ncompelled to come up with answers is if we in the Congress--the coequal \nlegislative branch of Government--place some conditions on the $20 \nbillion in reconstruction moneys.\n  To me it seems pretty straightforward what needs to be done to lower \nthe risks and costs of current participation in Iraq. It is called the \nUnited Nations. It is called the international community. We need to \ninvite them to be a part of this effort. That is why I believe the \nCongress should link the provision of reconstruction moneys to the \npassage of a United Nations resolution that places responsibility for \nrebuilding Iraq where it belongs--on us and the international community \nas a whole. To get such a resolution, obviously the administration must \napproach other member states with a credible proposal, one that gives \nthe United Nations some measure of authority over the civilian \nadministration of the country while also charging it with mobilizing \nmore resources from member states. Clearly, the United States should \nretain command of any ongoing military operations in Iraq. But on \npolitical, economic, and civic reconstruction, we better involve other \nnations fairly quickly. We cannot do this alone. The American people \nwill not support this over the long term. If we don't invite them to \nparticipate and to help us, we are going to find it very difficult with \neach passing day to find anyone who will join us in this effort.\n\n  I don't understand the reluctance on the part of the administration \nto turn over the civilian administration of the country to an \ninternational body. There is certainly ample precedent for doing so. \nNot only would it lower the profile of our presence in that country, \nbut it would also likely unleash additional resources and cooperation \nboth regionally and internationally, bring Iraq around to the kind of \nnation we would like to see, and truly deal with the problems of \nterrorism globally.\n  The Congress has to do it unless the administration decides on its \nown to change course. If we don't speak up in these coming days, if we \njust provide a blank check and a vote for $87 billion with nothing \nfurther to be said, we will not have anyone to blame but ourselves in \nthe coming days if this present policy continues to collapse. And I \nbelieve it will.\n  It is time for us to stop sitting on the sidelines. Under the able \nleadership of Senator Lugar, the Foreign Relations Committee has been \ncarrying out careful oversight in Iraq. The Foreign Relations Committee \nnow has the responsibility to develop some legislative proposals--\nperhaps along the lines I have outlined for people to bring to the \ntable--in order to influence the contents of the legislative package we \nwill be asked to vote on in the coming days. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--because I know very \ndeeply the concerns I am expressing publicly are shared by many in this \nChamber regardless of party, regardless of ideology, and regardless of \nwhich States we represent.\n  There is a growing concern that we have this wrong and that we have \nto get it right soon. Here is an opportunity that may not come again to \nus for many months to try to set this on a different course.\n  We are at a very special and historic moment. We cannot and must not \nsit idly by when we know multilateralizing the reconstruction and \ndemocratization of Iraq is the right thing to do. It is the right thing \nfor Iraq. It is the right thing for the United States of America. But \nit is time we in the legislative branch, the coequal branch, step up \nand act in the interests of our people and other like-minded people \naround the globe.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night the Detroit Shock won the \nWomen's National Basketball Association Championship, defeating the \ntwo-time defending champion Los Angeles Sparks 83-78. This tremendous \naccomplishment is all the more special because the Shock rose from the \nworst record in the league last year to champions this year.\n  Over the course of this year's season, the Shock won a league-best 25 \ngames, a year after losing a league-worst 23 games. The Shock's victory \nis also the first time in the WNBA's 7-year history that neither \nHouston nor Los Angeles won the championship.\n  The enthusiasm and support for the Shock by the people of Detroit and \nMichigan was clearly demonstrated by the fact that last night's game \nwas attended by a WNBA record crowd of over 22,000 people.\n  The Shock completed their incredible run from last to first with the \nleadership of Coach Bill Laimbeer, finals Most Valuable Player Ruth \nRiley's career-high 27-point performance, as well as the strong play of \nSwin Cash, who finished with 13 points, 12 rebounds, and 9 assists. \nThese performances were supported by Deanna Nolan's 17 points, and \nRookie of the Year Cheryl Ford's 10 points and 11 rebounds.\n  It was a tremendously exciting game throughout. The Los Angeles \nSparks erased a 14-point deficit in the first half, and an 11-point \ndeficit in the second half, and even had a 3-point lead with less than \n4 minutes to go. But with less than a minute left, Deanna Nolan, from \nFlint, MI, secured the Shock's lead when she hit a 3-point shot to give \nthem a 75-73 lead. Then Cheryl Ford hit 2 free throws, and it was a 4-\npoint game with 43 seconds remaining. In the end, the Shock were \nvictorious in what was the highest-scoring WNBA finals game in history.\n  The 2003 WNBA champion Detroit Shock will celebrate its first-ever \nWNBA championship with fans tonight at The Palace of Auburn Hills. This \nis Detroit's first professional basketball championship since our \nPistons won back-to-back championships in 1988 and 1989. Shock Head \nCoach Bill Laimbeer was actually cocaptain of those Pistons teams, and \nin 1988 it was the Los Angeles Lakers--the Los Angeles Sparks' NBA \ncounterparts--that Detroit defeated to win the championship.\n  I know our colleagues will join me and Senator Stabenow in \ncongratulating the Detroit Shock on their championship and looking \nforward to their drive to repeat next year.\n  Mr. President, it is also my fervent hope that the Shock's worst-to-\nfirst season will be an inspiration to the Detroit Tigers next year.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will be very brief, but I wanted to make \na point on the Record relative to some messages and information I \nreceived from my State which I would like to share with my colleagues.\n  During the month of August, I went back across the State of Illinois \nand visited with a lot of people, including chambers of commerce, labor \nunions, families, and community leaders. I would say for the third or \nfourth consecutive year, the report I received from businesses in \nparticular in my State was identical. When I asked them what their \nmajor concern was, time and again they came back and said the same \nthing. It is the No. 1 concern of businesses across America when it \ncomes to the cost of doing business and competitiveness. It is the No. \n1 concern of labor unions across America when it comes to fair \ncompensation for their employees. It is the No. 1 concern of more and \nmore families across the United States as they realize how vulnerable \nthey are.\n  What is that concern? The cost of health insurance. Time and time \nagain that issue resurfaces. I have to tell my constituents in \nIllinois, my friends in business and labor, that I understand what they \nare saying. But this is an issue which has gone unaddressed in \nWashington in the time I have been here, for the last 7 years, in the \nSenate. It is as if the people in the Senate, the men and women like \nmyself who are talking back home, are not listening or at least they \nare not coming back here and saying: What can we do about this?\n  There are some who have an automatic reaction and say: Don't jump in \nwith a Government solution. The market will solve this problem.\n  I would say to them that the market is addressing this problem. The \nmarket of health insurance in America is reducing coverage, reducing \ntheir exposure to risk, and raising costs to increase their \nprofitability.\n  What I am about to say is not just anecdotal evidence of a trip \naround Illinois this year or for the last 4 years, but it is the same \nthing we found when the Kaiser Family Foundation released their annual \nreport on health insurance across America, and I commend it to those \nfollowing this debate: KFF.ORG, KFF.ORG. Go to that Web site and you \nwill find this report on the cost of health insurance.\n  According to this report, monthly premiums for employer-sponsored \nhealth insurance went up 13.9 percent between 2002 and 2003, the third \nsuccessive year of double-digit increases in the cost of health \ninsurance, while inflation in general is going up 2.2 percent. Of \ncourse workers are paying more out of pocket and receiving less \ncoverage.\n  Small businesses are getting hammered if they can afford health \ninsurance. If they can't afford it, frankly, they are on their own, and \nthat is not a good outcome here. The question is, Why are these rates \ngoing up?\n  When the Kaiser Foundation asked the businesses what they thought, \nthe No. 1 reason was the cost of prescription drugs going through the \nroof.\n  I talked to the CEO of the biggest company in Illinois during my \nAugust recess. They are self-insured for health. He told me they are \nnow spending more money on prescription drugs for their employees and \nretirees than they are for the rest of their health insurance costs--\nmore on prescription drugs. Prescription drugs are skyrocketing in \ncost. We are doing nothing about it, either in the prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors or in any other legislation.\n\n  The second reason, of course, for the cost of health insurance going \nup is the cost of hospital services. So you might ask, What about the \nhealth insurance companies? How are they doing? That is interesting.\n  The Weiss Ratings, an insurance rating agency, looked at the profits \nfor 519 health insurance companies. They evaluated these companies and \nthey learned that between 2001 and 2002, of these 519 health insurance \ncompanies, their profits went up 77 percent. The same review had shown \na 25-percent increase in the years 2000 to 2001. And the trend is \ncontinuing this year.\n  Have you seen the ads for PacifiCare Health Systems where the whale \njumps out of the water and splashes in? In the second quarter of 2003, \nPacifiCare Health Systems, which serves 12 million Americans, reported \na profit increase of 260 percent. UnitedHealth Group reported a 35-\npercent increase. Aetna reported a 28-percent increase.\n  These are extraordinary profit margins in the midst of a recession in \nAmerica. They are profit margins at the expense of businesses, their \nemployees, of labor unions and their members, and families across \nAmerica. For my colleagues who say it is hands off, Government cannot \nget involved in this debate, this is an issue to be resolved in the \nmarketplace, I remind you again it is being resolved in the marketplace \nas health insurance premiums skyrocket and coverage disappears.\n  A friend of mine with a small business in downstate Illinois and 10 \nemployees had 1 employee whose wife had a baby who was sick. The baby \nincurred great costs at the hospital. The next year, when his small \nbusiness went in for their health insurance, they were told their \npremiums would double--a 100-percent increase from one year to the next \nbecause of one claim.\n  This man and his wife had this company in their family for \ngenerations. They called together the 10 employees and said: We cannot \ndo it. We cannot pay it anymore. We are going to give you the money \nwhich we would have put in your monthly paycheck each month for your \nhealth insurance. You have to go try to find coverage.\n  The family with the sick baby could not find any. The others went out \nand did the best they could. I asked the owner of the company, who was \ngenuinely saddened when it reached that point, what did it mean? He \nsaid: I'm in the open market for health insurance. It meant at his age, \nabout 58-years-of-age, and his wife about the same, that whatever they \nmake a claim for under their health insurance policy this year will be \nexcluded from next year.\n\n[[Page S11614]]\n\nWhether it is part of your body or disease or illness, you are stuck.\n  Next year it is excluded.\n  Let me tell you the lengths to which they have gone. When this woman, \nwho is now with her husband in the private health insurance market, \ngoes in for a mammogram and they say, Where should we send the results, \nshe says: Send them to me personally. I don't want them to go to a \ndoctor because if they become part of my medical record, it will be \nused against me when we apply for health insurance next year.\n  That is what it has come to and that is what people are facing across \nAmerica--outrageous copayments, increases in premiums they cannot \nafford, and less and less coverage every year.\n  What have we done about it? What has this Government done to stand \nbehind these businesses and labor unions and families? Absolutely \nnothing.\n  That is unacceptable. If we really want to address an issue that \nbusiness cares about and labor cares about, this is the issue.\n  If you are concerned about competitiveness, consider this: The cost \nof health insurance is embedded in the cost of every American product \nthat we export overseas. In other countries, the government provides \nthe health insurance. It is a government obligation, paid for in taxes. \nThe individual companies do not have to add it to the cost of the car \nthey are selling in the United States. But we do. Every time we produce \nsomething in the United States with American workers, covered by health \ninsurance premiums that are going through the roof, the cost of that \nhealth insurance is embedded in every product and, frankly, takes away \nfrom our competitiveness.\n  I challenge myself as a Senator here and my colleagues. We cannot \nescape the responsibility to address this issue honestly, and we cannot \nescape the reality that the marketplace is now driving health insurance \nbeyond the reach of conscientious businesses that want to protect their \nemployees and labor unions that are trying to stand up for working men \nand women and of families who, if they are left to their own devices, \nwill find this to be a very cruel alternative when they seek health \ninsurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11614-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1618\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, for the information of Members, we will \nhave an hour of debate, a half hour each side, and then we will have a \nvote at 2:40 this afternoon, followed by a series of five votes on \njudges.\n  This is a vote that, candidly, is not necessary. It is a vote that \nwill be 100 to nothing, or as many Senators as are still here to \nnothing.\n  It is a vote to get this bill to conference. The House passed one \nbill. The Senate has passed a different bill. The normal rules are you \nadopt a motion of disagreement and go to conference. Otherwise, you \nkeep bouncing back and forth to the House and the Senate with a fully \namendable vehicle which doesn't get you anywhere.\n  I am asking all of my colleagues to vote on this procedural matter to \nget the bill to conference. I will tell you that I fully anticipate the \nbill coming out of conference within a very short period of time before \nwe recess for the rest of the year. We will have a bill that will pass \nhere overwhelmingly. It will pass in the House overwhelmingly and be \nsigned by the President, which is the objective I think certainly the \nvast majority of the people in this Chamber would like to see done.\n  I understand there may be some reasons the Senator from California \nwanted to have this debate and have this vote. This is probably the \nonly time where all of us will agree on this issue and vote for this \nresolution and get it to conference. We will then move, hopefully \nexpeditiously, from that point.\n  I see the Senator from New Jersey is here. I will be happy to yield \nthe floor and allow him time to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, thank you. I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor and stand with my good friend, \nSenator Boxer, and the women across America to express my support for \nthe landmark Roe v. Wade decision and the importance of protecting a \nwoman's fundamental right to choose. I think that really is what the \nissue is about--not the parliamentary procedures we are talking about. \nEarlier this year, we marked the 30th anniversary of this critical \ndecision which clearly established a woman's fundamental right to \nreproductive choice. I strongly support that right. The decision about \nthis difficult choice for an individual should be made by the woman, \nher doctor, and her moral counsel and, in my view, not by politicians \nand not by Government. Simply put, I trust the women of America to make \ntheir own health and moral decisions without the intrusion of \nGovernment. I think that is what Roe v. Wade indicates.\n  Having said that, I recognize women and men of good faith can and \nwill reach different conclusions about this difficult moral question \ninvolved in the debate. But Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. I am \nvery troubled by this administration's--and frankly Congress's--\nattempts to undermine that basic right by that decision. Whether it is \nthrough the so-called partial-birth abortion bill, reduced access to \nfamily planning, efforts in redefining the legal status of fetuses, or \nfar-right traditional nominations, this administration and this \nCongress are constantly knowingly chipping away at women's fundamental \nfreedoms.\n  That is why I was pleased when, in the context of the so-called \npartial-birth bill, the Senate adopted the Harkin resolution expressing \nsupport for Roe v. Wade, which is what the debate is about today.\n\n  First, let me make clear I oppose the underlying bill, and I still \ndo. I believe the bill is unconstitutional, and it doesn't take into \naccount the health of the woman that the Supreme Court requires. Its \npractical effect would be to deny women access to some of the safest \nprocedures at all stages. That said, with the Harkin amendment \nincluded, I was at least partially satisfied that the Senate has \nreaffirmed the importance of Roe v. Wade.\n  Again, the reason we are having this debate is to make sure our \nconferees are embracing something we supported here in an open vote on \nthe floor of the Senate. All of us know the House has stripped away the \nresolution affirming Roe, laying bare, in my view, the true purpose of \nthe underlying legislation--to undermine Roe and ultimately roll back \nwomen's rights.\n  When Roe v. Wade was decided in January of 1973, abortion, except to \nsave a woman's life, was banned in two-thirds of the States, including \nmy home State of New Jersey. Roe rendered these laws unconstitutional, \nmaking abortion services safer and more accessible to women throughout \nthe country--not just to a select few--and certainly on a safe basis. \nMany of these statutes are still on the books waiting for an anti-\nchoice majority in the Supreme Court to overrule Roe.\n  I hope my colleagues will think long and hard about the implications \nof forsaking Roe. We need to be very careful to avoid returning to a \nperiod in which abortion was illegal and when the only choice women had \nwas to seek illegal and unsafe abortions--particularly when economic \nposition determined who had a safe choice. In those days, thousands of \nwomen died each year as a direct result of the abortion ban. In\n\n[[Page S11615]]\n\nfact, 17 percent of all deaths due to pregnancy and childbirth were the \nresult of illegal abortions. It would be tragic if we return to those \ndays and forget the lessons of history.\n  The Supreme Court itself in 1992 noted that in addition to improving \nwomen's health, Roe has enabled women to control their reproductive \nlives, and thus ``participate equally in the economic and social life \nof the Nation.'' Justice Harry Blackmun, the author of Roe, called his \ndecision ``a step that had to be taken as we go down the road towards a \nfull emancipation of women.'' That is a pretty straightforward sentence \nthat I think most Americans believe in.\n  If we are really interested in reducing the number of abortions in \nthis country, we should ensure that women have access to the full array \nof family planning services, including prescription, contraception, \nemergency contraception, and prenatal care. We should also support \nexpansion of comprehensive sex education. That is the way to deal with \nthis problem as opposed to putting it into the dark alleys and off of \nthe front pages.\n  Every week 8,500 children in our country are born to mothers who lack \naccess to prenatal care. Too many of these children are born with \nserious health problems because their mothers lacked adequate care \nduring their pregnancy. As a result, 28,000 infants die each year in \nthe United States. That is the real tragedy. We ought to act \nimmediately to address this issue by expanding access to prenatal care, \nas several of my colleagues and I have proposed, to start helping them \nstay healthy. What we should not do, however, is pass legislation we \nknow is unconstitutional and which would ban a common and safe form of \nabortion at all stages of pregnancy, and which would increase maternal \nmortality--all without improving the health of a single child.\n\n  We also should not forget Roe v. Wade is still the law of the land, \ndespite this administration's seizing opportunity after opportunity to \nundermine it. Unfortunately, though, Roe hangs by a thread, and the \nretirement of one Supreme Court Justice could mean a change and the \ndemise of Roe v. Wade.\n  That is why it is absolutely essential for this Senate to affirm the \nimportance--and indeed the very validity--of Roe v. Wade. That is why \nit is important for the Senate to oppose the House stripping of the \nHarkin resolution, which is what we are debating.\n  It is time for us to make sure we stand firm on what we believe in so \nstrongly. I think there is a lot we can do to prevent unintended \npregnancies. That is where we ought to be putting our efforts--not \nundermining Roe v. Wade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Certainly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what time remains at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California controls 22\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from Pennsylvania controls 28 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just wanted to thank my friend very much, through the \nChair, for coming over. I know it is a very hectic day for all of us. I \nappreciate the fact that several of my colleagues have come to the \nfloor to speak about this.\n  The Senator's point is quite eloquent; that is, affirming Roe, saying \nthis decision was the right decision and what this Senate ought to do.\n  Further, what we ought to be doing instead of outlawing procedures \nwithout making exception for the health of the woman, we ought to be \nmoving forward aggressively with family planning. We ought to be \nhelping poor children and poor families.\n  I find very interestingly the very people who want to have the court \noverturn Roe, say that Roe is a bad decision, and the Government should \ndecide what women should do with their own bodies are the ones we \ncannot get to support us on family planning and on helping poor kids. \nIt is a very odd set of circumstances to me when I see an elected \nofficial say we should ban abortion because it is wrong from minute 1. \nWe should ban abortion, force women to have these children at the \nearliest stages, not let them decide but have the Government decide, \nand then turn our backs on the children once they are born.\n  I ask my friend if he does not see an irony here?\n  Mr. CORZINE. There clearly is. The Senator from California recognized \nthat. First, there are positive steps that can truly lift up and help \nchildren across the country, across the world, frankly, including more \nthoughtful planning processes. But more importantly, we are taking a \ndecision away from individuals, which is the most private, the most \nmoral, the most important decisions they can take, and saying we know \nbest. I have a very hard time understanding how that fits with other \nphilosophies that I hear at times expressed.\n  I know this is a difficult decision for every individual. They have \nto struggle with that in their own lives. There is no way, in my view, \nthat we should be moving to have Government make that decision when, in \nfact, the individual, doctor, and people's moral counsel are the places \nwhere that decision lies.\n  I appreciate the Senator from California and her effort to make sure \nsuch an important and potentially divisive issue in our society, which \nhas been decided by the courts, constitutionally decided by the Court, \ncontinues to be reaffirmed by all involved in elective public office.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my colleague one more question. My colleague has \ncome in favor of the Harkin amendment. I hope we have a very big vote \nto disagree with what the House did. The House struck the Harkin \namendment from the bill. That is a very strong difference the Senate \nhas with the House. We will vote to disagree with what the House did.\n  I share with my friend the very elegant simple language of the Harkin \namendment:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe vs. Wade (410 \n     U.S. 113 (1973)) was appropriate and secures an important \n     right; and\n       (2) such decisions should not be overturned.\n\n  This is a very elegant, simple statement and, by the way, has no \nforce of law. It is simply a sense of this Senate.\n  Does it not seem to my friend to be an indication of how out of sync \nthe House is on that they would strike this simple sense-of-the Senate \nlanguage? If you ask the people, and we have a recent poll--Should \nGovernment be involved in the early stages of a pregnancy?--80 percent \nsay, Government, keep your nose out. And the House is so interested in \npassing this underlying ban on a medical procedure that, by the way, \nhas no exception for health, would the Senator not think they would \nhave just left this in and then there would be no difference between \nthe House and the Senate? As we know from our Government textbooks, \nwhen there is no difference, the bill would go right to the President. \nDoes my friend believe that the House leadership, those who struck this \nlanguage, who pushed striking this language, are out of step with the \nvast majority of people in New Jersey, people in California, people in \nthis country, 80 percent of whom believe the early stages of pregnancy, \nthis decision should be between a woman, her doctor, her God, and her \nfamily, and it is not about Senator Corzine deciding or Senator Boxer \ndeciding or Senator Santorum but rather the women, in consultation with \ntheir conscience, their family, their God, their doctor.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from California is elegantly stating the \ncase. I certainly have a strong sense that the people of New Jersey \nbelieve, the women of New Jersey believe, what the people across the \ncountry in the poll numbers that have been suggesting believe: Most \nAmericans thought this issue was resolved once and for all by a very \nclear decision, tough decision of the Supreme Court, and should stand.\n  What we are doing by including the Harkin resolution--which is, as \nthe Senator said, very elegant, simple, very straightforward, not the \nrule of law, the force of law--is very clearly underline something that \nhas been decided by the American people and continues to be supported \nby the American people. It is important we have this language in the \nunderlying bill which, by the way, as I suggested, I didn't vote for to \nstart with. But I do believe it was made better by this resolution. I \nimplore the Senator from California to continue to speak out with the \nkind of\n\n[[Page S11616]]\n\nelegance and care which gets at one of the most difficult and painful \nchoices and issues we have to deal with in our society.\n  Since we have resolved this, we should live with it and go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. To reiterate, this idea that the vast majority of the \nAmerican public agrees with Roe v. Wade is not correct. Roe v. Wade \nallows abortion under any circumstances at any time during pregnancy. \nThat is what Roe v. Wade does.\n  Now, what does the American public say about their position on \nabortion? According to the Center for the Advancement of Women, a pro-\nchoice activist group doing a survey among women in America--not \nwording it in a way that will get a conservative or pro-life response, \nI might add--51 percent of the women in this survey this year, this \nsummer, said they would either ban all abortions or only abortions in \nthe case of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother--51 \npercent of women in this country, and this is not inconsistent with \nother polls.\n  The idea that 80 percent of the people in America support Roe v. \nWade, if you tell people what Roe v. Wade is or ask them their position \non abortion and match it up with what Roe v. Wade does, 80 percent of \nthe American public under no survey support what the law is pursuant to \nRoe v. Wade; 51 percent would take what most people in this Chamber \nwould term the pro-life position, 50 percent of women--that is, no \nabortions or no abortions except in the case of rape, incest, and to \nsave the life of the mother, which is far less than 1 percent of \nabortions done in this country: 1.3 million, one-third of all \nconceptions in America end in abortion.\n  Additionally, 17 percent say it should be stricter than under current \nlaw. What does that mean? That means stricter than under Roe v. Wade. \nSo you have 68 percent of the women saying they disagree--according to \na pro-choice advocacy group survey--saying they disagree with Roe v. \nWade.\n  So the suggestion that the House is out of step with America because \nthey do not support language that is not supported by 68 percent of the \nAmerican public--and I argue it is probably higher than that because \nthe other category is so cloudily worded so as to probably bring in \npeople who would have problems with the absolutism of Roe v. Wade. The \nidea that 68 percent, at least, of women in this country do not support \nRoe v. Wade speaks for the wisdom of the House and the centrality of \nthe position that the House took.\n  A couple other comments about Senator Boxer's statement about \nrejecting the House's stripping of the Harkin language. The fact is, \nwhen you have two different versions that pass both bodies, you go to \nconference. That is what we do. We do it as a routine. That is what we \nwill do today. This is a routine procedure vote that simply gets us to \nconference. I assure my colleagues the bill that will come out of \nconference will be one that will be very familiar to Members here and \nwill be, I believe, overwhelmingly adopted.\n  There are another couple points I would like to make.\n  I spoke earlier on this topic--the Senator from California spoke \nabout it--and that is this idea that Roe v. Wade has saved the lives of \nwomen who would otherwise have had abortions illegally and would have \ndied as a result.\n  The Senator from California states that there were 5,000 women who \ndied per year as a result of illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade. I \nput into the Record the facts. The facts at that time, according to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the National Center for Health \nStatistics, which said there were a total of 612 deaths of women who \ndied as a result of complications from pregnancy--total maternal deaths \n612: of that, 83 were related to abortion.\n  If you look at the trend--this chart starts in 1942--the total number \nof deaths from abortion goes down from 1,200 to 1,100, to 986, to 888, \n760, 585, 496, 394, 316, 303. It keeps going down and down and down, \nall the way up to 1966, 189--160, 133, 132, 128, 99, 83--every year, \nvirtually every year. There are a couple where it goes up maybe one or \ntwo and then back down one or two, but the trendline is clear: Because \nof the improvements in health delivery, the improvements in medicine, \nwe have seen the number of deaths go down, even when abortion was \nillegal, as well as a commensurate drop in total maternal deaths as a \nresult of pregnancy.\n  We would expect that trend to continue as health delivery continues. \nIn fact, if you look at the numbers today, in 1998, which is the most \nrecent number available, there were nine women who died from legal \nabortions. If you would follow this trendline, that is actually higher \nthan what the trendline would suggest, given the trendline over the \nprevious 30 years on this chart.\n  So the idea that Roe v. Wade is saving all of these lives is false. \nIt is false. The idea that the Senator suggested--she said she was \ngoing to put evidence in the Record to substantiate the 5,000. We have \ngotten the information the Senator put in the Record. I cannot find \nanything in those documents that even talks about the number of women \nkilled from abortions prior to 1972. So maybe she handed in the wrong \ndocuments. I don't know. But I don't see anything in any of those \ndocuments that talks about the number of women who died prior to 1972 \nas a result of abortion.\n  The reason is, the only facts we have are the official facts of the \nU.S. Government. I know the Senator from California said: Well, these \nwomen in these statistics were subject to prosecution, criminal \nsanction, if they had an abortion, so, of course, they wouldn't be \nreported. What the Senator from California obviously forgot is these \nwomen are dead. So obviously they aren't concerned about criminal \nsanctions at that point. This is information off the death certificate. \nSo the idea that someone is playing with these numbers or the people \nare not reporting them because of fear of criminal action is just \nabsurd.\n  This argument that justifies Roe v. Wade is false. But what is true? \nThe number of abortions in this country has skyrocketed--that is true--\nand millions of children have died. Millions of children have died as a \nresult of Roe v. Wade.\n  Is the condition of children better as a result of Roe v. Wade? Is \nthe condition of the family better as a result of Roe v. Wade? The \nstatistics don't prove that out, either. Oh, I remember reading things \nthat were written at the time about how the legal right to an abortion \nwas going to dramatically affect the amount of abuse, domestic \nviolence, and we would see a dramatic drop in domestic violence because \nchildren--these problems that we have out there--if you take children \nout of the relationship--unwanted children--domestic violence will go \ndown. Roe v. Wade will decrease the amount of violence in the house. \nNot true. It did not happen. It went up.\n\n  It was said: Well, it will decrease the amount of violence toward \nchildren. You have all these unwanted children out here and as a result \nparents get violent because they don't want these kids and they are \nforced to have them. So not only domestic violence will go down but \nchild abuse will go down. False. It more than doubled. Almost \nimmediately, within a few years after Roe v. Wade, it started to go up \nand dramatically increase.\n  You can see from every single social indicator that has an impact on \nwomen and children and families in America, they have suffered horribly \nas a result of this ``compassionate'' decision. The facts just do not \nwork out the way some would have liked them to, so we make up facts.\n  The Senator said: I am entitled to my facts and she is entitled to \nhers. Well, I disagree. You are entitled to your opinion; you are not \nentitled to your own set of facts. The facts are what they are. Make \nyour debate. Make your arguments. As a result of that, I respect you to \ndo that. But the facts are what they are.\n  These are not my facts. These are the facts of the Federal \nGovernment, period. And they do not support the arguments.\n  The Senator from New Jersey said that somehow or another we are not \nto make decisions in the Senate that affect the rights of women with \nrespect to carrying a pregnancy to term. I respect that opinion. I \ndisagree with it.\n  I think it is important we have this debate. The problem, though, is \nthat we really cannot have this debate. See, the problem with the U.S. \nSupreme Court's decision is that this debate was\n\n[[Page S11617]]\n\ntruncated in America because the U.S. Supreme Court came in and pulled \nthe debate that was raging across America as to how we are to deal with \nthis very difficult issue--and it is a difficult issue--they just \npulled the stakes right up and said: No, we are going to take this \nincredibly important moral decision, take it out of the hands of the \nAmerican public, and we are going to decide, we are going to make a new \nconstitutional right, a right to an abortion.\n  I think everyone would agree, prior to 1973 there was no such right. \nSo they created one in the Constitution--by the way, without having to \ngo through the tortuous exercise of passing a constitutional amendment. \nThey just decided to do it and took away the right of every American--\nother than them--to decide what the right public policy should be, what \nthe moral public policy should be.\n  I hear this so often, that Congress should not make moral decisions. \nName me one vote we have here that does not have some moral \nimplication. Every single one does, from whom we tax to whom we \nregulate. There is a moral component to everything we do here. We \ncannot run from that. My goodness, I hope we do not want to run from \nit.\n  But they usurped that authority away from the people of the United \nStates, and now, when those of us get up and question that, we are \nsomehow illegitimate or extreme or somehow not comporting with the law \nof the land.\n  Well, I have likened this decision--and I will to do it again--to the \nDred Scott case. I refer to Roe v. Wade as Dred Scott II because it is \nexactly the same principle upon which Dred Scott was decided. Dred \nScott was decided saying that the rights of a human being were subject \nto the rights of another person.\n  The life right, the essential right, the most important right, the \nright to an existence was subject to the liberty rights of somebody \nelse.\n  There were people at that time who said: Who are we to make this \ndecision that slaveholders should not have the ability to own slaves? \nIt has been done for centuries. It is in the Bible. How can this be \nwrong? And who are we to make the decision? We should trust our own \nconscience. We should trust the conscience of these people to do the \nright thing. I think that is what the Senator from New Jersey said. \nThat decision should be made between the slave owner, the banker, and \nthe slave. Maybe the slave doesn't get involved; I don't know. What did \nthey say back then? But that is the same debate being made today. We \nsort of remove ourselves from having any moral overtones: We should not \nmake this decision. Let somebody else make it. I personally may be \nopposed to slavery, but who am I to tell a slaveholder they shouldn't \nhave a slave? How many times have you heard: I personally would never \nown a slave? I personally would never condone abortion?\n  It is the same issue. The right of life has been subjugated to the \nright of someone's freedom to do what they want irrespective of that \nother person's life. That is what slavery was based upon. That is why \nwe look at it now and we say: How could we possibly let that happen?\n  How could we take the order of liberties put forward in the \nDeclaration of Independence--that you are endowed by your creator with \nthe right to life first and foremost, then liberty, then the pursuit of \nhappiness? Why? Because if you don't have life, you can't have liberty. \nAnd if you don't have liberty, you can never pursue your happiness and \nyour dreams. When you put those out of order, it is like pouring acid \non the structure of America. It corrodes us. It just eats away at us. \nAnd it infects so much else. So much else has been affected by this \nright to privacy under the Constitution that was created by the Supreme \nCourt. I mean you go on and on and on, these rights that put the \nliberty rights of some over the life rights of others. What happened to \nthe society that put the rights of others before the rights of us, put \nthe common good before us?\n  I had the privilege a couple months ago, on July 4, to be at the \nNational Constitution Center opening. I thank my colleagues who \nsupported Federal support for this incredible facility to teach our \nchildren about our Constitution. It is three blocks from Independence \nHall. It is a magnificent facility, a great interpretive facility that \nteaches about the essentials of our Constitution.\n  I was asked to speak at this event and talk about one particular \npiece of the Preamble to the Constitution. Each speaker got a little \npiece and, therefore, we were to weave the whole thing together. My \npiece was ``promote the general welfare.''\n  Not having been a great student of the Constitution, I decided I had \nbetter read the Preamble again and get an understanding of what this \nwas all about. As I looked at that, I looked up the definition of \n``preamble.'' It said: The reason for the document to follow. It gave \nthe reason. Why did we establish, why did we put this Constitution \ntogether? The preamble states the why; the Constitution itself is the \nwhat. And it struck me, as to all the things that were in the \nConstitution--establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide \nfor the common defense, secure liberty for ourselves and our \nposterity--of the five verbs, ensure, establish, provide, and promote, \nfour of the five were active verbs in which the Government was to do \nsomething. It was the Government's responsibility to ensure or to \nestablish or to provide, except the one--promote.\n\n  The Government's job there was not to do that but to create an \natmosphere in which people would do it. Do what? Promote the general \nwelfare. And what is the general welfare? What was the reason that our \nFounding Fathers gave us all of these rights and which the Supreme \nCourt now litigates on, the rights in the Bill of Rights, the right to \nfreedom of speech and freedom of assembly and freedom of the press and \nreligion, all of the freedoms, equal opportunity, all of the things \nthat are in this great Constitution of ours?\n  What was the goal of our Founders in giving individual--because they \nare by and large not group rights; they are rights of individuals--\nrights, the general welfare, not the individual welfare, not your \npersonal success, the common good. It was a country designed to be \nbigger than us. It was not about us. Yes, they gave freedom to us. They \ngave liberty to us. But the goal was not us. The goal was something \nlofty, something great. And we are corroding this document into \nsomething that is just about us.\n  The greatest of the corrosions is Roe v. Wade. The greatest injustice \nis Roe v. Wade, where it says: I am the law; I decide common good, \ngeneral welfare--me. I come first.\n  That is not the vision of the miracle of Philadelphia. That is not \nthe reason this country was established through this Constitution. We \nhad loftier goals. We had greater ideals. We had dreams of what this \ncountry could be if we all went out and, yes, pursued our dreams, but \nwe did so in service to others, in building a community, in founding a \nnation based on morals and laws that respected the rights of others. \nOh, how we have slipped, how we have slipped to just thinking about us.\n  Why is this right in the Constitution so popular among others, \nparticularly the popular culture, the elite culture in this country? \nWhy is it so adamantly defended by the media and those in this elite \nculture? Because it is about me. It is a culture. Look around you, \nfolks. It is a culture that says: If it feels good, do it. Please \nyourself. Don't worry about other people. Just do whatever feels good--\nme, me, me.\n  Of all the rights in the Constitution, the right to privacy is the \n``me'' right, it is the ``me first'' right.\n  If you think about what our Founding Fathers did when they put that \nConstitution together, they had no intention of creating me-first \nrights. If you have any question, read the Preamble--the general \nwelfare, the common good. That is what this country is all about, and \nthey knew the best way to get there was to give people the freedom to \npursue the truth, to pursue those dreams, to pursue happiness--not \nhedonistic happiness but true happiness that you find in serving \nothers, in doing things that are bigger than you.\n  We have lost our way, and there is no better example of how lost we \nare than this decision. I know there are hard cases out there, and we \nwill hear them, I am sure. We will hear them over and over again, how \ndifficult the decisions are. Having known people who have gone through \nthat decision, I know\n\n[[Page S11618]]\n\nhow gut-wrenching and terrible and awful these tough decisions are. But \nI think back to the speech given earlier this year by Condoleezza Rice \nat the National Prayer Breakfast. She gave a talk I have not heard in \nthis town for a long time. She gave a talk about the importance of \nsuffering. She gave a talk about her ancestors, slaves in America, who \nhad a spiritual hymn, ``Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen,'' followed \nshortly thereafter by the verse: Glory hallelujah.\n  She said it struck her: How could they be talking about all this \nsuffering and pain and then giving glory to God? She let me understand \nthat God puts you through suffering to perfect you. I don't know too \nmany people in life who learn and grow by having things come easy, \nbeing taken care of by somebody else. They learn by the difficult, \ntough things we all do because we are all sinners, we all make \nmistakes, and we get ourselves in jams all the time. You learn, you \ndevelop character, and you develop who you are by how you deal with \nthat suffering.\n  I would argue the right to privacy in America has given people an out \nthat is not always in the best interest of them or our society.\n  This is a tough issue. I reiterate, I respect the other side for \ntheir opinion. I just wish the Court would respect my side. I wish the \nCourt of the United States of America would respect the other side of \nthis issue enough to allow us to debate it in America and make a \ndecision based on how America feels about it because that is how \ndemocracies and republics are supposed to work. But they have denied \nyou, the American public, and your representatives here the opportunity \nto do that. My colleague from California wants to keep it that way. I \nthink you deserve better.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will you give me the time situation, \nplease?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 15 minutes 27 \nseconds, and the Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 minute 2 seconds.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from California reserves 10 \nminutes to close.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will you please notify me when I have 10 \nminutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we are coming to the end of what I think \nhas been a very good debate. I am very hopeful the Senate will vote yes \non the motion to disagree with the House. The Senator from \nPennsylvania, who is worried about this, has decided everyone is going \nto vote for it. I say good news. Let the Supreme Court see that while \nthe Senate took up this bill to ban a medical procedure, a medically \nnecessary procedure, it, at the same time, supported a landmark \ndecision called Roe v. Wade that said to the Government: Stay out of \npeople's lives in the very early stages of a pregnancy. It said to the \nSenators then and to the Senators now: You think you are important, but \nguess what. You need to respect the people you represent and not \ninterfere in a decision they need to make with their God. I think that \nis profoundly moral.\n  What I think is immoral is to take your views, Madam President, or my \nviews or the views of the Senator from Pennsylvania and force them on \nthe people of this country. It is disrespectful, it is not right, and \nit is not what America is about.\n  In 1973, the Court said to us: At the early stages of a pregnancy, a \nwoman has this right, but at the later stages of a pregnancy the State \ncan, in fact, ban abortion, as long as the State always respects the \nlife and health of a woman. That was a wise decision, and it has held \nto this time. There are many people who want to see it overturned. \nIndeed, the Court is about 5-4 on that decision. A lot hangs on that \nbecause this is not some abstract issue. This is a real issue.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania challenged me this morning. He said: \nYou keep saying women's health would be harmed if this medical \nprocedure in the underlying bill is banned, but you have no proof.\n  I don't know what more I can do than what I did this morning, which \nis to put into the Record--and I will reiterate the documents--how many \ndoctors, organizations, how many nurses, how many OB/GYNs said, we are, \nin fact, opening up the door for women to be harmed, gravely harmed.\n  Let's put up the chart that shows what we were told by physicians \ncould happen. If this is supposed to be a moral bill, I ask you a \nsimple question: Is it a moral position to outlaw a medical procedure \nthat doctors are telling us is necessary, in many cases, to protect the \nhealth of a woman? Is it a moral position to subject a woman to \nhemorrhages, to uterine rupture, to blood clots, to embolism, to \nstroke, to damage to nearby organs, such as your kidneys, to paralysis? \nIf that is considered a moral position, then I guess--I just can't see \nit. I don't see it.\n  If you don't know, if you do something without knowledge, I cannot \nsay you are immoral. But if you are doing something with knowledge, if \nyou are banning a procedure we know is necessary, and we have doctor \nafter doctor--here is testimony of Vanessa Cullins, vice president of \nMedical Affairs of Planned Parenthood after years of being a board-\ncertified OB/GYN with a master's degree in public health and business \nadministration. That is her testimony.\n  We also put in the Record the testimony of Anne Davis, M.D. She is a \nphysician who practices in New York. She is board-certified in OB/GYN. \nShe went to Columbia University. She gives us chapter and verse about \nher belonging to the American College of OB/GYNs and how they are very \nworried that these things, and worse, could happen if this bill passes.\n  Let's face it, this underlying bill is going to pass. For the first \ntime in history, Congress is playing doctor, outlawing a medical \nprocedure that is sometimes necessary to save the life and health of a \nwoman, outlawing that procedure without a health exception, and we are \ndoing it with knowledge and forethought. If you can sleep at night \ndoing it, then that is fine.\n  The American Medical Women's Association: Please have a health \nexception.\n  The American Public Health Association; Physicians for Reproductive \nChoice and Health. It goes on and on. This letter by Felicia Stewart, \nwho is an OB/GYN in California, was very specific on what could happen. \nSo the bottom line is, if we want to talk about morality, I am ready to \ntalk about morality.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will withhold my 10 minutes until after the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, to reiterate, we make moral decisions \non this floor every day. We decide what things are legal, what things \nare illegal. We do so based on a variety of things, but morality is \ncertainly one component of that. The idea that we have no right to pass \nlaws that are moral, then we should eliminate the laws against killing, \nwe should eliminate the laws against rape. Those are all based upon the \nfact we believe those acts are harmful and immoral and therefore we \npass laws to proscribe them.\n  I do not think we want to kick ourselves out of the business of \nstopping things that are immoral in this country by passing laws to \nproscribe them. Believe it or not, some people actually do not do \nimmoral things because there are laws against them.\n  I suggest that this idea that we have no right to pass moral judgment \nis the greatest canard that I have heard across this country. I hear it \nall the time, that we should absent ourselves from this moral debate. \nIt is exactly where this debate should occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I never said we should not pass laws that stop \nimmorality. I am a champion of those. I am leading a fight right now in \nthe Commerce Committee to stop child kiddy porn. I am sure my friend is \ngoing to work with me on it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. He misunderstood and absolutely misrepresented what I \nsaid. What I said is that the underlying bill, which does not make an \nexception for the health of the woman, is an immoral\n\n[[Page S11619]]\n\nbill. I do not think it is a moral bill. I think it is an immoral bill, \nand the reason I think it is an immoral bill is it makes no exception \nfor the health of a woman, no matter how hard we try. We reached across \nthe party line. We said we want to make an exception for health. Oh, \nno, women will lie. Oh, no, doctors will lie. We cannot have a health \nexception. People will lie.\n  I feel sorry for a woman who finds herself in a circumstance where \nshe is in desperate shape, in a pregnancy gone horribly wrong--and I \nhave met many of them. I have seen their faces, and God bless them \nbecause they have come out and given up their privacy to talk about \nwhat they have gone through. I feel sorry for the next woman who is \nlying bleeding on a table and a doctor has to take out this law and \nsay: I am not sure because your life may not be at stake. It may be \nyour health, and if I use this safe procedure I might lose my license, \nI might go to jail.\n  Anyone who wants to be party to that, be my guest. Thankfully, across \nthe street there is a Supreme Court, and I think they will find this \nunderlying bill unconstitutional because it is vague and because it \ndoes not make an exception for the health of the woman. Even the most \nrabid anti-choice people are now saying that this bill is surely \nunconstitutional.\n  Why do I think the underlying bill is immoral? Because we know a \nwoman could get a hemorrhage, a uterine rupture, blood clots, an \nembolism, a stroke, damage to her organs, or paralysis if this \ntechnique, this medical procedure, is not used in certain very serious \ncases.\n  So, oh, yes, I support laws that are moral. My colleague is \nabsolutely correct, there is morality in everything we do. When we go \nafter corporate abuse, when we go after criminals who because of \ninsider trading, for example, make an illegal profit, I am going after \nthem. That is a moral issue. Weapons of mass destruction, that is a \nmoral issue. A new generation of nuclear bombs, that is a moral issue. \nAbortion is a moral issue. You bet it is.\n  I believed that the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 took a moral stand \nand found that they have to balance the rights of all involved. My \nfriend says, and I am going to quote him now, ``Our society is \ncorroding.''\n  Well, I do not believe that I am corroding because I am pro-choice. I \ndo not believe the people in the Senator's State who are pro-choice are \ncorroding. I do not believe that the people of this country who believe \nthat politicians ought to stay out of their private lives in the early \nstage of a pregnancy are corroding. I think they are struggling with a \ntough issue.\n  My friend said this morning that I was wrong, that 5,000 women did \nnot die. I put a cite into the Record. I now have a book by Richard \nSchwartz, assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and \nGynecology School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. He was the \nchief of the section there. This is an old book from 1968 in which he \nsays:\n\n       It has been estimated that as many as 5,000 American women \n     die each year as a direct result of criminal abortion. The \n     figure of 5,000 may be a minimum estimate inasmuch as many \n     such deaths are mislabeled or unreported.\n\n  As I said to my friend this morning, he said the CDC said only 85 \nwomen died of illegal abortions. Well, people did not come forward. \nFamilies did not come forward. Doctors did not come forward.\n  This was a crime. He has in his own State a great university, and one \nof the leaders of the School of Medicine there has written this. I ask \nunanimous consent that this excerpt from the book be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Septic Abortion\n\n                     (By Richard H. Schwarz, M.D.)\n\n\n                          Scope of the Problem\n\n       It has been estimated that as many as 5,000 American women \n     die each year as a direct result of criminal abortion. The \n     figure of 5,000 may be a minimum estimate, inasmuch as many \n     such deaths are mislabeled or unreported. Most studies also \n     indicate that up to 1,200,000 illegal abortions are performed \n     annually or--otherwise stated--that one pregnancy in five in \n     this country is illegally terminated. Hellegers challenged \n     these figures and suggested that there are more likely \n     200,000 abortions and 800 deaths annually. Although much \n     smaller, these figures still represent a significant wastage. \n     With the striking reduction in the general, maternal death \n     rate, however, septic abortion has become a leading cause of \n     maternal deaths. In Philadelphia over 50 per cent of the \n     maternal deaths result from complications of abortion, and \n     this fact apparently holds true in other areas of the \n     country: Stevenson reports 57 per cent in Michigan; Hellman, \n     33 per cent at the Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn: and \n     Fox, 28 per cent in California.\n       During recent years at the Philadelphia General Hospital, \n     where deliveries averaged between 4,000 and 5,000 per year, \n     there have been, rather consistently, 800 to 1,000 abortions \n     annually. One can readily see that this exceeds the expected \n     spontaneous abortion rate. Periodic reviews of patients \n     admitted with incomplete or inevitable abortions indicate \n     that at least one third of these women can be classified as \n     septic at the time of admission to the hospital. During the \n     12-year period between January 1, 1954 and December 31, 1966, \n     a review of slightly over 12,000 abortions revealed 29 \n     deaths. Twelve fatalities were caused by septic shock, five \n     by ruptured postabortal abscess, two by staphylococcal \n     septicemia and two by tetanus. Therefore, 21 of the total of \n     29 deaths, were caused by infection.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Another point of debate about how many women died, \nwhether it is 85, 89, 100, 5,000, or as Dr. Schwartz says, probably \nmuch more, one death from an illegal abortion is too many.\n  Those of us who remember back to those days remember that, and that \nis why the Harkin amendment is so important because the Harkin \namendment simply said we strongly support Roe. We do not think it ought \nto be overturned. I am very hopeful that every Republican and every \nDemocrat today will vote to support Roe in this motion to disagree.\n  My colleague says it is just a routine voice vote. No, it is not. It \nis a vote on substance. That is why we have been arguing it. If it was \nsuch a routine, just a go-to-conference vote, I do not think he would \nhave been arguing against Roe. If he wants to argue against Roe and \nthen vote for Roe, that is great with me because we are sending that \nright over to the Court, and they will see that the Senate stands \nfirmly in favor of Roe.\n  There are certain problems in our country that we thought we solved. \nOne of them was this problem because when Roe v. Wade was heard, we did \nhave thousands of women dying, and thousands more being made infertile. \nWe all knew the stories. We all lived through those times. Roe said \nsomething had to be done about it. What they decided to do is balance \nall the interests.\n  Let us show what Roe says, because it is, in my opinion, such a \nmoderate decision that balanced all of the interests and why it has \nbeen supported for so many years. What they say is that after \nviability:\n\n     . . . the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality \n     of human life may, if it chooses, regulate and even \n     proscribe--\n\nthat means ban--\n\n     abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical \n     judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the \n     mother.\n\n  I believe people who come to this floor and talk about morality, that \nis their right to do it. If they want to say they are more moral than \nsomeone else, that is their right. I do not have a problem with that. \nBut what the Court did back in 1973 has said this is a tough issue. We \nhave to look at everything. What they decided is instead of women \nrunning to a back-alley abortionist and paying cash under the table and \nrisking their life by bleeding to death, becoming infertile and all of \nthat, that in the early stages of a pregnancy, before the fetus could \nlive outside the womb, that a woman has this right to choose.\n  I have to say, if we go back, and we could go back--it all depends on \nwho is in this Senate, who is sitting in the President's seat, who is \nover in the Court. That is all that is riding on. It is very clear. If \nwe go back, we are going to go back to the days that were not good for \nwomen and were not good for families. Do you know what. They were not \ngood for anyone.\n\n  The beauty of being pro-choice and being in favor of Roe is that we \nrespect everyone's opinion, not only by just standing here and saying, \nI respect the Senator, I respect the Senator--that is all fine. I \nrespect my constituents. That means I trust them to make a judgment. \nThat is the foundation of Roe--balancing all the interests; saying, at \nthe early stages, keep the big nose of Uncle Sam and the Government out \nof private lives.\n\n[[Page S11620]]\n\n  Some people find that privacy ruling distressing. I think it said: Do \nyou know what. This is a great country because we respect our people. \nWe are not an oppressive government like China. We are not an \noppressive government like Romania certainly was. We don't force our \npeople to have children. And we don't force them to have abortions. We \ntrust them to think about what they want to do in such a situation.\n  I am extremely hopeful that in one moment from now we will have a big \nvote, a big vote to disagree with what the House did when they \ncallously stripped out the Roe language that Senator Harkin put in.\n  I hope it is a big vote. I cannot wait to see the vote because we are \ngoing to make sure the Supreme Court understands that we still stand \nfor the life and health of the woman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am delighted that David Proctor is \nmoving forward, as I believe three other nominees are from New York. \nDavid Proctor was an outstanding student in his undergraduate studies \nat Carson Newman College. He served on the Law Review at the University \nof Tennessee. He was at the top of his class in law school. He clerked \nfor Judge Emory Widener on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  He was a member of one of Alabama's largest and most prestigious law \nfirms, Sirotte & Permutt. And then he formed his own firm: Lehr, \nMiddlebrooks, Price & Proctor.\n  He is a lawyer's lawyer, a practitioner who is in court on a regular \nbasis, a man of great integrity and ability. I believe he is going to \nbe a terrific Federal judge. He wants more than anything to give his \nlife to serving the law. I think he will do that. It is a great honor \nfor me to support his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I support the nominee who has been \naddressed by the Senator from Alabama.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nR. David Proctor, who has been nominated to the United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of Alabama.\n  Mr. Proctor graduated with honors from the University of Tennessee \nCollege of Law in 1986. Following his graduation, he clerked for the \nHonorable Emory Widener Jr. on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  Mr. Proctor next entered private practice with the law firm of Sirote \n& Permutt, first as an associate and then as a partner. He left Sirote \nin 1993 to become a partner at Lehr, Middlebrooks, Price & Proctor, \nwhere he currently practices law. He specializes in labor, employment \nand civil rights law, representing employers and public sector entities \nranging from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses. Furthermore, he \nhas authored numerous articles on employment law. In recent years, Mr. \nProctor has augmented his litigation practice with mediation.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues a letter sent to the \ncommittee in support of Mr. Proctor's nomination by Alex Newton, a \npartner in the Birmingham law firm of Hare, Wynn, Newell and Newton. \nMr. Newton is a self-described ``lifelong active Democrat.'' He has \nknown Mr. Proctor since the beginning of his legal career and highly \nrecommends him to the bench. He writes that Mr. Proctor has ``broad \nexperience . . . as an attorney. He is energetic, personable and \nblessed with absolute integrity. As a judge, I have no doubt he would \nrule without being influenced by race, creed, wealth or poverty of the \nlitigant before him. He would serve . . . with distinction.''\n  As this letter attests, Mr. Proctor is an experienced attorney who \nwill be an\n\n[[Page S11621]]\n\nasset to the Federal bench. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of R. David Proctor, of Alabama, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama? The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Smith) is absent \nbecause of a death in the family.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) would vote ``yea''.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Hollings), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from \nGeorgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FEUERSTEIN TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                      EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination of Sandra \nJ. Feuerstein.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Sandra J. Feuerstein, of \nNew York, to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are two minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the nomination. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield to the senior Senator from New \nYork. These next four nominees come here with bipartisan support. As a \nresult, they went through very quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, this is the first of four nominees from \nNew York. They are all very qualified, fine people.\n  The only point I wish to make is that the administration and the \nGovernor worked closely with the Senate and with me and Senator Clinton \non these nominations. I think it shows, when there is cooperation, when \nthere is true advice as part of the advise and consent process, we can \ncome up with excellent nominees.\n  Each one of the nominees meets the criteria I believe we should have \nin every Federal judge--legal excellence, moderation, not too far left, \nnot too far right, and diversity.\n  I will speak once because there are four of them, but I am proud to \nbe here to vote for every one of the four nominees.\n  Again, if we get cooperation, we can do this without acrimony, \nwithout partisanship. That is what has happened in New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to express my unqualified \nsupport for the nomination of Sandra Feuerstein to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of New York, and to urge my colleagues \nto confirm this fine nominee.\n  Justice Feuerstein has excellent academic and professional \nqualifications for the Federal bench. After her graduation from Cardozo \nLaw School, she joined the clerk pool of the New York Supreme Court Law \nDepartment. In 1985, she was chosen to clerk for Justice Leo H. \nMcGinity, an administrative judge in the New York State Supreme Court. \nIn 1987, she joined the bench of the Nassau County District Court. In \n1994, Justice Feuerstein became a Justice of the New York State \nSuperior Court, where she would remain for the next five years. Since \n1999, she has been a Justice on the New York State Appellate Division--\nNew York's highest State court.\n  In addition to her proven bench experience, Justice Feuerstein is a \nhighly recognized public figure. She has lent her extensive talents to \nthe Nassau County Bar, various pro bono programs that she has founded \nor chaired, and many charitable organizations like the American Cancer \nSociety. In the last decade, Justice Feuerstein has been the recipient \nof such awards as: Judge of the Year twice, Woman of the Year, Pro Bono \nRecognition Award, and Outstanding Committee Chairperson of the Year \nAward, to name a few. Earlier in her career, Justice Feuerstein was \nboth an associated editor and editor of the Nassau Lawyer. In addition \nto her professional, charitable and publishing duties, she has been an \nadjunct professor at Hofstra University Law School since 1998.\n  Justice Feuerstein possesses the qualifications, the capacity, and \nthe temperament a judge needs to serve on the federal bench. I am \npleased to support this stellar nominee.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, prior to the start of the vote, I know \nthere are a number of Senators concerned about the schedule, given the \nconditions. I ask the distinguished Senator from Vermont, the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, what his intentions would be with \nregard to additional rollcall votes. We anticipated taking up five \nnominations this afternoon. I have been consulting with him, and I \nreally appreciate, as always, his cooperation on this matter.\n  I ask if he has any intention of seeking rollcall votes on the other \nnominees who are currently pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if I may respond to my friend from South \nDakota, I assured the distinguished Senators from New York and the \ndistinguished Senators from Alabama that we would have support on the \nAlabama judge, which we just voted on, and the next one is from New \nYork, and we would get them confirmed.\n  I have been asked by a number of Senators, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, because of the weather, if there is a possibility to just \nhave this next rollcall vote and do the remaining three by voice vote. \nI would have no objection. Would that be the last vote of the day?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I do not think the leader is prepared \nto say that yet.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If we are going to have more votes, we might as well go \nahead.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I don't know. We will discuss it with the leader.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Why don't we go forward with this vote. If the decision is \nmade that there will be no further rollcall votes while we are voting \non this next\n\n[[Page S11622]]\n\nnomination, then I will not ask for rollcall votes on the remaining \nthree nominations.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from South Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will consult with the majority leader \nwith regard to his intention for additional rollcall votes, and we can \ncontinue our discussion following this vote. I think we ought to \nproceed with the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if the distinguished Democratic leader \nand the distinguished Republican leader do not intend to have any more \nrollcall votes, I certainly am not going to ask for any more rollcall \nvotes on the remaining judges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Sandra J. Feuerstein, of New York, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York? The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Smith) is absent \nbecause of a death in the family.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) would vote ``yea''.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Hollings), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from \nGeorgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, first of all, congratulations to the \nmanagers of this bill. We are making real progress. We still have a \nnumber of amendments to look at, and discussions are ongoing. Even over \nthe last several hours, while we have addressed the judges issue and \ncompleted debate and voting on the partial-birth abortion issue, work \non Interior has continued. Overall, we are very pleased.\n  This is really for the benefit of our colleagues to give them some \nidea of what will be happening here on the floor today, tonight, \ntomorrow, and over the next several days.\n  First, we will have no more rollcall votes tonight or tomorrow or \nFriday. I start with that because I know that is what my colleagues are \nwaiting to hear.\n  Work will continue tonight on the Interior bill. In talking to the \nmanagers, a number of amendments are being considered. Debate will \ncontinue this afternoon and into this evening and tomorrow morning.\n  We are in constant touch through the Sergeant at Arms and talking to \nFEMA about the weather conditions. Any decisions as to how long we will \nactually be in session will absolutely be focused on safety first and \nforemost. In saying that, we will be in session this afternoon and \ntonight, on Interior. We will come in tomorrow morning, and we will \nmake the announcement when, but probably at 9:30 in the morning. I \ndoubt that we will be on the floor all day. Again, the weather in part, \nthe debate on the Interior bill in part, will determine that.\n  We will not be in session on Friday.\n  We will have votes on Monday, and likely multiple votes on Monday, \nsince we are losing the opportunity for rollcall votes on Friday and \nThursday and in part tonight. Business will continue, but it will mean \nthat we will need to have multiple votes on Monday.\n  We intend to make progress on Interior, but also would like to set \nas, really, the final--final passage on that Tuesday, at some point \nTuesday. That means we have the amendments before us to consider, and \nif there are any other amendments, we absolutely must know about those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I appreciate the announcement of the \nschedule by the majority leader. I will say to my colleagues, I have \nevery expectation that we can complete our work on this bill on \nTuesday. I intend to work with the majority leader to complete our work \non the Interior bill by Tuesday. That will require Senators who have \namendments to come to the floor for the remaining hours of today and \ntomorrow morning. I know I have one or two amendments, and I intend to \noffer them either today or tomorrow morning in order to allow those \nvotes to be cast and stacked on Monday night. So there is no reason we \ncannot finish our work on this bill on Tuesday, assuming--and the \nmajority leader has assured me--that we will go to another \nappropriations bill once we complete our work on this one.\n  I would also want to say to my distinguished colleague who was here \njust a moment ago, the Senator from Vermont, I am, once again, grateful \nfor his cooperation. He is a man of his word. He, again, had indicated \nto me, on the understanding there would be no more rollcall votes, that \nhe would be willing to allow the three remaining votes on these judges \ntoday to be taken by voice. So I want to express for the record and \npublicly, once again, my gratitude to Senator Leahy for his cooperation \nand his understanding of the need for some Senators to catch planes \nthis afternoon.\n\n  I appreciate, again, the majority leader's comments and will work \nwith him to complete the schedule.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me make one further statement and I will be happy to \nyield.\n  Committee hearing decisions are being made today by chairmen. Again, \nwe are going to be conducting business on the Senate floor. A number of \nchairmen called and said: Should we go ahead and cancel our hearings \nand committee meetings? That is being left to their discretion. \nIndividual offices--I know a number are calling the Sergeant at Arms \nand calling our offices. We will stay in touch and we will come \nstraight to the floor if there is any information in terms of safety \nthat we know about as we go forward.\n  These five judges are very important. I would add we have six judges \nwho are also waiting, right now, whose nominations are ready to come to \nthe floor and to be voted upon. I hope we can do that soon. I would \nlike to be able, possibly, to do some of those on Monday. We have six \nmore judges who are ready to go.\n  I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I would only say for the record, the \nvotes today will take us to 151 judges that the Senate has cast votes \non since this administration has come to office--151 district and \ncircuit court judges. So, obviously, we are making great progress on \nthose numbers.\n  For the record, I want to be sure our colleagues are aware of where \nwe are, where we stand with regard to the number of confirmations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S11623]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I understand the schedule has the \npotential of finishing up on the Interior bill on Tuesday. Does the \nleadership have options after Tuesday in terms of what appropriations \nbills we might go to after Tuesday?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be happy to talk. We have been talking several days \nin advance each time. As the Democratic leader said, our intention is \nto go to appropriations and stay on appropriations. There is other \nbusiness as we worked out to address partial-birth abortion and the \njudges. But the intention is to go to an appropriations bill. The \nspecific one we don't know now. This is Wednesday. We are talking about \na week from now. But we will stay in constant touch.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

The question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Richard J. \nHolwell of New York to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of New York?\n  Without objection, the nomination is confirmed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nRichard J. Holwell, who has been nominated to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York.\n  Mr. Holwell is a 1970 cum laude graduate of Columbia Law School. The \nfollowing year he earned his diploma in criminology from the Cambridge \nUniversity Institute of Criminology. He then entered private practice \nwith the New York law firm White & Case, first as an associate, then as \na partner. Currently, he heads the firm's global litigation practice.\n  Mr. Holwell has spent most of his professional career litigating \ncomplex securities, antitrust, bankruptcy, and other financial market \ncases before both trial and appellate courts. He has extensive \nexperience in both civil and criminal investigations conducted by the \nDepartment of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and \nother Federal agencies.\n  Mr. Holwell has also been a zealous advocate for the underserved. In \n1987, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund awarded him its Pro \nBono Award for his successful litigation of Capers v. Long Island Rail \nRoad, a 10-year protracted title VII case in which he fought to protect \nthe rights of black employees. In addition to title VII suits, he has \nrepresented indigent clients in landlord-tenant and custody disputes.\n  Mr. Holwell is an extremely well-qualified nominee. He brings \ncompassion as well as more than 30 years of legal experience to the \nFederal bench. I am confident that he will be a fine addition to the \nbench and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his confirmation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11623-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF STEPHEN C.

The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Stephen C. Robinson, of \nNew York, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District \nof New York.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nconfirmation of Stephen Robinson to the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York.\n  Mr. Robinson has had a diverse and distinguished legal career. After \ngraduating from the prestigious Cornell Law School, he worked for two \ncorporate law firms, concentrating almost exclusively on civil matters. \nIn 1987, he shifted gears and joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York, where he represented the United States \nprimarily in criminal trials.\n  In 1991, Mr. Robinson joined Kroll Associates, an international risk \nconsulting company, serving as an advisor to the company on legal \nmatters and conducting investigations for governments, corporations and \nlaw firms.\n  From 1993 to 1995, Mr. Robinson worked with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, providing advice and counsel to the FBI regarding \nvarious policy issues in both civil and criminal matters. Then in 1995, \nMr. Robinson became counsel for Aetna U.S. Healthcare, where he \nprovided advice to the internal audit, compliance and investigative \nservices departments and was ultimately promoted to chief compliance \nofficer.\n  In 1998, Mr. Robinson returned to public service as the U.S. Attorney \nfor the District of Connecticut. He supervised over 50 lawyers in three \noffices and set policy and prosecution guidelines for all civil and \ncriminal matters. Additionally, he coordinated the investigative \nstrategy for Federal law enforcement agencies, while managing all \naspects of the office's operations, including budget, personnel and \npress issues. For the past 2 years, he has worked with Empower New \nHaven, Inc., a nonprofit corporation.\n  Mr. Robinson's extensive experience in both the public and private \nsectors makes him amply qualified for judicial service.

The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of P. Kevin Castel, of New \nYork, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nNew York.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nP. Kevin Castel, who has been nominated to the United States District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York.\n  Mr. Castel is a highly regarded litigator. Upon graduating from St. \nJohn's University School of Law in 1975, he clerked for Judge Kevin \nDuffy on the United States District Court for the Southern District of \nNew York. Following his clerkship, he worked as an associate for Cahill \nGordon & Reindel until 1983, when he was elevated to partner and where \nhe remains today.\n  Mr. Castel has focused much of his professional career on complex \ncommercial litigation, including securities, antitrust, intellectual \nproperty, employment and products liability cases. Furthermore, as \npresident of the Federal Bar Council, he has written extensively on \ncorporate litigation issues.\n  In addition to the Federal Bar Council, Mr. Castel holds leadership \npositions in other notable organizations, including the New York State \nBar Association and the Legal Aid Society.\n  Mr. Castel will bring 20 years of legal experience and sharp acumen \nto the Federal bench. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded, the question is, Will \nthe Senate advise and consent to the nomination of P. Kevin Castel, of \nNew York, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District \nof New York?\n  Without objection, the nomination is confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motions to \nreconsider these votes are laid on the table.\n  Under the previous order, the President will be immediately notified \nof the confirmation of these nominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11623-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11623-S11624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the matter now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.R. 2691, the Interior appropriations bill, \nis now before the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to send an amendment to the desk. \nI have spoken with both leaders. I have not spoken with Senator Burns. \nI have spoken through his staff to him. I have spoken, of course, to \nSenator Dorgan. I am sending this amendment to the desk with the \nunderstanding that we will not vote on it until after the caucus on \nTuesday. The reason for that is this is a very important amendment for \nthis side. We want to make sure we have the opportunity on Tuesday to \nspeak on it, all 49 members of the Democratic caucus, prior to the \nvote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1731\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for initiating any new \n                     competitive sourcing studies)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk not only on \nmy behalf but on the behalf of Senators Lieberman, Landrieu, Kennedy, \nand Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. Murray, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1731:\n       On page 137, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. COMPETITIVE SOURCING STUDIES.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used \n     to initiate any competitive sourcing studies after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a very short amendment, but it \naffects the lives of thousands and thousands of people who work for the \nPark Service. It affects the lives of every American who enjoys the \ngreat resources of our country.\n  The amendment I sent to the desk will stop this administration from \nmoving forward to privatize our national parks, forest lands, and other \npublic lands. It would nip the administration's ill-conceived \nprivatization plan in the bud.\n  More specifically, this amendment prohibits the expenditure of funds \non new outsourcing studies. These are privatization studies for the \nagencies funded in this bill. These agencies were created to protect \nspecial places in nature as a legacy for future generations. They \nshould be managed for posterity and not managed for profit.\n  The House of Representatives has agreed that privatization is a bad \nidea. It included this language in the Interior appropriations bill \nthat passed in July. The Nation's hard-working public servants who care \nfor our forests and parks not only collect fees and maintain parks, but \nalso give directions, fight wildfires, and help injured visitors.\n  Volunteers who love our public spaces provide tens of thousands of \nhours of work for these agencies every year. Will contractors receive \nvolunteers? Will there be volunteers for these people who are working \nfor profit in our national resources, our national treasures? It is \nvery unlikely.\n  While the administration's plan has been marketed as a cost-saving \nmeasure, just the opposite is true. Privatization will waste taxpayer \ndollars. Privatization studies may cost as much as $8,000 per position \nstudied. This means that next year, the agencies funded in this bill \ncould waste as much as $26.4 million on these studies, studies for a \nwrongheaded idea that is bad for our parks, forests, the people who \ncare for them, and the people who visit these parks.\n  Also, these contractors lack the knowledge of the sites that public \nservants possess. They are at the sites for one reason: Not people, but \nprofit. I have nothing against profit motive. I think it is great \nselling cars, books, shoes, clothes--virtually everything. I certainly \ndon't think it is a good idea to privatize our beautiful resources, our \nnational treasures.\n  At a recreation area in Nevada, a contractor designed metal courtesy \ndocks to be built in an area where temperatures reach up to 120 degrees \nin the summer. These docks would have burned visitors in the months \nwhen the docks were the busiest. The discarded design cost $21,000 in \ntaxpayer money, and instead of building five courtesy docks as \nintended, the recreation area only had funding to build two docks.\n  Nevadans visiting our public places, Americans visiting our public \nplaces want professionals enriching their experience by directing them \nto famous sites and the best-kept secrets of our parks.\n  These are a few things people have written to me about on this \nsubject. Zephyr Cove, NV, is in the Lake Tahoe region. It surrounds \nLake Tahoe. This is not a public employee, but she says:\n\n       I'm one small voice, but I'm convinced that privatization \n     of our National Park System would be another step to \n     demolishing what little resources we have now and what we can \n     hope to gain in the future to hold and treasure for future \n     generations.\n\n  She says further:\n\n       Many of the Park Service personnel are neighbors and our \nfriends. They care deeply about what they do. Their pay is relatively \nlow for the expertise they have. They do it because they know the value \nof protecting our parks, wildlife habitats, and environment.\n\n  I do not know for sure if the administration's true agenda here is to \nundermine that commitment to our national parks, forests, and other \npublic lands. I don't know that, but that is what many feel.\n  An editorial in The Tennessean believes that. Editorializing recently \nagainst this plan, the paper had this to say:\n\n      . . . privatizing the professionals on whom the parks depend \n     to manage resources will rid the administration of those \n     pesky folks who keep pointing out what harm has been done by \n     President Bush's reckless environmental policies.\n\n  This is an editorial that was written in The Tennessean on August 29, \n2003.\n  We have heard not only from newspapers around the country and people \nwho don't work for the public entities, but we also heard from public \ncustodians of our treasures. I am not going to use their names here, of \ncourse. They might somehow be harmed at work.\n  One public employee writes:\n\n       The depth and breadth of loyalty that is inherent to the \n     average [public] employee cannot be contracted out.\n\n  And he is absolutely right. The public employees my amendment would \nhonor share a lot in common with Members of this body, our staffs, our \npolice, and others who work here. They, like us, sought their jobs to \nserve other people and to advance positive goals and ideals. It is that \nmotivation and loyalty that cannot be outsourced no matter how much \nmoney we throw at studying it.\n  The privatizing concept, as set forth in The Tennessean, says it all:\n\n     . . . privatizing the professionals on whom the parks depend \n     to manage resources will rid the administration of those \n     pesky folks who keep pointing out what harm has been done by \n     President Bush's reckless environmental policies.\n\n  Loyalty, public service, and dedication to our public lands cannot be \noutsourced. It cannot be privatized.\n  I hope people understand these great national parks we have. These \nare treasures. These national parks are the envy of the world. Nevada \nis fortunate, but we only have one national park. It is a wonderful \nplace, Great Basin National Park, a very new national park. It is small \nby national park standards, about 80,000 acres. It has a 13,000-foot \nmountain on it, Wheeler Peak. It has a glacier. It has the oldest \nliving thing in the world, a bristlecone pine.\n  These trees are over 5,000 years old. Think about that--trees that \nstarted\n\n[[Page S11625]]\n\ngrowing before Christ came to Earth. These trees were around the same \ntime the pyramids came into existence. They are living things at the \nGreat Basin National Park.\n  In our park, we have the Lehman Caves. Around the turn of the last \ncentury, a man who was a cowboy was out riding his horse and he \nsuddenly found himself in a deep underground cavern. The horse, as far \nas I know, was not injured, but that was the beginning of a great \nodyssey for people to visit this magnificent part of nature, Lehman \nCaves, which is now in the Great Basin National Park.\n  We were fortunate enough a short time ago to be present at that \nfacility when they dedicated the new visitors center. It is in a remote \npart of the State of Nevada, but it is a place that people from all \nover the world travel to because of its uniqueness.\n  Great Basin is only one of our many national parks. I was in Montana \nand Wyoming recently. I had the good fortune, after these many years, \nto once again visit Yellowstone National Park. I was only able to spend \na couple of hours there, but it was a great experience.\n  I first went there shortly after my wife and I returned from law \nschool in Washington. We traveled from Las Vegas on one of the first \nvacations we ever took. We could have gone anyplace our small budget at \nthat time would handle, but we drove from Las Vegas to Yellowstone. I \nstill look back with great awe at Old Faithful and the many other \nthings we were able to see, the buffalos and other animals. So when I \nreturned there, even though it was only for a few hours, the place I \nwanted to go visit again was Old Faithful.\n  Old Faithful spewed a few times during the time I was there. We took \na walk through Geyser Park. We saw buffalo lying right near the \ngeysers. The reason these great animals come and lie down near these \nspewing geysers is that, to a great extent, they keep the pests off \nthemselves by doing so.\n  Even though I was there just a short time, it was wonderful again, \nafter 25 years, to reflect back on my little children when they were \ntiny going there and visiting that park.\n  This experience I had was magnified on both occasions by virtue of \nthe people who work there. They have nothing of which to be ashamed. \nThey are Government employees who have dedicated their lives not to \nseeing how much money they can make but to being in the great outdoors, \nbeing part of nature.\n  I can remember the woman who took us on our walk through this little \nGeyser Park. She was an expert. She knew when every geyser was going to \nspew forth some water. She was able to tell stories about how people \nfirst discovered them. She is a woman who makes very little money but \nis talented, as a person in her position should be.\n  So on the two occasions I visited Yellowstone, my experiences were so \nmuch better as a result of the people who work there for the Federal \nGovernment--park rangers, other park employees.\n  I hope this Senate will respond overwhelmingly and support this \namendment, as was done in the House.\n  The people who work in these parks are not Democrats. They are not \nRepublicans. In the true sense of the word, this should not be a \nDemocratic amendment. It should be an amendment that is supported by \nthe Senate to protect these faithful employees of the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  We are very fortunate in the State of Nevada to have a large presence \nof the Federal Government. I say fortunate because 87 percent of the \nland in the State of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government. Only 13 \npercent of Nevada is owned by individuals; the rest is Government land. \nThe Bureau of Land Management's largest assets are in the State of \nNevada.\n  In addition to the national forests and the park I have described, we \nhave large parts of the State of Nevada, as I have indicated, that are \ncontrolled by the Bureau of Land Management. The employees who work for \nthe BLM are just as dedicated as those people who work in our parks.\n  The forest rangers are also people who work so hard for so little \nreturn. I am convinced that if this is put out to the lowest bidder, we \nare going to have parks that are visited by people who recognize that \nthese people are not there for any purpose other than somebody who got \nthe contract and is trying to make a buck, someone who has gotten \nminimum-wage employees to get by with as little as possible.\n  We cannot let this go forward. It is a slap in the face to these \nloyal, dedicated public servants. It is a slap in the face of the \nAmerican public. These Federal assets are owned by all of us, and all \nof us should have a say in how these parks are run. Renting them out to \nthe lowest bidder is not the way to do it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, before I turn the floor over to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, I would simply like to say \nthat upon completion of the last judge vote today, that means we have \napproved 151 judges during the little over 2\\1/2\\ years President Bush \nhas been President. I think we\n\n[[Page S11626]]\n\nare doing remarkably good work for this President as relates to judges. \nThe count is 151 to 3. That means there have been three judges who have \nbeen submitted to us we have not accepted.\n  President Reagan did not reach 150 judges until well into the fourth \nyear of his first term. The first President Bush did not receive his \n150th Federal judge until well into his fourth year. During President \nClinton's second term, the term just preceding this administration, he \ndid not appoint his 150th judge until his fourth year. So we are a year \nand a half--at least a year ahead of Reagan, first President Bush, and \nthe second term of President Clinton.\n  So we have done extremely well. Senator Leahy is to be commended for \nhis ability to move these judges in conjunction with the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, the chairman, Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I rise today to voice my concern about the \ndisastrous turn which the fortunes of this Nation have taken. The Bush \nadministration, in a scant 2\\1/2\\ years, has imperiled our country in \nthe gravest of ways, and set us up for a possible crisis of mammoth \nproportions. The crisis may not occur tomorrow in these proportions, or \nthe next day, but it is coming.\n  Instead of linking arms with a world which offered its heart in \nsympathy after the brutality of the terrorist attacks in September of \n2001, this White House, the Bush White House, through hubris and false \nbravado, has slapped away the hand of assistance. This administration \nhas insulted our allies and our friends with its bullying and go-it-\nalone frenzy to attack the nation of Iraq.\n  In order to justify such an attack, it was decided somewhere in the \nWhite House to blur the images of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. \nBlurred images notwithstanding, what is becoming increasingly clear to \nmany Americans is that they are going to be asked to carry a heavy, \nheavy load for a long, long time.\n  Let me be clear. We are presently engaged in not one war but two \nwars: The war begun by Osama bin Laden, who attacked this Nation on the \nSeptember 11, 2001, and then there is the war begun by President George \nW. Bush when he directed U.S. forces to attack Iraq on March 19, 2003. \nThe first war was thrust upon us. The bombing of Afghanistan was a just \nretaliation against that attack. The second war, on the other hand, was \na war of our choosing. We chose it. It was an unnecessary attack upon a \nsovereign nation. This President and this administration have tried \nmightily to convince the people of America that attacking Iraq was \ncritical to protecting them, the people of this country, from \nterrorism. The case that the administration makes is false, it is \nflimsy, and the war, I believe, was unwise and was unnecessary and was \nwithout ample justification.\n\n  The war against Iraq has crippled the global effort to counter \nterrorism. The war in Iraq has made a peace agreement between Israel \nand its adversaries harder to obtain. The obsession with Iraq has \nserved to downplay the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The \nfocus on Saddam Hussein has diverted attention from bin Laden, who is \napparently still on the loose and threatening to attack again. The war \nin Iraq has alienated our traditional allies and fractured the cohesive \nalliance against terrorism which existed after 9/11. It has made the \nUnited States appear to the world to be a bellicose invader of another \ncountry. It has called our motives into question. It has galvanized the \nworldwide terrorism movement against us. The war in Iraq has cost us \nlives and treasure. Yet this President will shortly request $87 billion \nmore for his ill-fated adventure.\n  He says we will spend whatever it takes. So he says your money--it is \nyour money. We have heard that many times. It is your money, and he \nsays your money we will spend, whatever it takes.\n  Prudence dictates that we consider the risks. This Nation has \nsuffered massive job losses amounting to 93,000 in August alone and \napproximately 600,000 since January of this year. Job losses of this \nmagnitude mean less money coming into the Treasury and more money going \nout. U.S. manufacturing jobs continue to disappear overseas as \ncompanies relocate operations on other shores. There seems to be no \nend, thus far--there seems to be no end to the job hemorrhage. The \nmanufacturing sector has lost jobs for 37 months in a row. The weak job \nmarket threatens to sap our strength from our domestic economy. Should \ninflation begin to creep up, as some worry that it will, higher energy \ncosts and lower consumer confidence may slow the economy further.\n  Suppose another massive al-Qaida attack were to occur here at home, \nkilling hundreds or thousands and delivering another devastating blow \nto the U.S. economy? Could we still afford to continue to send billions \nof taxpayer dollars to Iraq? At best, our future economic growth is \nuncertain. There are too many unknowns. Our deficit is growing. When \nthe $87 billion 2004 Iraq Supplemental is included, as it probably will \nbe, the deficit for 2004 alone is expected to total $535 billion.\n  That is $530 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. That \nnumber will only grow, if we continue to experience massive job losses \nand the economy takes a turn for the worse.\n  We can ill afford to finance the rebuilding of Iraq alone. Yet \nPresident Bush steadfastly resists doing what it takes to involve the \ninternational community.\n  It should be obvious that we need assistance. The United States \ncannot even continue to supply the troops to secure Iraq without more \nhelp. A recent Congressional Budget Office study, which I requested, \nmakes it clear that maintaining the level of troops we now have in Iraq \nwill stretch us very thin should something happen in Korea or elsewhere \non this troubled globe. Our National Guard is being asked to stay \nlonger and longer in Iraq to help backfill the shortage in regular \ntroops. These are men and women with jobs and families and key roles to \nplay in their own communities. We cannot continue to utilize their \nskills in Iraq without suffering the consequences at home.\n  Even now, as a hurricane lurks off our shores, there are worries \nabout shortages of emergency personnel because so many National Guard \nmen and women are serving in Iraq.\n  But the Bush administration continues to spend our treasure and our \ntroop strength in a single-focusd obsession with the fiasco in Iraq. \nAre we to mortgage the future of our Nation to years of financing this \nunwise adventure? Surely we cannot ask American families for sacrifice \nindefinitely, especially when their sacrifices are made to advance a \nwar we do not need to fight, that we ought not to have gone overseas to \nfight. We chose to attack another country.\n  We must come to grips with our limits. We must acknowledge risks and \nreality.\n  Yet on last Sunday, Vice President Cheney dug his heels in at the \nsuggestion of rethinking our policy in Iraq. In a television interview, \nVice President Cheney said he saw no reason to ``think that the \nstrategy is flawed or needs to be changed.''\n  He went on to try to convince the American public that Iraq was ``the \ngeographic base'' for the perpetrators of 9/11. Think of that--a claim \nthat this humble Senator has never heard before, and that flies in the \nface of U.S. intelligence agencies which repeatedly have said they have \nfound no links--none--between the 9/11 attacks and Saddam Hussein or \nIraq. We may come to rue the day when we took our eyes off bin Laden \nand sapped our energies and our credibility in this quagmire in Iraq. \nWe chose to attack that country. Yet there seems to be no soul \nsearching in this White House about the consequences of this war.\n  While Bush's aides talk of ``generational commitment'' and the \nPresident talks of ``sacrifice,'' I wonder if the American people fully \ncomprehend what they are being urged to forego. They have already \nsacrificed loved ones with 158 troops killed and 856 wounded just since \nPresident Bush declared the end of major combat on May 1. How many more \nfamilies must sacrifice? How many more families must sacrifice while we \noccupy Iraq?\n  The President says we will do whatever it takes. Mr. Rumsfeld says we \nwill do whatever it takes. How many more families must sacrifice while \nwe occupy Iraq?\n\n[[Page S11627]]\n\n  A generation of ``sacrifice'' may also mean a slow sapping of key \nnational priorities, including repairing the infrastructure which fuels \nour economic engine and funding the institutions and programs which \nbenefit all Americans. Compare the latest request for the Iraq \nsupplemental with the commitment in dollars to other vital programs, \nand the picture becomes more clear. President Bush is asking for $87 \nbillion for Iraq but only $34.6 billion for Homeland Security--$29-plus \nbillion--which will come to the Senate soon in a bill which was marked \nup today. The President wants $87 billion for Iraq but only $66.2 \nbillion for the discretionary programs for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n\n  The President seeks $87 billion to secure Iraq but only $52.1 billion \nfor the U.S. Department of Education. The President wants $87 billion \nto shore up Iraq but only $29.3 billion for America's highways and road \nconstruction.\n  For the State Department and foreign aid for the entire world, \nPresident Bush sees a need for only $27.4 billion. Yet Iraq is worth \nover three times that much to this White House.\n  Remember that $87 billion is just for 2004 alone. Does anyone really \nbelieve it will be the last request we will receive for Iraq? No. This \nis just the tip of the iceberg, in all likelihood.\n  The President asked America for a generation of ``sacrifice,'' but \nthat noble-sounding word does not reveal the true nature of what the \nPresident demands from the American people. He asks them to supply the \nfighting men and women to prosecute his war.\n  Yes, he asked them, the American people, to supply the fighting men \nand women to prosecute his war. I am not talking about the war that \nbegan on September 11, 2001. That was an attack upon us by al-Qaida. I \nam talking about his war, the President's war in Iraq, which began in \nMarch of this year in which he, the Commander in Chief, ordered the \nattack on Iraq, a sovereign country that had not attacked us and which \ndid not represent an imminent threat to the security of our country.\n  He implores our people to sacrifice adequate health care. He asks our \npeople to settle for less than the best education for their children. \nThink about it. He asks our people, the American people, to sacrifice \nmedical research that could prolong and save lives. He asks the \nAmerican people to put up with unsafe highways and dangerous bridges. \nHe asks them to live with substandard housing and foul water. He asks \nthe American people to forego better public transportation and not just \nfor now but for generations. And all of it for his folly in Iraq.\n  Most puzzling to this Senator is this President's stubborn refusal to \nguard against the terror threat at home by adequately funding Homeland \nSecurity. Is he asking us all to risk the safety of our homeland, too?\n  And to further insult the hard-working people of this Nation, George \nWalker Bush proposes to lay this sacrifice not only on the adult \npopulation of this great country but on their children and their \ngrandchildren by increasing the deficit with nary a thought to the \nconsequences.\n  Yet not a peep can be heard from this White House about paying for \nsome of this sacrifice of which the President speaks by foregoing a \nportion of future tax cuts, tax cuts that mainly benefit those citizens \nwho do not need so many of the services the Government has to provide.\n  Our reputation around the globe, America's reputation around the \nglobe, has already been seriously damaged by this administration. Are \nthe dreams and hopes of millions of Americans to be ``sacrificed'' as \nwell on the altar, on the bloody altar, of Iraq?\n  I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about the growing \nquagmire in Iraq. I urge members of the President's own party to warn \nhim about the quicksand he asks America to wade in. We need a long and \nthorough debate about the future of our country. We need a serious \ndiscussion about the kind of America we will leave to our children and \ngrandchildren. We need to renew our efforts to negotiate a peace \nagreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Are we fighting a war in \nIraq when pushing the peace might better serve our cause? We must think \nagain about world-wide terrorism--and it comes in many forms and \nshapes--and the best way to combat it. Let us not continue to simply \nwage the wrong war, Mr. Bush's war in Iraq.\n\n\n             ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, September 17 is a day of history in American \ncalendar. On this day in 1630, the city of Boston was founded. On \nSeptember 17, 1947, James V. Forrestal was sworn in as this Nation's \nfirst Secretary of Defense.\n  On September 17, 1920, the National Football league was formed in \nCanton, OH. On September 17, 1954, Ernie Banks became the first Black \nbaseball player to wear a Chicago Cubs uniform. He was voted ``best \nplayer ever'' by Chicago fans when he retired in 1971. On September 17, \n1984, Reggie Jackson hit his 500th career homer, seventeen years to the \nday after he hit his first major league home run.\n  On this day in 1911, the first transcontinental airplane flight took \nplace between New York City and Pasadena, CA. It took pilot C.P. Rogers \n82 hours to cover that distance. Just 65 years later, on September 17, \n1976, the Space Shuttle was revealed to the public for the first time, \nready to take men into the heavens. Such a lot of change in such a \nshort period of time.\n  Last week, in another airplane related piece of history, the nation \nsadly observed the second anniversary of the tragic events of September \n11, 2001. It was a terrible, terrible day, marked by the awful, abrupt \nend of too many innocent lives. September 17, 1862, was another \nterrible, terrible day. On that beautiful September day, over 23,000 \nmen were killed, wounded, or missing in action after the Battle of \nAntietam, outside Sharpsburg, MD--just over the line from the eastern \npanhandle of West Virginia. That battle was a turning point in the \nCivil War.\n  But by far, one of the most important events in this Nation's history \nhappened on the 17th of September, 1787. On that memorable day, the \nmembers of the Constitutional Convention signed the document that has \nled this Nation safely through the shoals of history for the past 216 \nyears, surviving even the devastation of the Civil War. It was this \ndocument that I hold in my hand: the Constitution of the United States \nof America.\n\n  That Constitution was not our first attempt at self-governance. It \nfollowed on the heels of the Articles of Confederation, which was the \nfirst Constitution, correcting the failures of that weak Government by \nestablishing a stronger central Government to manage the differences \nbetween the States and to provide for the common good. And then, to \nassuage the concerns of those citizens who feared that a strong central \nGovernment would trample on the rights of the individual, the \nConstitution was amended after ratification with the first 10 \nconstitutional amendments, guaranteeing individual freedoms in what has \nbecome known as the American Bill of Rights.\n  The Constitution of the United States has, sadly, been overlooked by \nmany in the public over the years. It is not a lofty piece of rhetoric \nlike the better known Declaration of Independence. But the Constitution \nis the strongest piece of armor protecting the rights and the freedoms \nof each and every citizen--your rights, your rights, your rights, yes, \nyour rights, and yours, and yours, and mine. It deserves to be better \nknown. It is, after all, our manual for governance, our handbook of \nGovernment, the tech manual for our national operating system. And \nunlike many technical manuals, it is easy to read and to understand, \neven 216 years later.\n  This short document is blunt and straightforward. It starts with only \na preamble and then gets right to the heart. In Article I, it sets \nforth the domain of the legislative branch and the qualifying \nrequirements for us legislators. It does the same for the executive \nbranch in Article II, laying out the procedure for selecting a \nPresident and stating what his domain and powers shall be. Then the \njudicial branch gets the same treatment, short and sweet, in Article \nIII. Article IV sets out the States' rights and duties to the central \nGovernment and provides for the addition of new States. Article V, in a \nsingle paragraph, lays out the procedure for amending the Constitution. \nArticle VI provides for the transfer of power from the Articles of \nConfederation to the new Constitution and makes the Constitution and \nthe Federal laws the\n\n[[Page S11628]]\n\nsupreme law--together with treaties--the supreme law of the land. \nArticle VII provides the procedure for ratifying the Constitution.\n  There it is. There it is--a new Government in only seven articles. It \ntakes more verbiage than that just to buy a house in these days.\n  The Constitution is an amazing product of compromise and balance, \ncreated by just a handful of delegates--55--in under 4 months. Many of \nthe delegates' names should be familiar to most Americans, names such \nas George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional Convention, \nand James Madison, George Mason, Benjamin Franklin, and Alexander \nHamilton. Other famous names were not present, such as Thomas \nJefferson. He was not there. He was serving at the time as the \nAmbassador to France. Then there was John Adams, who was in London as \nthe U.S. Ambassador. The details of the Convention of 1787 make \nfascinating reading.\n  The Convention met in closed session, but James Madison obtained \npermission to take notes on the debates. His notes, supplemented by the \noutlines or drafts of other delegates, were not published until 1840--4 \nyears after his death. They outline the evolution of the document, \nshowing competing alternatives and the compromises that allowed the \nlarge and small States, and all of the other conflicting interests, to \nreach agreement on a final document that all agreed could be ratified \nby the States.\n\n  The body in which I speak, and to which I have been elected time and \ntime again by the people of West Virginia, the Senate, is the result of \none such contentious debate that almost caused the Convention to \nadjourn.\n  I was talking with the pages just the other day, and we talked about \nthe Great Compromise. I talk with these pages, the Republican pages and \nthe Democratic pages. They change from time to time. They will be here \nperhaps for half a semester or a full semester or a few days. When we \nare out for a break, there will be a different group of pages. And we \ntalk about history. These fine pages and I were just commenting the \nother day about the Great Compromise. I said, What do we mean by the \nphrase the ``Great Compromise''? Well, that is what I am referring to \nnow.\n  At one point during the Convention, the Virginia plan called for the \ncreation of a bicameral legislature, with each House's representation \napportioned by population. This suited Virginia and other large States \nwell but was opposed by small States that feared joining a Union so \ndominated by the larger States. The delegations from the small States \nargued that their citizens would never ratify a Constitution that did \nnot recognize some form of State equality.\n  After 3 weeks of increasingly bitter debate, the delegates agreed to \nwhat has come to be known as the Great Compromise. The result of that \ncompromise is the Congress that we know today--a lower House, chosen \naccording to population, and with the sole authority to originate \nrevenue bills; and an upper House, the Senate, in which each State has \nan equal vote.\n  Other compromises were necessary for the Convention to reach \nagreement, some less successful than that which led to the composition \nof the Congress, some positively inspired. The delegates deliberated \nover the power of the executive; they deliberated over interstate \ncommerce; they deliberated over the subject of slavery--these among \nother topics.\n  A small but inspired compromise is contained in the Preamble. The \nPreamble to the Articles of Confederation named the States in \ngeographic order from north to south. Without knowing which States \nwould ratify the Constitution, and in what order, the delegates in \nPhiladelphia were uncertain how to list the participating States.\n  So the answer was a graceful new opening: ``We the people of the \nUnited States . . . do ordain and establish this Constitution . . .'' \nwithout ever mentioning the States by name.\n  Every citizen should be familiar with the Constitution. We should \neach have a little radar system, an intuitive raising of the hairs \nalong the back of one's neck, when attempts are made to flout the \nConstitution, either by design or out of misguided good intentions. I \nfear that this radar system is not functioning as well as it should be. \nWhen it fails, the checks and balances contained in our Constitution \nbegin to rust and then begin to grind to a halt. When the Congress does \nnot jealously guard its prerogatives against an overreaching executive, \nthe executive branch gains strength from power that it should not have.\n  The Founders of this Nation worried about creating too strong an \nexecutive. They worried about creating a tyrant such as the one, George \nIII, against whom they had fought a war for freedom. So they created a \nsystem where the people's direct representatives called the shots the \nCongress writes the laws, controls the funds, and approves the nominees \nfor key executive posts. If all of those restraints failed, the \nPresident was subject to impeachment and trial by Congress.\n  But today, in our fears about national security and our national \npolitical system dominated by political party considerations, we face a \nsituation in which Congress is being pressured to act as a rubber stamp \nfor a strong-willed Executive. We have seen this happen with respect to \nvarious and sundry executives some Democratic, some Republican. But in \nthis instance, in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, there was a \nstampede to do something, anything, to avenge this vile attack on our \ncitizens. The Congress did not seriously debate or consider the long \nterm consequences of the call to action, and apparently, neither did \nthe White House. We rushed into war without a real declaration of war. \nInstead, Congress passed a resolution giving the President sweeping \npowers to take such action as he saw fit, including military action, in \nthat region. As a result, our military is over-extended and committed \nto long-term nation-building efforts in Iraq and, to a degree, in \nAfghanistan. Members of Congress are labeled ``unpatriotic'' if Members \nquestion--even question--any request for additional funds for those \nefforts.\n  At the same time, political party pressures were applied to pass \nexpensive ``temporary'' tax cuts theoretically aimed at restarting a \nsluggish economy. The long-term impact on the deficit will hamstring \nthe Nation for years to come. Congress should know better. This Senate \nshould know better. Those of us who have been around for a while can \nrecall the tremendous effort--and compromise--needed to achieve deficit \ncontrol in the late 1980s and early 1990s. We can recall all of the \nhard, hard decisions that had to be made to bring the deficit under \ncontrol. Did we really forget all of that in those few short years of \nsurplus? Well, if we did forget that lesson from history, I fear we are \ndoomed to repeat it, and we struggle to bring these even larger \ndeficits under control.\n  The time is long past for Members of Congress to reassert the \nauthorities granted to them in the Constitution. A citizenry familiar \nwith their Constitution should demand it. We are, after all, ``. . . \nbound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution . . .'' in \nArticle VI, if we take the time to read it that far.\n\n  In his Farewell Address, delivered to his cabinet on, fortuitously \nenough, September 17, 1796, George Washington made this observation:\n\n     . . . [Y]ou have improved upon your first essay by the \n     adoption of a Constitution of government better calculated \n     than your former for an intimate union and for the \n     efficacious management of your common concerns. This \n     government, the offspring of your own choice, uninfluenced \n     and unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature \n     deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the \n     distribution of its powers, uniting security with energy, and \n     containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \n     has a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect \n     for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence \n     with its measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental \n     maxims of true liberty.\n\n  Our Constitution is the foundation of our liberties, and we must be \nits guardians.\n  I would like to close with a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, \nentitled ``O Ship of State.''\n\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n\n[[Page S11629]]\n\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n     Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\n     'Tis of the wave and not the rock;\n     'Tis but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee.\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee, -are all with thee!\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1734\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1734.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funds for clinical services to the \n                 Indian Health Service, with an offset)\n\n       On page 88, beginning on line 17, strike ``$2,546,524,000'' \n     and all that follows through ``Provided'' on line 20, and \n     insert the following: ``$2,838,524,000, together with \n     payments received during the fiscal year pursuant to section \n     231(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 238(b)) \n     for services furnished by the Indian Health Service, of which \n     $2,329,414,000 shall be available for clinical services: \n     Provided, That section 13031(j)(3) of the Consolidated \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. \n     58c(j)(3)) is amended by striking `September 30, 2003' and \n     inserting `September 30, 2004': Provided further''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, once again I come to the floor to bring \nto the attention of the Senate the critical shortfall in funding for \nthe Indian Health Service. Through treaties and Federal statute, the \nFederal Government has promised to provide health care to American \nIndians and Alaskan Natives. Sadly, we have not even come close to \nhonoring this commitment.\n  The Indian Health Service is the only source of health care for many \nIndians and is required to provide it, yet funding has never been \nadequate.\n  The chronic underfunding has only grown worse in recent years, as \nappropriations have failed to keep up with the steep rise in private \nhealth care spending.\n  Last March, we offered an amendment to the budget resolution to \nprovide $2.9 billion to the Indian Health Service for the budget for \nthe fiscal year 2004. Our amendment would not have met all of the \nhealth care needs in Indian country, not by far, but it would have \nprovided enough room in the budget to fund basic clinical health care \nservices for American Indians and Alaskan Natives.\n  Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated by a vote of 48 to 51, on \na party-line vote.\n  The Republican leadership made a counteroffer. They proposed an \namendment to increase IHS funding next year by $292 million, one-tenth \nof what our amendment called for. The Senate adopted that amendment.\n  Since then, two important reports have been released.\n  In July, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released a report \ndocumenting shocking health care disparities between Indians and other \nAmericans. In August, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued a \nreport showing that Native Americans live sicker and die younger than \nother Americans as a result of inadequate health care.\n  Another important thing happened since the Senate voted last March to \nadd $292 million to the Indian Health Service's budget next year. Our \ncolleagues on the other side agreed in conference to kill that funding \nincrease. I am now offering an amendment that simply does what the \nSenate is on record having supported last March.\n  The amendment would restore the $292 million increase for the Indian \nHealth Service that this Senate supported overwhelmingly last March.\n  The Civil Rights Commission report compared health care funding for \nNative Americans to that for other groups for which the Federal \nGovernment has direct responsibility for health care. The report \ncompared per capita health expenditures for 2003 by category.\n  This chart describes in detail the comparison, I would say in \nsomewhat embarrassing detail when you look at where we are. For the \ngeneral U.S. population on an annual per capita basis, about $5,000 is \nspent. We spend in the VA a little more than what we spend on a \nnational per capita basis, $5,214. For understandable reasons, seniors \ngenerate more expense, and the per capita cost for Medicare is $5,915. \nMedicaid drops somewhat below, about $2,000 or $1,500 below what we \nspend for the general population. Prisoners actually do almost as well \nas Medicare beneficiaries with $3,803 for Federal prisoners and $3,879 \nfor Medicare.\n  Look where we are for the Indian Health Service clinical services per \ncapita spending, $1,914, well below what we pay for Federal prisoners; \nabout half, frankly, of what it is we pay for prisoners today. This is \nwhat the Indian population gets per capita, this is what Federal \nprisoners get per capita: $3,800 to $1,900.\n  I have to say that I don't know what clearer message we could send \nthan that if we only spend per capita half for the Native American and \nAlaska population than what we spend for Federal prisoners in this \ncountry.\n  This funding is obviously woefully inadequate to meet the health care \nneeds of Native Americans who, as I already noted, have a lower life \nexpectancy than other Americans and a disproportionate number of \nserious medical problems. Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in \nthe country, the highest rates of heart disease, the highest rates of \nsudden infant death syndrome, the highest rates of tuberculosis. There \nis also a great need for substance abuse and mental health services.\n  So while they have the greatest need, the greatest incidence of these \nextraordinarily difficult health problems, they have one-half the \nresources of what we commit to our Federal prisoners.\n  Native Americans are often denied care most of us take for granted, \nand in many cases would even consider essential. They are often \nrequired to endure long waits before seeing a doctor and may be unable \nto obtain a referral to see a specialist. Sometimes lack of funds means \ncare is postponed until Indians are literally at risk of losing their \nlives or their limbs. Others receive no care at all.\n  I will never forget talking to a man who is now a tribal leader from \nthe Yankton reservation. He told me he was hunting and he stepped in a \nhole. This was before he was elected. He stepped in a badger hole or \none of the holes in the field as he was hunting. He broke his leg, went \nto the hospital, and they said there was nothing they could do. They \ntold him to come back. He came back the next day. They said there was \nnothing they could do. They said, we do not know when we can help you. \nYou may need to go somewhere else.\n  Well, he was in such pain that he ended up lying in bed for close to \n6 months and healed without any help whatsoever.\n  Today he walks with a limp, he has deep scars on his leg, and he \nconsiders himself lucky, lucky because he can walk again. That is \nhappening today in America, and I think that is so intolerable, so \nunacceptable, so contrary to the commitment we made to Native American \npeople. This is rationing at its worst. Rationing of care means all too \noften Indians are forced to wait until their medical condition becomes \neven more serious and more difficult to treat. It is a situation none \nof us would find acceptable, but this is the reality in Indian country.\n  Right now, the IHS service unit at Eagle Butte in South Dakota does \nnot have an obstetrician. The Eagle Butte service unit is funded at 44 \npercent of the need calculated by the Indian Health Service. The \nfacility has a birthing room and 22 beds, but there are only 2 to 3 \ndoctors to staff the clinic, hospital, and emergency room.\n  Naturally, as a result, many children and expectant mothers do not \nreceive\n\n[[Page S11630]]\n\nthe care they need and deserve. Due to budget constraints, the IHS \npolicy is to allow only one ultrasound per pregnancy. The visiting \nobstetrician is available only every couple of weeks.\n  The story of Brayden Robert Thompson points out how dangerous this \nsituation is. On March 3, 2002, Brayden's mother was in labor with a \nfull-term, perfectly healthy baby. Brayden's umbilical cord was wrapped \naround his neck, but without ultrasound that went undetected. The \navailable medical staff did not know what to do about his lowered \nheartbeat, abnormal urinalysis, or the fact his mother was not feeling \nwell. Despite the symptoms, IHS refused to provide an ultrasound or to \nsend her to Pierre, which is the closest city off the reservation, to \nsee an obstetrician. Brayden was stillborn.\n\n  This tragic death was completely preventable, but tough choices are \nbeing made every single day at IHS facilities throughout the country \nbecause there simply is not enough money to provide the care every \nAmerican deserves.\n  I received a letter not long ago from Michelle German about her \ndaughter Brittany.\n  This is Brittany. I have the letter, and I will read portions of it. \nMichelle writes:\n\n       My daughter Brittany is thirteen years old and for the last \n     couple of years has suffered from a skin disorder called \n     polymorphous light erosion/eruption, which basically means \n     she is allergic to UV rays (the sun). We had visited many \n     doctors, at the Sisseton Indian Health Service and the Coteau \n     des Prairie Clinic (also located in Sisseton) before being \n     referred to a dermatologist in Fargo. . . .The Indian Health \n     Service denied our request for a referral due to the lack of \n     funding, but I find this very ironic because I had my own \n     insurance. However, I was told that her condition has already \n     been diagnosed, it is not life threatening and that the \n     Indian Health Services were not going to be responsible for \n     any debt that my insurance would not cover. Since this had \n     all taken place, I had lost my job and my insurance. I find \n     it frustrating that we were over income to qualify for \n     Medicaid or the CHIPS program through the State of South \n     Dakota!\n       To make a long story a little shorter, we have been \n     doctoring back at the Indian Health Service and now we are \n     battling the pharmacy because it does not carry the \n     medication that has been prescribed to her by the \n     dermatologist. Brittany has been [on] various medications \n     throughout her clinic visits at the Indian Health Service \n     without success. The prescribed medications, that are \n     working, are not available through the Indian Health Pharmacy \n     and I have been purchasing it from our local drug store in \n     the amount of forty-five dollars per forty-five gram tube.\n       Brittany has gone through quite an ordeal because of the \n     question ``what is the matter with your face?'' and now it is \n     on her arms and legs which are beginning to scar due to the \n     scratching. She has been limited to being kept indoors from \n     the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. to prevent any outbreaks and \n     the itchiness that follows. This is very hard for both of us \n     because she is a very active teenager who enjoys playing \n     golf, softball and swimming. We have had to change the type \n     of clothing worn in the summer, the bathing soaps and \n     lotions; she is now required to wear sunscreen and lip screen \n     throughout her time outside. . . .\n       I could go on, . . . but I think you get the idea. I have \n     attached a picture of my daughter when the skin rash started \n     on her face for your review.\n\n  I hope this helps explain her story. We have case after case. This \nmay not be life-threatening. But Brittany is not able to get the help \nshe needs, the attention she needs, the treatment she needs, in large \nmeasure because IHS has said in her case they do not see a life-\nthreatening problem.\n  This is not solely an Indian issue. It affects surrounding rural \ncommunity hospitals, ambulance services, and other health care \nproviders who work with the IHS.\n  The Lake Andes-Wagner ambulance district in southeastern South Dakota \nis facing financial disaster, in part because they have not been \nreimbursed properly by the Indian Health Service. This ambulance \nservice offers emergency transport for citizens of Charles Mix County \nand Yankton Sioux tribal members, since the Wagner IHS hospital cannot \nafford to operate its own service. If this ambulance service shuts \ndown, what will these residents, Indian or non-Indian, do when they \nface an emergency?\n  Bennett County Hospital in southwestern South Dakota suffers similar \nIHS reimbursement problems, as do others in the non-IHS areas \nthroughout rural America.\n  In his budget request for the next fiscal year, the President \nrequested only $1.9 billion for clinical services for Indians. This \nrepresents a very small increase over what the President requested for \nfiscal year 2003 and no increase over what was finally included in the \nomnibus appropriations bill. We can and we must do better.\n  The amendment I am proposing again would increase funding for \nclinical services by a mere $292 million. I would like to say that this \nis the minimum amount that is necessary to provide basic health care to \nthe current IHS user population, but I can't say that. The minimum \namount necessary is an additional $2.9 billion, and this is one-tenth \nof that amount.\n\n  Today, I am asking the Senate to live up to the commitment it made \nlast March, to make that extremely modest $292 million increase real by \nincluding it in this appropriations bill. It is nowhere near enough, \nand it is sorely needed to address the severe funding shortfall the \nIndian Health Service faces.\n  The cost of the amendment is offset by revenue raised from an \nextension of the customs user fee that will otherwise expire on \nSeptember 30. We all agree the extension is inevitable. This will \nrequire only a small portion of those funds, and I can think of no \nbetter use for the money.\n  Native Americans are facing a literal ``life or limb'' test before \nthey can access health care today. We are spending twice as much per \ncapita on Federal prisoners' health than on the health care for the \nIndians to whom we promised full health benefits. We simply cannot \ntolerate this. The problem is real. The solution is simple. We must \nstart giving the Indian Health Service the funds it needs to provide \nNative Americans the health benefits they were promised.\n  Let's take this modest step toward that end.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Mr. President, the nation of Ukraine recently celebrated \nthe 12th anniversary of its independence from the former Soviet Union. \nThis milestone, gained after decades under Soviet repression, is a \nnotable achievement that bears witness to humanity's inextinguishable \nand universal desire for liberty and freedom. Twelve years after its \nindependence, much has been achieved, yet much work remains to be done \nbefore Ukraine is able to fulfill its considerable promise and fully \njoin the Euro-Atlantic community of nations that find unity through \ntheir commitment to democracy and a steadfast adherence to the rule of \nlaw.\n  Yesterday also marked the third anniversary of the disappearance and \nmurder of Ukrainian journalist Georgiy Gongadze. This anniversary casts \na pall over Ukrainian society and underscores the problems it faces as \nit seeks to reform its domestic political situation. The editor of an \ninternet newspaper, Ukrainska Pravda Ukrainian Truth--Gongadze reported \nwidely on corruption within highest circles of Ukrainian society. He \nwas an outspoken critic of corruption, and his decision to create an \ninternet news journal was done in part to avoid some of the censorship \nand intimidation imposed upon journalists in Ukraine who routinely have \ntheir papers seized, presses damaged, and lives threatened by \ngovernment officials.\n  However, Gongadze's actions did not escape official notice. Nothing \ndone by members of the fourth estate is going unnoticed in a nation \nthat Reporters Without Frontiers ranked 112th in its rating of \nworldwide media freedom. After Gongadze's disappearance, tapes secretly \nrecorded by Mykola Melnychenko, a former bodyguard for President Leonid \nKuchma, documented plans by President Kuchma and other government \nofficials to dispose of Gongadze by a variety of means including \n``selling him to the Chechens.''\n  Since his disappearance 3 years ago, little headway has been made \ninto the investigation of his murder. Ukrainian officials have hindered \nefforts by the FBI to examine evidence, court documents have been \nforged and a witness in the case recently died while in police custody. \nDelays into this investigation and the lack of transparency with which \nit has been conducted undermine the reputation of Ukraine and hinders \nits relationship with the United States, the European Union, and NATO.\n  Much has been made of Ukraine's contribution to Operation Iraq \nFreedom. Currently, a brigade of Ukrainian soldiers are on the ground \nin Iraq, and this contribution is greatly appreciated. Yet such \nassistance, coupled with military reform, should not be seen as a quid \npro quo for a lack of reform on Ukraine's domestic front. Unification \nwith the Euro-Atlantic community is not merely a geopolitical or \nbureaucratic decision. Ukraine must continue efforts to develop and \nimplement a responsive and transparent rule-based system of law before \nit is fully able to from the West.\n  The conduct of the October 2004 Presidential elections in Ukraine \nwill be watched closely by the international community. Free and fair \nelections, regardless of their final outcome, will be an important step \ntoward Ukraine's rapproachment with the community of nations. This \nelection will be vital not for its outcome, but for the process by \nwhich it is conducted. It is my hope that the October 2004 elections \nwill aid Ukraine's transformation from a nation where fear undermines \npublic discourse into a nation where all facets of society can freely \nengage in the market-place of ideas without fear of recrimination. Only \nin such a society will we be able to learn the truth surrounding the \ndisappearance and murder of Georgiy Gongadze. His family and the \nUkrainian people deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11634-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MARVIN ``SONNY'' ELIOT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I have the honor of recognizing a \ngreat American and Michigander, Marvin ``Sonny'' Eliot. Sonny was born \nand raised in my hometown of Detroit. He is well known as a popular TV \nand radio weatherman, with a career spanning 57 years. However, equally \nas impressive as his broadcasting career is his aviation and military \ncareer.\n  Sonny had always wanted to fly planes. While in high school, he \ncommuted across town to take a special aviation course at another \nschool. Sonny did so well on the final exam that he was awarded flying \nlessons, which led to his pilot's license in 1940. After high school, \nSonny attended Wayne State University. Before finishing a degree \nprogram, he decided to enlist in the U.S. Army Air Corps.\n  Following his training in the Air Corps, Sonny was shipped to \nWendling, England, where he flew B-24's as part of the 392nd Heavy \nBomber Group. During World War II, Sonny was shot down over Gotha, \nGermany on his 16th mission. Subsequently, he was captured by the Nazis \nand spent 16 months as a Prisoner of War in Germany, 14 of which were \nin the prison camp Stalag Luft I. Due to his valor and loyalty in the \nservice, Sonny earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal, and \nPurple Heart. In addition, he received the Presidential Unit Citation \nwith all the members of the 392nd Heavy Bomber Group for carrying out \none of the most vital air strikes of the aerial attacks of the war.\n  After returning from Europe in 1945, Sonny continued his studies at \nWayne State University where he earned a B.A. in English and an M.A. in \nMass Communication and began his career in broadcasting. He has spent \nalmost six decades on Detroit's airwaves with WWJ Radio and Channels 2 \nand 4 television, best known as a personable and humorous weatherman. \nIn fact, his witty weather reports have been named the nation's best by \nthe National Association of TV Program Executives.\n  Nevertheless, his interest in aviation never faded. While at Channel \n4 TV and WWJ, Sonny won numerous news media awards for promotion and \npublic awareness of aviation. In addition, he continues to fly and has \naccumulated more than 7,500 hours. Sonny holds the rank of colonel in \nthe U.S. Air Force Reserve and was named the Air Force liaison for the \n1st Congressional District. In October 2001, as a result of his \nlifelong commitment to aviation, he was enshrined into the Michigan \nAviation Hall of Fame.\n  Currently, Sonny can be heard on WWJ-AM 950 with his easy-to-\nunderstand weathercasts. I am pleased to join my colleagues in the \nSenate in saluting Marvin ``Sonny'' Eliot's lifetime full of \ncontributions to his country and the state of Michigan. I wish him \ncontinued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11634-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11634-S11635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NEGOTIATION OF A U.S.-CENTRAL AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address the ongoing \nnegotiations for a United States-Central America Free Trade Agreement--\nalso known as the ``CAFTA.''\n  These negotiations present a couple of unique challenges.\n  First, most of the CAFTA countries are less developed, both \neconomically and politically, than Mexico, Chile, or any of our other \nFTA partners. This presents challenges to the abilities of the Central \nAmerican countries--both to negotiate a comprehensive set of \ncommitments and to implement them effectively.\n  Second, these negotiations are on an accelerated schedule. They \nstarted in January 2003 and are set to conclude by the end of this \nyear. The limited trade negotiating capacities of the CAFTA countries \nmakes this an ambitious goal.\n  Third, several of the CAFTA countries played a less than constructive \nrole at the WTO Cancun Ministerial. Their participation in the G-21 and \nthe role of that group in precipitating the meeting's collapse raises \nserious questions about their commitment to trade liberalization.\n  I support comprehensive free trade agreements that create sound \nmarket access rules and meaningful commercial opportunities for \nAmerican farmers, workers, and businesses. And I support, in principle, \nthe goal of reaching such an agreement with the five CAFTA countries.\n  But we need to be realistic. A CAFTA agreement will be politically \ndifficult here--much more so than the recently passed free trade \nagreements with Singapore and Chile. The issues it raises will be \nchallenging on both sides of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S11635]]\n\n  Next year's vote on CAFTA will also set the stage for the many free \ntrade agreements that are lining up to pass through Congress: Morocco, \nAustralia, the Dominican Republic, South Africa, Bahrain. The list just \nkeeps growing.\n  To keep our trade agenda moving forward, we need a CAFTA that can \npass with a large majority. If CAFTA sours the Congress on FTAs we are \nin for real trouble.\n  With only 4 months left in the negotiations, time is running short. \nBut there is still time enough to push the CAFTA negotiations in the \nright direction. We can do that by addressing three principal concerns:\n  First, there needs to be a clear acknowledgment by our negotiators \nthat CAFTA presents different challenges than other agreements. These \ncountries have different political, legal, and social structures, and \ndifferent economies, than any of our existing FTA partners.\n  We cannot simply table the Singapore and Chile texts and say we are \ndone. Not for market access or agriculture. Not for services and \nintellectual property. Not for environment or labor. One size does not \nfit all.\n  Second, we need to make sure that this agreement is comprehensive. \nTaken together, the CAFTA countries are about our 18th largest trading \npartner. They account for one percent of U.S. trade. So the commercial \nbenefits from this agreement will be modest at best.\n  Absent significant commercial gains, the only way to ``sell'' the \nCAFTA to our farmers, workers, and businesses, is as a strong model for \nfuture agreements.\n  We hear from Costa Rica that they don't want a telecom chapter in the \nagreement. This is a bad precedent.\n  Similarly, we can't allow ourselves to go too far down the path of \n``non-reciprocal'' market access provisions for developing countries, \njust to get an agreement done.\n  Given their reluctance to tackle hard issues in the FTA negotiations \nand the recent actions of some of the CAFTA countries in Cancun, I am \nfrankly skeptical about where the CAFTA negotiations are headed. If we, \nand the CAFTA countries, are not prepared to conclude a comprehensive \nagreement, we need to ask ourselves if this agreement is worth \nnegotiating at all.\n  Third, we need to do more to address legitimate concerns about \nenvironment and labor.\n  Any number of objective sources have pointed out deficiencies in the \nenvironmental and labor laws of the various CAFTA countries.\n  And there is widespread agreement including among the CAFTA \ngovernments themselves--that these countries lack the capacity to \neffectively enforce their own environmental and labor laws.\n  Yet that is just what the text tabled by USTR would require them to \ndo. Even as the evidence mounts, our negotiators stick stubbornly to \ntheir determination not to go beyond the Chile and Singapore texts.\n  That won't work. For CAFTA, we need a different approach.\n  To date, our domestic politics on environment and labor have been \npolarized. The CAFTA countries see that and they use it as an excuse \nnot to engage constructively.\n  I want to help break this deadlock. I want to get us all talking \nabout constructive ways to address environment and labor.\n  A workable approach to environment and labor in the CAFTA will do two \nthings. It will help the CAFTA countries overcome their capacity \nlimitations. And it will give assurance that meaningful improvements in \nenvironmental and labor standards and enforcement in those countries \nare occurring.\n  In the next weeks, I plan to release a detailed proposal for \naddressing environmental issues in the CAFTA. I will give just a short \npreview today.\n  My proposal combines improvements to the Chile and Singapore \nenvironment chapter text with enhancements to the trade capacity \nbuilding and environmental cooperation programs.\n  In the text, I propose changes that will help build an open and \nresponsive system of environmental regulation in the CAFTA countries. \nFor example, the citizen petition process used in the NAFTA side \nagreement has helped empower environmental NGOs in Mexico, with \npositive effects. I think that should be a model for the CAFTA.\n  On trade capacity building, I think we can make this process work \nbetter to achieve long-term environmental and sustainable development \ngoals. On the U.S. side, that means creating a mechanism that assures \nfunding for capacity building over the long term.\n  For the CAFTA countries, it means completing the ongoing regional \nprocess of setting environmental priorities, and establishing a \nmonitoring system to assure that capacity building is leading to \nprogress toward those goals.\n  I look forward to sharing my detailed proposal in the near future.\n  It does not serve America's trade interests to negotiate imperfect \ntrade agreements simply to put another notch on our belt.\n  I hear people say all the time that America has fallen behind other \ncountries in negotiating FTAs and needs to ``catch up.'' But this is \nnot a numbers game. We must always remember that it is the quality, not \nthe quantity, of our free trade agreements that matters.\n  I hope that I will be able to work with the administration to pass a \ngood agreement with Central America. It is an important region, and \nthis could be a significant agreement.\n  But the Trade Act--and specifically the provisions on labor and \nenvironment--must be adhered to. Submitting the same labor and \nenvironment text for all agreements--regardless of the situation in \nthat country--is not, in my view, consistent with the Trade Act.\n  If we end up with an agreement that ignores Members' concerns on \nlabor and the environment, I will work hard against it.\n  I hope it does not come to that. I hope that we can work together on \nan agreement that makes sense and moves the ball forward. And I stand \nready to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11635-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11635-S11636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COLLAPSE OF THE WTO MINISTERIAL\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about next steps for \nour trade agenda after last week's collapse of the World Trade \nOrganization Ministerial in Cancun.\n  Certainly, the WTO is not dead. In fact, this kind of setback is \nfairly common in its history. Sooner or later the negotiators pick up \nthe pieces and get back to work. We must and we will continue to try to \nget the Doha round negotiations back on track. And eventually, I think \nwe will succeed.\n  But it probably won't happen soon.\n  In the meantime, we need to learn from last week's events and adjust \nour national trade strategy accordingly. In my view, there are two \nimportant lessons to be learned.\n  First, we can't count on a sweeping WTO agreement to be an engine of \neconomic growth for our country any time soon. The President has made \nthe stimulative effect of a strong WTO agreement a centerpiece of his \nplan for economic recovery and long-term growth. If we want to \nstimulate the economy through trade--and I certainly support that \ngoal--then we need a new plan.\n  Second, the administration needs to rethink its strategy for picking \nFTA partners. I have heard many times that we need FTA partners who \nwill be allies in the WTO and help the United States move that process \nforward. Instead, many of the same countries who are negotiating FTAs \nwith us joined the G-21 and helped deadlock the ministerial.\n  So where do we go next?\n  To begin, I don't think we should overreact. Punishing trading \npartners with whom we have differences of opinion is not likely to be \nproductive in the long term.\n  That doesn't mean they get a free pass. To the contrary, the onus is \nvery much on Costa Rica, South Africa, Guatemala, and the others to \ntake significant, constructive steps right now to show that they take \ntheir FTA negotiations seriously and are committed to comprehensive \nagreements with the United States. Where they have been holding back in \nFTA talks, they need to start putting more on the table. And if they \ndon't, they should realize we have other countries to look to.\n  At the same time, we need to think hard about how to use trade \nagreements to create economic alternatives to the WTO. American \nworkers, farmers, and businesses have just suffered a\n\n[[Page S11636]]\n\nbig setback. They will not see the economic benefits of the Doha round \nfor a long time. We need to focus our negotiating resources on \nbilateral and regional deals that can provide real commercial \nopportunities in the short term. That means, in picking FTAs, we need \nto give less weight to foreign policy and more weight to economic \npolicy.\n  Access to the large and vibrant U.S. market remains our best leverage \nin opening markets around the world. We must continue to use that \nleverage well.\n  I am disappointed in the outcome of Cancun. Like all disappointments, \nhowever, it offers lessons for the future. I hope we will learn those \nlessons and apply them to our trade agenda as we move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11636-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PUBLIC LANDS DAY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the focus of National Public Lands Day, \n2003, is to improve and conserve our Nation's forests, grasslands, \nplains, rivers, streams and wetlands. As last year, we can expect tens \nof thousands of volunteers to join our dedicated land managers in \nprojects across the country to protect America's rich natural resources \nand improve our opportunities to enjoy them.\n  Year and year National Public Lands Day volunteers are maintaining \nthe legacy of the Civilian Conservation Corps, CCC, who exemplified \nland stewardship through the thirties and into the forties. National \nPublic Lands Day continues to serve, as did the CCCs, to build a sense \nof ownership for our public lands. I believe this land stewardship and \nsense of ownership are most critical today as many changes are \noccurring which are affecting our public lands. I would like to spend \njust a few minutes to discuss these changes, how they are affecting our \npublic lands and what we are, and can be, doing to address these \nimpacts.\n  Our first concern is fire and fuels. Many of you are well aware of \nthe catastrophic wildfires that have been occurring across the country \nover the past several years. This is a direct result of changing forest \nconditions that have led to a large build-up of fuels. Through \nlegislated authorities such as Stewardship Contracting, communities are \nworking with resource professionals and private contractors to address \nthis situation while providing jobs, products and local income. We need \nto continue this work together to thin our forests, reduce hazardous \nfuels and restore the landscape to a more balanced condition. We need \nto continue to work together to provide more defensible space around \nour communities. Through legislation such as the Healthy Forest \nInitiative we can facilitate such projects that will protect our \ncommunities, our watershed and other at-risk lands. By continuing to \nwork together we can address these hazardous conditions with win-win \nsolutions.\n  The introduction and spread of unwanted invasive species is another \nconcern. Noxious weeds, non-native fish species and introduced insects \nare just a few examples of invasive species that can wreak havoc on our \npublic lands and across all ownerships. Throughout the country, local \ngovernments, private landowners and public land managers are working \ntogether to build strategies and share resources to combat invasive \nspecies across broad landscapes. Working together we can develop \nprevention plans to keep unwanted species out and control plans to \nreduce or eradicate unwanted species that have already arrived. Working \ntogether we can ensure that our public lands will remain healthy \nhabitats for the plants and animals that enrich our lives.\n  Another concern is that, across the country, farms, ranches and other \nlarge tracts of open land are disappearing. These open spaces are being \nconverted into neighborhoods, shopping malls and commercial complexes. \nIn many respects these developments bring progress and benefits. In \nother ways these changes are creating a ripple effect on our public \nlands. Uses that were once spread across open lands owned by many are \nnow being concentrated on the open lands remaining--Public Lands. \nWorking together we can address these issues by considering these \neffects prior to development. Working together we can anticipate the \nincreased demands such development will have on public lands and \nprepare our land managers to meet those demands. Working together we \ncan find ways to promote development and protect our public lands.\n  Our last major concern is unmanaged outdoor recreation. Americans are \nhard working, but in our time off we like to play as hard as we work. \nMore and more, many of us like to recreate on our Nation's public \nlands. As a result the numbers of recreationists and types of \nrecreational activities are increasing at a staggering rate. This is \ncreating a situation that leaves land managers struggling to keep up \nand the public frustrated with unmet expectations. To help with this \nsituation, across the country, volunteers, user groups and resource \nprofessionals are working together to provide trail systems that \nprovide high quality, safe experiences for hikers, stock users and OHV \nriders of all ages. Senior citizens and other volunteers are providing \ncampground host services to ensure safe, enjoyable camping experiences. \nAnd volunteers are providing interpretive services and educational \nprograms to enhance American's understanding of their natural \nenvironment.

Mr. President, this week Americans for Gun Safety, the \nBrady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United with the Million Mom \nMarch, and Coalition to Stop Gun Violence have joined to oppose an \namendment included in the House version of the Commerce, Justice, and \nState Department Appropriations Act that would cripple the ability of \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to enforce the \nNation's gun safety laws against firearms dealers who supply guns to \ncriminals.\n  The House amendment would prohibit the public release of information \nrelated to the importation and production of firearms. This would mean \nthat the only reliable national information available on how many guns \nare produced in a given year, as well as type, caliber, and \nmanufacturer, would no longer be available to the public. Further, the \namendment would prohibit the public release of information related to \nmultiple handgun sales. Under current law, dealers are required to \nnotify the BATFE of the sale of two or more handguns to the same person \nwithin 5 business days. Eliminating the public availability of this \ndata would make it more difficult to monitor the activities of reckless \ngun dealers. In addition, the amendment would prohibit the release of \ninformation related to tracing requests on guns used in crimes.\n  The amendment would also prohibit the BATFE from issuing a rule \nrequiring Federal firearm licensees to submit to a physical inventory. \nA physical inventory recently revealed that a Tacoma, WA gun dealer \ncould not account for the sniper rifle used by the Washington, DC area \nsniper and more than 200 other guns in his inventory. The amendment \nwould also require the immediate destruction of records of approved \nfirearms purchases and transfers generated by the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System. The retention of these records has \nassisted law enforcement officials in trying to prevent guns from \ngetting into the hands of criminals and identifying gun trafficking \npatterns.\n  This amendment was never the subject of hearings, is not supported by \nany major law enforcement organizations, is not supported by Attorney \nGeneral John Ashcroft or Director of the BATFE Bradley Buckles.\n  I support the efforts of Americans for Gun Safety, the Brady Campaign \nto Prevent Gun Violence United with the Million Mom March, and \nCoalition to Stop Gun Violence to block this amendment. This provision \ncould\n\n[[Page S11637]]\n\nshield reckless and negligent gun dealers from public scrutiny and \nweaken the BATFE's oversight and enforcement authority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11637-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INCREASING MILITARY PAY CATEGORIES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have joined Senator Daschle in \nintroducing a bill that would make permanent the increases in imminent \ndanger pay and family separation allowance passed by Congress in the \nFiscal Year 03 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n  Last spring, when the Senate considered the Budget Resolution, it \npassed, by a vote of 100 to 0, an amendment I offered with Senator \nLandrieu that would have allowed for $1 billion to cover the increase \nin these special pay categories.\n  Then, when the Senate considered the Fiscal Year 2003 Emergency \nWartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, it unanimously accepted an \namendment I offered with Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, increasing \nthese pay categories for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n  The amendment we offered to the Supplemental sunset these pay \nincreased, not because we wished to end them, but simply to allow the \nArmed Services Committee--the Committee of jurisdiction--to increase \nthese pay levels in the Fiscal Year 2004 Defense Authorization bill, \nwhich it did.\n  Now--when soldiers are dying in Iraq and military families have been \nseparated for many months--we hear that the Administration wishes to \ncut these pay increases in the Conference Committee.\n  The Statement of Administration Policy on the House version of the \nbill objects to the provision increasing both pay categories, saying it \nwould ``divert resources unnecessarily.'' The statement on the Senate \nbill only objects to the increase in Family Separation Allowance.\n  When confronted with questions about why the Administration wanted to \nreduce these pay categories, Defense Department spokesman, Under \nSecretary David Chu, came up with the classic Washington non-denial \ndenial. On August 14, Chu said: ``I'd just like very quickly to put to \nrest what I understand has been a burgeoning rumor that somehow we are \ngoing to reduce compensation for those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThat is not true. . . . ''\n  ``What I think you're pointing to is one piece of very thick \ntechnical appeal document that speaks to the question do we want to \nextend the language Congress used in the Family Separation Allowance \nand Imminent Danger Pay statutes. And no, we don't think we need to \nextend that language. That's a different statement from are we going to \nreduce compensation for those in Iraq and Afghanistan . . .''\n\n  What do these statements mean?\n  Evidently the administration wants to claim that it will keep \ncompensation the same for those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan through \nother pay categories, but do indeed intend to roll back the increases \nto imminent danger pay and family separation allowance.\n  This means that a soldier getting shot at fighting the war on \nterrorism in Yemen or the Philippines would receive less money than one \nwho is similarly risking his or her life in Iraq. This means that a \nfamily bearing huge costs because of burdensome, long-term deployments \nwould only be helped if the service member is deployed to Iraq or \nAfghanistan, but not if that same service member is deployed anywhere \nelse in the world.\n  It is unfair to cut funding intended to help military families that \nare bearing the costs of far-flung U.S. deployments. It is unacceptable \nthat imminent danger would be worth less in one combat zone than in \nanother.\n  The bill we introduce today makes a clear statement that these pay \ncategories should be increased permanently and should not be cut in \nconference.\n  Until these pay levels were increased in the Supplemental, an \nAmerican soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine who put his or her life on \nthe line in imminent danger only received an extra $150 per month. My \namendment increased that amount to $225 per month--still only an \nacknowledgment of their courage, but an increase nonetheless.\n  Prior to the increase in the supplemental appropriations bill, family \nseparation had been only $100 per month. We succeeded in raising it to \n$250 per month. These increases are only part of a normal progression \nof increases--for example, in 1965, imminent danger pay was $55; $100 \nin 1985, and raised to $150 in 1991. Family separation allowance was \n$30 in 1970, $60 in 1985, $75 in 1991, and $100 in 1997.\n  Family separation allowance was originally intended to pay for things \nthat the deployed service member would have done, like cut the grass, \nthat the spouse may then have had to hire someone to do. That may well \nhave been appropriate in the past, but now most families have two \nworking spouses--sometimes two working military spouses--and the \nabsence of one or both parent may add huge child care costs that even \nthe increased rate is unlikely to cover.\n\n  Military spouses sometimes find that they must give up their jobs or \ncurtail their working hours in order to take up the family \nresponsibilities that otherwise would have been shared by the missing \nspouse.\n  Example of increased costs that families may incur when military \npersonnel are deployed, in addition to increased child care costs \ninclude: health care costs not covered by TRICARE, for example, the \ncost of counseling for children having a difficult time with their \nparents' deployment; costs for the family of an activated Reservist or \nNational Guard member to travel to mobilization briefings, which may be \nin another state; various communication and information-gathering \ncosts.\n  I would like to quote for the Record from an article that appeared in \nThe Washington Post on April 11, 2003, entitled ``Military Families \nTurn to Aid Groups,'' that outlines how military families have had to \nrely on private aid organizations to help them when their spouses are \ndeployed. The article highlights the case of one mother, Michele \nMignosa and says:\n\n       The last 18 months have brought one mishap or another to \n     Michelle Mignosa. Her husband, Kevin, is an Air Force \n     reservist who since Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks has \n     been away from their Lancaster, Calif., home almost as much \n     as he's been there. First, there were the out-of-state trips \n     to provide airport security. Then he was deployed to Turkey \n     for 2\\1/2\\ months last spring. Now he's in Greece with an \n     air-refueling unit . . . And while he has been gone, the \n     problems have piled up at home . . . Strapped for cash since \n     giving up her part-time job because of Kevin's frequent far-\n     off postings, she didn't know where the money would come from \n     to resolve yet another problem.\n\n  I applaud the efforts of private aid groups to help military \nfamilies, but I believe that it is the duty of the U.S. Government to \ncover more of the costs incurred because of military deployments. It \nshould not matter to which country the service member is deployed. Cuts \nmust not be made to funds helping military families that are bearing \nthe costs of war, homeland security, and US military commitments \nabroad.\n  To say that pay will not decrease to those serving in Iraq or \nAfghanistan is ignoring the truth--rolling back family separation \nallowance from $250 per month to $100 per month will cost our military \nfamilies and could be especially painful those living on the edge.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill that Senator Daschle and I \nhave introduced and make a strong statement to the Defense Department \nthat Congress will not stand for cutting imminent danger pay and family \nseparation allowance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11637-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11637-S11638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        IN HONOR OF JOHNNY CASH\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nresolution to honor a great singer, a great songwriter, a great \nAmerican, a man who truly lived the American Dream. J.R. Cash, \notherwise known as ``the man in black,'' Johnny Cash, captivated all \nthose who listened during a career that spanned four decades. The man \nin black was a man who embodied and lived the spirit of working class \nAmerica and transformed that spirit into song. I speak today to honor \nthe life and work of this Arkansas native and music legend, and I would \nlike to thank the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, for his \nresolution and kind words.\n\n[[Page S11638]]\n\n  A native of Kingsland and Dyess, AR, Mr. Cash was respected and \nidolized by many in my State. It is always a tragedy to lose a native \nson, but I know the people of Arkansas will especially mourn the loss \nof Mr. Cash, who passed away last Friday at the age of 71.\n  Johnny Cash's life reads much like that of many Arkansas born during \nthe dark and dreary days of the Depression. He was born to a family of \nsharecropper in Kingsland, February 26, 1932, a small town in South \nArkansas not far from where my own father was born.\n  When he was 3, his family moved to Dyess, AR--a farming colony \nestablished by Franklin Delano Rossevelt's New Deal to help lift \ndisplaced farming families out of the Depression and the crushing \npoverty that still permeates a large part of the Delta soil. The Cash's \nwere especially poor. A neighbor, Earl Condra of Harrisburg, who knew \nthe plight of many families of the region once said, ``We were poor, \nbut the Cash's were about as poor as you could get.''\n  No one in the family escaped working on the farm. By the time he was \n6, Cash was carrying water to workers in the field. By 10 he working \nalmost a full day in the cotton fields, from, as he said, ``can `til \ncan't''. When he was 12, his 14-year-old brother, whom young Johnny \nidolized, was killed in a saw accident while sawing oak logs into fence \nposts for the family farm. That same year, Cash's father told him he \nhad reached ``the age of accountability . . . you're accountable as a \nman, to yourself and to others.''\n\n  For Cash, it seemed the only escape from his hard life was through \nmusic. After a long, hard day picking cotton in the fields, his family \nwould often sit on their front porch and sing.\n  ``I remember when I was a lad, times were hard and things were bad. \nBut there's a silver lining behind every cloud. Just four the number of \npeople, that's all we were, trying to make a living out of black land \ndirt. But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud. Daddy sang \nbass, Momma sang tenor, me and little brother would join right in \nthere. Singin' seems to help a troubled soul. One of these days, and it \nwon't be long, I'll rejoin them in a song. I'm going to join the family \ncircle at the throne,'' he recalled in one of his songs.\n  Indeed, by the age of 12, Cash was performing songs on the radio in \nBlytheville, AR.\n  Although he was one of few to graduate high school in post-Depression \nArkansas, Cash knew his future lay in music.\n  ``I think the first time I knew what I wanted to do with my life was \nwhen I was about 4 years old. I was listening to an old Victrola, \nplaying a railroad song . . . I thought it was the most wonderful, \namazing thing that I'd ever seen. That you could take this piece of wax \nand music would come out of that box. From that day on, I wanted to \nsing on the radio,'' he reminisced in a 1993 interview.\n\n  The quote under his picture in the 1950 Dyess Senior High School \nyearbook read, ``Be a live wire and you won't get stepped on.''\n  Within months of his graduation he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and \nwas assigned to Landsberg, Germany, where he was a radio intercept \noperator tasked with intercepting Soviet Morse Code. And it was also in \nGermany that he learned to play the guitar.\n  After his discharge from the Air Force in 1954, Cash moved to \nMemphis, TN, to take a job as an appliance salesman and to attend \nbroadcasting school through the G.I. bill.\n  It was in Memphis where Johnny Cash would get his chance to sing to \ngreat audiences. After being turned away on numerous occasions, Johnny \nwoke early one morning and went to the Memphis office of the famous Sun \nRecords to meet Sam Phillips and he arrived for work. After a brief \nsession, Mr. Phillips told Johnny to return the next day with a band. \nFrom that day forward, Johnny Cash reigned as the undisputed king of \nthe downtrodden poor, a working man's savior in song.\n  Johnny Cash sang with a scowl of determination. The darkness of the \nsongs he sang was only brightened by the hope of the audiences he \naddressed. That this man, this legend, this poor kid from Arkansas, \ncould succeed on the grandest scale by putting his experiences and his \nemotions into song, gave the poorest sharecropper and the most \noppressed worker that hope. There are no parameters in song. No \nboundaries, no borders, no confinements. For in a song, a man may truly \nexpress the deep well of thought not to be expressed in polite society. \nSong crisscrosses through time with an ease and a fluidity that gives \ntrue freedom to those who are not free, whether they are beholden to \ndebt, their family, society or their own shortcomings. Johnny Cash \nunderstood the nature of song like few before or after. He understood \nits power over people. He understood the hope it could give, the \nhappiness it could bestow, the sorrow it could impart. He knew these \nthings about music. He used this understanding to give voice to those \nthat had none.\n\n  As he said in explaining his propensity to wear black clothes, ``I \ntried to speak for the voices that were ignored or even suppressed by \nthe entertainment media, not to mention the political and education \nestablishments.'' As he put it, black clothes symbolized the \ndispossessed people of the world.\n  Johnny Cash achieved a level of success equal to that of the Beatles \nand Elvis. The legacy he left will be a lasting one in country and rock \nmusic. From jazz to blues to country music, to the rock and roll that \nwas nurtured in its early years in the juke joints of the Delta South \nand the urban ghettos of the north, Johnny Cash contributed his own \nparticular interpretation to this musical legacy: one that will forever \nbe enshrined in the memories of his friends, colleagues, and thousands \nof fans.\n  Johnny Cash sold more records than anyone in the world in 1967. He \nwas so popular that he had his own ABC television series. He won eleven \nGrammys and was the youngest person ever inducted into the Country \nMusic Hall of Fame. He has also been inducted into the Rock and Roll \nHall of Fame, has been honored with a Kennedy Center Award, and has a \nstar on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. President Bush honored him with the \nNational Medal of the Arts this past April.\n  Despite all of the professional accomplishments and accolades, I \nthink Mr. Cash would rather us celebrate his life in terms of the \npeople he touched with his music and his philanthropic work. In \naddition to his music, Mr. Cash endowed a burn research center, \ncampaigned for prison reform, counseled former inmates transitioning to \nsociety, and donated and worked for the Mental Health association, Home \nfor Autistic children, Refugees for Battered Women, the American Cancer \nSociety, YWCA, and the Humane Society, among others.\n  Johnny Cash rose from nothing to everything on the strength of an \niron will, gritty self-determination, and an unflappable faith in God, \nhis family, and his music. Nothing he earned in his life came at the \nexpense of others. Yet all he gave to all. Johnny Cash learned from his \nmistakes and ascended to a level higher than those who preceded him. He \ntaught us to learn from our mistakes. He taught us to never give up, \nthat the dreams of a small boy on a small farm in a small town can be \nbig, and that they can come true. He taught us how to be free through \nthe words and melody of a song. The lessons from his music are \napplicable today and will be for generations to come. Nothing captures \nthe imagination of the heart like a great song. Mr. Cash captured the \nhearts of many. And his song will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11638-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11638-S11639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING DR. CYNTHIA HALDENBY TYSON\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I recognize Dr. Cynthia Tyson, \nwho retired this year from her position as president of Mary Baldwin \nCollege in Staunton, VA.\n  Dr. Tyson was born and raised in England, where she received both her \nbachelor's and master's degrees, as well as her Ph.D. She first came to \nthe United States as a Fulbright scholar, and has worked in higher \neducation as both a lecturer and an administrator.\n  During her 18-year tenure at Mary Baldwin College, she was the active \nforce behind that school's renaissance into a nationally renowned \nwomen's liberal arts college. From the beginning of her tenure in 1985 \nto this day, Mary Baldwin College has more than doubled its enrollment, \nwith almost 2,200 students attending 6 locations throughout Virginia. \nThe college has\n\n[[Page S11639]]\n\nconsistently attracted more highly qualified applicants, with the SATs \nand GPAs of its applicants increasing every year. Under Dr. Tyson's \npresidency, Mary Baldwin's endowment has increased threefold, with a \nrecord-setting $58 million raised in its most recent capital campaign. \nAll told, Mary Baldwin College, thanks to Dr. Tyson, is the largest and \nfastest growing women's college in Virginia.\n  In addition to her work at Mary Baldwin College, Dr. Tyson served as \npresident of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and was \nan active member in professional organizations, including the National \nAssociation of Independent Colleges and Universities, the Virginia \nFoundation for Independent Colleges, and the State of Virginia Rhodes \nScholarship Competition Selection Committee. She is also active in the \nStaunton community through the Frontier Culture Museum, Shenandoah \nShakespeare, and Rotary International.\n  Dr. Tyson has left an indelible mark not only on the institution that \nshe served so well as president but also on the hearts and minds of her \ncolleagues, students, and community as a friend and inspiration.

Mr. President, I speak today in honor of the Small \nBusiness Administration, which this year is celebrating the 50th \nanniversary of its service to America's small businesses.\n  This week marks the SBA's annual Small Business Week. Throughout the \nevents of this week, the SBA will demonstrate many of the valuable \nprograms that have been created to help entrepreneurs across the \ncountry achieve success over the past 50 years. The SBA is relied upon \nto help restore economically depressed communities, spur technological \nresearch and development, provide access to capital and business \ntraining, monitor the procurement practices of Federal agencies, and \nensure small businesses are heard within the Federal Government.\n  With the assistance of the programs and resources of the Small \nBusiness Administration and its dedicated employees, thousands of small \nbusinesses across the country have developed and expanded. Some of \nthose companies have since developed into household names after \nreceiving help from the SBA; companies like Outback Steakhouse, Nike, \nand Staples. These businesses exemplify the entrepreneurial spirit that \nis so unique to this country.\n  The importance of the small business community cannot and should not \nbe underestimated. The link between small businesses and a strong \neconomy is clear: small businesses account for over 50 percent of \nnonfarm GDP, and account for 75 percent of all new jobs. Time and \nagain, our small businesses have led this Nation out of bad economic \ntimes.\n  We cannot help this country's economy by ignoring our small \nbusinesses and underfunding the initiatives meant to foster their \nestablishment and growth. President Bush seems to understand that there \nis a need to support small businesses, but during his 3 years in \noffice, he has yet to translate that understanding into actions. In his \nfirst year, he cut the SBA's budget by almost 50 percent. In his second \nyear, he eliminated all funding for the agency's largest small-business \nloan program and shifted the cost--more than a hundred million--to the \nsmall businesses and the SBA's lending partners in the private sector \nwho make the loans possible--never mind that the government was already \novercharging them. He has cut funding for microloans and counseling--\nthe SBA's number one program for reaching African Americans, Hispanics \nand women.\n  Here in the Senate, we are trying to pass legislation reauthorizing \nthe programs of the Small Business Administration for another 3 years, \nand I think Chair Snowe and the other members of the committee for \nworking with me to create a bill that enables small businesses to \ncontinue to prosper. We are doing our part to assist small businesses, \nand the next step is to ensure that the SBA and its programs receive \nthe funding they need to actively help small businesses across the \ncountry in these difficult economic times. The administration's low-\nball request for FY 2004 will not help about adequate funding of the \ncritical assistance that America's small businesses need. I intend to \ndo everything possible to obtain necessary funding for these critical \nsmall business programs to ensure they will thrive in the next year and \nfor the 50 years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11639-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING WILLIAM G.

Mr. President, today I recognize Mr. Luther E. \n``Ikey'' Miller, who passed away on March 17, 2003 in Rileyville, VA.\n  Born on January 27, 1932, Mr. Miller was involved in a wide array of \nactivities in his lifetime, including law, business, politics, the \nmilitary, sports, music, and agriculture. Throughout his life, he was \ninfluential in his community. In 1973, he was appointed to serve as \nPage County Circuit Court clerk, a post that he held for 26 years, \nbecoming an integral part of the local judiciary. Mr. Miller also \nserved as chairman of the Page County Republican Party for 16 years, \nand as a Presidential elector for Virginia in the 2000 Presidential \nelection. A Virginia native, he graduated from Luray High School in \n1949. Mr. Miller entered the U.S. Army in 1952, serving until 1954, and \nachieving the rank of corporal before his honorable discharge. He also \nworked 21 years for First National Bank as a cashier and loan officer. \nMr. Miller loved sports, especially baseball, which he played in the \nminor leagues, as well as football and hunting. He also farmed full-\ntime throughout his life with the help of his family, and played in a \ncountry music band for 20 years.\n  Mr. Miller will surely be missed by his wife of 47 years Shirley, his \nfamily, friends, and the community he served so faithfully during his \nlife. I join with the Miller family in mourning the loss of such a \ngreat family man, public servant, and Virginian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11639-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11639-S11640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING THE ANN ARBOR SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA'S 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Stabenow and \nmyself, I congratulate the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra as it \ncelebrates its 75th anniversary. The Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra was \nfounded by Phillip Potts on a chilly autumn evening in 1928. Potts and \nfour musicians gathered in a basement room of a local church, set up \ntheir music stands, unpacked and tuned their instruments, and launched \ninto what would become a musical legacy that has touched many in the \nMichigan community.\n  Today, the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra includes over 150 \nprofessional musicians who perform under its auspices. The organization \nhas an active and committed 45-member Board of Directors and a staff of \nfive full-time employees. Each season, the symphony performs nine main \nstage concerts for 8,000 subscription patrons as well as five matinee \nconcerts for over 1,000 senior citizens and five family-oriented \nconcerts designed to engage family members of all ages. The group's \nextensive educational series includes four youth concerts, ``Ensembles \nin the Classroom'' during which orchestra members visit individual \nclassrooms,\n\n[[Page S11640]]\n\nand a variety of other educational events which enrich the lives of \nalmost 20,000 area students each year.\n  The Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra counts Joseph Maddy, who was also \nthe founder of Michigan's prestigious Interlochen Center for the Arts, \nas one of its earliest conductors. It has been the orchestra in \nresidence for the Martha Graham Dance Company, the University Musical \nSociety, the Music Paradigm, and Peter Schickele, aka PDQ Bach. Guest \nartists have included world renowned violinists Jaime Laredo, Catherine \nCho, Ilya Kaler, Augustin Hadelich, and Benny Kim; clarinetists Richard \nStoltzman and David Shiffrin; and pianists Anton Nel and Vladimir \nFeltsman.\n  During its 75-year history, the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra has \nreceived many honors. It has received awards from the National \nEndowment for the Arts, including a Millennium Project award for the \npremiere of a new work for an orchestra. It has also consistently \nearned top marks from the Michigan Council for the Arts and Cultural \nAffairs. Furthermore, in 2002 it was recognized by Crain's Detroit \nBusiness magazine as one of the area's best-managed nonprofit \norganizations. In addition, the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra won the \nNonprofit Enterprise at Work's Excellence Award for Management in 1997 \nand 2003.\n  The Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra's repertoire ranges from Baroque to \nthe 21st century and spans musical genres from Bach to Broadway. Each \nyear, the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra has premiered a new work by a \nyoung composer through its annual ``Mozart Birthday Bash'' concert \nseries. This year the orchestra is also commissioning a work by \ninternationally known Michigan composer Michael Daughtery. ``Silent \nMovies'' is a work for the Barton Theater Organ, which is located in \nthe historic Michigan Theater, in celebration of the orchestra's 75th \nanniversary.\n  The Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra is an integral part of the cultural \nand economic landscape of Ann Arbor and southeastern Michigan. Senator \nStabenow and I would like to congratulate and honor the Ann Arbor \nSymphony Orchestra, its Music Director Arie Lipsky, and the hundreds of \nmusicians, board members, and staff who have brought musical gifts to \nso many over the past 75 years. We know our Senate colleagues will join \nus in offering our thanks to the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra for \nenriching our lives and in wishing the organization continued success \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11640-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FERC NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n\n                            Grid Management\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the front page of the Washington \nPost recently featured a local graduate student who skillfully mapped \nthe electronic networks that interconnect every business and industrial \nsector in the American economy. The article emphasized how the \ninformation was readily available on the Internet and the associated \nsecurity concerns. It also discussed the astonishment and alarm among \nindustry leaders upon hearing about it.\n  Early this year, the Department of Homeland Security published two \npapers emphasizing the need to secure critical infrastructure from \nphysical and cyber-attacks, including all aspects of the electric power \ninfrastructure system. This was clarified further by the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission (FERC) in its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on \nStandard Market Design, which states, holesale electric grid operations \nare highly interdependent, and a failure of one part of the generation, \ntransmission, or grid management system can compromise the reliability \nof a major portion of the grid.\n  Simply put, experts in the public and private sector, time and time \nagain, acknowledge the vulnerability of the entire national electric \npower infrastructure and that all aspects should be protected. As \nblatantly demonstrated by the recent blackouts in the northeastern \nUnited States, the viability of the national power grid is an important \nnational security concern.\n  I am concerned, therefore, that a cyber security standard recently \nproposed by FERC, which is designed to protect the electric power grid, \nexempts rocess control systems, distributed control systems, or \nelectric relays installed in generating stations, switching stations \nand substations from the definition of ``critical cyber assets'' to be \nprotected.\n  Despite the clear intent of the Department of Homeland Security and \nFERC to protect the power system entirely, the proposed rule calls for \nonly partial protection. The FERC decision may mean that power \ndistribution is protected, while power generation remains vulnerable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield for a comment. I have been \nmade aware that technology exists in the marketplace that is capable of \nprotecting power generation assets. I am aware of at least one company, \nin fact, a Massachusetts company, that has developed software capable \nof protecting our power generation assets from cyber attack. If the \ntechnology exists, are we not obligated to protect these assets? \nProtecting transmission without protecting generation is like \nprotecting airports without protecting aircraft. Isn it reasonable, \ntherefore, to conclude that the entire national power grid, including \ngeneration, should be protected?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think the answer is yes. No aspect of the \nelectric power grid should be exempt from this cyber security standard. \nI urge the ranking member to work with us to address this issue during \nconference committee consideration of the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2004. With my good friend, the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts, I ask the Appropriations Committee, \nin conference with the House of Representatives, to include a \nrequirement that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission report to the \ncommittee and the Congress as to why generating infrastructure was \nexcluded from the proposed rule.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for brining this \nissue to my attention. I agree that process control systems, \ndistributed control systems, or electric relays installed in generating \nstations, switching stations and substations are indeed critical assets \nof the national electric power infrastructure and should not be exempt \nfrom protected assets. I look forward to addressing this issue in \nconference committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11640-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11640-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11640-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11640-S11641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendments:\n\n       S. 520.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to prescription drug coverage \n     in the federal Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 101\n\n       Whereas, advances in the effectiveness of prescriptive \n     medication have substantially improved the quality of health \n     care in the United States; a key component of prevention \n     health care, prescription drugs help patients live healthier, \n     longer, and more productive lives without the need for costly \n     long-term acute care; and\n       Whereas, since the passage of the Social Security Act of \n     1965, which originally authorized Medicare, the increased use \n     of new and improved prescription drugs has changed the \n     delivery of health care in the United States; nonetheless, of \n     the more than 40 million people enrolled in Medicare, one-\n     third have no prescription drug coverage, and the limited \n     coverage available to the remaining two-thirds of Medicare \n     beneficiaries is often inadequate to meet their needs; and\n       Whereas, comprehensive reform of the Medicare program is \n     necessary to provide affordable care for the elderly and \n     disabled who suffer from chronic disease and comorbidity; the \n     private sector has established a model for successful reforms \n     by negotiating discounts on prescription drugs and by \n     coordinating care with disease management, drug utilization \n     review, and patient education programs, all of which aid in \n     ameliorating medical problems; and\n       Whereas, despite the growing needs of the Medicare \n     population, the United States Congress has thus far failed to \n     remedy the inadequacies of the Medicare program; effective \n     reform would adopt the successful strategies of the private \n     sector and use the marketplace to foster competition among \n     private plans, maintaining the financial viability of the \n     program and offering greater choice of quality coverage to \n     seniors and the disabled; and\n       Whereas, instead, the lack of a prescription drug benefit \n     in particular has forced states to supplement Medicare by \n     providing medicine to vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries \n     through state Medicaid programs; this ``dually eligible'' \n     population, those who qualify for federal Medicare and state \n     Medicaid, accounts for 42 percent of Medicaid drug \n     expenditures nationwide; and\n       Whereas, the situation is critical in Texas, where the \n     Congressional Budget Office reported the enactment of a \n     Medicare drug benefit would mean a savings of nearly $2 \n     billion in Medicaid funds between 2005 and 2012; alarmingly, \n     the costs to state Medicaid programs are expected to increase \n     as the non-elderly disabled and the elderly over age 85 who \n     are most likely to be dually eligible are the fastest growing \n     populations within Medicare; and\n       Whereas, with state Medicaid programs already facing \n     serious budgetary constraints that threaten to restrict \n     patients' access to needed medical care and prescription \n     drugs, it is more important than ever that the Congress enact \n     a Medicare prescription drug benefit as quickly as possible: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 78th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully request that the Congress of the United \n     States enact financially sustainable, voluntary, universal, \n     and privately administered outpatient prescription drug \n     coverage as part of the federal Medicare program; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the Congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-283. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to the Government Pension \n     Offset (GPO) and the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP); to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        Joint Resolution No. 29\n\n       Whereas, the State Teachers' Retirement System has a higher \n     contribution rate than, and benefits commensurate to, the \n     Social Security system; and\n       Whereas, the State Teachers' Retirement System is not \n     coordinated with the federal Social Security system; and\n       Whereas, the Social Security Act includes two offsets, the \n     Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination \n     Provision, that reduce the Social Security benefits payable \n     to persons who are entitled to benefits under other public \n     retirement systems, under certain conditions; and\n       Whereas, public employees in California who do not pay into \n     Social Security incur substantial reductions in their federal \n     Social Security benefits even if they otherwise qualify for \n     those benefits through prior employment for which they paid \n     into Social Security, or as surviving spouses through their \n     spouses' Social Security eligibility; and\n       Whereas, these offsets discourage individuals with prior \n     work experience from seeking teaching positions; and\n       Whereas, every child is entitled to be taught by a fully \n     credentialed teacher, but California has had a significant \n     shortage of teachers credentialed in the subjects they are \n     assigned to teach; and\n       Whereas, the recruitment and retention of teachers from \n     other states who are entitled to Social Security benefits \n     upon retirement is also undermined by these offsets; and\n       Whereas, legislation to remedy the Government Pension \n     Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provision have been \n     introduced in the 107th Congress by members of the California \n     Congressional delegation and received bipartisan support from \n     a majority of the California delegation in the 106th \n     Congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly: That the Legislature of the State of \n     California requests the Congress of the United States to \n     enact legislation to remove the onerous effects of the \n     Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination \n     Provision of the Social Security Act, and further, the \n     Legislature of the State of California requests President \n     George W. Bush to support and sign that legislation; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-284. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to bringing peace and security to Cyprus; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 36\n\n       Whereas, this year marks the twenty-seventh anniversary of \n     the Turkish invasion and occupation of Cyprus; and\n       Whereas, the Republic of Cyprus has been divided and \n     occupied by foreign forces since 1974 in violation of United \n     Nations resolutions; and\n       Whereas, the international community and the United States \n     government have repeatedly called for the speedy withdrawal \n     of all foreign forces from the territory of Cyprus; and\n\n[[Page S11645]]\n\n       Whereas, there are internationally acceptable means to \n     resolve the situation in Cyprus, including the \n     demilitarization of Cyprus and the establishment of a \n     multinational force to ensure the security of both \n     communities in Cyprus; and\n       Whereas, a peaceful, just, and lasting solution to the \n     Cyprus problem would greatly benefit the security and the \n     political, economic, and social well-being of all Cypriots, \n     as well as contribute to improved relations between Greece \n     and Turkey; and\n       Whereas, the United Nations has repeatedly stated the \n     parameters for such a solution, most recently in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1217, which was adopted \n     on December 22, 1998, with United States support; and\n       Whereas, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1218, \n     also adopted on December 22, 1998, calls for reduction of \n     tensions in the island through a staged process aimed at \n     limiting and then substantially reducing the level of all \n     troops and armaments in Cyprus, ultimately leading to the \n     demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus; and\n       Whereas, President Bush wholeheartedly supported Resolution \n     1218 and committed himself to taking all necessary steps to \n     support a sustained effort to implement it: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives (the senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to work to implement United \n     Nations resolutions to bring peace and security to Cyprus; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-285. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to a center for the health, \n     welfare, and education of children, youth, and families; to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 123\n\n       Whereas, the Millennium Young People's Congress held in \n     Hawaii in October 1999, demonstrated the value of a \n     collective global vision by and for the children of the world \n     and the need for a forum for international discussion of \n     issues facing all children and youth; and\n       Whereas, children and youth are the key to world peace, \n     sustainability, and productivity in the next millennium; and\n       Whereas, the health, welfare, and education of children and \n     families are part of the basic foundation and values shared \n     globally that should be provided for all children and youth; \n     and\n       Whereas, the populations of countries in Asia and the \n     Pacific Rim are the largest and fastest growing segment of \n     the world's population with young people representing the \n     largest percentage of that population; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii's location in the middle of the Pacific Rim \n     between Asia and the Americas, along with a diverse culture \n     and many shared languages, provides an excellent and \n     strategic location for meetings and exchanges as demonstrated \n     by the Millennium Young People's Congress, to discuss the \n     health, welfare, and rights of children as a basic foundation \n     for all children and youth, and to research pertinent issues \n     and alternatives concerning children and youth, and to \n     propose viable models for societal application: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     first Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2002, the Senate concurring, that the United Nations is \n     respectfully requested to consider the establishment in \n     Hawaii of a Center for the Health, Welfare, and Education of \n     Children, Youth and Families for Asia and the Pacific; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the President of the United States and the \n     United States Congress are urged to support the establishment \n     of the Center; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the House and Senate Committees on Health \n     convene an exploratory task force to develop such a proposal \n     for consideration by the United Nations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the Secretary General of the \n     United Nations, the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     University of Hawaii, the President of the East West Center, \n     the President of the United Nations Association in Hawaii, \n     and members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-286. An act passed by the General Assembly of the State \n     of Maryland relative to the Department of Planning of the \n     State of Maryland; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n       POM-287. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of New Hampshire relative to the Low Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Program; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                      Concurrent Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, New Hampshire's federal allocation of the Low \n     Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is used to \n     operate the statewide fuel assistance program, which provides \n     benefits to qualified New Hampshire residents, such as low-\n     income elderly, disabled, and low-income working households, \n     to assist with paying their energy bills during the winter \n     season. The fuel assistance program also helps New Hampshire \n     residents in a hearing emergency by securing an emergency \n     delivery of fuel, delaying a shut-off notice, or referring \n     individuals to another source of assistance; and\n       Whereas, fuel costs for this winter have proven to be \n     higher than expected and higher than last winter, while the \n     average temperature thus far this winter has been colder than \n     usual; and\n       Whereas, during the 2001-2002 heating season, New Hampshire \n     received $13.2 million in LIHEAP funds based upon a $1.7 \n     billion federal appropriation. With these funds, New \n     Hampshire assisted 24,876 low-income households, but was not \n     able to provide full benefits to all income-eligible seniors \n     and working poor families that requested assistance; and\n       Whereas, New Hampshire's fuel assistance program made \n     numerous programmatic changes prior to this winter to further \n     maximize federal LIHEAP dollars this winter season, including \n     reducing income eligibility levels and reducing benefits \n     amounts. In spite of these efforts, sufficient federal funds \n     do not exist to serve all eligible New Hampshire residents \n     who request assistance; and\n       Whereas, states are developing new and innovative ways to \n     stretch available program resources, including the use of \n     pre-purchase programs during the summer months that are not \n     adequately supported by the current program legislation; and\n       Whereas, last winter many low-income residents \n     unnecessarily suffered and took extreme and dangerous \n     measures to stay warm. Results of a 2002 winter survey of New \n     Hampshire's low-income residents identified disturbing facts \n     which include that 16.4 percent of the over 900 respondents, \n     many of whom are elderly, disabled, facing severe medical \n     problems, or caring for small children, used dangerous \n     alternatives to heat their homes, such as space heaters or \n     ovens. Another 7.3 percent of the respondents indicated they \n     went without medical care or medicine; and\n       Whereas, the current authorization level, set at $2 \n     billion, is not sufficient to meet the current need for \n     program assistance as a result of rising unemployment and \n     poverty levels and continuing volatility in energy pricing; \n     and\n       Whereas, uncertainty in appropriations due to the lack of \n     advance funding has made it more difficult for the states to \n     set program eligibility levels and take advantage of program \n     buying opportunities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives \n     concurring, That the general court hereby urges the New \n     Hampshire congressional delegation to support:\n       I. Extending LIHEAP's authorization through fiscal year \n     2008;\n       II. Maintaining the current funding formula and hold-\n     harmless provisions in order to maintain-adequate funding \n     levels for the region's programs;\n       III. Increasing the authorization level to $3.4 billion; \n     and\n       IV. Allowing states to draw-down funds prior to the start \n     of the winter heating season in order to take advantage of \n     pre-purchase and other discount programs; and\n       That copies of this resolution be forwarded by the senate \n     clerk to the President of the United States, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the President of \n     the United States Senate, and the members of the New \n     Hampshire congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-288. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to the Texas border with \n     Mexico and border health issues; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, the United States and the United Mexican States \n     share a border of 2,000 miles from Brownsville, Texas, to San \n     Diego, California; the four states of the United States and \n     the six states of the United Mexican States along the border \n     are home to more than 75 million residents, an increase of \n     about 11 million since 1990; and\n       Whereas, a significant percentage of these 10 states' \n     population resides in the 44 United States counties and 80 \n     Mexican municipalities adjacent to the border, where rapid \n     population growth is putting great pressure on an already \n     inadequate infrastructure and straining the border region \n     past its economic limits and resources, the tragic effects of \n     which have broad repercussions on the health of residents in \n     both countries; and\n       Whereas, setting the stage for many of the health problems \n     of the border is the standard of living of many in the \n     region; more than a third of United States border families \n     live at or below the federal poverty guideline, and an \n     estimated 350,000 people live in colonias, unzoned, semirural \n     communities with no access to public drinking water or \n     wastewater facilities; and\n       Whereas, such deficiencies in public works have increased \n     the risk of exposure to pollution and water-borne \n     contaminants since many of the primary sources of water along \n     the border are contaminated by sewage and pollution from \n     agricultural and industrial sources; according to the United \n     States Health Resources and Services Administration, 122 \n     million liters of raw sewage are dumped into the Tijuana, \n     New, and Rio Grande rivers daily, and a series of studies\n\n[[Page S11646]]\n\n     conducted by several United States and Mexican agencies, \n     including the Texas Department of Health, monitored sites \n     along the Rio Grande and found chemicals such as PCBs, \n     cyanide, mercury, and lead at significant levels; and\n       Whereas, beyond the effects of population, poverty, and \n     pollution, many of the health concerns endemic to the border \n     region are exacerbated by a lack of access to primary care \n     and preventive medicine; uneven distribution of hospitals and \n     physicians, inadequate transportation, limited immunizations, \n     and a shortage of bilingual health care providers contribute \n     to otherwise preventable health problems; and\n       Whereas, several standard health indicators reflect the \n     shortcomings of the health care system along the border; the \n     incidence of hepatitis A and tuberculosis is two to three \n     times the national average, and measles, HIV/AIDS, and \n     various infectious diseases disproportionately threaten the \n     population of the border region as compared to the United \n     States as a whole; and\n       Whereas, due to these and many other concerns and in an \n     effort to provide international leadership to optimize health \n     and quality of life along the United States-Mexico border, an \n     agreement between the United States secretary of health and \n     human services and the secretary of health of the United \n     Mexican States created the United States-Mexico Border Health \n     Commission in 2000; and\n       Whereas, the crises of health along the border are myriad \n     and profound, with complications arising from cultural, \n     economic, and geographic conditions unique to the region; \n     although the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission \n     has made great progress in promoting health and reducing \n     health disparities, strategic planning and comprehensive \n     study are critical for the commission to fulfill its \n     mission to provide the tools necessary for the future \n     well-being of the border populations: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the 78th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby memorialize the Congress of the United States to \n     request that the United States Department of Health and Human \n     Services fund a benchmark study coordinated by the United \n     States-Mexico Border Health Commission and conducted by \n     universities from the border area of each of the adjoining \n     border states in both the United States and the United \n     Mexican States to engage each state's health policy with \n     respect to the border health issues and goals outlined in \n     Healthy Border 2010/Frontera Saludable 2010, a border-wide \n     program of health promotion and disease prevention that \n     defines an agenda for improving health in the United States-\n     Mexico border region; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the study also address early intervention \n     and preventive strategies; water and wastewater issues; \n     immunization; behavioral health issues, including nutrition \n     and exercise; elimination of health disparities among the \n     border population; and response to disaster and disease \n     outbreak; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, to the secretary of the United States Department of \n     Health and Human Services, and to all the members of the \n     Texas delegation to the Congress with the request that this \n     resolution be officially entered in the Congressional Record \n     as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of \n     America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-289. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to human cloning; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 354\n\n       Whereas, the advances of science have taken our society to \n     a challenging frontier. The highly publicized cases of \n     animals being cloned are harbingers of decisions our society \n     will face when the technology reaches the point where human \n     cloning is possible. The rapid pace of advancement leads many \n     to believe human cloning will soon be possible; and\n       Whereas, cloning is often mentioned in connection with \n     research in a variety of areas. Those discussing the \n     possibilities of human cloning do so without detailing the \n     horrific aspects of this procedure, especially the number of \n     failed cloning procedures for every cloning that succeeds. \n     Most importantly, some advocates of cloning ignore the grave \n     moral implications involved in this life and death issue; and\n       Whereas, there are profound problems with the concept of \n     human cloning. The process itself often involves the \n     discarding of living cells and the destruction of \n     unsuccessful clones. It is most disturbing to think that a \n     company could routinely kill cloned embryos after extracting \n     certain desired cells. The concept of human cloning evokes \n     images of human experimentation from the Nazi era. In \n     addition to these moral issues, there are also many who worry \n     that cloning may lead to serious genetic problems and \n     ultimately threaten public health; and\n       Whereas, there is legislation currently pending in Congress \n     that seeks to prohibit all human cloning. This bill, S. 1899, \n     unlike others that provide certain exceptions allowing \n     cloning for research purposes, recognizes the seriousness of \n     the problems created by cloning and the moral implications. A \n     true ban of all human cloning needs to be in place: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to ban all human cloning. We call on Congress to \n     enact S. 1899 and reject other bills that purport to ban \n     human cloning but provide for research using cloned cells; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-290. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to the Child Modeling \n     Exploitation Prevention Act of 2002; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, according to a sample survey of the nearly 24 \n     million school-aged children that were on-line regularly in \n     1999, roughly one in five received a sexual solicitation; \n     remarkably, fewer than 10 percent of these sexual \n     solicitations were ever reported to authorities; and\n       Whereas, unfortunately, as the Internet has revolutionized \n     access to information, sharing of ideas, and global \n     communication, it also has provided a vast landscape for the \n     machinations of sexual predators; the United States Customs \n     Service reports there are an estimated 100,000 websites \n     involved in some way with child pornography, and arrests, \n     indictments, and convictions for possession of child \n     pornography transported across borders have climbed steadily \n     since 1992, doubling several times during the last 10 years; \n     and\n       Whereas, among the websites charging users to view images \n     of children in suggestive poses are those that have become \n     known as exploitive child modeling sites; where legitimate \n     child modeling websites market the talent of the model, \n     exploitive child modeling features compromising visual \n     depictions of children without a direct or even indirect \n     purpose of marketing an actual product other than the images \n     of the minor; and\n       Whereas, the anonymous nature of communicating through the \n     Internet allows pedophiles to deceitfully contact and \n     personally interact with these child models, providing \n     opportunity to develop on-line relationships and thereby \n     increasing the chances of aggressive solicitations for \n     meeting in person; and\n       Whereas, more than 70 percent of convicted pedophiles have \n     accessed child pornography or exploitive child modeling \n     websites as a means of sexual gratification, and the very \n     operators of these sites, while defending their legitimacy, \n     admit that pedophiles are likely frequent visitors; and\n       Whereas, legislation is now before the 107th Congress that \n     would protect children's opportunities to develop legitimate \n     modeling careers and at the same time protect them from \n     exploitation at the hands of website operators: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 78th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     enact the Child Modeling Exploitation Prevention Act of 2002; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and the President of the Senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all members of the Texas delegation to the \n     Congress with the request that this resolution be officially \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 291.

The Congress and the President of the United States are \n     respectfully memorialized to enact legislation honoring all \n     the senior citizens of the United States by designating May \n     15th as National Senior Citizen's Day.\n       2.

The Congress and President of the United States are \n     respectfully memorialized to make a wholehearted national \n     effort to encourage people and organizations to celebrate \n     ``National Grandparents Day'' by planning appropriate \n     programs, ceremonies and activities that commemorate and \n     honor the wonderful and vital contributions that grandparents \n     make to the lives of their families.\n       2.

A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act to add Rhode Island to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery \nManagement Council; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rhode Island \nFishermen's Fairness Act of 2003. This legislation would address a \nserious flaw in our Nation's regional fisheries management system by \nadding Rhode Island to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council \n(MAFMC), which currently consists of representatives from New York, New \nJersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.\n  The MAFMC manages the following 13 species, all of which are landed \nin Rhode Island: Illex squid, loligo squid, Atlantic mackerel, black \nsea bass, bluefish, butterfish, monkfish, scup, spiny dogfish, summer \nflounder, surfclam, ocean quahog, and tilefish.\n  In 2001, the most recent year for which final data are available, \nRhode Island fishermen brought in over 21 percent of MAFMC landings by \nweight--more than any of the MAFMC member States except New Jersey, \nwhich is responsible for about 56 percent of total MAFMC landings. In \nfact, with the exception of New Jersey, Rhode Island's total 2001 MAFMC \nlandings, 44.1 million pounds, nearly equaled those of all other MAFMC \nmember States combined, 45.9 million pounds.\n  If Rhode Island fishermen are responsible for a large percentage of \noverall MAFMC landings, these species make up an even larger proportion \nof landings within Rhode Island every year. Between 1995 and 2002, \nMAFMC species represented between 29 percent and 58 percent of all \nfinfish landed in Rhode Island annually, for an average of 43 percent \nof total landings by weight. In eight of the years between 1990 and \n2002, squid, Illex and loligo, was the number one finfish landed in \nRhode Island, with a value of between $13 million and $20 million \nannually.\n  Yet Rhode Island has no voice in the management of these species.\n  Following council tradition and Federal fisheries law, the Rhode \nIsland Fishermen's Fairness Act would create two seats on the MAFMC for \nRhode Island: one seat nominated by the Governor of Rhode Island and \nappointed by the Secretary of Commerce, and a second seat filled by \nRhode Island's principal State official with marine fishery management \nresponsibility. The MAFMC would increase in size from 21 voting members \nto 23.\n  There is a precedent for this proposed legislation. In 1996, North \nCarolina's representatives in Congress succeeded in adding that State \nto the MAFMC through an amendment to the Sustainable Fisheries Act. \nLike Rhode Island, a significant proportion of North Carolina's landed \nfish species were managed by the MAFMC, yet the State had no vote on \nthe council. Today, Rhode Island's share of total landings for species \nmanaged by the MAFMC is more than six times greater than that of North \nCarolina.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to restore a measure of \nequity to the fisheries management process by passing the Rhode Island \nFishermen's Fairness Act. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1624\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITION OF RHODE ISLAND TO THE MID-ATLANTIC \n                   FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL.\n\n       Section 302(a)(1)(B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(a)(1)(B)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``Rhode Island,'' after ``Virginia,'';\n       (2) by inserting ``Rhode Island,'' after ``except North \n     Carolina,'';\n       (3) by striking ``21'' and inserting ``23''; and\n       (4) by striking ``13'' and inserting ``14''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 1625. To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow small \nbusiness employers a credit against income tax for certain expenses for \nlong-term training of employees in highly skilled small business \ntrades; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to introduce \ntoday a\n\n[[Page S11650]]\n\nbill to provide a tax credit for apprenticeship training programs for \nvarious construction trades recognized by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics (BLS), including masonry, electrical contract work, plumbing \nand heating and a host of other important vocations.\n  There are several reasons why I believe this legislation is necessary \nfor apprenticeship training in these trades. First and foremost, these \nare highly skilled trades requiring many years of training. Second, \nthere is a significant shortage of workers in these trades; in fact it \nis my understanding that many contractors often have to look outside \nthe country to find a craftsman trained in one of these particular \nfields. Third, the average age of some of the workers in these crafts \nis over 50 and we must make every effort to ensure that we retain and \nrecruit the most capable people in these jobs. And finally, many of \nthese industries are very capital intensive and it makes sense to me to \noffer small businesses a short term tax credit to encourage \nproductivity and stimulate economic growth and job creation.\n  During the last Congress a similar bill was introduced in the House \nof Representatives by Congressman Foley of Florida. Regrettably the \nbill was not met with a great deal of enthusiasm, primarily due to the \nprice tag attached to it. The legislation I am introducing, the \nApprenticeship Training and Education Act of 2003, has been modified to \naddress budgetary concerns as well as the concerns of those in some of \nthe building trades that the apprenticeship training programs were \nindeed legitimate ones that would ultimately produce certified \ncraftsmen. I greatly appreciate the assistance of the Mason Contractors \nAssociation of America and the Independent Electrical Contractors in \ncrafting a bill that is fiscally responsible and credible.\n  I believe this tax credit will go a long way toward encouraging \ncompanies with a certified apprenticeship program to hire and train new \nworkers. As the population of these workers continues to age and \ndecline, it is absolutely essential that we look for ways to attract \nmore, younger workers to what I believe to be excellent, high-paying \nand high skilled jobs in these construction trades.\n  Under my bill, a tax credit of up to $10,000 per year for the first 2 \nyears of a 4-year program would be provided and companies could hire \nthree new apprentices each year. The normal business deduction taken \nfor this expense would be offset by the amount of the tax credit. The \nbill also specifically targets trades in the construction industry \nrecognized by the BLS and only those programs certified by a State's or \nthe Federal Department of Labor would qualify for the credit.\n  In my view there are many companies across the country that would \nbenefit tremendously from this tax credit. I commend this legislation \nto my colleagues and urge them to cosponsor it with me. These are jobs \nand trades to be proud of and I encourage other Members of this body to \npromote the skills and education necessary to keep them viable in the \nUnited States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1625\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as I consulted the morning weather reports, \nthe thought occurred to me that today's economic forecast sounds a lot \nlike the weather forecast. There is good reason to believe dramatic \nchange is on the way. Yet, unlike the weather, how dramatic the \neconomic change will be and how prepared we will be for it is in our \nhands. While we can't do anything about the weather, we can do \nsomething about helping America's workers get back to work.\n  We have already taken action to lay the groundwork for our economic \nrecovery. We have ensured the presence of more capital in our economy \nwhich will lead to the creation of more jobs for our people. We have \nalso begun to deal with the changing face of our Nation's economy. \nBecause the kinds of jobs that will be available in the days to come \nwill be different from those that were highly valued just months ago, \nwe need to ensure that those who are looking for jobs find them. To do \nthat we must ensure they have the training they will need for these new \npositions. We must also bring workforce supply and demand together to \nensure that our businesses have the skilled employees they need to \ncompete in a more global economy.\n  Workforce development is a powerful economic development tool. In \nthese challenging times, the reauthorization of the Workforce \nInvestment Act will give us an opportunity to improve the lives of \nmillions of our workers, and increase the strength of our businesses \nand communities.\n  Legislation I am introducing today, the Workforce Investment Act \nAmendments of 2003, along with my colleagues Senator Kennedy, Senator \nGregg and Senator Murray, will build upon the success of the Workforce \nInvestment Act while addressing its shortcomings.\n  In 1998 the Workforce Investment Act was enacted to create a \nstreamlined job training and employment system that would be responsive \nto the needs of employers and workers. The system may be fairly new, \nbut we've already learned a great deal about its strengths and \nweaknesses. These lessons reinforce what I learned as a small business \nowner in Wyoming: real opportunity in America comes from the small \nbusiness sector; economic development and workforce development go hand \nin hand; rural areas face unique workforce development challenges; \nWashington cannot--and should not--determine state, local and \nindividual workforce needs; and overly burdensome administrative \nrequirements divert resources from serving customers.\n  Prior to coming to the Senate, my wife and I owned a small chain of \nshoe stores. We were not shoe salesmen, we were shoe fitters. There is \na big difference. Shoe fitters listen to their customers and then meet \ntheir need for footwear with something comfortable to wear. Some people \nmay be born salesmen, but they have to be trained to be shoe fitters. \nWe had a series of courses we put our employees through. Few people are \naware that slight changes can be made in a shoe to make it especially \ncomfortable as well as useful and attractive. They aren't aware of the \npossibilities because they haven't been coming to see shoe fitters--\nthey've been dealing with salesmen.\n  We taught listening, needs questioning, and technical fitting. Any \nstaff person could advance through our training and begin filling foot \ndoctor's prescriptions. The value of the training was that it made our \nstores special. We made sure our customers received the help they \nneeded--even though they didn't know to ask for it--because they didn't \nknow it was available.\n  Along the way we got to see some very special people achieve. One \nyoung returning Vietnam vet became a store manager, then bought that \nstore--and later--bought a second store from us. Now he owns his own \nbuilding and is also in the motel business. Bill Schepeler of Miles \nCity, MT has and is playing a role in building three communities. I \nalso consider him to be one of my good friends. He went through a \nworkforce training program that we had approved in conjunction with the \nfederal government.\n  My wife has also served on several boards that dealt with training \nand jobs and is currently on the Advisory Committee On Apprenticeship \nof the Department of Labor. She and I know that real opportunity in \nAmerica comes from the small business sector where the American dream \ncan still happen.\n\n  This bipartisan legislation I am introducing today wil help keep the \nAmerican dream alive for millions of American workers. It will provide \nworkers with the training they need to find new or better jobs.\n  Our bill improves upon the existing one-stop career center delivery \nsystem to ensure that it can respond quickly and effectively to the \nchanging needs of employers and workers in the new economy and address \nthe needs of hard-to-serve populations. The bill also better connects \nthe job training system with the private sector and with post-secondary \neducation and training, social services, and economic development \nsystems. Doing so will prepare the 21st century workforce for career \nopportunities and skills in high-growing sectors. Our bill removes \nbarriers in the laws that have discouraged business involvement in \nworkforce training. As a result, job training and employment services \nwill be more demand-driven and responsive to the needs of employers, \nboth large and small.\n  One-stop career centers are the focal point of WIA's job training and \nemployment system. However, distance can create a barrier to delivering \njob training and employment services in many rural and frontier areas, \nlike Wyoming. A job seeker or employer in Dubois, WY has to travel 150 \nmiles round trip to get to the nearest one-stop center in Lander. It \nisn't hard to understand the impact that traveling distances like that \ncan have on a trainee or business owner. If you live in a big city--\nthere's probably a facility just down the road--or a short bus ride \ndowntown. There is an answer to that problem--technology can \neffectively remove the barrier created by distance. This legislation \nwill leverage technology to improve access to WIA services throughout \neach state, including rural areas.\n  Some states and localities have found creative ways to overcome the \nchallenges imposed by current law. Wyoming has done a magnificent job \nwith the resources they have been allotted, and I commend their \ningenuity. With this legislation, we will give Wyoming and the other \nstates and localities the tools they need to help the unemployed or \nunderemployed.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the HELP Committee for all their \nwork on this bipartisan Workforce Amendment Act. I also want to thank \nthe Department of Labor for their assistance. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues and the administration to expeditiously address \noutstanding issues and enact this vital legislation. A demand-driven, \nflexible, and accountable system that works in all areas of the country \nin all economic times is what we can achieve through the \nreauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act.\n  We can't do anything to change the path of Hurricane Isabel. However, \nwe can do something to put our workers on the path to new and better \njobs. In fact, this bill means more than just jobs--it means good, \nsolid careers for the workers of this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1627\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prescribe the oath of renunciation and allegiance \nfor purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today is Citizenship Day. On this day \nin 1787 the Constitution of the United States was signed. In 1952, \nCongress passed a law designating Citizenship Day on this day with the \nintent of recognizing those who had become American citizens during the \npreceding year.\n  In the ceremony where an immigrant becomes a naturalized citizen of \nthis country, where he or she becomes a new American, he or she swears \nan oath of renunciation and allegiance.\n  Last week, on September 11, I noted that the oath of allegiance is \ncurrently a matter of mere Federal regulation and not a matter of law. \nI said that Congress ought to enshrine the oath in law.\n  Today, on behalf of Mr. Burns, Mr. Sessions, and 30 Members of the \nSenate, I rise to introduce legislation to do precisely that--to make \nthe current oath of allegiance the law of the land. Doing so will give \nthe oath of allegiance the same status enjoyed by other key symbols and \nstatements of being an American--the American flag, the Pledge of \nAllegiance, the national anthem, and our national motto. All these \nsymbols and statements have been specifically approved by Congress and \nare now a matter of law. The oath of allegiance ought to be treated \nwith the same dignity.\n  The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services--or BCIS--an \nagency of the Department of Homeland Security, was recently planning to \nchange the oath of allegiance that immigrants take to become a citizen \nof this Nation. While those changes seem now to be on hold, it seems \ninappropriate to me that the BCIS, or any other Government agency, no \nmatter how well intentioned, should have the power to alter the oath \nwithout congressional approval.\n  In the first 5 months of this fiscal year, 166,968 immigrants took \nthe oath and were naturalized as new citizens of this country.\n  The oath assumed its present form in the 1950s and was first adopted \nin Federal regulations in 1929. But some of the language dates all the \nway back to 1790.\n  Yesterday, I attended a naturalization ceremony for new citizens. \nThey were proud to take the oath of allegiance to the United States. \nThey were proud to become Americans. This is the oath they took to \nbecome U.S. citizens--the oath which will become law if the bill I will \nintroduce today should pass and be signed by the President.\n  I quote:\n\n       I--and the citizen states his or her name--hereby declare, \n     on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure \n     all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, \n     state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been \n     a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the \n     Constitution and laws of the United States of America against \n     all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true \n     faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on \n     behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I \n     will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the \n     United States when required by the law; that I will perform \n     work of national importance under civilian direction when \n     required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely \n     without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help \n     me God.\n\n  That is the oath of allegiance. That is quite an oath. It has \nstrength. It has clarity. It sounds as if it might have been written by \nsome rowdy patriots in Philadelphia or Williamsburg.\n  Yet, surprisingly, Congress has never voted on the content of this \noath. We have left it to Federal regulators. It is time to protect it.\n  This is a straightforward bill that simply codifies the oath of \nallegiance as it presently stands. The bill I introduce today has, as I \nmentioned, already attracted 30 cosponsors, including the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina who is presiding today.\n  I hope more Senators will join us in protecting this key statement on \nwhat it means to become an American.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1629. A bill to improve the palliative and end-of-life care \nprovided to children with life-threatening conditions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to talk \nabout a bill I will be introducing today, along with Senator Chris \nDodd, a bill that has to do with children. It is an issue that is \ndifficult to think about or talk about but one that is critical to many \nchildren and their families in our Nation.\n  What I am taking about is what we do, or what we can do, when a child \ndevelops a life-threatening or terminal illness. What I am talking \nabout is we need to make sure we do everything in our power to make \nsick children as comfortable as possible and as happy as possible--\neverything in our power to ease their suffering. What I am talking \nabout is the pressing need for comprehensive, compassionate, continuous \ncare for children who are facing death as a result of serious illness; \nthe need\n\n[[Page S11681]]\n\nto make palliative care available to any child who is seriously ill and \nwho might possibly be facing death.\n  No parent or family member ever expects a child to die. With today's \nmodern medicine and research advances, it is easy to think that only \nolder people die, but, tragically, we all know that is not the case. \nThat is why today, along with Senator Dodd and Congresswoman Pryce and \nCongressman Murtha, we are introducing a bill, the Compassionate Care \nfor Children Act, 2003, in an effort to help ensure that very sick \nchildren receive a continuum of care and that young lives do not end in \npreventable pain or fear or sadness.\n  Every year, over 55,000 children die in the United States. Some \nchildren will die suddenly and unexpectedly, in a car accident, by \ndrowning, or fire, or by choking. Some may even be murdered.\n  Others, though, thousands of children, will be diagnosed with life-\nthreatening illnesses or disease that might eventually, over a period \nof time, take away their lives. Children with these kinds of illnesses \nare in and out of hospitals and clinics. They receive chemotherapy and \nradiation treatments. They might undergo multiple surgeries.\n  They might have nurses and doctors poking and prodding at them nearly \nall the time. Some of these children are old enough to realize that \nthey might die if the treatments for their diseases might not work. \nOthers are too young to understand that reality.\n  One poor girl--Liza--knew she was going to die. Shortly after her \nfourth birthday, she was diagnosed with a form of leukemia. For the \nnext year, Liza's parents explored every possible medical option for \nher, and every possible treatment. They took her to doctor after doctor \nafter doctor, and they had access to the most cutting-edge therapies \navailable to treat Liza's disease. But nothing seemed to work. At the \nage of 5, Liza began to ask her mother about what would come next, and \nwhether she would soon die after her bone marrow transplant--her last \nchance for a cure--had failed.\n  Once the medical treatments had failed, hospitals has little else to \noffer Liza. There was no discussion, tragically, about end-of-life care \nat the hospital for this little child. No one wanted to admit that they \nwere out of treatment options, that there was no cure, that she wasn't \ngoing to get better, have her life restored and her health restored, \nand that she wasn't going to grow up and become an adult and have her \nown children someday. There was no discussion of that. No one in that \nhospital wanted to talk with Liza about death, even though this little \ngirl pleaded with them to do so.\n  Liza's mother told the Washington Post that Liza asked her oncologist \nto tell her when death was near. This little 5-year-old girl asked her \ndoctor to tell her when she was going to die. Yet on the final night of \nher life, as this little child lay dying in her mother's arms, near her \nfather and her older sister, Liza asked, ``Why didn't the doctor call \nto tell me.''\n\n  Liza's parents were able to get some hospice care for their daughter \nduring the last 3 months of her life. Tragically, fewer than 10 percent \nof children who die in the United States ever receive any sort of \nhospice care. When children like Liza are terminally ill, parents are \nforced to make decisions for their children under extremely emotional \nand stressful conditions. The decisions that confront these parents are \nones that they never, of course, expected to have to make. Parents want \nwhat is best for their children. They want their children to get better \nand be healthy. They want their children to be pain free. They want \ntheir children to receive comfort and care when they are sick.\n  God forbid that parents find out their children are very sick--so \nsick they are never going to get better, so sick there are no more \ntreatments and no more cures, and so sick they know their children are \ngoing to die. Those parents will try to do everything imaginable and \neverything possible in their power to help their children and make them \ncomfortable, pain-free, and happy in their remaining days.\n  We have an obligation to help those parents achieve those goals.\n  Children with life-threatening diseases and illnesses require special \nmedical attention to make their shortened lives more comfortable. We \nknow that. Yet despite that knowledge, the fact is, current Federal law \nand regulations do not take into consideration the special care needs \nof a gravely ill or dying child. In fact, these Federal laws and \nregulations get in the way of taking care of these children.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would help correct the \ndeficiencies in current law and help sick children facing possible \ndeath live more comfortably and live with dignity and would help them \nreceive the comprehensive care they deserve and the comprehensive care \nwe would expect for our own children.\n  Let me take a few moments to explain what our bill actually does.\n  First, it offers grants so doctors and nurses can receive training \nand education to enable them to better understand these issues and to \nhelp them provide end-of-life care for these kids. The goal of these \ngrants is to improve the quality of care terminally ill children \nreceive. One of the ways we do this is to make sure doctors and nurses \ntruly understand these issues so they can provide the care and be \nbetter informed.\n  Our bill also provides money for the National Institutes of Health to \nconduct research in pain and symptom management in children. This \nresearch is critically important to improve the type of care dying \nchildren receive.\n  A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine stated that \n89 percent of children dying of cancer die experiencing ``a lot or a \ngreat deal'' of pain and suffering.\n  This does not have to happen. We can change that, and we must. This \nis simply not acceptable. Research has to be done so that children will \nnot suffer needlessly.\n  In addition to grants, the second piece of our bill changes the way \ncare is delivered to children with life-threatening illnesses. Right \nnow, doctors, hospitals, and parents have to overcome significant \ninsurance and eligibility barriers to enroll a dying child in hospice. \nFirst, to qualify for hospice, a doctor must certify that a child has 6 \nmonths or less to live. The problem with this ``6-month rule'' is that \nit is harder for a doctor to determine the life expectancy of a sick \nchild than it is to determine the life expectancy of a sick adult or \nelderly person. A child dying of cancer, for example, may die in 6 \nmonths or 6 years, making that child ineligible for hospice care that \nwould ensure a comfortable life while that child is alive. It is very \ndifficult many times to estimate how long that child is going to live. \nThis very rigid 6-month predictability rule which denies care is very \ninhumane for these kids. It is wrong, and we have to change that rule.\n  According to Dr. Joanne Hilden and Dr. Dan Tobin, ``Sick children are \nstill growing, which is a biological process very much like healing. So \nwhen a child is diagnosed with illness such as cancer or heart disease, \nhe is much more likely to be cured than an adult.''\n  Simply put, diseases progress differently in children than adults, \nand children with terminal diseases get lost in the health care system \ndesigned for adults--a health care system that does not take into \nconsideration the special needs of children.\n  Furthermore, the current system does not allow a patient to receive \ncurative and palliative care simultaneously. In other words, current \nlaw does not allow doctors to continue trying life-prolonging \ntreatments--treatments that could cure an illness or extend their life, \nand also at the same time provide palliative care to that patient. In \nother words, current law does not allow the assistance, the doctors to \ngo in to try to provide typical hospice care where you make that child \ncomfortable and do all the things to alleviate the pain and at the same \ntime you are still trying to save the child's life.\n\n  That is wrong. That is simply wrong. That presents a parent with a \nhorrible choice, a choice that no parent should have.\n  That is tragic. Palliative care offers a continuum of care, care that \ninvolves counseling to families and patients about how to confront \ndeath, care that involves making the patient comfortable in his or her \nsickest hours, care that acknowledges that death is a real possibility.\n\n[[Page S11682]]\n\n  Federal law requires a person who wishes to receive end-of-life care \nto discontinue receiving curative or life-prolonging treatment. When a \nchild is involved, this means a parent must agree to no longer provide \ncurative treatment, treatment that could cure the child--that is \nwrong--in order for their child to receive care and support for the \npossible end of life.\n  This should not be an either/or decision for parents. I don't know of \nany parent who would give up trying to cure a sick child when there was \nany chance that child might be saved. They should not be put in this \nposition.\n  Current law places parents in impossible positions. We simply must \nfix this. End-of-life care should be integrated with curative care so \nthat parents, children, and doctors have access to a range of benefits \nand services. As I said earlier, palliative care should not be confined \nto the dying. It should be available to any child who is seriously ill.\n  That is why our bill creates Medicare and private market \ndemonstration programs to remove these barriers, making it simpler and \neasier for doctors and parents to make end-of-life decisions for \nchildren. the demonstration program will allow children to receive \ncurative and palliative care concurrently. This means children can \ncontinue to receive treatment and life-prolonging care while receiving \npalliative care at the same time. The demonstration program also \nremoves the 6-month rule so children can receive palliative care \nbenefit at the time of diagnosis.\n  I take a moment to tell my colleagues about another girl, Rachel Ann. \nRachel Ann was a little girl who did receive palliative care from the \ntime she was diagnosed with a grave heart problem. Rachel Ann had a \nheart that doctors describe as ``incompatible with life.'' Most babies \nwith heart malformations like Rachel Ann die within a matter of days \nafter birth. Rachel Ann's parents were devastated and distraught to see \ntheir tiny baby connected to a sea of wire and tubes, clinging to life.\n  Rachel Ann's parents were referred to a pediatric hospice and decided \nto bring their daughter home from the hospital so she could experience \nlife with her family, surrounded by parents, brothers, relatives and \nchurch community at home. Rachel Ann's parents say she seemed truly \nhappy at home. She smiled and wiggled in response to voices and being \nheld. Her brothers doted on their baby sister.\n  Rachel Ann was able to spend her life at home in comfort with her \nfamily. She lived for 42 days and her family was able to make every \nsingle moment count. On Christmas day, after spending the morning with \nher family, Rachel Ann passed away.\n  This is truly a tragic story. Fortunately, Rachel Ann and her family \nwere able to spend as much time together as possible with Rachel Ann as \ncomfortable as possible. Her brothers were able to know their sister \nand to talk with hospice professionals about what was happening to her. \nRachel Ann's parents and grandparents also were able to talk about her \ncondition with hospice professionals and maintained an active role in \nher care. There was a support system in place for this family.\n  The terminal illness of a child must be an incredibly difficult thing \nto confront for a parent and a family. No one wants to think about \nchildren dying. No one wants to believe that children suffer, \nespecially in this age of great medical advances. It is a horrible \nsituation. But it is one that we must face. We can always do more to \nimprove the care that our children receive. We should continue to \nsupport research and finding cures for the diseases and illnesses from \nwhich children suffer. But until those cures are found, and as long as \nchildren die from these diseases, we must provide care and support for \na dying child. We have an obligation to provide that care and that \nsupport.\n  The bill we will introduce later today will be an important step in \nthis direction. It will provide tools and support networks to help \ngrieving families in their time of need. It is the right thing to do. I \nencourage my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1629\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to facilitate nationwide availability of 2-1-1 \ntelephone service for information and referral services, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S11686]]\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I want to think you Len Roberts and the \npeople of United Way for making this day possible. The tremendous board \nmembers, including Brian Gallagher and Dr. Johnnetta Cole. And Paul \nThornell and Bridget Gavaghan, of the staff.\n  I also want to thank Senator Dole for working with me on this \nproject. Because of her long history with the Red Cross, she \nunderstands the important of 2-1-1, and I am so pleased to be working \nwith her to champion the Calling for 2-1-1 Act. I know that she will be \na tremendous help in getting this legislation passed into law.\n  Representatives Richard Burr and Anna Eshoo are leading this effort \nin the House and I appreciate their efforts.\n  I also want to thank you Major Dennis E. Fowler who was here this \nmorning from Florida to share his perspective on the value of 2-1-1.\n  And of course, I have to mention George Clooney who is on the board \nof United Way and came to a press conference this morning to help \npublicize this legislation. I am always happy to thank people who take \ntime away from K Street to help Main Street.\n  This is a piece of legislation whose time has come.\n  As you all know, I represent a State that experienced a horrible \ntragedy on September 11. The silver lining in that tragedy was the \ntremendous outgrowth of volunteerism. We saw thousands of individuals--\npeople from all over the country--who came to New York just to lend a \nhand.\n  But the biggest challenge the city experienced was coordinating those \nefforts. Making sure we knew exactly how many people were needed to \nheal the wounded, clean up debris at the site, donate blood, bring food \nand coffee to the firefighters and police officers who were working \nround the clock, and so much more.\n  The needs were great and the people of America rose to the challenge. \nBut our infrastructure struggled to keep up.\n  As time wore on, the economic repercussions of the disaster became \nmore and more apparent. More than 100,000 people lost their jobs. Close \nto 2,000 families applied for housing assistance because they couldn't \npay their rent or mortgage. Ninety thousand people developed symptoms \nof posttraumatic stress disorder or clinical depression within 8 weeks \nof the attacks. Another 34,000 people met the criteria for both \ndiagnoses.\n  Again, our communities rose to the challenge. Philanthropic \norganizations like United Way, along with corporations, foundations, \nand community organizations raise more than $1 billion to help the \nvictims.\n  But our government did not have the infrastructure to handle the \noutpouring of support. In a study of the aftermath of September 11, the \nBrookings Institution and Urban Institute found that as the dislocated \nworkers struggled to obtain assistance. people ``found it difficult to \nconnect with resources due to a social-services infrastructure that \ndoes not support a simple and deficient method for people to learn \nabout and access services and for agencies to coordinate their \nactivities.''\n  That's what 2-1-1 is all about. It provides a single, efficient, \ncoordinated way for people who need help to connect with those who can \nprovide it.\n  The Federal Communications Commission land the groundwork for a 2-1-1 \nnumber in 2000 when it directed the telephone number to be reserved for \ninformation and referral to social- and human-services agencies. The 2-\n1-1 system opens the way to a user-friendly social-services network, by \nproviding an easy-to-remember and universally available phone number \nthat links individuals and families in need to the appropriate non-\nprofit and government agencies.\n  Where 2-1-1 is now active, it has done just that. 2-1-1 is helping \nour youth to navigate through difficult situations like exiting a gang, \nassisting a suicidal friend, and rejecting illegal drugs.\n  2-1-1 was already operating in Connecticut during September 11 and it \nwas critical in helping identify the whereabouts of victims, connecting \nfrightened children with their parents, providing information on \nterrorist suspects, and linking ready volunteers with coordinated \nefforts and victims with necessary mental and physical health services. \n2-1-1 provided locations of vigils and support groups, and information \non bioterrorism.\n  I want those services to be available to New Yorkers who continue to \nneed services in the recovery process. Some have mental health \nproblems. Other are still out of work. Others need legal and financial \nadvice. Whatever the need, 2-1-1 can help.\n  So I am thrilled to announce today that I am introducing the Calling \nfor 2-1-1 Act. I hope that we soon reach a day when all Americans have \nthe 4-1-1 on 2-1-1 so it can help them through life's toughest \nchallenges. Thank you.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS:\n  S. 1635. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nensure the integrity of the L-1 visa for intracompany transferees; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the L-1 Visa \nReform Act which affects intracompany transferees seeking entry to the \nUnited States. Congress created the L-1 visa to allow international \ncompanies to move executives, managers, and other key personnel within \nthe company and into the U.S. temporarily. The L-1 is an important tool \nfor our multi-national corporations, however, some companies are making \nan end-run around the visa process by bringing in professional workers \non L-1 visas and then outsourcing those workers to a third party \ncompany. In other words, some firms are using the so-called ``L-1 \nloophole'' to become the international equivalent of temp agencies, or \n``job shops.'' As a result, American workers are being displaced by \nforeign workers who are brought to the U.S. essentially for their \nlabor. This must stop--my legislation targets the problem, closes the \nloophole, and protects U.S. jobs from inappropriate use of the L-1 \nvisa.\n  The situation in question arises when a company with both foreign and \nU.S.-based operations obtains an L-1 visa to transfer a foreign \nemployee who has ``specialized knowledge'' of the company's product or \nprocesses. The problem occurs only when an employee with specialized \nknowledge is placed offsite at the business location of a third party \ncompany. In this context, if the L-1 employee does not bring anything \nmore than generic knowledge of the third party company's operations, \nthe foreign worker is acting more like an H-1B professional than a true \nintracompany transferee. Outsourcing an L-1 worker in this way has \nresulted in American workers being displaced at the third party \ncompany. In these difficult economic times, we must ensure that \nAmerican workers aren't losing their jobs to cheap foreign labor by \nthose circumventing protections already in law.\n  Several weeks ago I held a hearing on L-1 visa concerns in the \nImmigration Subcommittee. We heard from a full-range of witnesses--from \na displaced worker and labor unions to small and large U.S. companies \nto business immigration experts. The hearing clearly demonstrated a \nproblem exists, and the testimony of our witnesses directed attention \nto Congress' intent in creating the L-1 visa. The bill I am introducing \ntoday clarifies Congress' intent and restricts the inappropriate use of \nthe L-1 visa. The bill does so without forcing unnecessary restrictions \non the visa that would only result in adverse effects on legitimate L-1 \nusers.\n  The L-1 Visa Reform Act prevents companies from using the L-1 visa \nwhen an H-1B visa with its worker protections is appropriate. The \nlegislation requires that any employee with specialized knowledge who \nis located offsite must, first, be controlled and supervised by the \npetitioning company and, second, be provided in connection with an \nexchange of products or services between the petitioning company and \nthe third-party company. This will stop the practice of a consulting \ncompany bringing in foreign workers to send over to a manufacturer when \nthe consulting company does nothing more than cut the foreign worker's \npaycheck once a month. Instead, the bill requires the third-party \ncompany to have a pre-existing business relationship with the \npetitioning company that is more than just supplying workers.\n\n  In addition, the legislation requires companies to employ a worker \nfor at least one year before sending the employee over on an L-1 intra-\ncompany\n\n[[Page S11687]]\n\ntransfer. One year is a reasonable amount of time to require an \nemployee to have attained the specialized knowledge of the company's \nproducts, services or processes to qualify for the visa. The bill also \nmandates the Department of Homeland Security to maintain statistics \ndifferentiating between L-1 transferees who are managers and executives \nand those who are specialized knowledge employees. This will provide \nbetter accountability and fraud prevention when L-1 petitions are \nreviewed and approved.\n  We need the best people in the world to come to the United States, to \nbring their skills and innovative ideas, and to support our business \nenterprises. The L-1 visa is an important tool to achieve these \npurposes. But we must ensure that American workers are not displaced by \nforeign workers, particularly when we have safeguards in place albeit a \nloophole in law. The L-1 Visa Reform Act will close that loophole for \nthe benefit of U.S. workers and for U.S. businesses who use the visa as \nit is intended.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11687-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1723.

Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, \n     the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale \n     quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management \n     Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar, all of the western redcedar timber from \n     those sales which is surplus to the needs of domestic \n     processors in Alaska, shall be made available to domestic \n     processors in the contiguous 48 United States at prevailing \n     domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, \n     less than the annual average portion of the decadal allowable \n     sale quantity called for in the Tongass Land Management Plan \n     in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar, the volume of western redcedar timber \n     available to domestic processors at prevailing domestic \n     prices in the contiguous 48 United States shall be that \n     volume: (i) which is surplus to the needs of domestic \n     processors in Alaska, and (ii) is that percent of the surplus \n     western redcedar volume determined by calculating the ratio \n     of the total timber volume which has been sold on the Tongass \n     to the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale \n     quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management \n     Plan. The percentage shall be calculated by Region 10 on a \n     rolling basis as each sale is sold (for purposes of this \n     amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall mean that the \n     determination of how much western redcedar is eligible for \n     sale to various markets shall be made at the time each sale \n     is awarded). Western redcedar shall be deemed ``surplus to \n     the needs of domestic processors in Alaska'' when the timber \n     sale holder has presented to the Forest Service documentation \n     of the inability to sell western redcedar logs from a given \n     sale to domestic Alaska processors at a price equal to or \n     greater than the log selling value stated in the contract. \n     All additional western redcedar volume not sold to Alaska or \n     contiguous 48 United States domestic processors may be \n     exported to foreign markets at the election of the timber \n     sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be sold at \n     prevailing export prices at the election of the timber sale \n     holder.\n       Sec. 319.

Any modifications to the \n     authorization shall be made within the terms and conditions \n     of the authorization and authorities of the impacted agency;\n       (2) the return of a commercial recreation service to the \n     Secretary for operation when such services have been provided \n     in the past by a private sector provider, except when--\n       (A) the private sector provider fails to bid on such \n     opportunities;\n       (B) the private sector provider terminates its relationship \n     with the agency; or\n       (C) the agency revokes the permit for non-compliance with \n     the terms and conditions of the authorization.\n\n     In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation Fee \n     Demonstration Program to provide for operations until a \n     subsequent operator can be found through the offering of a \n     new prospectus.\n       Sec. 320. Prior to October 1, 2004, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall not be considered to be in violation of \n     subparagraph 6(f)(5)(A) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \n     Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(5)(A)) \n     solely because more than 15 years have passed without \n     revision of the plan for a unit of the National Forest \n     System. Nothing in this section exempts the Secretary from \n     any other requirement of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \n     Resources Planning Act (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) or any other \n     law: Provided, That if the Secretary is not acting \n     expeditiously and in good faith, within the funding \n     available, to revise a plan for a unit of the National Forest \n     System, this section shall be void with respect to such plan \n     and a court of proper jurisdiction\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\n     may order completion of the plan on an accelerated basis.\n       Sec. 321. No funds provided in this Act may be expended to \n     conduct preleasing, leasing and related activities under \n     either the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the \n     Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) \n     within the boundaries of a National Monument established \n     pursuant to the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) \n     as such boundary existed on January 20, 2001, except where \n     such activities are allowed under the Presidential \n     proclamation establishing such monument.\n       Sec. 322.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 235 which was \nreceived from the House and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 235) celebrating the \n     life and achievements of Lawrence Eugene ``Larry'' Doby.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senate is poised to pass H. Con. \nRes. 235, a measure that pays tribute to a legendary American pioneer \nand a long-time friend of mine, Larry Doby, who died on June 18. I \nappreciate the willingness of the majority and minority leaders to \nexpedite Senate consideration of this measure, and I applaud the \nefforts of Congressman Bill Pascrell of my home State of New Jersey, \nwho introduced it in the House of Representatives.\n  I first met Larry when we were thirteen or fourteen. We went to \nschool together at Eastside High in my hometown, Paterson, NJ. The \nfirst time I saw him, he was running track, doing the broad jump. And \nhe was amazing. We stayed in touch over the many years that have passed \nsince then.\n  Larry Doby was an exceptional athlete--one of our very best--and an \nexciting player to watch on the field. But he was much more than that; \nhe was a great man and he was also a good man. He had so much dignity. \nThough Larry Doby has died, the path he blazed for African-Americans \nremains.\n  Few people realize that Larry began his groundbreaking athletic \ncareer in 1943--at the age of 18--as the first African-American to play \nin the American Basketball League for the Paterson Panthers. He then \nmoved on to baseball, playing for the Newark Eagles of the Negro \nNational League. After returning from his service to the Navy for 2 \nyears, Larry hit .414 with 14 home runs in his final season in Newark.\n  It was on July 5, 1947, just 11 weeks after Jackie Robinson broke the \ncolor barrier in major league baseball, that Larry Doby signed a \ncontract with the Cleveland Indians of the American league. He was the \nfirst African-American player in the American League. Larry had no \nintention or desire to become part of history. When Indians owner Bill \nVeeck predicted to Larry that he would ``be part of history,'' Larry \nreplied, ``I had no notions about that. I just wanted to play \nbaseball.''\n  And play baseball he did, and quite well. Larry was an All-Star seven \ntimes in his 13-year career. In the 1948 World Series between Cleveland \nand the Boston Braves, his home run in Game 4 broke a 1-1 tie; \nCleveland won 2-1 and went on to win the Series in six games. He hit at \nleast 20 home runs in eight straight seasons and was inducted into the \nBaseball Hall of Fame in 1998.\n  Larry became the second African-American manager of a major league \nteam when he took over as skipper of the Chicago White Sox in 1978. He \nwas also the director of community relations for the New Jersey Nets in \nthe late 1970s, encouraging the development of youth programs in urban \nNew Jersey.\n  Larry was a superb athlete, but things didn't come easy for him. When \nhe joined the Indians, he was harassed by opposing players and fans. He \nwas forced to eat in separate restaurants, to sleep in separate hotels. \nSome of his own teammates wouldn't even shake his hand. But he pressed \non, and we're a better country for it.\n  At the memorial service for Larry, Newark Star-Ledger sports \ncolumnist Jerry Izenberg recalled the day that Larry entered the Hall \nof Fame in Cooperstown, NY. The two of them paused in front of a large \nphoto snapped immediately after Game 4 of the 1948 World Series--the \ngame Larry won with his home run. The photo showed Larry and winning \npitcher Steve Gromek hugging each other. Larry reminisced that the \nphoto appeared on the front pages of a lot of newspapers the next day \nand said to Jerry, ``That was the first time you could see a black and \nwhite person embrace on the first page of papers.'' ``At the time,'' \nJerry said, ``America needed that picture. And Larry was so proud to \nhave played a part in giving America what it needed.''\n  Larry said it best in a speech he gave after his career had ended. He \nsaid, ``We can see that baseball helped make this a better country. We \nhope baseball has given (children) some idea of what it is to live \ntogether and how you can get along, whether you are black or white.''\n  By this resolution Congress is showing its appreciation on behalf of \nall Americans to Larry Doby for his role in breaking down racial \nbarriers in baseball and in America. I'll say here what I said at his \nmemorial service: ``When we stand every day for the things we believe \nin, we'll be standing for Larry Doby.'' His family will miss him. I \nwill miss him. America will miss him.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 235) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/17/senate-section/article/S11707-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11707-S11708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 49\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
