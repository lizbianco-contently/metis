Mr. President, in just over 100 days, the American \npeople will make an historic and fateful decision. They will decide \nwhether we stay the course we are on or move our country in a new and \nbetter direction.\n  As I have traveled around South Dakota and the Nation, I have heard a \nlot about the hopes and dreams Americans have for their families. I \nhave listened to ranchers and farmers, teachers and mothers, police \nofficers and firefighters. I am always humbled by the honesty of their \nmessage.\n  Families in South Dakota and across our Nation aren't asking for \nspecial deals or special advantage. All they want is a fair opportunity \non a level playing field. They want to know that there is only one set \nof rules, and that the game isn't rigged against them. Most of all, \nthey want to know that as we make decisions affecting the future of our \ncountry, our first priority is doing right by America.\n  If a policy isn't going to make us stronger and safer, if it is not \ngoing to expand opportunity and put common sense ahead of ideology, \nthen it is not doing right by America.\n  Doing right by America rejects the defeatist view that we have enough \nmoney to rebuild Iraq, but not enough resources to take care of \nAmerica.\n  At its heart, doing right by America means fulfilling our moral \nresponsibility--together--to create a better future for our children \nand grandchildren. It is a simple value that Americans have always \nlived by, but it has been pushed aside these last 4 years. Boardroom \npriorities have crowded out kitchen-table needs, and special \ninterests--like Enron, Halliburton, and the giant oil companies--have \nundermined our common purpose. Years of progress in spreading \nopportunity for regular Americans has been turned on its head.\n  We are all proud that America is a place of great wealth and success. \nBut the genius of America has never been just the ability of the rich \nto get richer. The true genius of America has always been the promise \nthat all Americans who work hard and play by the rules will have the \nopportunity to succeed.\n  The promise of opportunity is what inspired my grandparents, and tens \nof millions of other immigrants, to start a new life here. And nearly \nevery day, I hear a new story that reminds me that my most important \nresponsibility is defending the opportunity of regular Americans to \nbuild a better life for themselves and their children.\n  Middle-class families deserve an opportunity to compete for good jobs \nthat reward work. They deserve an opportunity to send their children to \ngood schools, and then on to good colleges and universities, without \nbusting the family budget. They deserve an opportunity to purchase \nhealth insurance at a reasonable price so they can see a doctor--one \nthey choose--when they are sick or injured, and so they can fill a \nprescription if their doctor writes\n\n[[Page S8496]]\n\none. They deserve the opportunity to be safe--safe in their communities \nand safe in their homes. And, after a lifetime of hard work and years \nof paying into Social Security, they deserve the opportunity to retire \nwith dignity and security.\n  That is not a lot to ask. But in some ways, it is everything. \nWidening the circle of opportunity and prosperity--year after year, \ndecade after decade--is what makes America great. It is our heritage, \nand it must be our legacy.\n  But today, those with power often seem to have lost sight of this \nfundamental value and the difference between right and wrong. We saw \nthat a few months ago, when a major telecommunications company gave one \nof its executives a severance package worth more than $8 million. This \nexecutive had worked there for only 7 months, and he was leaving \nbecause he hadn't done his job well. As the company handed the failed \nexecutive his $8 million check, it handed out something else to 12,000 \nof its rank-and-file workers: pink slips. That is not doing right.\n  Around that same time, a man I have known for years called my office. \nHis name is Brad Besler. He is 47 and a fourth-generation rancher in \nwestern South Dakota. He and his wife, Fern, have five children--four \nhave graduated from college, and the youngest is still in grade school. \nBrad called my office because South Dakota is entering its fifth \nstraight year of drought and he is worried. Two years ago, the drought \nwas so bad, and trying to survive it was so stressful, that he suffered \na stroke that left him blind in one eye. A few months ago, he had \nanother stroke.\n  If the drought is anywhere near as bad this year, he says he will \nhave to sell his entire herd of cattle--the only income his family has. \nIf that happens, he will have to drop his family's health insurance, \nwhich runs $896 a month.\n  He is trying desperately to avoid that because--with a blind eye, a \nbad back, and a history of strokes--he knows that if he loses his \ncoverage, it will be next to impossible for him to ever get health \ninsurance again.\n  Listening to Brad Besler, two things strike you. The first is his \nincredible courage and willingness to work hard to support his family. \nThe second is that Brad's government seems to have forgotten about him.\n  We are not doing right by Brad Besler. And in my view, we are not \ndoing right by America when we hand over millions to a lucky few who \nalready have so much, while ignoring the real needs of those who are \nworking so hard and so honestly.\n  But that is exactly what is happening in America today. There is an \never growing list of government policies that reward wealth, not work. \nThat is not an accident; it is a conscious choice.\n  With Republicans in control of the entire Federal Government, it \noften seems as if their leaders are trying to narrow the circle of \nopportunity and prosperity in America. And they have put the needs of \nmiddle-class families on the back burner.\n  We see that even as the economy slowly improves. Corporations reap \nmost of the benefits, while regular workers continue to struggle. In \nfact, during this recovery, corporations have gotten twice their normal \nshare of the increase in national income, while workers have received \ntheir lowest share in over 50 years.\n  As the chief economist at Merrill Lynch observed: ``We've had a \nredistribution of income to the corporate sector.''\n  Or as Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest men in America, put it: \n``If there's class warfare going on, my class is winning.''\n  That isn't good for most American families, and it isn't doing right \nby America.\n  We can do better, and we have done better. During the Clinton \nadministration, America created 21 million new private-sector jobs. \nNow, just 4 years later, the Bush administration is on track to have \nthe worst job-creation record since the Great Depression.\n  During the first 2\\1/2\\ years of the Bush administration, we lost \nover 3 million private-sector jobs. And although the economy has \nfinally started to recover some jobs in recent months, the new jobs \npay, on average, 13 percent less than the jobs they are replacing.\n  As a result, too many average families are losing ground, even as \nthey work harder and harder. And to make matters worse, the Bush \nadministration continues to demand that millions of employees lose \ntheir right to overtime pay.\n  Since President Bush took office, real weekly earnings for average \nAmericans have not grown at all--but their expenses have soared. Gas \nprices have gone up 23 percent; college tuition has gone up 28 percent; \nand health care premiums have gone up 36 percent.\n  And while the middle class is getting squeezed, huge corporations are \ngrowing rich. While consumers are struggling with record gas prices, \nChevron-Texaco is reporting record profits. While family incomes have \nstagnated, overall corporate profits have risen by more than 50 \npercent.\n  A generation ago, the average American CEO made about 50 times more \nthan the average worker. Now, thanks to bad policies and even worse \nvalues, the average CEO makes 300 times more than the average worker.\n  That is just not right. And unless we change course, it is going to \nget worse.\n  Instead of fighting to keep good jobs here, Republican leaders in \nWashington are using tax breaks to reward companies for shipping jobs \noverseas. Businesses are walking jobs out of the country, and the \ngovernment is holding the door for them.\n  A few months ago, President Bush's top economic adviser told us that \nsending jobs overseas ``is probably a plus for the economy, in the long \nrun. The President believes this.''\n  The President also seems to believe it is okay to send millions of \ndollars in unemployment pay to former Iraqi soldiers, while denying \nhelp to American workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas.\n  That is doing wrong by America.\n  As the election nears, the President's economic team has been \ngrasping for ways to make a bad economy sound good. To deal with the \nloss of more than 2 million manufacturing jobs, they floated the idea \nof redefining ``manufacturing jobs'' to include fast-food workers \npreparing Big Macs and Whoppers. Manufacturing once meant building cars \nor fabricating steel for good wages. Now the Bush administration says \nit might mean putting a burger on a bun for minimum wage.\n  That is not being straight with America.\n  And we are not doing right by America by running up trillions in new \ndebt and pretending it is not a problem.\n\n  During the Clinton administration, we turned huge deficits into \nrecord surpluses. Now, just 4 years later, $5 trillion of expected \nsurpluses have turned into $3 trillion of new debt. As a result, we are \ngiving our children something they don't want and don't deserve: a \n$25,000 birth tax. That is the share of our national debt owed by every \nchild in America. My two grandchildren both inherited that debt the \nmoment they were born.\n  It wasn't long ago that Republicans came to Washington promising \nfiscal discipline. Instead of keeping that promise, they have taken us \non a 4-year fiscal binge that has squandered record budget surpluses \nand created record budget deficits.\n  In 2000, Republican leaders, including President Bush, promised that \n``[t]he Social Security surplus is off-limits, off budget, and will not \nbe touched.'' Four years later, they have already raided $500 billion \nfrom Social Security to pay for tax cuts, and they are planning to take \nanother $2.4 trillion--$2.4 trillion--over the next 10 years.\n  That is your money. It comes out of your paycheck. It is supposed to \nbe there when you retire. It is not supposed to be used to pay for tax \nbreaks for millionaire CEOs or to reward companies for shipping \nAmerican jobs overseas.\n  Looting Social Security is not doing right by American workers and \nretirees, and we can't let it happen.\n  The Bush administration is draining trillions from Social Security, \nborrowing hundreds of billions from China and Japan to pay our debts, \nsending billions of dollars to Iraq for roads and schools, and then \nplanning on cutting billions here at home for education, environmental \nprotection, medical research, Head Start, and nutrition programs for \npregnant women and children. The administration even wants to cut $1 \nbillion from homeland security at the very time it is warning of likely \nnew terrorist attacks.\n\n[[Page S8497]]\n\n  That is not doing right by America, and it doesn't make any sense. \nBut this administration is making a habit of decisions that don't make \nmuch sense.\n  A couple of months ago, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \ndefended the administration's plan to provide health care to all \nIraqis, but not to all Americans. He said, ``Even if you don't have \nhealth insurance in America, you get taken care of. That could be \ndefined as universal coverage.''\n  Try telling that to the nearly 44 million Americans who are \nuninsured--4 million more than when George Bush took office--and the \nmillions more who are under-insured.\n  Try telling that to the millions of families who, year after year, \nare watching out-of-control health insurance premiums bust the family \nbudget.\n  Or try telling that to the Lakota woman in South Dakota whose sister \ndied a few months ago from a stomach cancer that went undetected \nbecause the Indian Health Service didn't have money to refer her to a \nspecialist.\n  In America today, seniors can't afford the medicine they need and \nhave discovered that last year's Medicare law is a sham that provides \nbillions to insurance and drug companies. Many veterans can't use the \nVA health system anymore because of arbitrary, budget-driven barriers \nto care. And 32,000 National Guard members and reservists who are \nserving in Iraq will lose their health coverage when they come home \nbecause the Bush administration refuses to extend their coverage.\n  These aren't unintended consequences. They are clear choices.\n  When record debt makes it difficult to repair our crumbling roads and \nbridges, fund our children's schools, support our police and \nfirefighters, and honor our commitment to America's veterans, that is \nthe result of bad choices.\n  When American soldiers are sent into combat without armor in their \nprotective vests, when they are losing limbs and sacrificing their \nlives because there aren't enough armored cars, when health services \nare being cut for veterans, and when the Bush administration says that \nthere isn't enough money to let reservists and Guard members buy into \nthe military health system, that is the result of bad choices.\n  These choices don't do right by America, and we need to change them.\n  There is something else we need to change. In the last 4 years, we \nhave seen more and more secrecy and less and less accountability in the \nBush administration.\n  During the past few years, a small group of courageous individuals \nhas stepped forward and said things this administration didn't want to \nhear and didn't want anyone else to know. In every case, their \npatriotism, honesty, or competence was attacked.\n  Senator John McCain found that out. So did the President's former \nTreasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. And so did Medicare actuary Richard \nFoster, former Army Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki, and former \nWhite House counterterrorism adviser Richard Clarke.\n  When Ambassador Joe Wilson told the truth about the administration's \nmisleading claims about Iraq's nuclear weapon capability, some \nGovernment officials retaliated by disclosing that his wife was a deep-\ncover CIA agent. For nothing more than political gain, they were \nwilling to endanger the life of one of the people who protect our \nnational security.\n  That is not doing right by America. Those aren't our morals, and they \naren't our values.\n  In the America I know, moms and dads sit at the kitchen table every \nmonth and balance the family checkbook. When the car breaks down or \nthere are unexpected doctor visits, there is a pinch. They don't expect \nthe Government to bail them out when that happens, but they want a fair \nshake. They want their Government to focus on jobs and health care and \neducation, and they don't want their Government to take their Social \nSecurity money to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and big \ncorporations.\n  They want their Government to do right by them, and they have a right \nto expect that. But when they see oil industry interests coming before \ntheir interests, HMO profits coming before the health of seniors, and \nspecial deals for Halliburton coming before the safety of their sons \nand daughters in Iraq, they know their Government isn't doing right by \nAmerica.\n  I am as frustrated as they are about these choices, but I am not \ndiscouraged about our ability to fix things. We can and we will. We can \nget America back on track by doing right by America.\n  Doing right by America means putting our common interests ahead of \nthe special interests. It means paying as much attention to middle \nAmerica as we are paying to the Middle East. And it means bringing \ncommon sense back to Government.\n  We should be thinking not just about the people who own Wal-Mart, but \nabout the millions of Americans who work and shop there.\n  We should be changing tax polices so corporations have an incentive \nto keep jobs here at home, not ship them overseas, and we should \naggressively enforce our trade laws to protect workers from unfair \ncompetition.\n  We should be improving roads and bridges and creating millions of \njobs along the way, and investing in education, training, and \ntechnological innovation so workers who have lost jobs can find new \nones, and workers who have jobs can get better ones.\n  And if we are truly going to do right by American workers, it is long \npast time that we increase the minimum wage, and it is absolutely \nessential that we stop the Bush administration from following through \nwith its plan to strip millions of workers of their right to overtime \npay.\n  Doing right by America means honestly confronting the health care \ncrisis in our country, not pretending that it doesn't exist. As a first \nstep, we should provide every American with the opportunity to choose \nfrom the same health care options, at the same price, as Members of \nCongress have. If it is good enough for those of us in Government, it \nought to be an option for every American who needs health insurance.\n  Doing right by America means an honest prescription drug policy that \ndoesn't funnel billions of dollars in windfalls to drug companies and \nHMOs, but instead offers seniors the medications they need at a fair \nprice--without the mind-boggling complexity of the Bush \nadministration's drug plan.\n  It means properly funding our children's schools and giving every \nAmerican family a guarantee: If your sons and daughters work hard in \nschool and get good grades, they will have a first-rate and affordable \ncollege education waiting for them the day they graduate from high \nschool.\n  And it means putting our Nation on the road to energy independence. \nThe next generation should be able to look forward to a future that is \nnot put at risk by unrestrained pollution and a dangerous dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  Finally, doing right by America means being honest about performance, \nboth at home and abroad. It is not pessimistic to acknowledge the \nproblems workers have endured over the past 4 years; it is pessimistic \nto think that we can't do better.\n  And it doesn't endanger our troops to ask questions that might save \ntheir lives. If we are going to do right by them, we have to stand up \nfor them, even if that means asking tough questions about the \nadministration and its policies. And when our troops return home, we \nhave to make sure they receive the medical attention they earned. We \nowe them more than empty promises.\n  We will have a clear choice in November. We can continue on the \ncourse we are on, where special interests come before common interests, \nwhere boardroom issues come before kitchen-table issues, and where \nopportunity is reserved for a small, members-only club. Or we can \nchoose a new and better direction.\n  Doing right By America means that our values guide our policies. Our \nstrength comes from opportunity and responsibility--and a commitment to \nmaking sure that our middle-class has a fair chance. It means fixing \nhealth care, creating good jobs again, and making education affordable.\n  Mr. President, we can do this, and we should do it together. Doing \nright by America shouldn't be an idea we just talk about, it should be \nthe value that guides all our decisions in Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first I commend our Democratic leader \nfor an outstanding vision of what we should be doing to do right by \nAmerica. His eloquence this morning certainly speaks to every single \nperson in Michigan and what we care about, the priorities and values \nthat we have, and certainly it speaks to the sense of urgency that I \nbelieve we need to get something done for the people we represent in \nthis wonderful country. We need to do right by America.\n  There is something wrong when we have provided funding for health \ncare in Iraq for a broad, universal health care system, yet we cannot \nfocus on health care at home for over 44 million people and focus on \nthe costs of prescription drugs or make sure there is a real Medicare \nbill that works. There is something wrong with this picture. It is \ntruly time for us to do right by America. That is our job.\n  I speak today specifically about a topic that I frequently think \nabout on the floor of the Senate that needs to have a sense of urgency \nabout it as we come to the end of this week. We will not be in session \nin August. We will come back only for a few weeks in the fall. There is \na sense of urgency at home about the need to lower the cost of \nmedicine, the access to prescription drugs in this country.\n  I rise to express great concern today because at this very moment the \nSenate HELP Committee was supposed to be marking up a bill that \nhopefully would lead to the safe importation of FDA-approved \nprescription drugs from Canada and other countries where it can be done \nsafely. But, once again, the markup has been delayed. I am deeply \nconcerned that with the number of legislative days winding down, we \nwill not see a bill coming from committee to the floor of the Senate \nany time this year.\n  We know the prices of prescription drugs continue to rise and \ncontinue to place a tremendous burden not only on our seniors but on \neveryone who uses medicine on a regular basis.\n  We have a strong bipartisan bill that we put together to allow the \nreimportation of prescription drugs. It has been carefully discussed \nand deliberated. There is no reason that Americans should not benefit \nfrom the passage of this new law so we can have access to safe, FDA-\napproved drugs that come from FDA-inspected facilities in other \ncountries. In fact, Sav-Rx, one of the companies that is offering a \nMedicare drug card now, is even promoting reimportation as part of \ntheir marketing.\n  As reported in Tuesday's Washington Post, the company's Web site \nreads:\n\n       Sav-Rx is giving you the opportunity to save an additional \n     20%-30% on your mail order prescriptions through the use of \n     our Canadian Mail Order Pharmacy.\n\n  This is one of our Medicare cards that is using a Canadian mail order \npharmacy.\n  I have to say I am more concerned about mail order or Internet \nsales--particularly Internet sales--where we do not have the \nsafeguards, or may not know where the prescriptions are coming from, \nrather than what our bill does, which is allow the local pharmacist in \nMichigan or the pharmacist in any other State to do business with the \npharmacist across the border in a safe, FDA-approved way, with a closed \nsupply chain that brings the medicine from one place to another so we \nknow where it comes from and we can assure its safety.\n\n  But here we have one of those providing a Medicare card to seniors \nwho are using right now a Canadian mail order pharmacy as part of this \nprocess. Yet we can't get the support to pass a bill that would \nguarantee this process is available for everyone through the local \npharmacy--one pharmacy to another--and which is done in the safest \npossible way. We don't have regulations right now that mirror what we \nhave in our bill in terms of promoting the safety of reimportation of \nprescription drugs.\n  If we are going to continue to see mail order and Internet sales, we \ncertainly need to address the issues that we have addressed in our bill \nto make sure this process is safe.\n  This is all about numbers, as usual. The opposition is all about \nnumbers. It is about the $17 billion annually that the drug companies \nstand to profit from the new Medicare law versus the $5 billion cost \nthat American consumers can save per month from reimporting \nprescription drugs from Canada or allowing the local pharmacists in \nAmerica to do business with the pharmacists in Canada.\n  It is about requiring our seniors to go through this complicated \nprocess under Medicare to attempt to get a discount through a Medicare \ncard that would set up much more to profit the drug companies than to \nprofit the seniors. It is about a process that we are forcing people to \ngo through to try to get help. It is complicated. There are multiple \ncards. The prices can change every 7 days. The discounted drugs can \nchange every 7 days.\n  We heard testimony on Monday from Dr. McClellan in charge of the \nCenter for Medicare. What we are hearing is this massive effort of \nspending money to market and try to explain to people this complicated \nprocess. Why do we have this complicated process? Because it benefits \nthe pharmaceutical companies. It doesn't allow Medicare to negotiate \ngroup prices to get the best deal for people. So we have this \ncomplicated, costly process going on to guarantee that the profits of \nthe industry are protected.\n  On the other hand, all we need to do is bring to the floor this \nbipartisan bill that would allow our local pharmacists to do business \nsafely with pharmacists in Canada and other countries. We could drop \nprices in half immediately for consumers. We would save over $5 billion \na month for consumers. We would truly begin to address the stories we \nhear all the time--it is happening; they are not just stories--of \npeople who are choosing between food and medicine, paying their \nelectric bill or paying their rent. We don't make up those stories. It \nis happening every day, and I am sure it is happening right now as I am \nspeaking. We can fix that, too.\n  If the HELP Committee brought up a bill, had a meeting and voted this \nbill out today, we would have on the floor a means for us to be able to \nwork together to adopt a bill that works, is safe, and lowers prices. \nBut instead one more time this is delayed--delayed, delayed. \nUnfortunately, folks can't delay their bills. When they go to the \npharmacy to get their medicine, they can't say: I would be happy to pay \nyou but nothing is happening in Congress yet. The President won't \nsupport lowering prices. So I can't afford to pay this right now. Can \nyou wait? Can I pay it next year when they finally get around to \nfixing this, maybe? People can't do that when they go into the \npharmacy. They have to pay for their medicine.\n\n  There is a sense of urgency which they feel that, unfortunately, is \nnot felt in this body, or by the leadership. Those of us who have been \nworking\n\n[[Page S8499]]\n\nacross the aisle to get something done certainly feel it, but \nleadership does not. Unfortunately, the White House does not.\n  What we see is a continual unwillingness to schedule a bill, to bring \nit out, to give us an opportunity to vote and to get this done in the \nSenate.\n  We have legislation, S. 2328, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and \nDrug Safety Act, that is widely supported. It has been crafted \ncarefully by Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle. It will work. \nIt will guarantee that we put in place the safe precautions we need and \nthat will allow us to finally be able to address the issue of lowering \nprices.\n  There are many concerns that I and my colleagues have about the bill \nbefore the HELP Committee. I will not go into all the specifics at this \ntime, except to say we feel confident that the legislation we have \nintroduced would fix the concerns and the problems, and that we can \nwork together to get this done in the right way.\n  I am deeply concerned that right now seniors of this country are \nbeing asked to wade through Medicare card after Medicare card trying to \nfind out whether there is anything that can be done for them in terms \nof lowering prices. They are wading through all the other complexities \nof the Medicare bill. We are not taking action as we could on something \nthat would immediately make a difference.\n  I go back to what our Democratic leader spoke about so eloquently \nthis morning. Senator Daschle spoke about doing right by America.\n  How is it that there is a sense of urgency here to be providing funds \nto make sure those in Iraq have access to health care? Certainly we \nwant them to have access to health care. But what about us? What about \ndoing right by America as well? What about taking just a portion of the \nfunds we are spending abroad to build roads and schools and create \nhealth care systems and use that here at home to help Americans who are \ndesperate about being able to afford the medicine they need?\n  I might also say that this is directly related to the health \ninsurance premiums our small businesses and large businesses are paying \nin America. We know that about half the cost increases on health care \npremiums comes from the explosion of prescription drug prices.\n  When we pass the reimportation bill that we are coming forward with \nin a bipartisan way, we not only help our seniors who need our help and \nthe disabled and their families and workers, we are helping businesses \nbe able to lower prices. We are helping universities that have medical \nschools to be able to allow their pharmacies to do business with those \nacross the border in a safe way. We are helping the local hospitals be \nable to lower their costs which in turn helps them lower the cost of \nhealth care and health insurance premiums.\n  Just one proposal has very broad implications to bring down prices \nand make sure we are addressing one of the fastest rising components of \nhealth insurance for businesses in our country.\n  We have a bipartisan bill before the Senate that is endorsed by the \nAARP, Families USA, the Alliance for Retired Americans, numerous \nsenior, consumer groups, and health groups. I am deeply troubled by the \nfact it will be very difficult to bring this bill before the Senate and \npass it before we break on Friday. This debate has gone on far too \nlong.\n  As I have indicated, this can help business and individuals with the \nhigh cost of health care. It is time to get it done. We have the \ngreatest country in the world. Give us a chance to make this change and \nwe can help every American have access to the medicine they need. We \ncan take an important step forward in doing right by America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, it has now been 1 year and 1 week, 1 year \nand 7 days since senior White House officials leaked the identity of a \nclandestine officer of the CIA, Valerie Plame, to Washington \njournalists. According to the Washington Post, there were two senior \nWhite House officials who called a number of reporters--at last count, \nmaybe six--to reveal the name of Valerie Plame as being a covert CIA \nagent. Of course, only one reporter sought to publish that--was Mr. \nNovak--in one of his columns.\n  This criminal act was a brazen act of revenge and retaliation to \npunish Ms. Plame's husband, who dared to question one of the \nadministration's key justifications for invading Iraq.\n  One year and 7 days and nothing has been done, nothing.\n  Here is what the White House had to say yesterday, July 20. Deputy \nAttorney General James Comey said:\n\n       We take issues of classified information very, very \n     seriously. As you know, we have prosecuted or sought \n     administrative sanctions against any number of people \n     throughout the years for mishandling of classified \n     information.\n\n  Say again? After they exposed Valerie Plame, what happened? It took 6 \nmonths from the time of the leak of the Plame matter for Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft to recuse himself. Not until December 30 was a special \nprosecutor appointed. The President and Vice President have never \nappeared to take this leaking of her name and her identity very \nseriously--or even seriously.\n\n  In his only public statement about this leak, here is what the \nPresident said:\n\n       I don't know if we are going to find out the senior \n     administration official. Now, this is a large administration, \n     and there's a lot of senior officials. I don't have any idea.\n\n  That was George W. Bush, October 7, 2003.\n  If you look at the video of this, he is smiling when he says it. He \nhas kind of a smirk on his face. Does that sound like a matter being \ntaken very seriously? One year and 1 week later we are still awaiting \nany sign that prosecutions or even sanctions will be brought against \nanyone in this matter.\n  This dismissive attitude on the part of the President and the Vice \nPresident is not acceptable. We are not talking about a Washington game \nof gotcha. We are talking about a calculated act of betrayal and \ntreachery against our Nation. A clandestine officer of the CIA was \nbrazenly exposed by a couple of senior White House officials who \nsomehow got access to this information. Who gave them access? Who in \nthe CIA or the National Security Council gave her name to these White \nHouse officials? How did they come by it? She was a very deep \nundercover agent.\n  This betrayal has real consequences in terms of the national security \nof the United States. This single act by the White House has undermined \nthe clandestine capabilities of the CIA. It has damaged our national \nsecurity. It has weakened our country. In this respect, the Valerie \nPlame incident fits a much broader pattern, a pattern of actions by \nthis administration that have made our Nation weaker, less secure, more \nvulnerable to terrorist attacks.\n  Don't take my word for it, take the word of some former CIA people. \nHere is Larry Johnson, former CIA analyst and State Department \nemployee:\n\n       For this administration to run on a security platform and \n     allow people in the administration to compromise the security \n     of intelligence assets, I think is unconscionable.\n\n  And here is James Marcinkowski, former CIA operations officer:\n\n       The deliberate exposure and identification of Ambassador \n     Wilson's wife, by our government, was unprecedented, \n     unnecessary, harmful and dangerous.\n\n  Yes, the leaking of Valerie Plame's name weakened our country, made \nus less secure, more vulnerable to future attacks.\n  Almost 4 years ago, when President Bush was running for election, he \nwent around the country raising his right hand, saying I swear to \nrestore honesty and integrity to the White House.\n  It is time for Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney to raise their right hands \nagain and to take an oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and \nnothing but the truth regarding the Valerie Plame incident and what \nthey know and what they have done to find out who exposed her name.\n  We had an example of this a few years ago when a President of the \nUnited States was put under oath and was filmed. We sat in the Senate \nand we looked at that film on video monitors during the impeachment of \nformer President Bill Clinton. Regardless of how you felt about the \nimpeachment, whether you thought it was good\n\n[[Page S8500]]\n\nor bad or what, the fact that the President of the United States was \nput under oath sent a clear message to the people of this country. No \nPresident is above the law, neither then nor now. It is time for this \nPresident and this Vice President to be put under oath. What happened 1 \nyear and 7 days ago is unconscionable, unprecedented, harmful, \ndangerous to the security of our country.\n\n  The President of the United States could have solved this in 24 hours \nby calling in every one of his top senior officials, have them sign a \npiece of paper, have them swear under oath that they did not do this \nand had nothing to do with this. We could have solved it in 24 hours, \nbut the President of the United States dismissed this. He sort of pooh-\npoohed the whole thing, smiled about it, and said, I don't think we \nwill catch whoever did this.\n  Where is the sense of outrage by this President and Vice President \nthat two senior officials would so brazenly, with such calculation, \nexpose the cover, expose the person in the CIA with assets around the \nworld, giving human intelligence to our CIA which we need so \ndesperately in our war against terrorism.\n  I task the Senate this morning, as I will every day, to call upon the \nPresident and the Vice President and to call upon the special \nprosecutor to put the President and Vice President under oath. If this \nis not resolved, America will become weaker, less secure, and more \nvulnerable. We cannot allow that to happen to this country.\n  The people who exposed Valerie Plame are guilty of violating a law \nand they should be punished to the full extent of that law. That sends \nthe signal to any other administration, be it Democrat or Republican, \nthat this kind of treachery, this kind of violation of our laws, will \nnot be permitted under any administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to direct a question through \nthe Chair to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, who is on the \nfloor.\n  Will the Senator from Illinois comment on the Senate schedule? We \nwasted a week, as the Senator may recall, on class action, where \nnothing was done. Then we spent a week on the marriage amendment when \neveryone knew, before it started, there were not enough votes. And then \nso far this week we spent yesterday on a judge. Nothing happened on \nthat. The rest of the day we spent on a free-trade agreement with \nMorocco, where the actual time on that bill has been less than an hour \nand a half on actual speeches given. Even though there was 20 hours \nallotted, we were willing to yield back our time from early on in that \ndebate. Now we are told we are still not going to go to legislative \nsession, that we are going to work on more judges even though we have \napproved almost a record number of judges.\n  I ask my friend, does the Senator from Illinois think it is important \nwe deal with other issues people in Illinois and Nevada talk to us \nabout, such as doing an appropriations bill for homeland security or \nmoving to something that is important to the people of Nevada, and that \nis maybe consider raising the minimum wage?\n  These are just a couple thoughts that come to the mind of the Senator \nfrom Nevada. Will the Senator from Illinois comment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would say, in response to my colleague \nfrom Nevada, I have had a number of jobs in my lifetime, and we are \nfortunate we are on salary on this job because if our pay depended on \nwhat we did and what we produced, we would not be drawing a paycheck \naround here for weeks at a time. We waste so much time on the floor of \nthe Senate, it is hard to imagine.\n  We spent a whole week on a class action bill that went nowhere. Then \nwe spent a better part of a week on a constitutional amendment on same-\nsex marriage that went nowhere. Now we are about to waste a third week \nin a row.\n  At the same time, I think there are 12 appropriations bills that have \nnot been considered. During this period of time, we had notification \nfrom Secretary Ridge at the Department of Homeland Security and our FBI \nDirector that America was going to face an attack. Most Americans stood \nup and took notice, as they should, and called our offices and said: \nWhat should we do? And we said: Lead your lives. Keep your eyes open.\n  But it is clear what we should do. Take a look at this Calendar. \nRight on the back of our Senate Calendar, the lead items are the \nHomeland Security appropriations bills. These are multibillion-dollar \nbills that will appropriate money to give to State and local \ngovernments as well as Federal agencies to make America safer--sitting \non the Calendar for a month, without even being considered.\n  We will take a break, at the end of this week, for 6 weeks. We will \nbe gone. We will come back, and they will still be sitting on the \nCalendar. God forbid anything happens in America. We are not going to \ndo anything to deal with them.\n  Then you page through this Calendar and find bills waiting for action \ndealing with security at nuclear powerplants, security at ports across \nAmerica, security at chemical plants, security on rail lines. If we \npaid any attention to Secretary Ridge, as we should, and Director \nMueller, we would be meeting today with Senators on the Senate floor \npassing this legislation. Instead, we are killing time. We are doing \nnothing.\n  Now, it is hard to explain why this do-nothing Congress is wasting \ntime when it should be, in fact, doing things to make America safer. I \ndo not understand why the leaders in this Congress cannot pick up the \nvery Calendar they print every day, turn to the back page and read the \ntop line: homeland security. Pretty clear: homeland security. Yet we \nhave not passed this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will direct another question through the \nChair to my friend from Illinois.\n  I am not proud of this, but the State of Nevada is the least insured \nState for medical care in the country. We lead the Nation in uninsured. \nBut there are 44 million people in America who have no health \ninsurance. Even if we did not pass legislation dealing with the \ncalamities facing American families because of no health insurance, \ndon't you think we could talk about it? Don't you think we could bring \nsomething up?\n  For example, I know the Senator from Illinois has worked on this, the \nSenator from North Dakota has been a leader on this, as has been the \nSenator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow: How about making it easy on the \nAmerican people by allowing us to buy the same drugs we pay a fortune \nfor here in America cheaper from the country just north of us, Canada? \nWouldn't that be a good thing to work on?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say, in response to the Senator from \nNevada, he obviously does not understand the world as the folks across \nthe aisle from us see it. They believe that families across America get \nup every morning and want to know whether the latest constitutional \namendment has passed. They think that is what families do--rush to the \ntelevision set, turn it on, and say quickly: Honey, did they pass a \nconstitutional amendment?\n  That is not what I find. What I find at home is that families get \ntogether and say: I hope we can keep our job. I hope, for goodness' \nsake, that next year health insurance doesn't cost as much as it did \nlast year and cover less.\n  That is the reality. That is the reality of life for families across \nAmerica. So you wonder if those of us elected to the Senate really \nrepresent America and are listening to American families and businesses \nand labor unions, who tell us time and time again: The cost of health \ninsurance is killing us. Why don't you do something?\n  Instead, the leadership in the Senate, in this do-nothing Congress, \ncomes forward and says: We are going to blow off 3 days on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate debating a constitutional amendment about same-sex \nmarriage.\n  Well, my wife and I have been married for 37 years. We believe in \ntraditional marriage. But, for goodness' sake, why do you need to amend \nthe\n\n[[Page S8501]]\n\nConstitution--in a Presidential election year, I might add--instead of \ntalking about the cost of health insurance and making it more \naffordable and more accessible for people across America? That is a \nreal issue, and it is an issue that has been really avoided by the \nleadership in this Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I direct another question to my \ndistinguished friend.\n  About 6 weeks ago, I asked all 17 superintendents of school districts \nin Nevada to meet with me. We have 17 counties in Nevada. Each county \nhas a superintendent of schools. The largest school district has about \n300,000 students; the smallest, Esmeralda County, with 88 students. I \ndon't know what their political affiliation is, but I will bet a lot \nmore are Republicans.\n  We met for a couple hours. They were all asked the question: How is \nthe Leave No Child Behind Act treating you in your school district? \nWithout exception, every one of the superintendents said: The Leave No \nChild Behind Act is leaving children of Nevada behind, without \nexception. They said: Please change this. Give us some resources.\n  I say to my friend, education is important in Nevada. The Leave No \nChild Behind Act has been a disaster for Nevada. Shouldn't we be \nspending some time talking about education in the U.S. Senate rather \nthan class action, marriage, and a few judges. We have approved more \nthan 100. They want to defer attention away from the real issues of \nthis country, so we are spending days of our existence on the Senate \nfloor talking about judges. Shouldn't we be dealing with education?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Nevada. In \nresponse, I would say, the reason why the Senate does not talk about \neducation is because the President's education bill, No Child Left \nBehind, has been underfunded by $20 billion. We put Federal mandates on \nschool districts that cost them enormous sums of money, which changed \nthe way teachers teach in a classroom.\n  This administration--the President and his followers in Congress--has \nrefused to send the money to help kids who are not scoring well on \ntests, kids who need someone to sit next to them and help them read, \nsomeone to help them understand basic math, someone to be there after \nschool to sit down and work with them on their homework, someone to be \nwith them in the summer months so they can do something and not lose \nall the knowledge they gained in the previous school year.\n  It takes people--dedicated men and women--who are teachers. It takes \nmoney. This administration says the money should go for tax cuts for \nwealthy people; it should not go for education. We should continue to \nspend $1.5 billion a week in Iraq, with no end in sight. That is why we \ndon't talk about education.\n  This administration will not budget the money to pay for the Federal \nmandates the President included in No Child Left Behind. Ask any school \ndistrict--in Nevada, Illinois, across America--what do you think of No \nChild Left Behind? We like accountability, but where is the promised \nmoney the President said would come to the school district to help us \nimprove test scores? It is not there. That is why this do-nothing \nCongress avoids the issue of education, like the issue of helping \nfamilies and businesses pay for health insurance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe our time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, it is interesting to listen to my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle this morning talk about any \nnumber of issues, in particular what we have been doing over the last \nseveral weeks--really the last several months--relative to the \nlegislative agenda in the Senate. This is the only legislative body, I \nam sure, anywhere in the world that, because it is the most \ndeliberative body in the world, allows the minority to in effect set \nthe agenda because they have the ability to stop any legislation or \ndebate or control the debate on any legislation unless the majority can \nobtain 60 votes to bring the debate to an end.\n  Here we have folks standing up this morning being critical of the \nleadership on this side of the aisle for not moving forward with a \nlegislative agenda when, for the first time in the history of our great \ncountry, certainly the first time in the history of this great \ndeliberative body, we have the folks on the other side of the aisle \nfilibustering circuit court judge nominees of the President of the \nUnited States. That has never happened before.\n  There is one simple reason it is happening now. That is, in spite of \nthis body approving hundreds of more liberal-leaning judges during the \n8 years of the previous administration, the Democrats in the Senate \nrefuse to allow more conservative judges to be appointed and confirmed \nby this President. We had another yesterday relative to another judge \nthat is now being filibustered. That takes time.\n  In addition, the folks on the other side of the aisle are doing \nsomething I have never heard of in my 10 years of service on Capitol \nHill; that is, they are demanding that before we go to conference on \nany bill, the end result of that conference be deemed to be so-and-so, \nwhich is to their way of liking, before they will agree to appoint \nconferees. That is not the way the legislative process works. The \nAmerican people select the majority party in the Senate and the House \nto pass legislation. The majority should control, but, unfortunately, \nit does not.\n\n  Lastly, I am a big supporter of the No Child Left Behind program. I \nam a huge supporter of public education. It is the foundation of the \nfuture of America. I am happy to be the husband of a 30-year former \nschoolteacher. My daughter starts next week teaching in the public \nschools in my home county. My mother was a public school teacher. My \nbrother is a public school teacher. I am a huge fan.\n  In spite of what I have just heard, I have yet to meet a teacher \nanywhere in America who doesn't say: I love the idea of providing \naccountability to the American people for the quality of education that \nI am providing to the children I teach. That is the basic concept of No \nChild Left Behind.\n  Sure, we have had problems with No Child Left Behind. Every major \nreform is going to have bumps in the road. I did four hearings in my \nState, invited every single school superintendent in all 159 counties, \nplus the city schools in my State to get together to bring their \nadministrative personnel, but primarily bring me your teachers. I \nwanted to hear from them what complaints they had. They had serious \ncomplaints that were discussed with representatives of the U.S. \nDepartment of Education and the Georgia Department of Education. We \nresolved--we didn't resolve all of them, but we went to work and we got \ntheir complaints answered. We made changes in the regulations. All I \nheard this morning is: Well, No Child Left Behind doesn't work. \nEverybody is upset.\n  Everybody is not upset with it. I assure my colleagues, there has \nbeen no legislation coming forward from the other side of the aisle to \ntry to correct it. It is simply a political year. It is unbelievable \nwhat we hear on the floor of the Senate these days. That is not what I \ngot up here to talk about this morning, but I couldn't listen to that \nand not comment on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8501-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8501-S8503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

He didn't tell \nthe truth, and that is explicitly set forth in the Senate intelligence \nreport. It was also set forth in the report issued by Mr. Butler in \nBritain last week.\n  On the 7th of July, Chairman Roberts and Vice Chairman Rockefeller of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee released a report on the U.S. \nintelligence community's prewar intelligence assessments on Iraq \nprepared by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. This 511-page \nreport is highly critical of our intelligence analysis and collection \ncapabilities, especially in the field of human intelligence or what we \nrefer to as HUMINT.\n  Yesterday, the Senate Intelligence Committee began the first of a \nseries of\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\nhearings on intelligence reform. We heard from our colleague Senator \nFeinstein about her proposal to create a new position of director of \nnational intelligence to oversee the entire intelligence community. We \nalso heard from three prominent experts--former Deputy Secretary of \nDefense John Hamre; former Director of Central Intelligence, Jim \nWoolsey; and Lieutenant General Odom, former Director of the National \nSecurity Agency--on how best to structure the intelligence community to \nmeet the needs of the threats we face today and will face tomorrow.\n  This was a very interesting hearing. Senator Feinstein does her \nhomework. She studied this issue. She presented a very insightful \npresentation regarding her bill. I look forward to continuing this \ndebate and continuing to review the process, looking both at what we \nhave in place today as well as what reforms we should make relative to \nthe intelligence community.\n  Tomorrow, we expect the 9/11 Commission to release its report on \nevents leading up to the attack of September 11. There is no doubt that \nthe intelligence community will also come under heavy criticism in that \nreport.\n  These various reports and hearings are getting wide coverage in the \nmedia. I am glad they are. It is important for our debate on reforming \nthe intelligence community to be as inclusive as possible. Intelligence \nreform is a bipartisan issue. The problems we have uncovered span more \nthan a decade, under both Republican and Democratic administrations and \nRepublican- and Democratic-controlled Congresses. The fact is, the \nsystemic changes and reforms in the intelligence community, which would \nhave made it more difficult for terrorists to strike us on 9/11 or to \nhave more accurate information on Iraq's WMD capabilities, simply did \nnot take place.\n  As more and more information gets into the public domain, especially \nin this highly charged political year, there will surely be attempts to \npoliticize the complex issues of intelligence failures and intelligence \nreform. What I would like to do is to put some clarity on this for the \nAmerican people.\n  First, there is only one principle to follow on intelligence reform. \nIntelligence is our first line of defense against terrorism, and we \nmust improve the collection capabilities and analysis of intelligence \nto protect the security of the United States and its allies.\n  We should beware of anyone who tries to twist this principle in a \npolitical fashion. The truth is our country, our people, our liberties, \nand our way of life are under attack by radical Islamic terrorists who \nkill and destroy in the name of religion.\n  The security of the United States, which is so dependent on having \naccurate and timely intelligence, is not a Republican or a Democratic \nissue. It is a responsibility of all of us in the Congress to make sure \nwe legislate and appropriate moneys so we have the best possible \nintelligence community.\n  Second, let's be clear about our tasks ahead. We are talking about \namending the National Security Act of 1947, which has been the \ncornerstone of our security and intelligence structure for over half a \ncentury. While change is needed, it should be deliberate. It should \nalso be substantive, even radical, if necessary.\n  The first comprehensive report detailing critical shortfalls within \nthe United States intelligence community's performance was conducted by \nthe House Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security. As the \nchairman of that subcommittee, I released its report on July 17, 2002. \nFollowing this, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the \nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence conducted a joint \ninquiry into the intelligence community's activities before and after \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and issued its report in \nDecember 2002.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee report released on July 7 reflects \nmy deep concern that a number of issues identified both by the \nSubcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security and the joint inquiry \nhave not yet been acted upon. For example, the subcommittee identified \nthat information sharing among intelligence agencies was abysmal, and \nthe joint inquiry report pointed out the CIA was too heavily reliant on \nforeign liaison reporting and that it had not taken the steps necessary \nto penetrate hard targets, such as the inner circle of al-Qaida. These \nissues have not yet been corrected to my satisfaction.\n  Third, as we address the question of how to reform the intelligence \ncommunity, including the possible creation of a director for national \nintelligence, there are five important objectives for us to focus on.\n  First, coordination and information sharing throughout the \nintelligence community must be improved.\n  Second, HUMINT capabilities must be increased, and we must be willing \nto accept the risks associated with aggressive HUMINT operations. And \nthat is a critical part of this. We must be willing to accept some of \nthe risks that are going to be necessary to secure the type and quality \nof information on the intelligence side that we need.\n  Third, analytical competition needs to be preserved.\n  Fourth, our counterintelligence capabilities need improvement.\n  And fifth, the role and scope of the military's position in the \nintelligence community should be reviewed.\n  I included this last point because I want to ensure that the \nmilitary's capability to support the intelligence requirements of our \nunified combatant commanders is maintained in any reformation of the \nintelligence community. That is absolutely critical. All one had to do \nwas listen to our panel yesterday to understand the real importance of \nthat point.\n  The scope of the military's direct involvement in intelligence is \nenormous and it needs to have a proper role in the intelligence \ncommunity. Eight of the fifteen members of the intelligence community \nbelong to the Department of Defense. In the current structure, each one \nof these DOD elements acts more or less independently, representing one \nsmall segment of the overall intelligence interests of our military. \nThe creation of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence has \nhelped somewhat to bring a common intelligence policy to DOD, but we \nshould also consider the creation of a single DOD intelligence command \nas part of any extensive and meaningful intelligence reform.\n  The Congress directed the establishment of the Unified Combatant \nCommand for Special Operations, or what is known as SOCOM, over the \nobjections of the Department of Defense because our colleagues had the \nvision to foresee the requirement. At the time, the DOD and Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff objected, but in hindsight, the creation of \nSOCOM was the correct path. The rationale for establishing a Unified \nCombatant Command for Intelligence, or INTCOM, is very much the same, \nand I believe now is the proper time to explore this idea.\n  As we found in our review on the intelligence on Iraq, the \nintelligence community is made up of hard-working, dedicated men and \nwomen, and Chairman Roberts, in his statement, referred to giving them \nan intelligence community worthy of their efforts. So I welcome the \nproposal of Senator Feinstein for establishing a Director of National \nIntelligence as one of the several ideas and issues for us to address \nand debate.\n\n  One final point. As President Bush has said many times, he is \ndetermined to make sure American intelligence is as accurate as \npossible for every challenge we face. America's enemies are secretive, \nthey are ruthless, and they are resourceful. That is why the President \nsupports intelligence reform as much as we do in the Congress.\n  In the coming months, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nwill solicit a broad range of views on reforming the intelligence \ncommunity, and we will vigorously debate each intelligence reform \nmeasure that comes before us. I look forward to this challenge, and I \nwill do everything in my power to ensure that the United States has the \nintelligence collection and analytical capabilities necessary to \nprotect our lives, our property, our way of life, and our liberties.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Georgia for his \nvery thoughtful and incisive comments. I believe he is a great addition \nto the Senate with his experience working on\n\n[[Page S8503]]\n\nintelligence issues in the House. On the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nhe makes great contributions. I appreciate and second what he has said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8503-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8503-S8505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE REPORT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is interesting today that some of our \ncolleagues are on the floor talking about the wonderful expose \nAmbassador Joe Wilson made. Joe Wilson and his wife have become quite a \ncause celebre. He has had 30 appearances, he is writing books and, oh, \nyes, now he is on the Web site of Senator Kerry. The Web site is \nironically entitled ``RestoreHonesty.com.''\n  On that Web site, Mr. Wilson said:\n\n     . . . this President misled the nation in his State of the \n     Union Address.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       They tried to intimidate me and others who were willing to \n     speak up and tell the truth. . . . I was courageous to speak \n     truth to the power of the Bush White House. . . .\n       George Bush's Administration has betrayed our trust--I know \n     that personally.\n\n  That is quite an indictment. It goes along with quite a few other \npoints.\n  I understand on the first page of his book--I did not buy it and I do \nnot intend to. I was told that three times on page 7 he said President \nBush lied. Why did he do that? It was all because of 16 words in the \nState of the Union Address on January 28, 2003.\n  I addressed this issue last week in this body, and I think I raised \nsome very serious questions about the veracity of Ambassador Wilson's \nsuggestions. I was given the opportunity last night on the Jim Lehrer \nPBS ``NewsHour'' to have a discussion with Mr. Wilson. Margaret Warner \nwas the interviewer. Unlike many of the other sound-bite discussions on \nTV these days, we had a full 10 minutes. It was a very interesting \ndiscussion because I had the opportunity to make my points, and Mr. \nWilson made his points. I commend PBS for giving us the opportunity.\n  What I cited when the interviewer asked me about my contentions that \nMr. Wilson was not truthful was I noted that the basis of his charge \nand the basis of so much nonsense we have seen disseminated in the \npress and repeated by some of my colleagues on this floor and covered \nin scam political pieces being put out by friends of the Democratic \nnominee that President Bush lied was totally debunked, among other \nthings, by the finding of Lord Butler's commission in the United \nKingdom.\n  He said in paragraph 499 of the report released last week:\n\n       We conclude that on the basis of intelligence estimates at \n     the time covering both Niger and the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo, the statements on Iraqi attempts to buy uranium from \n     Africa in the Government's dossier and by the Prime Minister \n     and the House of Commons were well-founded.\n\n  This is the important point. This is the examination of British \nintelligence:\n\n       By extension, we conclude also that the statement in \n     President Bush's State of the Union Address of January 28, \n     2003, ``The British Government has learned that Saddam \n     Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium \n     from Africa'' was well-founded.\n\n  Mr. President, the British went back and looked at it, and they said \nwhat President Bush said about British intelligence was well-founded. \nHe says:\n\n       The British Government had intelligence from several \n     different sources indicating that this visit was for the \n     purpose of acquiring uranium.\n\n  Now, we get a little bit more of that. Actually, the one piece of \ninformation that Ambassador Joe Wilson brought back from his trip to \nNiger in February-March of 2003--the only useful data he brought back \nwas the fact that the Prime Minister of Niger told him the Iraqi \ndelegation met with him in 1999 to begin discussions to establish \ncommercial contacts. What do you think they wanted to import from \nNiger? Well, there are a couple of choices. Niger's second and third \nlargest exports are mung beans and goats. Niger's largest export--\nthree-quarters--is yellowcake uranium. The Prime Minister reasonably \nconcluded that they were probably seeking yellowcake uranium. There is \nno evidence they actually purchased it. It was not conclusive. There \nwas a forged document about purchases that was not truthful, but that \ndoes not debunk or in any way take away from the fact that President \nBush was correct, and the British intelligence is still correct in \nsaying that Iraq was seeking uranium from Africa.\n  Based on that, and since Ambassador Wilson, who came back finding \nonly that there had been one contact, and that contact, according to \nmost analysts, suggested there was even more of a basis for the \nconclusion in the State of the Union Address--he came back and debunked \nthe whole thing, made it a lie.\n  The conclusion, unanimously reached in the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, after over a year of investigation, 15,000 documents \nreviewed, over 200 interviews, signed on by all members of the \ncommittee, including Senator John Edwards, says in conclusion 12:\n\n       It was reasonable for analysts to assess that Iraq may have \n     been seeking uranium from Africa based upon Central \n     Intelligence Agency reporting and other available \n     intelligence.\n\n  Conclusion 13 says:\n\n       The report on the former ambassador's trip to Niger, \n     disseminated in March 2002, did not change any analyst's \n     assessment of the Iraq-Niger uranium deal. For most analysts, \n     the information in the report lent more credibility to the \n     original Central Intelligence Agency reports on the uranium \n     deal.\n\n  You talk about thoroughly debunking the debunker. Our staff asked Mr. \nWilson how he knew some of the things he was stating publicly with such \nconfidence. On at least two occasions, he admitted he had no direct \nknowledge to support some of his claims, and he was either drawing on \nunrelated past experience or no information at all. For example, when \nthey asked him specifically how he knew the intelligence community had \nrejected the possibility of a Niger uranium deal, or even exploration \nfor a deal, as he wrote in his book, he told the committee his \nassertion may have involved a ``little literary flare.''\n\n  That is a heck of a thing to call a whopping lie, a ``little literary \nflare.'' Back home, we call that a fraud and a hoax. Now, I suggest to \nMr. Wilson once again that he owes a public apology to the President \nand the Vice President. By the way, he said he knew the Vice President \nknew of his report. The Vice President did not get his report. There is \nno evidence of that. If he had, it would have been with the analysts' \nconclusion that his report probably made it more likely and not less \nlikely that Iraq was seeking uranium from Niger. Anyhow, he stood by \nit.\n  I tell you, the whole premise of this smear campaign that was started \nby Ambassador Wilson to call the President a liar has been totally \ndebunked by the British intelligence report, by Lord Butler, and by our \nown Senate Intelligence Committee's unanimous report.\n  By the way, we have been hearing a lot--and I understand we are going \nto hear a lot more--about Ambassador Wilson's wife. Let me deal with \nthat. In our report, we found good evidence that she had actually made \nrecommendations to the CIA to send her husband to Niger. On page 39 of \nthe Intelligence Committee report, we state:\n\n       The former Ambassador had traveled previously to Niger on \n     the CIA's behalf. The former ambassador was selected for the \n     1999 trip after his wife mentioned to her supervisors that \n     her husband was planning a business trip to Niger in the near \n     future and might be willing to use his contacts in the \n     region.\n\n  Also, on page 39:\n\n       . . . interviews and documents provided to the Committee \n     indicate that his wife, a CPD employee, suggested his name \n     for the trip. The CPD {} reports officer told Committee staff \n     that . . . . On February 19, 2002, CPD hosted a meeting with \n     [Mr. Wilson], intelligence analysts from both the CIA and \n     INR, and several individuals from the DO's Africa and CPD \n     divisions. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the \n     merits of [sending the Ambassador]. . . . The INR analyst's \n     notes indicate that the meeting was apparently convened by \n     the former ambassador's wife, who had the idea to dispatch \n     him to use his contacts to sort out the Iraq-Niger uranium \n     issue. She left after she set it up, but she managed to get \n     the job done.\n\n  But we didn't stop there. Even though Mr. Wilson had angrily denied \nand used barnyard expletives in Time magazine to say that his wife had \nnothing to do with the trip to Africa, and Joshua Marshall quoted him \nsaying that it defies logic that his wife sent him, the most compelling \nanswers of all that his wife gave to our staff when interviewed in \nJanuary 2004, 6 months after the Wilson hoax began, and the\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n\nmonths and months of charges and Joe Wilson's fierce denials that his \nwife had anything to do with his selection--let me repeat. Ambassador \nWilson angrily said his wife had nothing to do with his trip to Africa.\n\n       That is bull [expletive]. That is absolutely not the case.\n\n  That is what Wilson told Time magazine on July 17, 2003.\n  So he had denied it. What did she say? Did she deny it? Six months \nafter she heard her husband angrily denying it and knowing what he had \nbeen saying for months and what he wrote in his book, I had staff go \nback and see what she said when asked about this issue. Her quote was:\n\n       I honestly do not recall if I suggested it to my boss. . . \n     .\n\n  That is what she said. That is from the transcript. Frankly, I think \nthat is very telling. She doesn't recall if she suggested it to her \nboss after 6 months, and her husband has been out there saying she had \nnothing to do with it. Are you kidding? Just who is the Ambassador's \nsource for all of his denials? Yet 6 months later she cannot remember \nif she suggested it to her boss?\n  I know the occupant of the chair has interviewed some witnesses and \ntried some cases. When you get a person who has knowledge that is right \non point, and it is an issue that has been the focus of great \ndiscussion for months and you ask them, Did you, in fact, say what the \nother witnesses said, you can do two things: Say, absolutely not, I \ndidn't say it. But if that is not true, you have all these other \nwitnesses who said you did. So what do you say? You say: I honestly do \nnot recall.\n  I think that leaves us pretty clearly in the camp of saying that what \nthe analysts and others said the February 12 memo she prepared means, \nand that is that she was the one who proposed sending her husband to \nIraq.\n  Joe Wilson said that the CIA said to a couple of reporters who asked \nabout that--and this is from last night--that she did not recommend her \nhusband to undertake the Niger assignment. He stated that the officers \nwho did ask him to check the uranium story were aware of who he was \nmarried to, which is not surprising; she did not recommend her husband.\n  Well, Ambassador Wilson may have found some people who were willing \nto say that, but we sent this whole report to the CIA. They fact-\nchecked the whole thing. We even set out the facts that she recommended \nsending her husband. The CIA commented on almost everything that we had \nin the report. It was a lengthy report. It took them a long time. Not \none comment, not one change, in the findings in our report that she was \nthe one who recommended him to go.\n  That has been discussed at great length on the floor by people who \nare charging that somehow there was a criminal conspiracy to ``out'' \nAmbassador Wilson's wife in retaliation.\n  I believe the Wall Street Journal has been doing a very interesting \nanalysis of this, and I ask unanimous consent that yesterday's Wall \nStreet Journal article ``Mr. Wilson's Defense,'' be printed in the \nRecord after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. In fact, it was such a traumatic experience to have Mr. \nWilson's wife identified that I saw their pictures in the paper. They \nposed for Vanity Fair in front of the White House. It must have been a \ncrushing blow to them to have her identity publicly disclosed. So they \nhad to get on the cover and make 30 appearances? And I trust his book \nsales are going well. Maybe he will even have a movie contract.\n  Anybody who reads the Kerry Web site, listens to his interviews, or \ngoes to a movie should know that his whole thesis is a fraud and a \nhoax.\n  Regrettably, that is merely a continuation of a plan that we have \nseen implemented by opponents of President Bush and Vice President \nCheney.\n  I joined the Intelligence Committee in January of 2003 because I \nrealized that intelligence is absolutely critical in the war on \nterrorism. We cannot stop terrorism by retaliating against suicide \nbombers. We cannot prosecute them. We cannot find enough to identify \nthem, much less prosecute them. So I joined the Intelligence Committee.\n  Clearly, we used to have a history that politics stops at the water's \nedge. Well, I understood that politics stopped at the entrance to the \nIntelligence Committee, but it has not been that way.\n  There are those in the Intelligence Committee on the other side who \nwant to use the Intelligence Committee as a vehicle not to improve our \nintelligence, not to find out what the weaknesses are and how to build \na stronger case, but to attack the President. That is what this \nNovember 2003 minority staff memo says: Here are our options under the \nrules and we have identified the best approach. Our plan is as follows: \nOne, pull the majority along as far as we can on issues that may lead \nto major new disclosures regarding improper or questionable conduct by \nthe administration. And they certainly they have done it.\n\n  Two, essentially prepare Democratic additional views to attach to any \ninterim or final reports, and we intend to take full advantage of it. \nThey have done that, and either today or tomorrow I will discuss the \npoliticization in those views.\n  They also go on to say: We will identify the most exaggerated claims \nand contrast them with the intelligence estimates that have since been \ndeclassified.\n  Well, tough luck, guys. There were no exaggerated claims, nothing to \ncontrast with the intelligence estimates. In fact, the big claim that \nthey make that the administration was pressuring analysts to change \ntheir conclusion has been debunked. It has been debunked thoroughly and \nrepeatedly throughout, and I have described this on the floor numerous \ntimes.\n  The conclusions are there was no pressure to change conclusions on \nweapons of mass destruction or on terrorism. We found in the \nconclusions that the Vice President's visits and questions to CIA were \nnot only not pressuring to change the views but were expected.\n  One of the problems we find is that there is not enough questioning \nby policy users. By the way, one of the things they are attacking and \none of the things that some of my colleagues have attacked is the \noffice of Doug Feith, special policy--a two- or three-man operation--\nhad a Defense Intelligence Agency analyst working with him. They \nreviewed for the Department of Defense the Secretary of Defense, the \nintelligence estimates they had, and they questioned them. That is what \nthey should have done.\n  Somehow this office is being called unlawful by one of my colleagues. \nHow bizarre. That is so far beyond the pale it is bizarre to say it is \nunlawful for a DIA agent working for the Secretary of Defense to \nquestion the CIA. Come on, gang. We need the CIA and the DIA to \ninteract, get rid of group think, challenge those assessments.\n  Unfortunately, this attack on Doug Feith in the Office of Special \nProjects has heavy overtones of anti-Semitism. We can see the charges. \nThey talk about the ``neocons'' who are warping our intelligence. \nUnfortunately, that is their code word for Jewish public servants, and \nI believe that is an unacceptable way to go about challenging policy. \nIt is not a fruitful endeavor.\n  Going back to the political memo of 2003, as I said, they wanted to \ncontrast the views. They also said:\n\n       Once we identify solid leads the majority does not want to \n     pursue, we could attract more coverage and have greater \n     credibility in that contact than one in which we simply \n     launch an independent investigation based on principled but \n     vague notions regarding the ``use'' of intelligence.\n\n  Well, they are doing that because they are saying they want to go \nback and investigate Doug Feith's office. They had no findings of \nanything that Mr. Feith did was illegal, unlawful, or unwarranted \npressure, but they are choosing to attack him because he represents the \n``neocons.'' I think my colleagues get what I mean.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       In the meantime, even without a specifically authorized \n     independent investigation, we continue to act independently \n     when we encounter foot-dragging on the part of the majority.\n\n  They say, in summary, that intelligence issues are clearly secondary \nto the public's concern regarding the insurgency in Iraq. Yet we have \nan important role to play in revealing the misleading, if not \nflagrantly dishonest, methods and motives of the senior administration \nofficials who made the\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\ncase for a unilateral preemptive war. The approach outlined above seems \nto offer the best prospect for exposing the administration's dubious \nmotives and methods.\n  That was the game plan that some of my colleagues took into this \ninvestigation of pre-Iraq war intelligence. That is deeply \ndisappointing--disgusting, I would say--to say this is the game plan \nbeing played out on the floor to politicize intelligence.\n\n  Their conclusions about ``misleading,'' about ``pressure,'' \nunfortunately, are not supported by the facts. There was exhaustive \nexamination and interviews. Chairman Roberts invited in anybody who \nclaimed to know about improper pressure on the analysts and nobody \ncould come forward with anything. Nobody could come forward with any. \nNo wrongdoing by Doug Feith, but they are still going at it.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not troubled by an \nabsence of fact. They have a political jihad. They have their crusade. \nThey have sold, to too many people, the base canard that President Bush \nand Vice President Cheney were not telling the truth when, in fact, the \nwhole basis of that charge was a fraud and a hoax.\n  As my colleague from Georgia said, we need to improve the \nintelligence operations. We have a lot of work to do. But we also have \nsome work to do in the Congress, and that is to get over attempting to \nuse the Intelligence Committee and the intelligence community as a \npolitical weapon to attack our opponents.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 20, 2004]\n\n                          Mr. Wilson's Defense\n\n       After U.S. and British intelligence reports exposed his \n     falsehoods in the last 10 days, Joe Wilson is finally \n     defending himself. We're therefore glad to return to this \n     story one more time, because there are some larger lessons \n     here about the law, and for the Beltway media and Bush White \n     House.\n       Mr. Wilson's defense, in essence, is that the ``Republican-\n     written'' Senate Intelligence Committee report is a partisan \n     hatchet job. We could forgive people for being taken in by \n     this, considering the way the Committee's ranking Democrat, \n     Jay Rockefeller, has been spinning it over the past week. But \n     the fact is that the three most damning conclusions are \n     contained not in Chairman Pat Roberts's ``Additional Views,'' \n     but in the main body of the report approved by Mr. \n     Rockefeller and seven other Democrats.\n       Number one: The winner of last year's Award for Truth \n     Telling from the Nation magazine foundation didn't tell the \n     truth when he wrote that his wife, CIA officer Valerie Plame, \n     ``had nothing to do with'' his selection for the Niger \n     mission. Mr. Wilson is now pretending there is some kind of \n     important distinction between whether she ``recommended'' or \n     ``proposed'' him for the trip.\n       Mr. Wilson had been denying any involvement at all on Ms. \n     Plame's part, in order to suggest that her identity was \n     disclosed by a still-unknown Administration official out of \n     pure malice. If instead an Administration official cited \n     nepotism truthfully in order to explain the oddity of Mr. \n     Wilson's selection for the Niger mission, then there was no \n     underlying crime. Motive is crucial under the controlling \n     statute.\n       The 1982 Intelligence Identities Protection Act was written \n     in the wake of the Philip Agee scandal to protect the CIA \n     from deliberate subversion, not to protect the identities of \n     agents and their spouses who choose to enter into a national \n     political debate. In short, the entire leak probe now looks \n     like a familiar Beltway case of criminalizing political \n     differences. Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald should \n     fold up his tent.\n       Number two: Joe Wilson didn't tell the truth about how he \n     supposedly came to realize that it was ``highly doubtful'' \n     there was anything to the story he'd been sent to Niger to \n     investigate. He told everyone that he'd recognized as obvious \n     forgeries the documents purporting to show an Iraq-Niger \n     uranium deal. But the forged documents to which he referred \n     didn't reach U.S. intelligence until eight months after his \n     trip. Mr. Wilson has said that he ``misspoke''--multiple \n     times, apparently--on this issue.\n       Number three: Joe Wilson was also not telling the truth \n     when he said that his final report to the CIA had \n     ``debunked'' the Niger story. The Senate Intelligence \n     report--again, the bipartisan portion of it--says Mr. \n     Wilson's debrief was interpreted as providing ``some \n     confirmation of foreign government service reporting'' that \n     Iraq had sought uranium in Niger. That's because Niger's \n     former Prime Minister had told Mr. Wilson he interpreted a \n     1999 visit from an Iraqi trade delegation as showing an \n     interest in uranium.\n       This is a remarkable record of falsehood. We'll let our \n     readers judge if they think Mr. Wilson was deliberately \n     wrong, and therefore can be said to have ``lied.'' We \n     certainly know what critics would say if President Bush had \n     been caught saying such things. But in any event, we'd think \n     that the news outlets that broadcast Mr. Wilson's story over \n     the past year would want to retrace their own missteps.\n       Mr. Wilson made three separate appearances on NBC's ``Meet \n     the Press,'' according to the Weekly Standard. New York Times \n     columnist Nick Kristof first brought the still anonymous \n     Niger envoy to public attention in May 2003, so he too must \n     feel burned by his source. Alone among major sellers of the \n     Wilson story, the Washington Post has done an admirable job \n     so far of correcting the record.\n       Also remarkable is that the views of former CIA employee \n     Larry Johnson continue to be cited anywhere on this and \n     related issues. Mr. Johnson was certain last October that the \n     disclosure of Ms. Plame's identity was a purely ``political \n     attack,'' now disproven. He is also a friend of Ms. Plame and \n     the author of a summer 2001 op-ed titled ``The Declining \n     Terrorist Threat.'' You'd think reporters would at least \n     quote him with a political warning label.\n       The final canard advanced by Mr. Wilson's defenders is that \n     our own recent editorials and other criticism was somehow \n     ``orchestrated.'' Well, by whom? Certainly not by the same \n     White House that has been all too silent about this entire \n     episode, in large part because it prematurely apologized last \n     year for the ``16 words'' in a State of the Union address \n     that have now been declared ``well-founded'' by Lord Butler's \n     inquiry in Britain. If Mr. Bush ends up losing the election \n     over Iraq, it won't be because he oversold the case for war \n     but because he's sometimes appeared to have lost confidence \n     in the cause.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, of course we all have spent a good deal of \ntime concerned about the direction we are taking here, the number of \nthings we are accomplishing, the fact that many of the things we would \nlike to do have not been accomplished. I think that is a legitimate \nconcern. We ought to try to deal with some of those issues.\n  On the other hand, there have been a number of things done, of \ncourse. I think we have had the most obstruction in the movement here \nthat we have seen in many years. Many important issues have been \nstopped, have been obstructed, frankly, because our friends on the \nother side of the aisle did not want to go forward with these issues, \nor wanted to hold them up where they could add all kinds of unrelated \namendments to them.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act, of course, was blocked. The fairness \nin asbestos injury resolution was blocked. The Patients First Act, the \nenergy policy--probably one of the most important issues we could have \ndealt with this entire year is still there. Charity aid, recovery, and \nempowerment legislation, which gave strength to do things in the \nprivate sector, we were unable to do that; Personal Responsibility, \nWork, and Family Promotion Act; workforce investment; five judges were \nheld up simply for the purpose of holding them up.\n  It is too bad. It is something we need to change. We ought to be \nconcerned here with issues, not politics, not Kerry, not Bush, but talk \nabout what the issues are here and the things we ought to be doing. \nPolitics, of course, is part of our lives, but so is accomplishing \nsomething in the legislature.\n  We have done some things. The Omnibus appropriations bill for this \nfiscal year was passed this year. It was delayed but nevertheless \npassed. The Pension Stability Act had to do with changing the \nrequirements for putting money into pensions. That made that better. \nThe accountability, flexibility and efficiency--the transportation \nbill--again, one of the most important bills we could possibly pass, we \npassed it in the Senate but, unfortunately, it is still hung up in \nconference. The Internet bill which allows for the moratorium of \ntaxation on the Internet, a good thing, was passed by the Senate.\n  The Jumpstart Our Business Strength Act, of course, is one that is \npending and ready to go, I hope, to the conference committee. This is \nthe one that the WTO had the penalties on exports from the United \nStates and we had a 3-percent reduction for those that exported goods \nand that gave us a penalty. Now we are changing that. There is also a \ngreat deal in that bill with regard to encouraging the economy to grow.\n  So we have done a number of things. We have done some things to \nreduce\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\nthe redtape and the consumer initiative, taxpayer protection, and IRS \naccountability that strengthens the protection the taxpayers have in \nterms of what information is made public on their taxes.\n  Strengthening and improving health care; we did the project \nbioshield. These things have passed the Senate but have not been \ncompleted yet largely because we have not been able to go to conference \non many of them.\n  Here again we find obstacles in our way this year that we have never \nseen before. I guess it means we need to take a little look at our \nsystem.\n  Keeping Americans safe at home--of course, we passed the unborn \nvictims of violence bill that amends the Federal law regarding women \nwho are assaulted, and an unborn child is killed, to allow the \nassailant to be charged.\n  Flood insurance reform is very important. It amends the Flood Act to \nencourage damage mitigation. Homeland security has been something, of \ncourse, we have passed.\n  Regarding crime, we have done a lot of things, even though we could \ndo a great deal more, I am sure.\n  Educational initiatives--the NASA Workforce Flexibility Act offers \nscholarships, incentives, for highly qualified students to move \nforward.\n  IDEA reauthorization, the Individuals with Disabilities Act, is one \nthat is very important to be reauthorized and moved through. It was \npassed by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for 5 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The point is, we have a problem with the process here. \nObstruction is available. I don't think that is what is intended.\n  At the same time, we have accomplished a good many things that \ncertainly are important and that we need to recognize.\n  I want to mention something that I believe is important, and that is \ntaking a little look and having a way to have some measurement of the \nkinds of things that are brought up that are legitimately \ncongressional--Federal kinds of issues.\n  I understand everyone has issues they would like to bring up. \nFrankly, some of them are inappropriate to be here on the Federal \nlevel. We continue to have more spending; we have more government; we \nhave more involvement in people's lives. One of the reasons is we have \nnot set up some criteria to say this is a good idea, but is it the \nthing that ought to be done in the Federal Government as opposed to \nState government or city government or county government?\n  Tom Feeney, from Florida, one of the House Members, put out an \ninteresting idea. He has a little card like a credit card. It measures \nthese things against issues.\n  No. 1 is less government: Does the bill tend to reduce government \nregulations, the size of government, eliminate entitlements or \nunnecessary programs? That is one of the tests he has against the \nissue.\n  No. 2 is lower taxes: Does the bill promote individual responsibility \nin spending or reducing taxes? It is a good idea to take a look at \nthat.\n  No. 3 is personal responsibility: Does the bill encourage responsible \nbehavior among individuals and families, and encourage them to take \ncare of their own issues to an extent? Remember, we don't want the \ngovernment in our lives, yet things have to be done. It is a choice: do \nwe do them ourselves?\n  No. 4 is individual freedom: Does the bill offer opportunities for \nindividuals to do those kinds of things?\n  No. 5 is stronger families: Is it something that contributes to the \nfamily function, the family structure in our country, which is \nobviously one of the most important things we have?\n\n  Finally, No. 6, does it add to domestic tranquility and national \ndefense?\n  I think those are interesting concepts, interesting measurements that \none might take--in their own mind, of course. Each person would have a \ndifferent view of how to deal with it but to see if what is before us \nmeets some of these measurements and does these things.\n  First, I think we are going to have to do something about the kind of \nobstructionism we have seen that moves to keep us from doing what we \nneed to do. Second, we need to recognize we have done a number of \nthings and passed them in the Senate. Unfortunately, they are not fully \ndone. Maybe a little unrelated, but important to me, we ought to have \nsome kind of standard we measure in our minds as to whether this is a \nlegitimate thing, necessary thing, appropriate thing to be done at the \nFederal level or indeed should be done other places.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8506-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8506-S8516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     UNITED STATES-MOROCCO FREE-TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, time until 11:30 \np.m. is equally divided for debate on or between the chairman and \nranking member.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, what is the pending matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Morocco-United \nStates free-trade agreement, FTA, and the impact this bilateral free \ntrade agreement will have on agricultural producers in my State of \nSouth Dakota. While I retain concerns on a number of agreements \nnegotiated under Trade Promotion Authority, TPA, as part of fast track \ntrade negotiations navigated by the current administration, I see a \npotential positive impact on the South Dakota economy from a number of \nprovisions in this agreement. I am pleased that the needs of many \nsectors in our agricultural community were accounted for while \nhammering out the terms included in this FTA.\n  I am disappointed at the recent passage of the Australian free-trade \nagreement, AFTA, which seriously weakens our ability to foster growth \nin the agricultural sector. It is concerning that the adoption of the \nAFTA will hinder the retention of our agriculture producers, exacerbate \nsupply, and consequently undermine our Federal price support programs. \nWhen dealing with sensitively priced commodities and a delicate supply \nand demand balance, I believe we must prudently evaluate the economic \nramifications from any proposed trade agreement. I am concerned for the \nrural communities in my home state of South Dakota, and I will continue \nto evaluate trade agreements on a case by case basis to ascertain the \npotential benefits and negative impacts.\n  Despite these concerns, I am pleased to see that the Moroccan free-\ntrade agreement holds promise and provides a number of potentially \nrewarding terms for United States producers and ranchers. The agreement \nencompasses a wide variety of commodities that are important to the \nhealth of the rural economy in South Dakota, including beef, soybeans, \nwheat, corn and sorghum. As in the case of beef, for example, \nincreasing market access under this agreement is imperative for \nensuring our producers and ranchers maintain ample opportunity for \npromoting quality American beef. This opportunity will be facilitated \nby a low in-tariff quota that will promptly be zeroed out.\n  As in the case of soybeans, duties on soybeans used for processing \nwill cease immediately. Duties on soybeans for processed soy products \nand other uses will be reduced by half in the first year, and \neliminated entirely within a 5-year timeframe. Additionally, wheat will \nbenefit from this bilateral FTA. Fluctuating weather conditions present \nproblematic conditions for Moroccan farmers, and as a significant\n\n[[Page S8507]]\n\nwheat importer, a beneficial trading relationship can be established \nfrom increased market access to the Kingdom of Morocco.\n  While I retain reservations about the direction the administration's \nfree trade agenda has taken, I am pleased that a free trade agreement \nhas been proposed that has garnered the support of many American \nagriculture producers, and will facilitate increased market access and \npositive economic impact for our rural communities.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the pending \nmeasure before the Senate, the U.S.-Morocco free-trade agreement. Soon \nthis body will likely pass the implementing legislation and send it to \nthe President for signature and subsequent enactment. Before that takes \nplace, I believe it is important to outline to the people of the \nCommonwealth of Virginia my position on this matter and why I will vote \nin favor of its passage though it is not a perfect agreement.\n  The enactment of free trade agreements have the potential to increase \nthe profitability of U.S. companies, increase U.S. jobs, open new \nmarkets for U.S. products and services and engender stronger \nrelationships with other nations. However, the central tenet of such \nagreements must be fairness, clear benefit to all parties and a \nrelatively equitable number and degree of concessions. Understanding \nthat in any negotiation there must be some give and take, it is \ncounterproductive and damaging for the U.S. to agree to provisions \nwithin these agreements that leave U.S. industries susceptible to \nloopholes that allow a non-party country duty free access to our \nmarket.\n  In the case of the Morocco free-trade agreement I am speaking of the \ntextile provisions. This agreement, while in many ways better than \nprevious free trade agreements, would still allow for non-party \ncountries to export yarn or fabric to Morocco and upon production into \napparel, be imported into the United States duty-free. If our \ngovernment is going to negotiate an agreement with another country and \nmake concessions to secure an equally beneficial arrangement, I cannot \ncomprehend why loopholes would be included to permit a third party to \nbenefit from the agreement without having to meet the requirements or \nmake the concessions of those party to the trade pact.\n  Under a tariff preference level, the Morocco agreement will allow the \nuse of fabric and yarn from a non-party of up to thirty million square \nmeters equivalent. It is difficult to understand why such an exception \nis necessary, given that the total Moroccan trade in fabric and yarn \nwith the U.S. in 2003 was 16.477 million square meters equivalent. I \nhave been in contact with many in the domestic textile industry and \nhave to sincerely agree with them that such a provision appears to be a \nsubstantial loophole that will ultimately allow a country other than \nthe U.S. or Morocco to benefit from the U.S.-Morocco free-trade \nagreement.\n  The U.S. government has an obligation to the American worker to do \naway with the practice of providing exceptions like tariff preference \nlevels. A third-party country that would provide yarn and fabric under \nthese loopholes will have conceded nothing nor offered greater access \nto its market as it benefits from the agreement negotiated between the \nU.S. and Morocco. Make no mistake, concessions like this can adversely \naffect American jobs. Domestic textile production has provided \nAmericans stable, well-paying jobs for generations; however the \nenactment of free trade agreements that allow a party to go outside of \nthe agreement but enjoy duty-free access has contributed to the growing \nnumber of unemployed textile workers in this country.\n  Going forward, I would strongly recommend to those negotiating trade \nagreements on behalf of the American people to visit Southside Virginia \nand gain a first-hand perspective on how the concessions made in trade \npacts can impact not only a few families, but entire communities. We \nmust make sure that when we are opening our markets to other countries \nthrough trade agreements that we do not allow a third party to benefit \nwithout being party to the requirements and concessions of that trade \nagreement.\n  Even with the grave concerns I have with the textile provisions of \nthis agreement, I believe that on balance, it provides a net-plus for \nthe working people of the United States. The reduction in tariffs and \nprotection of intellectual property and trademarks will provide great \nbenefit to hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs and further the global \nmarket share of their enterprises. Additionally, the relatively \nbalanced nature of the U.S.-Morocco free-trade agreement sets a \nvaluable example with the other developing countries around the world.\n  The removal of tariffs on 95 percent of bilateral trade on the day of \nenactment should greatly benefit the majority of U.S. industries and \ntheir employees. Given that Morocco currently places a 20 percent duty \non U.S. exports while the U.S. only assigns a four percent tariff on \nMoroccan exports this agreement makes a strong initial push for free \nand open trade. With strong U.S. industries like information \ntechnology, machinery and construction equipment poised to gain \nimmediate duty-free access to Morocco; the U.S. should see positive \ngains in exports to Morocco in the near future.\n  The domestic farming community will see tariffs on a large number of \nagriculture products cut significantly or eliminated immediately. The \nreduction of tariffs and the implementation of new tariff-rate quotas \non products like beef, poultry and wheat will likely result in a \ntremendous growth in the amount of U.S. agriculture products exported \nto Morocco.\n  The U.S. has had a difficult time convincing its trading partners to \nactively protect intellectual property and fully prosecute those found \nto be pirating or counterfeiting U.S. software, movies and music. I am \npleased the Morocco agreement establishes new protections for \nintellectual property rights and increases penalties for those found to \nengage in the piracy and counterfeiting of U.S. products.\n  Finally, the enactment of the U.S.-Morocco free-trade agreement sends \na powerful message to developing nations around the world. It is a \nclear indication that the U.S. is interested in developing mutually \nbeneficial economic and trade relationships that can result in greater \naccess to the U.S. market and hopefully closer ties with the U.S. \nAgreements like the Morocco trade pact provide a clear example for \nthose countries in Africa and the Middle East willing to make political \nand economic reforms.\n  In closing, I will vote in favor of the U.S.-Morocco free-trade \nagreement because comprehensively, it is beneficial to the U.S. \nbusiness community. The reduction of tariffs and increased access to \nmarkets will improve the profitability of many U.S. companies and \nprovide an example for future agreements with tolerant, reform-minded, \ndeveloping nations. This could have been an outstanding, purely \npositive agreement, rather than a good agreement on balance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the United States has enjoyed a close \nrelationship with Morocco since 1777, when Morocco became the first \nnation to recognize the sovereignty of our fledgling Government. Since \nthen we have stood together through thick and thin, and Morocco today \nremains one of America's dear friends. This free-trade agreement, FTA, \nwill further strengthen the bond between our two nations, and \nillustrates the benefits of greater economic ties with countries in the \ngreater Middle East.\n  Initially, the decision to begin negotiations with Morocco was \ncontroversial. But Morocco's economic liberalization and political \nreform efforts, combined with its role as a stabilizing force in the \nregion, made the decision a simple one.\n  The trade negotiations produced an agreement that will render more \nthan 95 percent of bilateral trade in consumer and industrial products \nduty-free immediately. U.S. investors in Morocco will be increasingly \nable to rely on a secure, predictable legal framework mandated by the \nFTA. U.S. banks, insurance companies, telecommunications companies and \nothers will get new access to markets within Morocco.\n  In addition, U.S. firms are guaranteed a fair and transparent process \nfor selling goods and services to a wide range of Moroccan Government \nentities, via the FTA's government contracting anti-corruption \nprovisions. These kinds of measures are what we expect from a free-\ntrade agreement. Unfortunately, this agreement also\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\ncontains protectionist language antithetical to the tenets of free \ntrade.\n  As with the Australian FTA approved by the Senate last week, and the \nSingapore agreement that went into effect in January, the United States \nTrade Representative included language that could impair Congress's \nability to pass and implement drug importation legislation. Such \nlegislation is not only something Congress has worked on for the past \nseveral years, but has also enacted.\n  The provisions USTR slipped into the Singapore, Australia and Morocco \nFTAs have significant implications for drug importation. Let us be \nclear about this language--it is antifree trade, serves only to block \nAmerican consumers from accessing lower cost goods and services, and \ncontravenes clear congressional intent.\n  Congress has repeatedly voted, with bipartisan majorities, to allow \ndrug importation. States and local governments are doing the same. An \noverwhelming majority of Americans believe that they have a right to \nimport more affordable medicines. So a simple question comes to mind: \nwhat is our Trade Representative, who is charged with representing the \ninterests of the American people, doing? Why deliberately include \nlanguage in bilateral trade agreements that could thwart importation \nefforts? Why flagrantly disregard the intent of Americans and their \nelected representatives? It seems to me that the special interests have \nagain found friendly territory.\n\n  When Americans wonder how this continues to happen, they should take \na glance at the list of intellectual property ``advisors'' that worked \nwith the negotiators. These advisors include representatives from drug \ncompanies, the pharmaceutical industry as a whole, and other lobbyists \nwith a direct interest in blocking drug importation. How many public \nhealth and consumer advocacy groups were included on this committee? \nZero.\n  The Singapore FTA was the first free-trade agreement to include \nlanguage that could impact drug importation. The Morocco FTA must be \nthe last.\n  Our trade negotiators must be less mindful of special interests and \nmore responsive to the express intent of the Congress. We granted the \nPresident trade promotion authority, TPA, in 2002 to demonstrate our \nNation's re-energized commitment to negotiating strong free-trade \nagreements. TPA was designed to lead to free trade, not more \nprotection.\n  This agreement is not the first in which the administration has made \nuse of TPA to promote its politically expedient policy priorities. Last \nyear, immigration provisions were included in the Singapore and Chile \nFTAs. If the Administration is to continue to enjoy the privilege of \nTPA, trade agreements must no longer be vehicles that include items \nrightfully addressed by Congress under the Constitution.\n  The United States has been and should be the leading promoter of an \nopen global marketplace. Steel tariffs, agricultural subsidies in the \nfarm bill, and other forms of protection, however, have damaged \nAmerica's free-trade credentials. If special interest carve-outs, like \nthe one for the pharmaceutical industry in this FTA, continue to \npollute our trade agreements, we will all be worse off. Our economy \nwill suffer and our leadership role on trade will further decline.\n  I will vote yes, but let me reiterate what I said last week with \nrespect to the Australia agreement: Should another FTA being negotiated \nnow or in the future come before the Senate with similar protections \nfor special interests, I will find it even more difficult to vote in \nfavor of it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am disappointed to see that the U.S.-\nMorocco Free-Trade Agreement contains patent protection language \nsimilar to that contained in the U.S.-Australia Free-Trade Agreement. \nAlthough I will not oppose this agreement on this one basis, I will \noppose the use of this language as a precedent for any future free-\ntrade agreement.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I opposed the Morocco free-trade \nagreement. Unfortunately, it is one more in what has become an \nincreasing number of deeply flawed trade agreements. These agreements \ncontinue to jeopardize U.S. jobs and businesses. They undermine \nenvironmental, health, and safety protections. They hinder our ability \nto loosen restrictions on reimportation of FDA-approved prescription \ndrugs. They limit our ability to use our tax dollars to help our own \nbusinesses and workers through buy American policies, and to discourage \ncorporations from reincorporating overseas, and they limit the ability \nof our democratic institutions to regulate essential services.\n  But though I opposed this trade agreement, I want to underscore my \nfirm belief that our bilateral relationship with Morocco is extremely \nimportant. We need our Moroccan partners if we are to succeed in \npursuing our first foreign policy priority: the fight against al-Qaida \nand associated global terrorist organizations. The United States cannot \nafford to ignore this critical North African ally which has suffered, \nas we have, brutal terrorist attacks. We cannot fight terrorists \nwithout a strong international coalition sharing crucial intelligence, \ndrying up sources of financial and political support for terrorism, and \ntracking down terrorist leaders. In order to have a strong partner to \ncount on, the U.S. must support the Moroccan people in their fight for \nbasic human rights, their efforts to combat corruption, and their work \nto create the kinds of economic opportunities that the country's large \npopulation of youth need. Without these efforts, this population will \nstagnate and resentment will grow. The U.S. should be cultivating \nfuture partners in Morocco, not future antagonists.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this Free Trade Agreement should have \nbeen easy for me to support.\n  It is an agreement with a moderate Arab nation, an FTA that will \nintegrate Morocco's economy with that of America. This FTA will aid \nMorocco's economy, strengthen our ties with the Kingdom, and help to \nbolster the contention that market economics can lead to a peaceful and \nprosperous moderate Islam.\n  What troubles me is the Bush administration's ongoing inattention to \nthe labor and environmental protections in trade agreements, which is \ninexcusable. This administration has refused to live up to the gold \nstandard on labor and environmental protections, a standard set by the \nClinton administration when it negotiated the United States-Jordan Free \nTrade Agreement.\n  Instead, President Bush and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick \nhave backtracked, endorsing less stringent protections in agreements \nwith Chile and Singapore. The administration ignored the disapproval of \nmany in Congress of those provisions. Stunningly, the administration \ndid not include Jordan-style provisions in the Morocco agreement, even \nthough Moroccan officials announced they would be willing to accept \nthem.\n  In short, President Bush settled for weaker protections than he could \nhave gotten, and he did it for what would seem to be no reason other \nthan to antagonize labor groups, environmental groups and some in \nCongress. I find that deplorable.\n  Despite the shortcomings of this agreement, however, and because \nMorocco is making progress on its labor and environmental laws, I will \nsupport this FTA to strengthen our ties with a moderate Arab nation \nthat has been a good global citizen.\n  Mr. BURNS. I have always said that I support free trade, as long as \nit is fair trade. The Morocco free-trade agreement before us today is \nan excellent example of that principle. Once this agreement goes into \neffect, 95 percent of the tariffs on consumer and industrial goods are \neliminated, with the remaining tariffs eliminated in 9 years. This deal \nrepresents the best access to a developing country yet. I applaud \nAmbassador Zoellick for his hard work in achieving a balanced free \ntrade agreement that provides significant benefits to both trade \npartners.\n  Morocco imports more than $11 billion in goods each year, with $475 \nmillion coming from the United States. We have an opportunity to \nincrease the United States presence in this emerging market. Current \ncircumstances are certainly less than ideal for American goods: imports \nfrom the United States face a stiff tariff, over 20 percent. In \nMontana, we have not yet benefited from trade with Morocco, and I can \nonly hope that passage of this agreement today will allow us to begin \nexploring the advantages that it can offer\n\n[[Page S8509]]\n\nMontanans and Moroccans alike, without unreasonable tariff barriers for \nour products.\n  I am especially pleased at the agriculture provisions in this FTA. \nToo often, free trade agreements represent a losing deal for Montana's \nfarmers and ranchers, but I believe this agreement shows a commitment \nto fair trade for agriculture. In 2003, the United States exported over \n$152 million in agricultural products to Morocco. Under this agreement, \nthat number could more than double, and I expect that some of that \nincrease will be Montana beef and grains. According to an analysis by \nthe American Farm Bureau Federation, ``the agreement is expected to \nresult in a 10-to-1 gain for the U.S. agriculture sector, which already \nenjoys a positive trade balance with Morocco.''\n  I commend the Trade Representative for the wheat provisions in this \nFTA. I know that Morocco expressed some serious concerns about \nnegotiating access for U.S. wheat, and Ambassador Zoellick worked hard \nto keep wheat on the table. Under this agreement, U.S. wheat exports \ncould experience a five-fold increase. At the same time, the Agreement \nis sensitive to Moroccan domestic wheat producers. While we would \nalways prefer tariffs to be completely eliminated, the expansion of \ntariff rate quotas, TRQs, in this agreement will allow Montana wheat \nproducers vastly expanded access to Moroccan markets. Currently, wheat \ntariffs on U.S. exports to Morocco run as high as 135 percent. The \ncommitments to reduce tariffs and expand TRQs are positive changes for \nour wheat producers.\n  In addition, the agreement includes an important provision that \nensures long-term fair access. If Morocco provides other trading \npartners preferential access that is better than what we have here \ntoday, Morocco has agreed to immediately extend that treatment to the \nsame U.S. product. This guarantees a level playing field for our \nagriculture producers. Finally, Morocco has also agreed to work with us \nat the WTO negotiations to limit the trade-distorting power of state \ntrading enterprises. This is the same agreement that we secured in the \nAustralia Free Trade Agreement approved last week. I am pleased to see \na growing international consensus that state trading enterprises, like \nthe Canadian Wheat Board, must be addressed to provide for real free \nand fair trade. I urge Ambassador Zoellick to continue focusing on this \nimportant issue.\n  Montana cattle producers also stand to benefit from this deal. Access \nto Moroccan markets for high quality beef--the kind of beef American \ncattle producers are known for is greatly increased. Tariffs on U.S. \nbeef are often as high as 275 percent. The commitment to reduce these \ntariffs and to expand TRQs will allow domestic cattle producers to send \nprime and choice beef into Morocco hotels and restaurants, providing \nMorocco substantial tourism industry with the quality it demands. In \naddition, Morocco has agreed to accept U.S. inspection standards for \nbeef, which will allow our products immediate access to Moroccan \nmarkets. This is a fair deal for our cattle producers.\n  In addition to the benefits to agriculture, service providers, such \nas telecommunications and construction, will have enhanced access to \nMoroccan markets. Telecommunications will be provided with non \ndiscriminatory access to the network. Intellectual property protection \nis provided, as are agreements on labor and environmental standards. \nThe Morocco free-trade agreement represents an important step toward \nthe President's goal of establishing a Middle East Free Trade Area, and \nI am pleased to offer my support.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I spoke yesterday about the Morocco free-\ntrade agreement and its benefits for both the United States and \nMorocco.\n  I hope and expect that when we vote on the Morocco implementing bill, \nthe bill will pass by an overwhelming margin.\n  That is a fitting way to cap a busy month on trade and head into the \nsummer recess.\n  As I look back at the accomplishments on trade since the beginning of \nthe year, I am pleased at how much we have done. It would be considered \na full plate in any year, but in an election year, it is especially \ngratifying to have achieved so much.\n  We passed the JOBS Bill, a complex tax measure that will help create \njobs in America and bring the United States into compliance with the \nWTO. That bill passed the Senate overwhelmingly with 92 votes.\n  We extended and enhanced an important trade and development program \nfor Africa--the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act through a unanimous \nvote.\n  We created a different trade and development program for Haiti, also \nthrough a unanimous vote.\n  And of course, just last week, we passed the Australia free-trade \nagreement implementing bill with 80 votes.\n  It has been a busy year.\n  I am heartened by the strong votes all these measures attracted. No \nvictory is ever easy. They are hard fought by people working every day \nto do the right thing.\n  I want to congratulate Senator Grassley and his staff for their \nleadership, and Ambassador Zoellick and his excellent negotiating team \nfor all their hard work.\n  As I look ahead, there will be some difficult issues to confront. I \nbelieve we have more work to do to rebuild a strong consensus on trade. \nWe could do better on both the substance of trade agreements and on the \nprocess of considering them.\n  I also believe we should be devoting more of our resources toward \nenforcing trade agreements we already have.\n  But today, I would like to focus on our successes on all we have \nalready accomplished, and on what we are about to do.\n  When we vote to approve the Morocco legislation, we will be \nsolidifying our oldest diplomatic relationship in the world.\n  We will be giving reform-minded governments in developing countries \naround the world incentive to redouble their efforts to modernize their \neconomies.\n  We will also be setting a new standard for agreements with developing \ncountries in a variety of important areas. These include intellectual \nproperty, market access, and even agriculture.\n  The Morocco agreement is a good agreement. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, just over 2 months ago I expressed my \ninterest in seeing both the U.S.-Australia and the U.S.-Morocco free-\ntrade agreements pass the Congress by the August recess. A lot of \npeople resisted this effort, arguing that it would be impossible for \nboth the House and Senate to hold hearings, prepare the legislation, \nconduct mock mark-ups, report the bills, and pass implementing \nlegislation for two free trade agreements in just two months. While the \ntask was indeed difficult, I am very pleased to say that we are on the \nverge of achieving my goal today.\n  In just a few moments the U.S. Senate will have an historic \nopportunity to strengthen our relations with Morocco with the passage \nof the United States-Morocco Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act. \nWhile nothing is certain, I expect this legislation to pass with strong \nbipartisan support. Passage of this legislation follows on the heels of \na strong Senate vote in favor of the United States-Australia Free-Trade \nAgreement last week. The Australia bill itself was preceded by renewal \nand extension of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, which passed \nthe Senate by unanimous consent on June 24 of this year. Prior to that, \nthe Senate was able to work out its differences and pass the JOBS Act \nby a vote of 92 to 5. I will note that each of these bills passed in an \nelection year, a year in which many pundits argued that nothing would \nget done. I also want to point out the broad bipartisan support which \neach of these bills received. In my mind, it is that element--\nbipartisanship--that is the key to our success.\n  I want to thank my ranking member, Senator Baucus, and the members of \nthe Finance Committee for working with me to bring these bills to \nfruition. There are a lot of demands placed upon Finance Committee \nmembers and their staffs, and I appreciate their hard work and \ndedication in helping us produce legislation that will receive broad \nbipartisan support in the Senate.\n  Turning to the bill at hand, passage of the United States-Morocco \nFree-\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\nTrade Agreement Implementation Act will help strengthen our \nrelationship with a long-standing friend and ally of the United States. \nFor over two hundred years, our two nations have enjoyed a strong and \nmutually beneficial relationship. Today, Morocco is a country in \ntransition. It is a country that recognizes that its long-term economic \nprosperity lies not in shutting itself off to the world, but in opening \nup to the world. It is in large part Morocco's willingness to embrace \nfree market and democratic principles that led President Bush to select \nMorocco as a potential free trade partner. This free-trade agreement \nwill help lock in and hasten reforms that the Moroccan Government \nembraced on its own initiative. I am confident that this agreement will \nspur growth and opportunity for Morocco and its people.\n  This trade agreement is also very good for the United States, \nespecially U.S. agriculture. Implementation of the agreement is \nexpected to help advance U.S. agriculture exports to Morocco to \nunprecedented heights, enabling us to better compete with the European \nUnion, Canada, and South America in the Moroccan market.\n\n  Many people worked hard to see today's vote become a reality. First \nand foremost, this would not have happened without the leadership of \nPresident George W. Bush. As I have noted before, President Bush is \ncommitted to building the U.S. economy by opening the world's markets \nto U.S. goods and services. The United States-Morocco Free-Trade \nAgreement is just the latest of his achievements in this regard.\n  The United States Trade Representative, Ambassador Robert B. \nZoellick, also merits special recognition and commendation for his \nefforts in negotiating this agreement. His commitment to expanding U.S. \ntrade opportunities is steadfast, for which I am grateful. I also want \nto express my thanks to John Veroneau, the general counsel in the \nOffice of United States Trade Representative, Matt Niemeyer, the \nAssistant U.S. Trade Representative for Congressional Affairs, and Lisa \nCoen, Deputy Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Congressional \nAffairs, for their many efforts to ensure that the committee was fully \napprised of developments during the negotiations and their efforts to \nresolve concerns raised by members as the committee informally \nconsidered proposed implementing legislation for this trade agreement. \nIn addition, I thank Michael Smythers, a special assistant to the \nPresident working in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, for \nhis efforts to facilitate our consideration of this implementing \nlegislation.\n  I commend my colleagues on the Finance Committee for their interest \nin seeing that this trade agreement was concluded and that the \nimplementing legislation was passed without delay. I would like to \nextend a special thanks to the ranking member of the committee, Senator \nBaucus. We have worked together over the years to expand trade \nopportunities for the benefit of U.S. farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, \nand service workers, and to benefit U.S. consumers. I am quite pleased \nwith the outcome of our current efforts with the imminent passage of \nthis implementing bill today.\n  My trade staff on the Finance Committee worked diligently over the \npast several weeks on developing the implementing bill and other \nmaterials connected with it. My goal was to have this legislation \npassed prior to the August recess, and they were instrumental in making \nthis happen. Moreover, my trade staff engaged in consultations with \nofficials from the Office of the United States Trade Representative \nthroughout the negotiations, which began way back in January 2003, so \nthis has been a long process for them. I greatly appreciate their hard \nwork.\n  My chief counsel and staff director, Kolan Davis, deserves \nrecognition. His dedication and skills are instrumental in advancing \nthe Finance Committee's agenda. The Chief International Trade Counsel \nof the Finance Committee, Everett Eissenstat, also deserves special \nmention. His expertise in trade policy and his ability to juggle \nmultiple trade priorities simultaneously are key to the Committee's \nsuccess. I would also like to recognize the other members of my trade \nstaff--my two trade counsels, David Johanson and Stephen Schaefer, for \ntheir invaluable technical assistance throughout this process. \nAdditionally, the work of Zach Paulsen, Dan Shepherdson, and Tiffany \nMcCullen, is appreciated, for their dedication to the Finance \nCommittee's work and to the people of Iowa. Without the diligence and \nhard work of my staff, we would not be at the point we are today.\n  Senator Baucus' trade staff also deserves recognition. The Democratic \nstaff director on the Finance Committee, Russ Sullivan, and the deputy \nstaff director, Bill Dauster, worked well with my staff throughout the \nprocess. I also appreciate the efforts of Tim Punke, Senator Baucus' \nChief International Trade Counsel, as well as Brian Pomper, John \nGilliland, Shara Aranoff, Sara Andrews, and Pascal Niedermann.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Polly Craighill of the Office of the \nSenate Legislative Counsel for the many hours she put into drafting the \nimplementing bill. Without her patience, hard work, and drafting \nskills, today's vote would not have been possible.\n  I look forward to the signing of this legislation into law by \nPresident Bush.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I inquire of the Chair what the pending business is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the nomination of \nHenry Saad, of Michigan, to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator Hatch is chairing a subcommittee \nhearing and asked that I open the debate with respect to the nomination \nand confirmation of Judge Henry Saad. So I think my comments are \nreflective of Chairman Hatch's views, but I will present them as my own \nas well.\n  I will first speak a little bit about Judge Saad and his nomination \nto this court and why we have had a problem in getting this far with \nhis nomination but why I hope our colleagues will be willing to vote to \nconfirm him.\n  As the Chair noted, he is a nominee to the U.S. Circuit Court for the \nSixth Circuit. He was nominated, and I ask my colleagues to think of \nthis date for a moment, on November 8, 2001. It is now 2004. He is a \ndistinguished State court of appeals judge from the State of Michigan \nwith nearly a decade of experience in that court. He has been there \nsince 1994. In that capacity, he is actually elected and reelected, and \nhe has been reelected twice to serve on the court of appeals with broad \nbipartisan support within the State of Michigan.\n  The American Bar Association has rated Judge Saad qualified to sit on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Therefore, his \nnomination should have come before us long before now. He should be \nconfirmed, obviously.\n  I will mention a bit about the Sixth Circuit. There are 16 authorized \nseats on the circuit, but there are 4 vacancies. Obviously, one-fourth \nof the authorized seats on that court remain vacant today. President \nBush has nominated four very well-qualified individuals from Michigan \nto fill these vacancies. The seat to which Judge Saad has been \nnominated has been deemed a judicial emergency and, of course, it is \nnot hard to see why with that number of vacancies.\n  Interestingly, President George H.W. Bush, President Bush No. 41, \nfirst nominated Judge Saad to the Federal bench in 1992, but the \nDemocratic Senate failed to act on his nomination at that time, as well \nas one other from Michigan, prior to the end of President Bush's term. \nSo this is the second time he has been nominated for this prestigious \ncourt.\n  A bit about his personal history. Judge Saad was born in Detroit. He \nis a lifelong resident of the State. He would be the first Arab-\nAmerican appointee to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. \nAccording to the Detroit Free Press, Bush's nomination of Saad in the \nwake of the September 11 attacks--remember, it was only 2 months to the \nday following the September 11 attacks:\n\n     conveys an important message to all the citizens and \n     residents of this country that we embrace and welcome \n     diversity and that we are extending the American dream to \n     anyone who is prepared to work hard.\n\n  Judge Saad has had a distinguished career as a practicing attorney \nand law professor before serving on the State bench. From 1974 until \n1994 he practiced law, first as an associate and then a partner with \nthe prestigious Detroit firm of Dickinson, Wright. He built a national \npractice and reputation there in the areas of employment law, school \nlaw, libel law, and first amendment law. He serves as an adjunct \nprofessor at both Wayne State University Law School and the University \nof Detroit Mercy School of Law. He received his\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n\nbachelor's degree in 1971 and his law degree, magna cum laude, in 1974, \nboth from Wayne State University. He received a special Order of the \nCoif award in 2000, which is bestowed by a vote of the faculty of the \nschool upon a distinguished graduate who has earned his degree before \nthe law school was inducting members into the Order of the Coif.\n  Judge Saad has significant appellate experience in both civil and \ncriminal matters, authoring well over 75 published majority opinions. \nHis nomination has broad bipartisan support, including endorsements \nfrom such disparate groups as the United Auto Workers and the Michigan \nChamber of Commerce.\n  Judge Saad is dedicated to improving the law and helping his State \nand local community through volunteer work. He was chairman of the \nboard of the Oakland Community College Foundation, president of the \nWayne State University Law School Alumni Association, and he is \ncurrently a member of the board of visitors to the Ave Maria Law \nSchool.\n  Judge Saad was a board member of the National Council of Christians \nand Jews and the American Heart Association, as well as trustee of WTVS \nChannel 56 Education Television Foundation.\n  Judge Saad received the ``Salute to Justice John O'Brien Award'' for \noutstanding volunteer service to the people of Oakland County in 1997, \nand he received the Arab-American and Chaldean Council Civic and \nHumanitarian Award for outstanding dedication to serving the community \nwith compassion and understanding in 1995.\n  Let me read a few statements from people who have endorsed the \nnomination and confirmation of Judge Henry Saad. The Secretary of \nEnergy, former Senator from the State of Michigan, said:\n\n       I have known Henry for twenty years on a personal and \n     professional level. He is a person of unimpeachable integrity \n     and will serve our country and our justice system remarkably \n     well.\n\n  John Engler, the former Governor of Michigan, said:\n\n       The President selected individuals [including Henry Saad] \n     who are experienced judges and whose reputations for \n     intellect, knowledge of the law, diligence and temperament \n     are well established. Judge Saad has established a \n     distinguished reputation on Michigan's appellate court \n     which he will take to the federal appeals court.\n\n  The President of the United Auto Workers, Stephen Yokich, said:\n\n       I have known Judge Saad for twenty-five years. He is a man \n     of the highest integrity and a judge who is fair, balanced \n     and hard working. I strongly support President Bush's \n     nomination of Judge Saad to the federal appellate bench.\n\n  Congressman Joseph Knollenberg, who is a Representative from the \nState of Michigan, said:\n\n       I have known Judge Saad for over twenty-five years. He was \n     an outstanding lawyer and is a highly regarded appellate \n     jurist, known for his scholarly opinions, balance and \n     fairness. I am confident he will be a great addition to the \n     Federal appellate bench.\n\n  Justice Stephen Markman from the Michigan Supreme Court said:\n\n       In his seven years on the Michigan Court of Appeals, Judge \n     Saad has been one of its most thoughtful and fair-minded \n     jurists. His opinions and his judicial integrity have earned \n     him the respect of a remarkably broad range of his \n     colleagues.\n\n  Finally, Judge Hilda Gage of the Michigan Court of Appeals said:\n\n       I have served with Judge Saad on the Michigan Court of \n     Appeals for six years. I admire his judicial independence and \n     his scholarly analysis of the law. I applaud the President's \n     nomination of Judge Saad to the Sixth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n\n  Those are some of the people who have worked with him, who have known \nhim a long time, who represent a diverse point of view within the State \nof Michigan, and yet all of whom endorse the President's nomination of \nJudge Saad to the Sixth Circuit.\n  Let me speak for a moment about the status of his circuit because, as \nI noted at the beginning, there are four vacancies. One-fourth of the \nactive seats on this court, are vacant. The President has nominated \nfour very well-qualified individuals to fill these vacancies. All four \nof these vacancies have been deemed judicial emergencies by the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n  I might, for those who are not aware, describe what this means. The \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts characterizes, in some rare \ncircumstances, vacancies on the court as judicial emergencies by virtue \nof the caseload of the court, the nature of the cases before the court, \nthe ability of the court to turn out decisions and opinions, and the \nnumber of judges available to serve on the court. They balance all of \nthose considerations. When the court does not have enough people to do \nthe job it is required to do, when litigants are taking too long to get \ntheir matters heard before the court, and in effect when justice is not \nbeing done because it is being delayed, then the Administrative Office \nof the U.S. Courts declares judicial emergencies.\n  All four of these vacancies in the Sixth Circuit have been so \ndesignated. The confirmation of two judges in late April and early May \nof this year filled two of then six vacancies, but the circuit remains \noverburdened.\n  By the way, let me quantify what I said a moment ago. When I spoke of \njudicial emergency, in the court of appeals, that occurs specifically \nwhen adjusted filings per panel are in excess of 700, or any vacancy is \nin existence more than 18 months where adjudicated filings are between \n500 and 700. All four of the Michigan vacancies on the Sixth Circuit \nhave been in existence for more than 18 months and the adjusted filings \ntotal 588. That is why it is so important that we act now to fill this \nvacancy.\n  Only a substantial commitment on the part of the senior judges of the \nSixth Circuit, and the district judges from within the circuit filling \nin, as well as visiting appellate judges from other circuits, has kept \nthe caseload of this important circuit manageable. It is the third \nbusiest court of appeals in the country. Chief Judge Boyce Martin has \nasked Congress to authorize a 17th judge for the court.\n  So if we filled all four of these vacancies today, not only would we \nhave at least filled those judicial emergencies, but the chief judge of \nthe circuit has said we need additional judges in addition to these.\n  Among the 12 U.S. Courts of Appeals, the Sixth is the 11th in the \ntimeliness in the disposition of cases. Only the Ninth Circuit takes \nlonger to issue its opinions. I am familiar with that, having practiced \nbefore the Ninth Circuit. When it takes so long for litigants who have \ndisputes before the court to get action on their cases, justice is \ndenied. This circuit, being the next to the bottom in terms of the \nspeed with which its decisions are made, makes it a clear candidate for \nthe Senate to act. It is unconscionable that we have not been able to \nconfirm Judge Saad as well as the other three nominees to this court.\n  The district court judges within the Sixth Circuit have complained \nthat what has turned out to be regular duty as substitute judges on the \ncourt of appeals has slowed down their own dockets considerably. In \nother words, they have not been able to do their own jobs because they \nhave had to fill in for the circuit court judges. According to Judge \nRobert Bell, who is a district judge from the Western District of \nMichigan:\n\n       We're having to backfill with judges from other circuits, \n     who are basically substitutes. You don't get the same sense \n     of purpose and continuity you get with full-fledged court of \n     appeals judges. . . . Putting together a federal appeals \n     court case often takes a Herculean effort in a short time for \n     visiting district judges. ``We don't have the time or the \n     resources that the circuit court has,'' Bell said. You can't \n     help to conclude that if we had 16 full-time judges with a \n     full complement of staff that each case might get more \n     consideration, not to say results would be different.\n\n  This quote, by the way, was the Grand Rapids Press, February 21, \n2002.\n  U.S. attorneys in Michigan likewise have complained that the vacancy \nrate in the Sixth Circuit has slowed justice and complicated the \nability to prosecute wrongdoers. It has enabled defendants to commit \nmore crime while awaiting trial. It has led to less consistencies in \nthe court's jurisprudence and effectively deprived the use of en banc \nreview in some cases. En banc review is the situation where a panel of \nthree judges has made a decision and the litigants have asked the full \ncourt to hear--in effect to rehear or have a mini-appeal--a case from \nthe decision of the panel of three. If you do not have the full \ncomplement of judges on the court, you can't have the same kind of en \nbanc review.\n  Let me quote a letter from 31 assistant U.S. attorneys in the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan sent to our colleague,\n\n[[Page S8518]]\n\nSenator Carl Levin, on January 16, 2002:\n\n       In years past, it was the normal practice of the Sixth \n     Circuit that a case would be heard by the Court approximately \n     three months after all briefs were filed, and in most cases \n     an opinion would issue in about three additional months. At \n     present, due to the large number of vacancies on the Court . \n     . . it has been taking on average between twelve and eighteen \n     months longer for most appeals to be completed than was the \n     case for most of the 1990's.\n\n  These are the prosecuting attorneys. These are the people who I noted \nhave complained that the vacancy rate has complicated their ability to \nprosecute wrongdoers. Our failure to act in the Senate has real-life \nconsequences on the people of Michigan. When justice cannot be \ndispensed with because there are not enough judges and wrongdoers are \nawaiting trial and they are able to go out and commit additional \ncrimes, we have a responsibility to solve that problem. That is why it \nis so important for us to vote and to vote up or down on the \nconfirmation of Judge Saad.\n  I serve on the Judiciary Committee. I heard some questions raised \nabout whether he would be a good addition to the court. You heard just \na summary of the many people who spoke on his behalf with a wide \ndiversity of opinion. He has a ``qualified'' rating from the Bar \nAssociation.\n  If my colleagues want to vote no on his nomination, they are free to \ndo so. On rare occasions, I have voted no against judicial nominees. I \nvoted no on very few occasions when President Clinton was making the \nnominations, but I felt that I always had the right to express my view \none way or the other. That is all Judge Saad is asking for. With the \nnomination pending now for almost 4 years, it is time that he have a \nvote up or down.\n  Let me read to you a letter from 31 assistant U.S. attorneys in the \nEastern District to Senator Levin:\n\n       [D]elays in criminal cases hurt the government; the \n     government has the burden of proof, and the longer a case \n     goes on the more chance there is that witnesses will \n     disappear, forget, or die, documents will be lost, and \n     investigators will retire or be transferred.\n\n  I go on from a different portion of this letter:\n\n       In some cases, convicted criminal defendants are granted \n     bond pending appeal. The elongated appellate process \n     therefore allows defendants to remain on the street for a \n     longer period of time, possibly committing new offenses. In \n     addition, the longer delay makes retrials more difficult if \n     the appeal results in the reversal of a conviction.\n\n  Further quoting from this letter:\n\n       The Sixth Circuit has resorted to having more district \n     judges sit by designation as panel members. This practice has \n     contributed to a slowdown of the hearing of cases in district \n     courts, because the district judges are taken out of those \n     courtrooms. The widespread use of district judges also \n     provides for less consistency in the appellate process than \n     would obtain if full-time Circuit judges heard most of the \n     appeals.\n       In some cases, the small number of judges on the Court has \n     served to effectively deprive the United States of en banc \n     review. . . . Achieving a unanimous vote of all of those \n     judges of the Court who were not part of the original panel \n     is, as a matter of practice, impossible, and not worth \n     seeking. However, if the Court was at full strength, an en \n     banc review could have been granted with the votes of about \n     two-thirds of the active judges who were not part of the \n     original panel.\n\n  Why haven't we been able to vote on Judge Saad? The two Senators from \nthe State, notwithstanding the fact that there are four vacancies in \ntheir own State, that the prosecutors from the State have written as I \nhave just indicated, that people of wide disparate views in their State \nsupport his nomination, the two Senators from the State have urged \ntheir colleagues not to allow the vote to go forward. The reason is \nbecause two nominees to fill vacancies in Michigan were left without \nhearings at the end of the Clinton administration in 2001. It is not \nuncommon at the end of an administration for there to be nominations \npending. I predict that because of opposition from the minority party, \nthere will be a lot of nominations President Bush would like to have \nconfirmed but which will not be confirmed because the other party will \nnot allow it to happen. Sometimes nominations are made too late in the \nyear for the vetting to be done, for the Bar Association to report, for \nthe hearings to be held, for the executive work of the Judiciary \nCommittee to report the judges to the Senate floor, and for the full \nSenate to vote. That is not an uncommon occurrence.\n  I note, for example, that Senators who are upset that two judges \nweren't considered at the end of the Clinton administration should also \nnote that two nominees, including John Smietanka, the very well \nqualified U.S. attorney from the Western District of Michigan, were \nalso left without hearings at the end of President Bush's term in 1993. \nSo President Clinton got to appoint the same number of judges to the \nSixth Circuit as the number of vacancies that came open during his \nPresidency. As with his predecessor, there were a couple of nominations \nstill pending at the time his term ended.\n  But as these examples illustrate, both parties have had nominations \nleft pending at end of their President's terms. The effort of the \nSenators from Michigan to block the consideration of Judge Saad as well \nas the other three nominations of President Bush at the outset of his \nterm in 2001 is unheard of. It might be one thing if these nominations \nhad just occurred and we didn't have time to consider them, but Judge \nSaad, as I said, was nominated on November 11, 2001, 2 months after the \nhistoric event of September 11. Five of the Sixth Circuit active \njudges--nearly half--were appointed by President Clinton--one \nPresident. I don't think it is possible to argue here that there is \nsome kind of political agenda by Republicans or by President Bush to \ndeny President Clinton nominations and confirmations of his \nnominations.\n\n  I might note that an editorial opinion in Michigan confirms this \npoint. It is overwhelmingly opposed to the tactics of the minority to \nprevent confirmation of the nominees President Bush has made to fill \nthese vacancies.\n  Let me quote from the Grand Rapids Press of February 24, 2002. This \nis only 3 months after the nomination of Judge Saad:\n\n       The Constitution does not give these Senators from Michigan \n     [Senators Levin and Stabenow] co-presidential authority and \n     certainly does not support the use of the Court of Appeals to \n     nurse a political grudge. . . . [Senators Levin and Stabenow] \n     have proposed that the President let a bipartisan commission \n     make Sixth Circuit nominations or that Mr. Bush re-nominate \n     the two lapsed Clinton nominations. Mr. Bush has shown no \n     interest in either retreat from his constitutional \n     prerogatives. Nor should he. Movement in this matter should \n     come from Senators Levin and Stabenow--and, clearly, it \n     should be backward.\n\n  From the Detroit News, June 30, 2002:\n\n       It was wrong for the Senate to fail to act on Clinton's \n     Michigan nominees. But another wrong won't make things right \n     for Michigan. Enough is enough. . . . Senators, it is long \n     past time to fill Michigan's voids in the hall of justice.\n\n  I will conclude with one comment. Colleagues on the other side of the \naisle will argue that we actually have confirmed a lot of President \nBush's nominees. The truth is that we have confirmed about the same \nnumber of district court judges as is usual for the Senate during the \nfirst term of the President. In the first 3\\1/2\\ years of President \nBush's term, we have confirmed, so far, 198 judges, and that is pretty \nclose to the other President's by this overall statistic. President \nBush would be on about the same pace as President Clinton, who \nappointed a total of 371 judges in 8 years--just 4 fewer than the 375 \nappointed by President Reagan. This would be about par.\n  The problem is, in the circuit court judges, Presidents ordinarily \nget most of their nominees confirmed, but President Bush is only \ngetting about half of his confirmed.\n  Here are the statistics. President Clinton saw 71 percent of his \ncircuit court nominees receive a full vote in the Senate; the first \nPresident Bush, 79 percent. President Reagan, 88 percent of his circuit \nnominees were confirmed; President Carter, 92 percent. But in the 107th \nCongress--our Congress--President Bush has only gotten 53 percent of \nhis circuit court nominees voted on by the full Senate, 17 out of 32.\n  That is where the problem is and there is no secret why. As has been \ndescribed many times by my friends on the other side of the aisle, the \ncircuit court is just below the Supreme Court. It is viewed as more \npowerful and more important than the district courts. There are many \nmore district court judges. They are the court of first resort. Their \ncases are appealed to the circuit courts.\n  Most of the time, circuit court decisions are not appealed or the \nappeals\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\nare not accepted by the Supreme Court. It can only hear maybe 300 cases \nor so a year, so, as a practical matter, the circuit courts become the \ncourt of last resort. That is why Democrats have refused to even vote \non President Bush's nominees for circuit courts because they believe \nPresident Bush's nominees would not be as capable, have the right \npolitical philosophy, or serve the interests of justice as well as a \nPresident of their party.\n  As I have noted, whether Democrat or Republican, the full Senate \nunder Republican control, as well as under Democratic control, has \nallowed votes on the vast majority of the circuit court nominees of \nprevious Presidents. It is only President George Bush who has only \nreceived a vote on half of his circuit court nominees. That is what is \ngoing on. It is wrong. We need to vote. We need to vote on a nominee \nwho has been pending now since November 11, 2001, Judge Henry Saad. I \nurge my colleagues when that opportunity comes within the next several \nhours, we will have that opportunity, they will agree to permit an up-\nor-down vote. That is all we are asking for.\n  If they have objections, and I see a couple of my colleagues are \nhere, perhaps they would like to discuss their objections to Henry \nSaad. But let the Senate vote on this nominee as we do with most other \nissues. We bring it to the vote. Our Members want to vote. But at least \nthis man, who has been waiting now for 3 years, would have a chance to \nhave his nomination either confirmed or rejected.\n  I urge my colleagues to provide him that opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak \nas in morning business and after I finish, in approximately 15 minutes, \nthe Senator from New York be given an opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Bin Laden Flight Manifest\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss some \ndisturbing information that was released to the public today. It \nconcerns the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the United States on \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  A little more than a week after September 11, precisely on September \n19, 2001, a luxury airliner 727 took off from Boston Logan Airport. It \nwas wheeled up, at 11 o'clock at night, under the cover of darkness. \nThat airplane left the United States for Gander, Canada, then on to \nParis, Geneva, and the final stop was Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n  The question was, Who was on this charter flight carrying people who \nwill never again set foot in the United States? That charter flight, 1 \nweek after September 11, carried 12 members of the bin Laden family out \nof our country. When they left, they took a million unanswered \nquestions with them.\n  Now, on this chart is the flight manifest of that fateful flight. I \nwill read the names of those with the last name of bin Laden: ``Najia \nBinladen, Khalil Binladen, Sultan Binladen, Khalil Sultan Binladen, \nShafig Binladen, Omar Awad Binladen, Badr Ahmed Binladen, Nawaf Bark \nBinladen, Mohammed Saleh Binladen, Salman Salem Binladen, Tamara Khalil \nBinladen, Sana's Mohammed Binladen, and Faisal Khalid Binladen.''\n  I ask my colleagues, why in the world would we let 12 members of \nOsama bin Laden's family leave the country at that moment?\n  One of the first rules of a criminal investigation when you have the \nsuspect on the run is to interrogate the family members. Osama bin \nLaden had just murdered over 3,000 Americans, but the administration \nlet his family flee. The question is, Why?\n  There are reports that some of the bin Ladens were interviewed on the \nairplane by the FBI. Interviewed on the airplane? Everybody knows when \nthe FBI is conducting a serious interview they do not do it within \nhearing of everyone else. These people were about to take off. Why \nwould they disclose anything to U.S. law enforcement? They were getting \nout of here.\n  I have talked to law enforcement officials who said, at the very \nleast, the bin Laden family should have been detained on a material \nwitness warrant and put under oath and asked the question, Do you know \nwhere Osama bin Laden is? Do you know where his safe houses are? Where \ndoes he get his money? Who are his associates?\n  The Saudi PR machine has been spinning that Osama bin Laden is \nostracized from his family; no one has any contact with him anymore. \nMost experts believe that is not the truth. It may be true for some \nfamily members but certainly not all.\n  It is, at the very least, unclear what bin Laden's position on Osama \nbin Laden really is. Osama bin Laden's brother, Yeslam bin Laden, was \ninterviewed on television recently. He was asked the question, Would \nyou turn Osama bin Laden in, if you knew where he was? He essentially \nsaid no.\n\n  Before it left this country, this charter flight stopped in several \nU.S. cities. It started by picking up one bin Laden, Najia bin Laden, \nin Los Angeles. It then flew to Orlando to pick up more members of the \nbin Laden family. Once in Orlando, the crew of this charter flight \nfound out who they were carrying as passengers and threatened to walk \nout. They did not want to fly that flight but the charter company \ninsisted they stay on the job. The airplane was flown from Orlando to \nDulles, near Washington, to pick up more bin Ladens. Then the flight \nlanded at Logan Airport in Boston to pick up additional family members \nto leave the country.\n  At Logan Airport, the officials there were not eager to let this \nplane full of bin Ladens take off so easily. The airport officials \ndemanded clearances from the Bush administration before they let this \nairplane leave. But then, to their astonishment, the clearances quickly \ncame through. Let them leave, was the order from the Bush \nadministration. And we ask, Why?\n  Look at the names of the bin Laden family members who are allowed to \nleave the country. It is astounding, 12 of them, all of them with bin \nLaden last names. That is a pretty good indication that they ought to \nbe questioned, ought to be interpreted, that they ought to tell what \nthey know about Osama bin Laden, the murderer of our Americans.\n  Millions of Americans were still distraught on September 19. \nThousands of foreigners were detained across our Nation and across the \nworld, but the family of the perpetrator was let go. It makes no sense.\n  Some of these individuals' names raise specific concern. Take Omar \nbin Laden. He was under suspicion for involvement in a suspected \nterrorist organization. This was known on September 19, 2001, but the \nadministration allowed him to flee. Once again, we must ask the \nquestion, why?\n\n  The President of the United States should explain to the American \npeople why his administration let this plane leave. The American people \nare going to be shocked by this manifest, and they deserve an \nexplanation.\n  These are 12 names that may have been inconvenienced in September \n2001, if we detained them and subjected them to questioning under oath. \nThey might not have liked it. That is 12 people potentially \ninconvenienced compared to the almost 3,000 names of those murdered on \n9/11.\n  The American people deserve an answer. This information is reliable. \nManifests are always filed with flights, especially those going out of \nthe country. The destination: Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia, Saudi \nArabia--all the way down the line. The passport numbers are blocked out \non this chart, but their identity is quite clear.\n  This is a question that must be answered.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know my colleagues are waiting, so I \nwill try to be brief. I have come to the floor to talk about a \nresolution Senator Cornyn and I are submitting on human trafficking. \nBefore I get into that, I want to mention a couple of points in \nreference to my good friend from Arizona. One is a numerical question. \nHe talked about courts of appeals\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\njudges who have been approved under previous administrations and then \nmentioned the 107th Congress of this administration. It is sort of a \nbit of comparing not apples and oranges but apples and half apples.\n  I believe if you look at the number for the whole of President Bush's \nterm, it goes up considerably. It might not be quite as high as some of \nthe others, but it is much higher than the 53 percent Senator Kyl \nmentioned. Senator Kyl is a good friend of mine. I mentioned this to \nhim while he was here.\n  But the second point I would make--I know my good colleague from \nMichigan, Carl Levin, will be bringing this up at some length--to me, \nthe issue is not a tit-for-tat issue. They did a lot of wrongs \npreviously when President Clinton was President and they did not let \njudges come through, and that created the vacancies in Michigan. But I \nhave some sympathy for the Detroit News article Senator Kyl quoted that \nsaid there should not be tit for tat here.\n  Two wrongs don't make a right. It is sort of anomalous for those \ncreating the wrong to say two wrongs don't make a right. But there is a \nfar more important point, and that is this: The reason we have no \napproval of judges in Michigan is the President has ignored the part of \nthe Constitution that talks about advise and consent. For the vacancies \nin Michigan, if the President sat down with the Michigan Senators, Mr. \nLevin and Ms. Stabenow--both reasonable people, people who have engaged \nin many bipartisan relationships themselves--and said: ``How do we work \nthis out?'' it would have been worked out in the first 6 months of the \nPresident's term.\n\n  The idea that, A, previous Senates have created vacancies, and then \nthe President says to the Senators of that State or to the Senators of \nthis body: ``It's my way or no way. I'm picking the judges. You have no \nsay,'' that is what has created the deadlock.\n  The Constitution calls for advice as well as consent. In States where \nthere has been advice, it has worked. In my State of New York we have \nno vacancies. Why? Because the administration has consulted with me. My \ncolleague Senator Clinton and I have nominated some judges to vacancies \nin New York. They have nominated the lion's share, but none of them \nwould meet with this body's disapproval.\n  I am sure, if the President would simply sit down with Senator Levin \nand Senator Stabenow, and say: ``How do we work this out?'' it would be \nworked out, pardon the expression, in a New York minute. But they do \nnot. They have an attitude: Here is what we want. You approve them. And \nif you don't approve every single one, then you are obstructionists.\n  As has been mentioned over and over again, of the 200 judges this \nbody has dealt with, 6 have been disapproved and 194 have been \napproved. That is a darn good track record. I am a Yankee fan. The \nYankees' percentage is up there around .700, .650 in terms of wins and \nlosses. We are all proud of that. The President is doing a lot better \nthan the Yankees.\n  The idea that ``It's my way or no way'' is not going to work. \nFurthermore, I would argue to my colleagues, it is not what the \nFounding Fathers wanted. If they wanted the President to appoint judges \nunilaterally, they would have said so in the Constitution. But they \nwanted the Senate to have a say.\n  I remind my colleagues, one of the first judges nominated by \nPresident Washington, John Rutledge of South Carolina, was rejected by \nthe Senate because, of all things, of his views on the Jay treaty. And \nin that Senate were a good number of Founding Fathers, people who had \nactually written the Constitution, so clearly the Founding Fathers did \nnot intend the Senate to be a rubberstamp.\n  Certainly they did not intend for the Senate to hold up a majority of \njudges, but when the President nominates people way out of the \nmainstream, when the President refuses to sit down and negotiate, these \nare the results. And I would guess--again, I defer to Senator Levin, \nwho is on the floor--my view is, if the President or his counsel were \nto pick up the phone and say to Senator Levin: ``How do we work this \nout?'' it is still not too late, even as we enter the twilight of this \nCongress, to get it done.\n  That is all I will say on that matter. I will leave the rest to my \ncolleague from Michigan.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Schumer pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n413 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for his \ncomments relative to judicial appointments. He is exactly right in \nterms of the number of judges that this Senate has confirmed with the \nsupport of this side of the aisle. He is exactly right when it comes to \nthe willingness of Senator Stabenow and myself to compromise the \ndeadlock that exists with this administration over the Michigan judges. \nWe have been willing to do that from the beginning of this \nadministration. We continue to be willing to attempt some kind of a \ncompromise relative to these vacancies.\n  What we are unwilling to do is to allow a tactic, which was used \nrelative to these two women who were nominated by President Clinton \nwhich denied them hearings for over 4 years and over 1\\1/2\\ years \nrespectively, to succeed, as the good Senator from New York said, to \neither create these vacancies or to leave these vacancies opened for \nthe next President to fill. That is not the way things should work. It \nis not the way the Constitution contemplated it. We are going to do our \nbest to continue to press for a bipartisan solution in a number of ways \nbut in the meantime to not simply say, OK, go ahead, fill vacancies \nwhich should not exist but only exist because of the denial of hearings \nfor two well-qualified women who were appointed by President Clinton.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for his comments, for his \nperception, for his willingness and determination--more than \nwillingness--to look at the full meaning of the Constitution so that it \nis not just the President who makes appointments in a situation such as \nthis and assumes that the vacancies, which were created by denial of \nhearings for nominees of the previous administration, will be \nrubberstamped by this body.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, I compliment my friend from Michigan for his \nsteadfastness on this issue. Everyone knows the desire of the Senator \nand his colleague, Senator Stabenow from Michigan, to compromise. Over \nand over and over again, we on this side of the aisle have said: We \ndon't expect the President to appoint judges that we agree with on most \nthings. In fact, for 200 judges, the vast majority of us have voted for \njudges with whom we don't agree on many issues.\n  The point is, to blame these vacancies, as my friend from Arizona \ntried to do, on the Senators, when the President refuses to just pick \nup the telephone and call them and say, ``How do we work this out,'' is \nvery unfair.\n  I ask my colleague, once again, is he willing--and is Senator \nStabenow, to his knowledge, willing--to sit down with the White House \nand come up with a compromise to fill these vacancies and that these \nvacancies don't have to remain vacant except for almost the \nintransigence of the White House to say, ``If you don't do it our way, \nwe are not doing it any way''? Am I wrong in that assumption?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from New York is decidedly right. We have \nexpressed that willingness. There have been a number of suggestions \nwhich have been made for compromise. One of the suggestions which we \nhave made was that there be a bipartisan commission appointed in \nMichigan to make recommendations to the White House to fill these \nvacancies. The recommendations do not have to include these two women. \nBipartisan commissions have been appointed in other States without this \nkind of a deadlock existing but simply to promote bipartisanship. That \nsuggestion has been rejected by the White House.\n  There was another suggestion that was made by Senator Leahy when he \nwas chairman of the Judiciary Committee for that period of time the \nDemocrats were in the majority. That suggestion was actually supported \nby the then-Republican Governor of Michigan. There was a recommendation \nby then-Chairman Leahy as to how to resolve this issue. That was also\n\n[[Page S8521]]\n\nrejected by the White House. We continue to be open to suggestions to \nfill these vacancies, but we are deeply of the belief that the tactic \nthat was used to deny hearings to qualified women--one of whom is a \nMichigan court of appeals judge and the other one of whom is a \ncelebrated appellate lawyer in front of the Sixth Circuit--should not \nsucceed. Maybe it succeeds in some places where there are not Senators \nin those States who will object because the new President of their \nparty picks somebody they like and may have recommended.\n  But in a situation like this, when you have the advise-and-consent \nclause in the Constitution, and where there has been this kind of a \ntactic used, which the White House acknowledges was unfair--Judge \nGonzalez has acknowledged that that tactic of denying hearings was \nunfair--simply to then fill the vacancies that were unfairly created is \nnot something we can simply roll over and accept.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield further?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for his steadfastness. He is hardly \na person with a reputation of being unwilling to compromise and work \nthings out. To my knowledge, he loves to do that kind of thing.\n  I will make one more point before yielding the floor. This involves \nmy previous discussion with the Senator from Arizona, to corroborate \nand clarify the Record. There have been 35 court of appeals judges \nconfirmed under President Bush. There were 65 in the 2 Clinton terms, \ntwice as long. At least thus far, we are doing a better job confirming \nPresident Bush's court of appeals nominees than the previous Senates \ndid in confirming President Clinton's. The numbers are fairly \ncomparable, with President Bush doing a little bit better.\n  With that, I yield back to my colleague and tell him I fully support \nhim in his quest for some degree of fairness and comity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from New York.\n  Mr. President, I discussed with the Senator from New York the \nsituation and the background relative to these Michigan vacancies. Two \nwomen, Helene White, a court of appeals judge, and Kathleen McCree \nLewis, well known in Michigan as a very effective advocate--\nparticularly appellate advocacy--were nominated by President Clinton to \nbe on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Judge White was denied a hearing for over 4 years, which is the \nlongest time anyone has ever awaited a hearing in the Senate. She was \nnever given a hearing by the Judiciary Committee. Kathleen McCree Lewis \nwaited over a year and a half without a hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  For a time, there was a refusal to return blue slips on these two \nnominees by my then-colleague Spence Abraham. But even after Senator \nAbraham returned the blue slips in the spring of 2000, the women were \nnot given hearings. They never got a vote in the Judiciary Committee or \non the floor.\n  That distortion of the judicial nominating process was unfair to the \ntwo nominees. It deprived the previous administration of consideration \nby the Senate of those two nominees. Senator Stabenow and I have \nobjected to proceeding to the current nominees until a just resolution \nis achieved.\n  Moving forward without resolving the impasse in a bipartisan manner \ncould indeed deepen partisan differences and make future efforts to \nresolve this matter more difficult. I have said repeatedly that the \nnumber of Michigan vacancies on the Sixth Circuit provides an unusual \nopportunity for bipartisan compromise.\n  Judge Helene White was nominated to a vacancy on the Sixth Circuit on \nJanuary 7, 1997. I returned my blue slip on Judge White's nomination. \nThe junior Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, did not. More than 10 \nmonths later, on October 22, 1997, Senator Leahy, as ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, delivered what would be the first of at least \n16 statements on the Senate floor, made over a 4-year period regarding \nSixth Circuit nominations in Michigan. He called for the committee to \nact on Judge White's nomination. His appeal, like others that were to \nfollow, was unsuccessful.\n  For instance, in October of 1998, more than a year and a half after \nJudge White was nominated, Senator Leahy returned to the floor, where \nhe warned the following:\n\n       In each step of the process, judicial nominees are being \n     delayed and stalled.\n\n  His plea was ignored. The 105th Congress ended without a hearing for \nJudge White.\n  On January 26, 1999, the beginning of the next Congress, President \nClinton again submitted Judge White's nomination. That day, I sent one \nof many notes to both Senator Abraham and to the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. In that letter, I said the 105th Congress had \nended without a Judiciary Committee hearing for Judge White and \nsuggested that fundamental fairness dictated there be an early hearing \nin the 106th Congress. Again, no hearing.\n  On March 1, 1999, Judge Cornelia Kennedy took senior status, opening \na second Michigan vacancy on the Sixth Circuit. The next day, Senator \nLeahy returned to the floor, repeated his previous statement that \nnominations were being stalled, and raised Judge White's nomination as \nan example.\n  On September 16, 1999, President Clinton decided to nominate Kathleen \nMcCree Lewis to that second vacancy. Soon thereafter, within 2 weeks, I \nspoke with Senator Abraham about both nominations, the Lewis and the \nWhite nominations. It had been more than 2\\1/2\\ years since Judge White \nwas first nominated. Twice in the next month and a half, Senator Leahy \nurged the committee to act, calling the treatment of judicial nominees \nunconscionable.\n\n  On November 18, 1999, I again wrote to Senator Abraham and Chairman \nHatch, urging hearings in January 2000 for the two nominees. I then \nnoted that Judge White had been waiting for nearly 3 years for a \nhearing, and I stated that confirmation of the two women was essential \nfor fundamental fairness. My appeals were for naught, and 1999 ended \nwithout hearings in the Judiciary Committee.\n  In February of 2000, Senator Leahy spoke again on the floor about \nvacancies on the Sixth Circuit. A few weeks later, in February of 2000, \nI made a personal plea to Senator Abraham and Chairman Hatch to hold \nhearings on the Michigan nominees. Again, I was unsuccessful and no \nhearing was scheduled.\n  On March 20, the chief judge of the Sixth Circuit sent a letter to \nChairman Hatch expressing concerns about an alleged statement from a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee that ``due to partisan \nconsiderations,'' there would be no more hearings or votes on vacancies \nfor the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals during the Clinton \nadministration. The judge's concern would turn out to be well-founded.\n  On April 13, 2000, Senator Abraham returned his blue slips for both \nJudge White and Ms. Lewis without indicating his approval or \ndisapproval. The day Senator Abraham returned his blue slips, I spoke \nto Chairman Hatch and sent him a letter reminding him that blue slips \nhad now been returned, that objections had not been raised, expressed \nmy concern about the unconscionable length of time the nominations had \nbeen pending, and I urged that they be placed on the agenda of the next \nJudiciary Committee confirmation hearing.\n  Those efforts were unsuccessful. Two Michigan nominees were not \nplaced on the agenda. I tried again early May 2000. I sent another note \nto Chairman Hatch, but those nominations were not placed on the \ncommittee's hearing agenda then or ever.\n  Over the next several months, Senator Leahy went to the floor 10 more \ntimes to urge action on the Michigan nominees. More than once, I also \nraised the issue on the Senate floor.\n  In the fall of 2000, in a final attempt to move the nominations of \ntwo Michigan nominees, I met with the majority leader, Senator Lott, \nand Senator Daschle to discuss the situation. I sent a letter to the \nmajority leader urging him, stating, ``The nominees from Michigan are \nwomen of integrity and fairness. They have been stalled in this Senate \nfor an unconscionable amount of time without any stated reason.''\n  Neither the meeting with the majority leader nor the letter resulted \nin the Judiciary Committee holding hearings on these nominations, and \nthe 106th\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\nCongress ended without hearings for either woman.\n  Judge White's nomination was pending for more than 4 years, the \nlongest period of time of any circuit court nominee waiting for a \nhearing in the history of the Senate. And Ms. Lewis's nomination was \npending for over a year and a half.\n  There has been a great debate over the issue of blue slips. I am not \nsure this is the place for a lengthy debate on that issue, but I will \nsay there has not been a consistent policy, apparently, relative to \nblue slips, although it would seem as though the inconsistency has \nworked one way.\n  In 1997, when asked by a reporter about a Texas nominee opposed by \nthe Republican Senators from Texas, Chairman Hatch said the policy is \nthat if a Senator returns a negative blue slip, that person is going to \nbe dead. In October 7, 1999, Chairman Hatch said, with respect to the \nnomination of Judge Ronnie White:\n\n       I might add, had both home-State Senators been opposed to \n     Judge (Ronnie) White in committee, John White would never \n     have come to the floor under our rules. I have to say, that \n     would be true whether they are Democrat Senators or \n     Republican Senators. That has just been the way the Judiciary \n     Committee has operated. . . .\n\n  Apparently, it is not operating that way anymore because both \nMichigan Senators have objected to this nominee based on the reasons \nwhich I have set forth: that we cannot accept a tactic which keeps \nvacancies open, refusing hearings to the nominees of one President to \nkeep vacancies open so they can then be filled by another President. \nThat tactic should be stopped. It is not going to be stopped if these \nnominations are just simply approved without a compromise being worked \nout which would preserve a bipartisan spirit and the constitutional \nspirit about the appointment of Federal judges.\n  It is my understanding that not a single judicial nominee for \ndistrict or circuit courts--not one--got a Judiciary Committee hearing \nduring the Clinton administration if there was opposition from one home \nState Senator, let alone two. Now both home State Senators oppose \nproceeding with these judicial nominees absent a bipartisan approach.\n  Enough about blue slips. Senator Abraham then did return blue slips \nin April of 2000. He had marked them neither ``support'' nor \n``oppose'', but they were returned without a statement of opposition. \nAnd what happened? What happened is, even though those blue slips were \nreturned by Senator Abraham, there still were no hearings given to the \nMichigan nominees to the Sixth Circuit.\n\n  There was also an Ohio nominee named Kent Markus who was nominated to \nthe Sixth Circuit. In his case, both home State Senators indicated \ntheir approval of his nomination, but nonetheless, this Clinton nominee \nwas not granted a Judiciary Committee hearing, and his troubling \naccount of that experience shed some additional light on the Michigan \nsituation.\n  He testified before the Judiciary Committee last May, and said the \nfollowing. This is the Ohio Clinton nominee to the Sixth Circuit:\n\n       To their credit, Senator DeWine and his staff and Senator \n     Hatch's staff and others close to him were straight with me. \n     Over and over again they told me two things: One, there will \n     be no more confirmations to the Sixth Circuit during the \n     Clinton administration, and two, this has nothing to do with \n     you; don't take it personally--it doesn't matter who the \n     nominee is, what credentials they may have or what support \n     they may have.\n\n  Then Marcus went on. This is his testimony in front of the Judiciary \nCommittee:\n\n       On one occasion, Senator DeWine told me ``This is bigger \n     than you and it's bigger than me.'' Senator Kohl, who kindly \n     agreed to champion my nomination within the Judiciary \n     Committee, encountered a similar brick wall. . . . The fact \n     was, a decision had been made to hold the vacancies and see \n     who won the Presidential election. With a Bush win, all those \n     seats could go to Bush rather than Clinton nominees.\n\n  We are not alone in the view that what occurred with respect to these \nSixth Circuit nominees was fundamentally unfair. Even Judge Gonzales, \nthe current White House counsel, has acknowledged it was wrong for the \nRepublican-led Senate to delay action on judicial nominees for partisan \nreasons, at one point even calling the treatment of some nominees \n``inexcusable,'' to use his word.\n  The tactic used against the two Michigan nominees should not be \nallowed to succeed, but as determined as we are that it not succeed, we \nare equally determined that there be a bipartisan solution, both to \nresolve a current impasse, but also for the sake of this process. There \nis such an opportunity to have a bipartisan solution because there are \nfour Michigan vacancies on the Sixth Circuit.\n  In order to achieve a fair resolution, Senator Stabenow and I have \nmade a number of proposals, and we have accepted a number of proposals. \nWe proposed a bipartisan commission to recommend nominees to the \nPresident. Similar commissions have been used in other States. The \ncommission would not be limited to any particular people. The two \nnominees of President Clinton may not be recommended by a bipartisan \ncommission. Of greater importance, the existence of recommendations of \na commission are not binding on the President.\n  The White House, in response to this suggestion--again, even though \nit was used in other States--has said that the constitutional power to \nappoint judges rests with the President, and of course it does. So \nthere is no way anyone would propose or should propose that a \nbipartisan commission be able to make recommendations which would be \nbinding upon the President of the United States, nor is the \nrecommendation binding upon the Senate of the United States. It is \nsimply a recommendation. This has occurred in other States under these \nand similar circumstances, and there is no reason why it should not be \nused here.\n  We also, again, were given a suggestion by the then-chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, who has tried his very best to \nfigure out a solution to this deadlock. Senator Leahy made a suggestion \nwhich was acceptable to both Senator Stabenow and me. It was acceptable \neven to the then-Republican Governor of the State of Michigan, Governor \nEngler, but it was rejected by the White House.\n\n  We have an unusual opportunity to obtain a bipartisan solution. It is \nan opportunity which has been afforded to us by the large number of \nvacancies in Michigan on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Finding \nthat bipartisan path would be of great benefit, not just as a solution \nto this problem but to set a positive tone for the resolution of other \njudicial disputes as well.\n  In addition to the points which I have made, we made the additional \npoint at the Judiciary Committee relative to the qualifications of \nJudge Saad. We indicated then and we went into some detail then that it \nis our belief that his judicial temperament falls below the standard \nexpected of nominees to the second highest court in this country.\n  The Judiciary Committee considered a number of issues relating to \nthat subject, judicial temperament or shortfall thereof, of this \nnominee in a closed session of the Judiciary Committee. I will not go \ninto detail further, except to say we have made that point. We feel \nvery keenly about that issue.\n  The vote in the Judiciary Committee was 10 to 9 to report out this \nnomination. It was a vote along party lines. The temperament issue, \nhowever, was raised, and properly so, in the Judiciary Committee, as \nwell as this basic underlying issue which I have spent some time \noutlining this afternoon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            The Iraq Debate\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter of \ngreat relevance to the debate about the war in Iraq and the recent \nSenate report on the intelligence community. This report has \nilluminated a subject of considerable controversy and partisan \ncriticism of the President.\n  I also rise to speak about the importance of maintaining a basic \nstandard of fairness in American politics.\n  I am talking about the controversy that erupted over the infamous \n``16\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\nwords'' in the State of the Union Address that Senator Kerry and \nnumerous Senate Democrats and the media cited in accusations that the \nPresident misled the country into war.\n  On January 28, 2003, President Bush told the American people that:\n\n       The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein \n     recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \n     Africa.\n\n  That was in the President's State of the Union address in January \n2003.\n  When doubt surfaced about some--but not all--of the evidence \nsupporting this claim, Joe Wilson, who had traveled to Niger to \ninvestigate an aspect of the intelligence, penned an op-ed in the New \nYork Times accusing the administration of manipulating intelligence.\n  Not pausing for a full investigation, a partisan parade of Democratic \nSenators and Presidential candidates took to the streets to criticize \nthe President and accuse him of misleading the Nation into war, a very \nserious charge.\n  Sensing a scandal, the media pounced.\n  NBC aired 40 reports on Wilson's claim. CBS aired 30 reports, while \nABC aired 18.\n  Newspapers did not hold back either. The New York Times printed 70 \narticles reinforcing these allegations, while the Washington Post \nprinted 98.\n  Pundits and politicians gorged themselves on the story.\n\n  Joe Wilson rose to great fame on the back of this inflammatory \ncharge. He wrote a book for which he received a five-figure advance, he \nwas lionized by the liberal left, and he became an adviser to Senator \nKerry's Presidential campaign, a campaign to which he is also a \nfinancial contributor.\n  Of course, we now know Wilson's allegation was false. And we know the \nchief proponent of this charge, Joe Wilson, has been proven to be a \nliar.\n  After more than a year of misrepresentation and obfuscation, two \nbipartisan reports from two different countries have thoroughly \nrepudiated Wilson's assertions and determined that President Bush's 16-\nword statement about Iraq's effort to procure uranium from Niger was \nwell founded.\n  In fact, the real 16-word statement we should focus on is the one \nfrom Lord Butler's comprehensive report about British intelligence. \nHere is what he had to say:\n\n       We conclude that the statement in President Bush's State of \n     the Union address . . . is well founded.\n\n  Let me repeat Lord Butler's statement:\n\n       We conclude that the statement in President Bush's State of \n     the Union address . . . is well founded.\n\n  Those are 16 words to remember.\n  It is now worth the Senate's time to consider Mr. Wilson's claims.\n  Claim No. 1 is Wilson's assertion that his Niger trip report should \nhave debunked the State of the Union claim.\n  On this bold allegation, the Senate's bipartisan report included this \nimportant conclusion:\n\n       The report on the former Ambassador's trip to Niger, \n     disseminated in March 2002, did not change any analysts' \n     assessments of the Iraq-Niger uranium deal. For most \n     analysts, the information in the report lent more credibility \n     to the original CIA reports on the uranium deal. . . .\n\n  Let me repeat:\n\n       For most analysts, the information in the report lent more \n     credibility to the original CIA reports on the uranium deal. \n     . . .\n\n  Claim No. 2 is similarly egregious.\n  According to the Washington Post, ``Wilson provided misleading \ninformation to the Washington Post last June. He said then that the \nNiger intelligence was based on a document that had clearly been forged \n. . . '' But ``the documents . . . were not in U.S. hands until eight \nmonths after Wilson made his trip to Niger.''\n  Predictably, this bombshell appeared on page A9. Page A9, Mr. \nPresident. After this story had previously enjoyed extensive coverage \non Page A1.\n  There were indeed document forgeries, but these documents were not \nthe only evidence that convinced foreign intelligence services about \nIraq's efforts to purchase uranium.\n  Damningly, the former Prime Minister of Niger himself believed the \nIraqis wanted to purchase uranium and according to the Financial Times:\n\n       European intelligence officers have now revealed that three \n     years before the fake documents became public, human and \n     electronic intelligence sources from a number of countries \n     picked up repeated discussion of an illicit trade in uranium \n     from Niger. One of the customers discussed by the traders was \n     Iraq.\n\n  And the Wall Street Journal has reported that:\n\n       French and British intelligence (services) separately told \n     the U.S. about possible Iraqi attempts to buy uranium in \n     Niger.--7/19/04\n\n  Mr. President, when the French corroborate a story that Iraq is \nseeking WMD, you're probably in the right ballpark.\n  Indeed, the Senate's bipartisan report concluded that at the time:\n\n     it was reasonable for analysts to assess that Iraq may have \n     been seeking uranium from Africa based on CIA reporting and \n     other available intelligence.\n\n  Claim No. 3 is Wilson's repeated denial that his wife, Valerie Plame, \na CIA analyst, never recommended him for the Niger trip.\n  In his ironically titled book, The Politics of Truth, Wilson claimed:\n\n       Valerie had nothing to do with the matter She definitely \n     had not proposed that I make the trip.\n\n  In fact, the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Report includes testimony \nthat Plame ``offered up his name'' and quotes a memo that Plame wrote \nthat asserts ``my husband has good relations with Niger officials.''\n  The New York Times recently reported that:\n\n       Instead of assigning a trained intelligence officer to the \n     Niger case, though, the C.I.A. sent a former American \n     Ambassador, Joseph Wilson, to talk to former Niger officials. \n     His wife, Valerie Plame, was an officer in the \n     counterproliferation division, and she had suggested that he \n     be sent to Niger, according to the Senate report.\n\n  That story can be read on Page A14 of the New York Times.\n  Claim No. 4 is Wilson's allegation that the CIA warned the White \nHouse about the Niger claim and that the White House manipulated \nintelligence to bolster its argument for war. Wilson charged:\n\n       The problem is not the intelligence but the manipulation of \n     intelligence. That will all come out despite (Sen.) Roberts' \n     effort to shift the blame. This was and is a White House \n     issue, not a CIA issue.\n       This reckless charge by Wilson was, we know, repeated by \n     many of the President's critics.\n\n  Of course, it is not true. It simply is not true.\n  The Senate Intelligence Report determined the White House did not \nmanipulate intelligence, but rather that the CIA had provided faulty \ninformation to policymakers. And the Washington Post recently reported \nthat ``Contrary to Wilson's assertions the CIA did not tell the White \nHouse it had qualms about the reliability of the Africa intelligence.'' \n(Susan Schmidt, Washington Post, A9, 7/10/04)\n  Again: Front page news on Page A9.\n  According to the New York Times and the Senate Intelligence Report, \nJoe Wilson admitted to Committee staff that some of his assertions in \nhis book may have, quote, ``involved a little literary flair.''\n  ``Literary flair'' is a fancy way of saying what ordinary people \nshooting the breeze on their front porches all across America call by \nits real name: a lie. That is what it is.\n  So, the truth is Joe Wilson did not expose the Administration; in \nfact, he has been exposed as a liar.\n  He misrepresented the findings of his trip to Niger, he fabricated \nstories about recognizing forgeries he never saw, he falsely accused \nthe White House of manipulating intelligence, and he misrepresented his \nwife's role in promoting him for the mission.\n  Joe Wilson's false claims have been exposed, but the networks aren't \nrushing to correct the story. Will NBC correct the 40 times it ran \nWilson's claims, will CBS correct the 30 times, will ABC correct the \n18?\n  To be sure, a few networks and newspapers have noted the Senate \nIntelligence Report conclusions, but where is the balance? Where are \nthe lead stories? Where are the banner headlines? In short, where is \nthe fairness?\n  Sadly, that is the state of political coverage in this election year. \nScreaming charges about the President made on A1, repudiation of the \ncharges on A9, if they are made at all. Is that fair?\n  What of the political campaigns? It's a small wonder the Democrat \ncandidates for President and their supporters aggressively picked up \nthe Wilson claim. After all, the media was driving the train, so why \nnot hitch a ride?\n  However, now that Wilson's false claims have been exposed, shouldn't \na\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\nbasic sense of fairness prevail? Shouldn't the partisans admit they \nwere wrong, too?\n  For example, some of my colleagues in the Senate should ask \nthemselves if it's now appropriate to distance themselves from Joe \nWilson's distortions. Speaking on this floor on March 23, the Minority \nLeader praised Wilson and accused the Administration of retaliating \nagainst him:\n\n       When Ambassador Joe Wilson told the truth about the \n     administration's misleading claims about Iraq, Niger, and \n     uranium, the people around the President didn't respond with \n     facts. Instead they publicly disclosed that Ambassador \n     Wilson's wife was a deep-cover CIA agent.\n\n  Just last month, Senator Daschle noted:\n\n       Sunlight, it's been said, is the best disinfectant. But for \n     too long, the administration has been able to keep Congress \n     and the American people in the dark . . . other serious \n     matters, such as the manipulation of intelligence about Iraq, \n     have received only fitful attention.\n\n  I hope he will acknowledge now the inaccuracy of his statement, and \nallow the sunlight to shine on Ambassador Wilson's fictions.\n  Senator Kerry welcomed Wilson onto his campaign team of advisors, and \nhis campaign hosts Wilson's website, which carries a disclaimer that it \nis ``Paid for by John Kerry for President, Inc.''\n  The Kerry/Wilson website includes a collection of articles by and \nabout Joe Wilson that propound his baseless allegations against the \nBush Administration, which I don't have time to go into today. Suffice \nit to say that showcasing Wilson's discredited views should at least be \nmet with some acknowledgement that he was wrong all along.\n  Perhaps we can learn a thing or two from the recent episode involving \nSandy Berger.\n  Berger, an advisor to President Clinton and Senator Kerry stepped \ndown from the Kerry campaign. He's under investigation for removing and \npossibly destroying classified documents being reviewed by the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  Were I to engage in a little literary flair, I might say it seems \nSandy walked out of the National Archives with some PDBs in his BVDs, \nand some classified docs in his socks. At any rate, I think it is \nappropriate, and politically wise, for him to leave the Kerry campaign.\n  It is clear Senator Kerry approved of Mr. Berger's departure. He \nshould certainly ask the discredited Mr. Wilson to leave the team as \nwell.\n  I close with a simple observation. I believe vigorous political \ndisagreements are the heart of a strong democracy. When our debates are \nrooted in fact, impassioned political disagreement makes our country \nstronger.\n  I also believe Americans value fundamental fairness--fundamental \nfairness--and deserve a news media that reflects this value. How is it \nfair to report an accusation with blaring page 1 headlines and around-\nthe-clock television coverage and not give a slam-dunk repudiation of \nthe charge the same kind of attention?\n  We will watch over the next few days to see if fundamental fairness \nwill be met, and if those who championed Mr. Wilson's charges will set \nthe record straight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished majority \nwhip, the assistant floor leader, for what is an excellent set of \nremarks, long overdue and very much on point.\n  I am on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. I remember when \nthis whole brouhaha came up, how demeaned the President of the United \nStates was, not only by the media but by this man, Ambassador Wilson, \nwho immediately took great glee in slamming the President because of 16 \nwords that happened to be accurate. We could not talk about it before \nnow, but the British findings show the President was accurate. And I, \nfor one, am very happy for the Butler report and for what came out.\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky that this was \npage 1 offensive media to the President of the United States, \nundermining what he was saying, what he was doing, and what we have \nbacked him on this floor in doing. Now that this man has been caught in \nthese shall I say discrepancies--some might be a lot stronger than \nthat--we see hardly any comments about it. But having said that, I have \nto say I have been reading the Washington Post, and they have acted \nquite responsibly. Many of the other media have not acted that way. But \nthe distinguished Senator from Kentucky covered this matter very well.\n  I feel sorry whenever partisan politics trumps truth, whenever, in \nthe interest of trying to get a political advantage from one side or \nthe other, anybody of the stature of a former Ambassador of the United \nStates would participate in distorting the record, especially when \nhe knew better.\n\n  So again, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah. Hopefully, \nthis will be the beginning of a wave of coverage both on the networks \nand in the newspapers on correcting the record and making it clear that \nMr. Wilson's assertions are demonstrably false and have been so found \nby two different important reports.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I want to comment \nthat anybody with brains, when they saw that Iraqi team and knew of the \nIraqi team--of course, they could not say much about it until now--knew \nthe Iraqi team had gone over to Niger, why else would they have spent \nthe time? Niger had hardly any exportable products other than food, \nexcept for yellowcake uranium. Why would they waste their time going to \nNiger?\n  I remember at the time thinking: This smells, this argument that the \nPresident has misused 16 words and that the CIA should be held totally \nresponsible because those 16 words were wrong. And now we find they \nwere not necessarily wrong. In fact, they were right.\n  That smacks of this whole matter of partisanship with regard to the \ncurrent Presidential race. We have our two colleagues on the other side \nwho are now running for President and Vice President who voted for our \nactions in Iraq. At least one of them spoke out on how serious the \nactions of the Iraqi regime under Saddam Hussein were, voted for it, \nand now they are trying to weasel out because they voted against \nfunding it, saying they wanted to get it done right. Well, that is a \nnice argument, except that we have well over 100,000 of our young men \nand women over there, and others as well, who are put at risk if we do \nnot fund the effort once it has started.\n  Secondly, I heard lots of comments from the other side as to weapons \nof mass destruction. They knew Saddam Hussein had them in the early \n1990s. The U.N. knew they had them. Almost every Democrat of substance \nspoke out that he had them, were concerned about the fact that he had \nweapons of mass destruction, that he was trying to obtain weapons of \nmass destruction, including the distinguished candidate for President \nin the Democratic Party.\n  And to get cheap political advantage, they have tried to undermine \nthe President of the United States because, so far, we have not been \nable to discover except small evidences of actual weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  What has not been said, for the most part, is any basement in \nBaghdad, any swimming pool in Baghdad--a city the size of Los Angeles--\ncould store all of the biological weapons necessary to kill a whole \ncity such as Baghdad or Los Angeles and could store all of the chemical \nweapons that could cause havoc all over the world. The fact we have not \nfound them yet does not mean they are not there.\n  It does appear the nuclear program Saddam Hussein had authorized in \nthe early 1990s--and had been well on its way to accomplishing the \ndevelopment of a nuclear device--was not as forward advanced as many of \nus thought. But there is no question they had the scientists in place. \nThere is no question they had the knowledge in place. There is no \nquestion they had the documents in place. There is no question he \nwanted to do that, no question that he would have done it if he could.\n  I think as time goes on, more and more information will come out that \nwill indicate that the President of the United States has taken the \nright course, with the help of this whole body. It seems strange to me \nthat so many are trying to weasel out of the position they took earlier \nin backing the President of the United States and in backing our \ncountry and in backing\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\nour soldiers, and are trying to make political advantage out of some of \nthe difficulties we have over there.\n\n  Now that political advantage has been tremendously diminished--\ntremendously diminished--as of the time that jurisdiction was turned \nover to the Iraqis. They are now running their country, with us as \nbackup to help them, to help bring about the freedoms all of us in \nAmerica take for granted every day. I doubt they will ever have the \ntotal freedoms we take for granted every day, but they have a lot more \nfreedom now than they ever even contemplated or thought possible under \nthe Saddam Hussein regime.\n  That is because of our country. That is because of our young men and \nwomen who have sacrificed. I particularly resent it when, for cheap \npolitical advantage, some of our colleagues get up and moan and groan \nabout what is going on over there. Every time they do it, it undermines \nthe very nature of what our young men and women are sacrificing to \naccomplish.\n  Fortunately, it is the few who do that. But nobody on this floor on \neither side should be undermining our young men and women over in Iraq, \nwho are heroically serving, some dying--over 900, as we stand here \ntoday.\n  Cheap political advantage--that is the era we are in, I take it. Both \nsides from time to time have used efforts to accomplish cheap political \nadvantage, but I have never heard it worse than what I have seen this \nyear against this President. I have never seen a more vicious group of \npeople than the outside commentators who hate President Bush. In all \nhonesty, we can sit back and let these terrorists run around this world \nand do whatever they want to do and act like it won't affect us or we \ncan take action to try to solve the problem.\n  It is a long-term problem; it is not a short-term one. It is going to \ntake a lot of courage and good leadership, and it is going to take \npeople who don't just quit and hope they will go away. They are not \ngoing to go away. These people are committed ideologues. They are \ntheocratic ideologues. And in many respects throughout the history of \nthe world, that is where most of the really dangerous difficulties \ncome. It is through vicious, radical, theocratic ideologues. Frankly, \nthat is what we are facing. Anybody who thinks this is going to be just \nan easy slam dunk to resolve has not looked at any of the intelligence, \nhas not thought it through, and really has not spent enough time \nworrying about it on the Senate floor or otherwise.\n  I have not always agreed with our President. I probably have been \nwrong when I haven't. The fact is, I sure agree with him in supporting \nour troops and supporting freedom in the world. Think about it. If \nSaddam Hussein had been allowed to go on unchecked, not only would \nmillions of Iraqis be kept in terrible conditions, upwards of a million \nkilled viciously by that regime, but ultimately he would have developed \nnuclear weapons, as he was trying to do in the early 1990s and came \nclose to doing by everybody's measure who knew anything about it. Had \nthat occurred and we didn't do anything about it, guess who would have \nhad to. And if they had to, as they did in the early 1980s in taking \nout the nuclear reactor, we would have world war III without question.\n  So there is a lot involved here. This is not some simple itty-bitty \nproblem, nor is it something conjured up by the President of the United \nStates, nor is it something that really intelligent, honest, bipartisan \npeople should ignore. We need to work together in the best interests of \nthis country and of the world to make sure that these madmen do not \ncontrol the world and continue to control our destinies and that these \nmadmen don't get so powerful that they can do just about anything they \nwant to in the world. You can see how they try to intimidate just by \nthreats and even action. Well, great countries cannot give in to \nthreats, nor can we give in to offensive action that needs to be dealt \nwith. This country has led the world in standing for freedom.\n  I have to say that I loved the comment of Colin Powell when somebody \nin a foreign land snidely accused the United States of attempted \nhegemony or trying to be imperial. He basically said: Our young men and \nwomen have given their lives all over this world for freedom, and the \nonly ground that we have ever asked in return is that in which we bury \nour dead. That is true to this day. I think if the rest of the world \nlooks at it honestly, they will have to say America really does stand \nfor that principle: freedom and decency and honor and justice, not just \nin this land but for other lands as well.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, we are on the Saad nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. As we begin the debate on this nomination, I want to put \nit in the larger context of the judicial nomination process.\n  On May 9, 2001, President Bush nominated 11 outstanding individuals \nto serve on the Federal bench. I would note that this was months \nearlier than previous new Presidents, giving the Senate plenty of time \nto begin considering his nominees. In the 3-plus years--over 1,100 \ndays--since those nominations, the Senate has confirmed only 8 of the \nfirst 11 nominees. By comparison, the previous 3 Presidents saw their \nfirst 11 appeals court nominees all confirmed in an average of just 81 \ndays following their nomination. We are now 1,100 days past. Not so for \nPresident Bush.\n  While three of his first nominees were confirmed within 6 months, \nmany others waited for 2 years or more before they were confirmed. But \neven this long wait was better than the fate of the three remaining \nnominees who have been subjected to filibusters.\n  One of those, Miguel Estrada, waited for more than 2\\1/2\\ years and \nbecame the target of the first filibuster against a judicial nominee in \nAmerican history. This Hispanic man deserved better treatment, but he \nwas mistreated for crass partisan purposes. Though a bipartisan \nmajority of Senators supported Miguel Estrada, he had to withdraw after \nan unprecedented seven cloture votes, meaning seven attempts to try and \nget to a vote where he could have a vote up or down. Those seven \ncloture votes, any one of which would have ended the filibuster and \nallowed that vote up or down, he went through seven of them, the most \nin the history of this country for any judicial nominee. By the way, \nthe only nominees who have ever had to go through cloture votes in a \nreal filibuster or in real filibusters have been President Bush's \nnominees. We have had cloture votes before, but there never was any \nquestion that the nominees were going to get a vote in the end.\n  Several weeks prior to those first nominations, shortly after \nPresident Bush's inauguration, the Democratic leader stated that the \nSenate minority would use ``whatever means necessary'' to block \njudicial nominees they did not like. We have seen the fulfillment of \nthat statement as a variety of techniques have been employed to delay \nor obstruct the confirmation of nominees, including bottling up \nnominees in committee, injecting ideology into the confirmation \nprocess, seeking all unpublished opinions, requesting nominees to \nproduce Government-owned confidential memoranda, repeated rounds of \nwritten questions, and multiple filibusters. It is a sad commentary on \nthe deterioration of the judicial confirmation process that we are now \napproaching double-digit filibusters in the U.S. Senate of 10 judges or \nmore.\n  Let me reiterate a few points which I made yesterday concerning the \nprocess of confirming judges. Despite this range and frequency of \nobstructionist tactics which we have seen, some of them entirely new in \nAmerican history, the Senate has confirmed 198 judges during the past 3 \nyears. I will note that this is behind the pace of President Clinton in \nhis first term. And the minority has made even these confirmations as \ndifficult as possible. Yet some of my colleagues think that the \nconstitutional duty to advise and consent has a time clock attached to \nit and that the time has run out for the Senate to do its duty. I \nreject this analysis, either that the previous agreement to allow the \nvote on the 25 judges was the sum total of our work in the Senate or \nthe notion that judicial nominations cannot be confirmed after some \nmythical deadline is announced.\n  There are plenty of examples of confirmation of judges in \nPresidential election years during the fall, some of which occurred \nduring or after the election was held. Stephen Breyer is a perfect \nillustration. He now sits on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\nStephen Breyer was confirmed to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThat is just one example. I was the one who helped make that possible \nbecause Reagan had been elected.\n  The Republicans had won the Senate for the first time in decades. \nThere was no real reason to allow what many thought was a liberal \nDemocrat to be appointed to any court at that point or to be confirmed \nto any court at that point. But Stephen Breyer was an exceptional man. \nHe not only had been chief of staff to Senator Kennedy on the Judiciary \nCommittee, and not only was he a Harvard law professor and a brilliant \nlegal theorist, he was a very honest, decent, honorable man. I helped \ncarry that fight. It wasn't much of a fight in the end because the \nRepublicans agreed, and we confirmed Stephen Breyer late in the year \nafter the election took place.\n  I helped facilitate that confirmation which took place after the \nNovember 1980 presidential election. That nomination was made by \nPresident Carter, who had just been defeated by President Reagan, and \nyet we acted on it. I note that Senator Thurmond was the ranking member \nat that time. Yet his name continues to be invoked as the authority of \na binding precedent. I reject the notion of this purported rule and \nwould hope that the service of the longest serving and oldest Member to \nhave served in this body would not be used in the manner I have heard \nrepeated in the committee and on the Senate floor.\n  Besides, Senator Thurmond was chairman of the committee, and at one \ntime he did say: We have had enough confirmations, and this is what we \nare going to do. We are going to stop this year.\n  But even then he didn't.\n  Under the Senate Democrats' theory, the Senate has apparently \nconfirmed enough judges. The remaining vacancies, half of which are \nclassified as judicial emergencies because of the backlog, just don't \nseem to matter to them. According to their analysis, because of some \nacceptable vacancy rate or because of the mythical time clock, the \nremaining 25 judges pending before the Senate should be dismissed out \nof hand. This is not logical, nor is it the proper approach to take \nunder the Constitution.\n  I will also respond to some of the arguments made that Senate \nDemocrats have only rejected six or seven nominees. The fact is, the \nSenate has not rejected the nominees which have been filibustered. If \nthey have the votes to defeat the nominee, then let those votes be cast \nand let the results stand. But a minority of Senators are denying the \nSenate from either confirming or defeating some of these nominees. That \nis what we are seeking today--an up or down vote.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, one of the battlegrounds of this \njudicial obstructionism has been the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nDespite President Bush's attempt to fill four critical vacancies on \nthat court, and two district vacancies in Michigan, these nominations \nremained stalled in the Senate. There are many factors contributing to \nthe stalemate we have found ourselves in with regard to confirmations \non the Sixth Circuit, some of which go back to the Clinton \nadministration. I will discuss that in detail at a later point, but for \nnow, everyone knows that I have been working to reach an accommodation \nthat would help move this process forward.\n  I have great respect for Senators Levin and Stabenow. I have worked \nfor many years with Senator Levin and have reached agreements with him \non many difficult issues. For example, Senator Levin and I worked with \nSenators Biden and Moynihan to dramatically revise the regulations \npertaining to heroin addiction treatment. That effort is paying off. I \nremain hopeful that we can do so here.\n  On this issue, I have continued to work with Senators Levin and \nStabenow. I have carefully listened to their concerns. And while the \nMichigan Senators' negative blue slips were accorded substantial \nweight--that is why this has taken so long--I delayed scheduling a \nhearing on any of the Michigan nominees because of the Michigan \nSenators' views. Their negative blue slips are not dispositive under \nthe committee's Kennedy-Biden-Hatch blue slip policy. It was started by \nSenator Kennedy, confirmed by Senator Biden, and I have gone along with \nmy two liberal colleagues on the committee.\n  I don't think there is any doubt that I have attempted to reach an \naccommodation that would fill these seats. Unfortunately, my efforts \nhave not been successful. I remain hopeful that we can come to a \nresolution, and I will keep trying to do so. But I must emphasize, in \nmy view, integral to any accommodation is the confirmation of Judge \nSaad, Judge Griffin, and Judge McKeague--at least votes up or down. \nSince they have a majority of people in the Senate who would vote for \nthem, I believe they would be confirmed in the end.\n  These are exceptional individuals. Judge Saad and Judge Griffin both \nserve on the Michigan Court of Appeals. Judge McKeague is a district \nJudge for the United States District Court for the Western District of \nMichigan. He was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n  It has been nearly 1 year since the Judiciary Committee first \nconsidered the nomination of Henry W. Saad, who has been nominated for \na position on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. \nThis is an historic appointment. Upon his confirmation, Judge Saad will \nbecome the first Arab-American to sit on the Sixth Circuit, which \ncovers the States of Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan.\n  It is long past time for the Senate to consider Judge Saad's \nnomination. He was first nominated to fill a Federal judgeship in 1992, \nwhen the first President Bush nominated him for a seat on the United \nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The fact \nthat he did not get a hearing may have worked to his benefit, since he \nwas appointed in 1994 by Governor Engler to a seat on the Michigan \nCourt of Appeals. He was elected to retain his seat in 1996 and again \nin 2002, receiving broad bipartisan support in each election.\n  On November 8, 2001, President Bush nominated Judge Saad for a seat \non the Sixth Circuit, the position for which we are considering him \ntoday. When no action was taken on his nomination during the 107th \nCongress, President Bush renominated him to the Sixth Circuit on \nJanuary 7, 2003. All told, Judge Saad has been nominated for a seat on \nthe Federal bench three separate times. It is high time the Senate \ncompleted action on his nomination.\n  Judge Saad's credentials for this position are impeccable. He \ngraduated with distinction from Wayne State University in 1971 and \nmagna cum laude from Wayne State University Law School in 1974. He then \nspent 20 years in the private practice of law with one of Michigan's \nleading firms, Dickinson, Wright, specializing in product liability, \ncommercial litigation, employment law, labor law, school law and libel \nlaw. In addition, he has served as an adjunct professor at both the \nUniversity of Detroit Mercy School of Law and at Wayne State University \nLaw School.\n  Judge Saad is active in legal and community affairs. Some of the \norganizations he has been involved with include educational television, \nwhere he serves as a trustee, the American Heart Association, Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving, and other nonprofit organizations that serve the \nelderly and impaired. As a leader in the Arab-American community, Judge \nSaad has worked with a variety of organizations in promoting \nunderstanding and good relations throughout all ethnic, racial, and \nreligious communities. He is an outstanding role model.\n  Judge Saad enjoys broad bipartisan support throughout his State, as \nevidenced by endorsements in his last election by the Michigan State \nAFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers of Michigan. He has received dozens \nof letters of support from leading political figures, fellow judges, \nlaw professors, private attorneys, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, \nand a variety of other groups.\n  Let me quote from just a few of the letters received in support of \nJudge Saad's nomination. Maura D. Corrigan, Chief Justice of the \nMichigan Supreme Court, wrote: ``Henry Saad has distinguished himself \nas a fair-minded and independent jurist who respects the rule of law, \nthe independence of the judiciary, and the constitutional role of the \njudiciary in our tripartite form of government. . . . Judge Saad is a \npublic servant of exceptional intelligence\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\nand integrity. He has the respect of the bench and the bar.'' Other \njudges have written that he is ``a hard-working and honorable \nindividual'' and that he is ``an outstanding appellate jurist with a \nstrong work ethic.'' Roman Gribbs, a lifelong Democrat and retired \njudge, wrote, ``Henry Saad is a man of personal and professional \nintegrity, is fair-minded, very conscientious and is above all, an \noutstanding jurist.'' Judge Saad has clearly earned the respect and \nadmiration of his colleagues on the Michigan State court bench. His \nnomination deserves consideration by this Senate.\n  I hope that our consideration of Judge Saad's nomination is not \novershadowed by collateral arguments about the propriety of his \nnomination, the committee blue slip process, an attack on his personal \ncharacter and qualifications, or other diversionary arguments. The \nquestion before the Senate is the qualifications of Judge Saad to sit \non the Federal bench.\n  We have heard from the other side about the President just \nsteamrolling these nominations, without consulting with the home state \nSenators.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I join the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, in supporting Henry Saad for the \nU.S. Circuit Court for the Sixth Circuit. He is an exceptionally \nqualified nominee who has great support in his area. He graduated with \ndistinction from Wayne State University and then magna cum laude at \nWayne State University School of Law. He has served for a decade on the \nMichigan Court of Appeals. He was nominated for this position by former \nPresident Bush 10 years ago and was held up, blocked, and did not get a \nhearing, and now he is back and being held up again.\n  He has the necessary experience to serve. He has been active in his \ncommunity. He is a Heart Association board member, Oakland College \nCommunity Foundation chairman, member of the board of the Judges \nAssociation, Michigan Department of Civil Rights hearing referee. He is \na Community Foundation of Southeast Michigan board member. He has \nwritten a number of articles on subjects such as employment \ndiscrimination, AIDS in the workplace, libel standards, and legal \nethics. He has given a number of speeches, primarily on appellate \nadvocacy. He has been nominated for a position as an appellate judge, \nso this is good experience. Appellate judges do not try cases, as the \nPresiding Officer knows. Appellate judges review trials that went on \nbefore. They review briefs carefully and they hear arguments from \nattorneys involved in a case and who have written briefs in summary, \nand then they make written rulings to decide whether the trial was \nproperly tried or not. We need him on this circuit.\n  I have to share some thoughts about this matter because it is \nimportant and something smells bad. It is not good what has occurred \nwith regard to this nominee and other nominees to the Sixth Circuit. \nThere has been an orchestrated effort to block rule of law nominees for \nsome time now.\n  The House of Representatives had hearings on this matter some time \nago and was highly critical about what has occurred. Frankly, I am not \nsure we fully know the story yet of all that occurred. Let's take \nrecent history when the Democrats were in the majority in the Senate \nand they controlled the Judiciary Committee and could decide what \nnominees came up for vote.\n  The Democrats made a number of questionable decisions, and they took \ncare of some outside groups, and they took certain steps that were \nquite significant. A number of nominees were delayed or blocked. As I \nrecall, even then there were four, maybe six, vacancies in this \ncircuit. Right now, 25 percent of the circuit is vacant. It is an \nemergency situation, according to the courts, because we have so many \nvacancies there.\n  Thirty-one assistant United States attorneys--these are the \nprosecutors who try cases every day, not a political group, but a group \nof workhorse attorneys trying cases--have expressed concern about the \nfailure to fill these appointments and how long it takes their criminal \nappeals to be decided. But I want to share this with my colleagues \nbecause I think we might as well talk about it. I wish it had not \nhappened, but it has.\n  Take the case of Julia Gibbons of Tennessee. She was a very talented \nnominee to the Sixth Circuit early on. When the Democrats were in \ncontrol of the Judiciary Committee, her nomination in 2001 was \nmysteriously slowed down. It did not move. At one point in March of \n2002, Senator McConnell spoke on the floor, and he complained that she \nhad waited 164 days and never had a hearing, and we wondered what was \ngoing on and why this fine nominee was being held up.\n  We now know through the release of internal memos that were published \nin newspapers, in the Wall Street Journal and other places that \ndiscussed this case, what happened. Frankly, I do not think these memos \nshould have been made public--under the circumstances, they were, based \non what I know. But things leak around here. That is the way it is. I \nhave to share with this body what occurred.\n  What we know is that in April of 2002, there was a staff memorandum \nto Senator Kennedy from his staff that indicates that the NAACP, which \nwas a party to a Sixth Circuit case, the Michigan affirmative action \ncase to be exact, that they considered to be an important case--this is \nwhat the memorandum says: That the NAACP\n\n     would like the Judiciary Committee to hold off on any Sixth \n     Circuit nominees until the University of Michigan case \n     regarding the constitutionality of affirmative action in \n     higher education is decided by the en banc, Sixth Circuit. . \n     . .\n       The thinking is that the current Sixth Circuit will sustain \n     the affirmative action program, but that if a new judge with \n     conservative views is confirmed before the case is decided, \n     the new judge will be able . . . to review the case and vote \n     on it.\n\n  The Kennedy memorandum further states that some ``are a little \nconcerned about the propriety of scheduling hearings based on the \nresolution of a particular case. We are also aware that the Sixth \nCircuit is in dire need of judges.''\n  The memorandum goes on to conclude:\n\n       Nevertheless we recommend that Gibbons be scheduled for a \n     later hearing: The Michigan case is important.\n\n  Even though it was understood to be wrong to influence the outcome of \na pending case, it was recommended that Gibbons be delayed.\n  Now, people like to suggest that the holdup in these nominations is \nsome flap with the home State Senators, that it is tit for tat. I \nremember a good friend who former President Bush nominated, John \nSmietanka, for this circuit. He was blocked. He was a wonderful \nnominee, a saintly person really, a great judge. He was blocked, so \nthey say this is all tit for tat, but I do not think so.\n  I am afraid what really is at work is this circuit was narrowly \ndivided. In fact, as I recall, the University of Michigan case was \ndecided by one vote. Had the new judge been confirmed and voted the \nother way, it would have been a tie vote. That verdict would not have \ncome out as it did. So I think there is an attempt to shape the makeup \nof this court. Let's not make any mistake about this whole issue. The \njudiciary debate is not about politics; it is not Republican versus \nDemocrat. This debate is about the beliefs, the value judgment, and the \nlegal philosophy of President Bush, and I dare suggest a vast majority \nof American citizens. President Bush and the American people believe \nthat judges should be bound by the law, they should follow the law, \nthey should strictly follow the law, and that unelected, lifetime \nappointed Federal judges are not in power to set social policy because \nthey are unaccountable to the public. So that is the big deal.\n  There are people who believe otherwise. There are people who can no \nlonger win these issues at the ballot box, if they ever could. They \nwant judges to declare things that they do not want to have their \nfingerprints on, like taking God out of the Pledge of Allegiance. These \nare activist decisions. So I believe this is a matter far deeper than \njust Republican versus Democrat; it represents a debate about the \nnature of the American judiciary--do we stay true to an Anglo-American \ntradition that judges are not political, that they are independent, \nthat they wear that robe to distinguish themselves from the normal \nperson, that they isolate themselves from politics, and that they study \nthe law and rule on the law?\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\nThat is what I believe a judge ought to do. That is the ideal of \nAmerican law. It is very important that we maintain that.\n  When we have nominees held up explicitly to affect the outcome of a \ncase that might come before them, a very important and famous case, \nindeed perhaps the most significant case that year--maybe even in the \nlast half- dozen years--to be shaped and blocked simply because of that \ncase is bad. In fact, after the case was over, Judge Gibbons was \nconfirmed 95-0 by this body. There never was any objection to her other \nthan they were afraid it would affect the outcome of the case.\n  There are vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. The President is empowered \nto make the appointments. He is empowered to make the appointments \naccording to the legal philosophies and principles he announced to the \nAmerican people when he ran for office. President Bush declared that he \nwas going to nominate and fight for judges who would follow the law, \nnot make law, who would show restraint, who would be true to the \nlegitimate interpretation of the statutes and the Constitution, not \nusing that document to further promote their own personal agendas. That \nis what he has done, and that is what Judge Saad's record is. He is not \ngoing to impose his values on the people of the Sixth Circuit. That is \nnot his philosophy of judging. His philosophy is to follow the law, not \nto make the law. We have no fear of that kind of judge. We ought to \nconfirm him.\n  The people of this Nation need to know that the Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle, and the Democratic machine is time after time \nmustering 40 votes to block these nominees from even getting an up-or-\ndown vote. In fact, when we vote on cloture to shut off debate and we \nhave to have 60 votes, we are constantly getting 53, 54, 55 votes for \nthese nominees, which is more than enough to confirm them, but we \ncannot shut off the debate and get an up-or-down vote. So by the \nunprecedented use of the filibuster, these judges are not getting an \nup-or-down vote. I say to the American people, they need to understand \nthis. I believe the rule of law in this country is jeopardized by the \npoliticization of the courts. We must not allow that to happen. I \nbelieve the collegiality and traditions of this Senate are being \naltered. There is no doubt we have not had filibusters of judges \nbefore. In fact, about 4 years ago, Senator Leahy was denouncing \nfilibusters when President Clinton was in office, and now he is leading \nit. The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee is leading a host of \nfilibusters. It is an unprincipled thing.\n\n  I remember Senator Hatch, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \na guardian of the principles and integrity of the Senate, on many \noccasions told Republicans when they said, Well, we do not like this \njudge, we ought to filibuster him, why do we not filibuster him, and he \nsaid, You do not filibuster judges; we have never filibustered judges; \nthat is the wrong thing to do. And we never filibustered President \nClinton's judges.\n  I voted to bring several of them up for a vote and cut off debate \neven though I voted against those judges because they should not be on \nthe bench. I did not vote to filibuster the judge, and I think that is \nthe basic philosophy of this Senate.\n  I hope we will look at this carefully. These nominees are highly \nqualified. They are highly principled. Many of them have extraordinary \nreputations, like Miguel Estrada, Judge Pickering, Bill Pryor, and \nPriscilla Owen from Texas, a justice on the Texas Supreme Court who \nmade the highest possible score on the Texas bar exam. These are highly \nqualified people who ought to be given an up-or-down vote. If they were \ngiven an up-or-down vote, they would be confirmed just like that.\n  Unfortunately, we are having a slowdown, unprecedented in its nature. \nIf this does not end and we cannot get an up-or-down vote on these \njudges, those of us on this side need to take other steps. And we will \ntake other steps. We need to fight to make sure that the traditions of \nthis Senate and the constitutional understanding of the confirmation \nprocess are affirmed and defeat the political attempts to preserve an \nactivist judiciary that our colleagues, it appears, want to keep in \npower so that they can further their political agenda, an agenda they \ncannot win at the ballot box.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Omnibus Spending Bill\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, there are only 22 legislative days left in \nthis fiscal year. The Senate seems to be frittering away those precious \ndays. To date, the Senate has only passed one appropriations bill, the \nDefense bill. Only four bills have been reported from the Senate \nAppropriations Committee.\n  The House has passed nine appropriations bills, but apparently the \nSenate would rather work on political messagemaking than to take care \nof the Nation's vital business. So I fear, once again, that the Senate \nRepublican leadership is setting a course for a massive omnibus \nspending bill. That is what it looks like. That is what we are going to \ndo, have a massive omnibus spending bill, in all likelihood.\n  This year, with the failure of the Senate Republican leadership to \neven bring the Homeland Security bill before the Senate, the Omnibus \nappropriations bill may include as many as 12 of the 13 annual \nappropriations bills. That is very conceivable to ponder.\n  On July 8, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and FBI Director \nRobert Mueller announced that another terrorist attack is likely before \nthe November elections, yet the Homeland Security appropriations bill, \nwhich the committee reported 4 weeks ago, has not even been presented \nto the full Senate for its consideration. What is wrong? What is wrong \nwith this picture? Talk about fiddling while Rome burns. The flames are \nall around us.\n  The Senate Republican leadership is setting the stage for another one \nof these massive spending bills that may be brought up in the Senate in \nan unamendable form. And one shudders to think what will go on behind \nclosed doors. Who among the 100 Senators will be in the meetings that \nproduce a massive bill that appropriates over $400 billion for \nveterans, education, homeland security, highways, agriculture, and the \nenvironment? Who among the 100 Senators will be in the meetings when \ndecisions are made about including provisions on drug importation, gun \nliability, farm bill issues, nuclear waste storage at Yucca Mountain, \novertime rules, or on the outsourcing of government services? Does \nanybody know?\n  And, who knows what surprises, that were never debated or even \ncontemplated in the Senate, will find their way into such an omnibus? \nWhat kind of interesting bugs will crawl into this big bad apple of a \nbill? I cannot tell you how many Senators will be in the room, but I \ncan assure you of one thing. The White House will be there. You can bet \non that. They will be there with their pet projects and their pet \npeeves and their opportunities to move certain items into their \nfavorite States--doing their bidding, legislating right along with the \nSenators. They will be there. White House bureaucrats and soothsayers \nwill suddenly become legislators for a day, or perhaps several days.\n\n  That is not the way our Constitution contemplated the writing of \nappropriations bills. The Framers believed that Congress ought to have \nthe power of the purse. This White House would like to have it. They \nwould like very much to have it. But all of those constitutional \nniceties get blurred and blended when it comes time to deal on Omnibus \nappropriations bills. The checks and balances gets thrown out the \nwindow when it comes time to deal with Omnibus appropriations bills.\n  One could conclude that the only thing the President wants from the \nfiscal year 2005 appropriations bill is the Defense appropriations \nbill. That is the only thing the President would want from the 2005 \nappropriations process--the Defense appropriations bill.\n  On June 24, 2004, in its Statement of Administration Policy, the \nWhite House urged the Congress to pass the Defense bill before the \nstart of the August recess. Why?\n  In February, the President did not ask for one thin dime, not one \nthin dime did he ask for as far as the costs\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\nof the war in Iraq--nothing. Administration officials had the temerity \nto insist that the costs of the war were not knowable. Then suddenly, \non May 12, 2004, the President saw the light and realized that he \nneeded more money for the war in Iraq. It must have come to him in a \nsudden vision. So, like a teenage driver, he put the foot on the gas \nand insisted that the Congress give him a $25 billion blank check for \nthe escalating costs of his war in Iraq.\n  With the help of Senator Stevens of Alaska, the blank check got \ncanceled, but the defense conference report will include the $25 \nbillion in additional funds. The President will get the one thing he \nwanted out of this year's appropriations process; he will get the \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  So I must ask the American people, why is it the President has not \nsent messages to the Congress urging prompt action on the bill that \nfunds the veterans health care system? I am sure the veterans are \nconcerned about what is going to happen with respect to their needs.\n  Moreover, does the President not know that the bill that funds our \nNation's schools is stuck in subcommittee? What about the \nappropriations bill that funds our highway system that has not yet been \nconsidered by the House or the Senate? In February, the President \nproposed to put a man on Mars, but the bill that funds the space \nprogram has not been marked up by either the House or Senate \nappropriations committees.\n  According to President Bush, Congress must urgently send him the \nDefense appropriations bill; but for all of the other appropriations \nbills, the attitude is ho hum; so what.\n  According to the administration, we are facing another terrorist \nattack. Are we not even going to debate whether a 5-percent increase \nfor the Department of Homeland Security is enough?\n  Last year, we fell prey to a 7-bill omnibus, but at least the Senate \ndebated as freestanding bills 12 of the 13 bills. Now we are down to \nonly one debate this year on the Defense bill. That is one bill, and \nonly one debate this year, on the Defense bill.\n  Where do we go from here on funding the needs of the people? One of \nthe options that has been discussed by the Republican leadership is to \npass the full-year continuing resolution and leave town, get out of \ntown, catch the next train, all aboard. That is right. The exalted \nservants of the people may just decide to enjoy a summer vacation if \nsome in the Republican leadership have their druthers. What does it \nmatter if all of the Federal Government, except the Pentagon, operates \non automatic pilot for a full year? Who needs guidance from the \nCongress on the priorities? Who needs careful scrutiny of Federal \nprograms? What about the new initiatives? Shouldn't they be under \ncareful scrutiny? Shouldn't questions be asked and questions answered?\n  Let me give you, my colleagues, a few examples of what would happen \nunder a full-year continuing resolution. If that is what you want, I \ntell you what you are going to get.\n  If the Senate Republican leadership refuses to allow the Senate to \ndebate the Homeland Security appropriations bill, important funding in \nnew programs would not be available to the Department.\n  As we all know, on March 11, 2004, nearly 200 people were killed by a \nseries of bombs detonated on the transit system in Madrid, Spain. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security responded by sending out a list of \nsecurity recommendations for mass transit and rail systems in the \nUnited States. These recommendations included moving garbage cans and \nasking commuters to be more alert to suspicious people and packages, \nlike unattended backpacks. However, despite my efforts, no moneys were \napproved for fiscal year 2004 for mass transit or rail security. Are we \ncomatose in the Senate? Perhaps we better reach back in our desks \nsomewhere and get our living wills.\n\n  On an average workday, 32 million people travel on mass transit. Get \nthat, 32 million people travel on mass transit on an average workday. \nHowever, under a continuing resolution, there would be no funding to \nhelp secure our mass transit and rail systems. There would be no funds \nfor additional law enforcement presence, no funds for additional K-9 \nteams, no funds for additional surveillance, no funds for additional \npublic education about the threat. Is that OK with the Senate?\n  Following the tragic events of September 11, the administration \nestablished a firm goal for the number of Federal air marshals so that \na high percentage of critical flights could be protected. The exact \nnumber of air marshals is classified, but the fact is, the Federal air \nmarshals program has never reached the staffing level called for in the \nwake of the September 11 attacks.\n  Instead, the White House has allowed the number of air marshals to \nfall by 9 percent, falling far below the goal. As air marshals leave \nthe program, budget constraints prohibit the hiring of replacements. \nThe number of air marshals continues to dwindle and the number of \ncritical flights they are able to cover remains on a steady downward \nspiral. If forced to operate under a continuing resolution, the number \nof air marshals protecting domestic and international flights could \nfall by another 6 percent, putting Americans in greater danger. How can \nwe contemplate such irresponsibility? Doesn't public safety count?\n  How about funding for our Nation's schools? Two and a half years ago \nthe President promised to leave no child behind. The No Child Left \nBehind Act authorized $20.5 billion in fiscal year 2005 for title I, \nthe Federal program designed to help disadvantaged students in \nkindergarten through high school, those students who are most at risk \nof being left behind. A continuing resolution would freeze title I \nfunding at just $12.3 billion. That would leave behind 2.7 million \nstudents who would not receive the title I services that were promised \nto them in the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  A continuing resolution would also freeze funding for special \neducation. Two months ago, the Senate voted overwhelmingly by a vote of \n96 to 1 to authorize a $2.3 billion increase for the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act--better known, perhaps, as IDEA--in fiscal \nyear 2005, and fully fund the law within 7 years. A CR would put the \nlie to that pledge.\n  As candidate for President in 2000, President Bush said:\n\n       College is every parent's dream for their children. It's \n     the path to achievement. We should make this path open to \n     all.\n\n  But, my dear friends, under the Bush administration, the cost of \ntuition has gone up by 26 percent, making it harder and harder for low- \nand middle-income students to pursue that dream.\n\n  The Pell grant: A maximum Pell grant now covers only 34 percent of \nthe average annual cost of college compared to 72 percent in 1976. \nUnder a continuing resolution, there would be no increase in the \nmaximum Pell grant now set at $4,050. There would be no increases for \nthe College Work-Study Program or for other campus-based aid programs. \nSo much for dreams, so much for promises, so much for empty talk.\n  For the construction and restoration of our Nation's highways and \nbridges, a long-term continuing resolution would stifle the flow of \nbillions of new dollars going to our States to improve safety \nconditions, minimize congestion, and create badly needed jobs.\n  Just this past February, more than three-quarters of the Senate, 76 \nSenators, approved a surface transportation bill that called for an \noverall commitment of highway funds for fiscal year 2005 of $37.9 \nbillion. Under a long-term continuing resolution, highway funding would \nbe $4.25 billion less than that amount, a $4.25 billion shortfall. That \ndifference represents more than 200,000 jobs across America, jobs that \nare desperately needed all across our States. But the Senate is in \ngridlock, much like the gridlock on our Nation's highways.\n  Our Nation's military is serving gallantly in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nbut under a continuing resolution the Veterans Health Administration, \nunbelievably, would get drastically reduced health care services for \nour fighting men and women. Approximately 237,000 veterans would not be \nable to receive care, and veterans outpatient clinics would schedule \n2.6 million fewer appointments. The waiting list for veterans seeking \nmedical care would grow to over 230,000. What a way to treat our brave \nmen and women. Shabby and shameful are the two words that come to mind.\n  Al-Qaida operatives are in the United States preparing for another \nterrorist\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\nattack. The FBI must mobilize to find those terrorists before they \nattack us. But a full-year continuing resolution would force the FBI to \nfreeze all hiring in fiscal year 2005. That would result in the FBI \nlosing 500 special agents and negating the proposed increase of 428 \nspecial agents. Nor would the FBI be able to fund any of the new \ninitiatives proposed in the fiscal year 2005 budget request, including \nresources for the new office of intelligence counterterrorism \ninvestigations, counterintelligence, and fighting cyber crime.\n  Another casualty of a full-year continuing resolution would be \nprograms to combat HIV/AIDS, particularly in eastern Europe and Asia \nwhere the epidemic is spreading out of control. Only one in five people \nworldwide have access to HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Yet a continuing \nresolution would reduce funding for those programs by almost half a \nbillion. That means there would be hundreds of thousands of new \ninfections of the deadly virus--infections that could have been \nprevented, lives that could have been saved.\n  The list goes on and on and, like Tennyson's book, goes on. Members \nof this Congress have a duty and a responsibility to the American \npeople. They do not want us to approve massive omnibus spending bills \nthat no one has bothered to read. They do not want us to pass mindless \ncontinuing resolutions that put the Government on automatic pilot and \ntheir safety on the line. They do not want us to cash our own paychecks \nwithout doing the work we were sent here to do.\n  We are paid to debate legislation. We are paid to make careful \nchoices on behalf of the people. The elections are coming, and if we \nare not going to do our work, then we should not claim the title of \nSenator. Just like Donald Trump, come November, the American people \nmight decide to send us a very straightforward message: You're fired.\n  Last week, the Republican leadership jammed into the defense \nconference report a provision ``deeming'' the level of spending for \nfiscal year 2005 at the level in the budget resolution conference \nreport. It seems now we are ``deeming'' our way through budget debates. \n``Deeming''--this provision was not contained in the Senate or House \nversion of the Defense bill. It was not debated here on the Senate \nfloor. Yet this innocuous-sounding ``deeming'' provision will have far-\nreaching consequences. That provision will result in appropriations \nbills that inadequately fund homeland security, education, veterans, \ntransportation, and other programs to meet domestic needs. And the \nconsequences are not just on paper. The American public is being \ncheated year after year by the steady erosion of money available to \nfund the public's priorities. They are being ``deemed'' down the river.\n  This year, even while the directors of Homeland Security, the FBI, \nand the CIA are warning us of al-Qaida in our midst, we still are \nunaccountably and stubbornly sitting on the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill as if in total defiance of the dangers to our \ncountry and to the people's safety.\n  None of this is the fault of our able Appropriations Committee \nchairman, Senator Ted Stevens. Early on, I encouraged Chairman Stevens \nto move 13 freestanding, fiscally responsible appropriations bills \nthrough the committee and on to the Senate floor. Senator Stevens \ninstructed his 13 subcommittee chairmen to produce balanced and \nbipartisan bills; however, the Senate Republican leadership has refused \nto free up floor time for the appropriations bills.\n  I will not be a party to such chicanery, and I implore the leadership \nof this body to stop the games and stop the politics. And I ask the \nmajority leadership to set aside the pending business and proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar Order No. 588, H.R. 4567, the fiscal year \n2005 Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I echo the comments of Senator Byrd, \nthe ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. While I do not have \nthe perspective of his years of service in the Senate and on the \nAppropriations Committee, I share his concern about the breakdown we \nare seeing in this year's appropriations process.\n  There are only 2 days left before the Senate leaves for an extended \nAugust recess. Yet the Appropriations Committee has reported out only 4 \nof the 13 appropriations bills we must pass this year. The Senate has \npassed only one Appropriations bill--the Defense Appropriations bill. \nThis is a dereliction of our primary duty in the Senate, funding the \nfunctions of Government.\n  The blame for this situation does not go, in my view, to the \nAppropriations Committee. In the limited work the committee has done \nthis year, it has operated in an efficient, bipartisan manner. But we \nall know that the committee has been hampered by the failure to enact a \nbudget resolution.\n  A budget is a clear articulation of priorities. We are having these \nproblems because of a failure to prioritize, or because of skewed \npriorities. As we all know, the Congressional Budget Office is \nprojecting a $477 billion deficit in fiscal year 2004.\n  But some in the Congress continue to believe that more tax cuts \nshould be the priority in this Congress. And they refuse to subject \nthese tax cuts to the discipline of pay-as-you-go rules, which would \nrequire offsetting revenue increases, or spending cuts.\n  They insist that we can balance the books by ``controlling'' \nnondefense, nonhomeland security, discretionary spending. Yet, no one \nhas shown any inclination to significantly cut discretionary spending. \nJust the opposite. As Bill Young, the chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee notes:\n\n       No one should expect significant deficit reduction as a \n     result of austere non-defense discretionary spending limits. \n     The numbers simply do not add up.\n\n  The notion of balancing the budget, while further reducing revenue, \nis simply wrong-headed. Or, as Chairman Young succinctly puts it, ``the \nnumbers simply do not add up.''\n  The Senate is scheduled for 19 legislative days after August. It does \nnot appear that there is much hope for completing our appropriations \nwork in that time. Indications in the media from the chairman and from \nthe Republican leadership are that we will be faced with moving an \nomnibus appropriations bill when we return, possibly with some bills \nheld over for a lameduck session of Congress. That is a terrible way to \ndo business, and I sincerely hope it does not come to that.\n  In the remaining 2 days before we recess, I am hopeful that we can at \nleast take up my subcommittee's bill, the military construction bill. \nThe subcommittee chairman, Senator Hutchison, and I have worked well \ntogether to craft a good bill with the support of Senators Stevens and \nByrd. I believe that it deserves the support of the full Senate.\n  And when the Senate reconvenes, in September, I hope that we on the \nAppropriations Committee will work efficiently, and on a bipartisan \nbasis, to report freestanding bills to the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cornyn pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n413 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  (Mr. CORNYN assumed the Chair.)\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to express deep \ndisappointment about what is taking place on the Senate floor in the \ncloture vote scheduled for tomorrow. For the past 3\\1/2\\ years, Senator \nLevin and I have been urging the Bush administration to work with us to \ndevelop a bipartisan solution regarding the Michigan nominees to the \nSixth Circuit Court. We have met on several occasions with Judge \nGonzales, the current White House counsel, and other White House staff, \nbut the White House has rejected all of our efforts at a compromise. We \nalso had numerous meetings with Chairman Hatch and testified before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee several times on the need for a bipartisan \nsolution.\n  Chairman Hatch had expressed a willingness to work with us and to \nwork with Senator Leahy on a bipartisan solution to this impasse, but \nit seems these efforts have been abandoned by Republican leadership in\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\nfavor of scoring political points before the party conventions.\n  I still believe the best way to end this impasse is to forge a \ncompromise. I hope the Bush administration and the Republican \nleadership will not continue down this road of what appears to be \npolitically motivated and partisan cloture votes instead of working \nwith us to develop a fair solution. A ``nay'' vote on cloture will \npreserve potential negotiations toward the bipartisan compromise we \nhave been seeking. A ``yea'' vote will destroy these efforts and, \nunfortunately, be a vote for preconvention politics.\n  Let me start by saying a few words about Judge Saad's nomination. \nJudge Saad is before us now. After listening to people in Michigan who \nhave shared serious concerns with both Senator Levin and I, and having \nhad an opportunity to review the FBI background materials, I have to \nsay that I have serious concerns about Judge Saad's temperament and \nappropriateness for serving on this important bench. While I cannot go \ninto specifics, I urge my colleagues to review the Judiciary \nCommittee's FBI background materials for themselves.\n  Judge Saad's lack of fitness for this appointment is also evidenced \nin the record he has put together as it relates to his work on the \nMichigan Court of Appeals. Most troubling, perhaps, are his decisions \nand reversals in cases involving the application of the law in civil \nrights cases--particularly in sexual harassment cases.\n  His decisions also demonstrate hostility to the rights of \nwhistleblowers. We know in this day and age, as we have learned through \nthose who were courageous and came forward in the Enron and Halliburton \ncases, and others where employees have come forward, how important it \nis to be able to protect the rights of employees who see that something \nis wrong and they step forward. They are what we call whistleblowers.\n  His decisions also have been hostile to the rights of people who are \ninjured. For example, in Coleman v. State, Judge Saad joined in \ndeciding against the plaintiff in a sexual harassment case, which was \nlater reversed by the Michigan Supreme Court. Coleman, a State prison \nemployee, was subjected to comments by her supervisor about her \nallegedly provocative dress and to daily inspections of her clothing, \nafter she was the victim of an attempted assault and rape by an armed \nprison inmate. She was the one who was questioned, as too often we hear \nas it relates to women who are told it was their fault, because of the \nway they dress, and that is why they were assaulted. The Michigan \nSupreme Court reversed the decision, holding that there was sufficient \nevidence for the victim to go to trial.\n  In Haberl v. Rose, Judge Saad dissented from the court of appeals' \nreinstatement of a jury verdict for the plaintiff who was injured by a \nGovernment worker who was doing Government work but driving her own \nautomobile.\n  In the complicated case, the majority found that Michigan's sovereign \nimmunity statute was not applicable, since a more specific civil \nliability statute said that car owners are not immune from liability. \nCar owners have liability in these kinds of cases.\n  The dissenting Judge Saad stated that the sovereign immunity statute \napplied but the civil liability statute did not and, thus, the injured \nplaintiff could not recover.\n  Judge Saad was harshly criticized for his dissent by the majority of \nthe judges, who essentially called him a judicial activist:\n\n       Indeed, it is the dissent that urges ``rewriting'' the \n     statutes in question and advocates overstepping the bounds of \n     proper judicial authority.\n\n  Based on these concerns, I do not believe Judge Saad has the \nnecessary judicial temperament to serve a lifetime appointment--a \nlifetime appointment--on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak more broadly now about the process of \nbringing the Sixth Circuit nominees to the floor of the Senate. Senator \nLevin has spoken eloquently about the history of the Sixth Circuit \nnominees prior to my serving in the Senate. He has explained how two \nextremely well-qualified women--Judge Helene White and Kathleen McCree \nLewis--failed to get a hearing before the Judiciary Committee for more \nthan 4 years and 1\\1/2\\ years, respectively, during the previous \nadministration.\n\n  In fact, if she had been confirmed, Kathleen McCree Lewis would have \nbeen the first African-American woman on the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Senator Levin and I are not alone in the view we hold that what \noccurred with respect to these nominees was fundamentally unfair.\n  On more than one occasion, Judge Gonzales, the current White House \ncounsel, has acknowledged that it was wrong for the Republican-led \nSenate to delay action on judicial nominees for partisan reasons, at \none point even calling the treatment of some nominees during the \nClinton administration ``inexcusable.''\n  Senator Levin and I have repeatedly proposed to settle this \nlongstanding conflict by appointing a bipartisan commission to make \nrecommendations to the White House on judicial nominations.\n  Our proposal would be based on the commission that is set up and \nworking just across Lake Michigan in Wisconsin. The State of Wisconsin \ncommission has produced bipartisan nominees for both district and \ncircuit courts since its inception under the Carter administration.\n  In fact, just recently, the Senate confirmed Judge Diane Sykes for a \nvacancy on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Sykes, a Bush \nadministration nominee, was recommended by the bipartisan Wisconsin \ncommission and had the support of both of her Democratic home State \nSenators.\n  This process works. The Wisconsin commission includes representatives \nfrom the Wisconsin Bar Association, the deans of the State's law \nschools, as well as members appointed by both Republicans and \nDemocrats. They only recommend qualified candidates who have the \nsupport of the majority of the commission. The President then looks to \nthe recommendations of the commission when making his nominations.\n  The Wisconsin commission's recommendations have always been followed \nby the President, regardless of political party. Again, this system has \nworked.\n  This type of commission preserves the constitutional prerogatives of \nboth the President and the Senate. It allows the President to pick one \nof the recommended nominees and protects the Senate's advise and \nconsent role.\n  Wisconsin is not the only State where this type of bipartisan \ncommission works. In a similar form, it has worked in several other \nStates, including Washington, California, and Vermont.\n  Unfortunately, the White House continues to reject this proposal from \nMichigan, despite having agreed to similar commissions in other States \nwith other Democratic Senators.\n  Senator Levin and I are interested in finding a real bipartisan \nsolution to this problem. We have stated on numerous occasions that we \nare willing to accept the commission's recommended nominees, even if \nthey do not include Helene White and Kathleen Lewis, or any other \nperson we would choose if it were up to us.\n  Instead of divisive cloture votes, let's look to the future and \nrestore civility to this process. It is time to do that with the Sixth \nCircuit.\n  I hope we can still accomplish this and that the Bush administration \nand Chairman Hatch will work with us to develop a fair compromise to \nthis longstanding problem.\n  Let me take a moment to reiterate this is not about being unwilling \nto fill vacancies. As other colleagues have indicated, we have, in \nfact, confirmed 198 judicial nominees of this President, and I have \nvoted for the overwhelming majority of those nominees. This is more \njudicial nominees than were confirmed for President Reagan in all 4 \nyears of his first term, more nominees than were confirmed for first \nPresident Bush during his 4-year Presidency, and for President Clinton \nin all 4 years of his second term. Mr. President, 100 judges were \nconfirmed in the 17 months of the Democratic Senate majority.\n  So under Democratic control, we confirmed 100 judges, and we were \nonly in the majority for 17 months of the last almost 4 years. Now, 98 \nmore judges have been confirmed in the 25 months of Republican \nleadership. In other words, the Democrats were in the majority less \ntime and confirmed more\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\njudges for this President during the last 3\\1/2\\ years. So this is not \nabout being unwilling to support filling judgeships, but it is about a \nvery specific concern about what has been happening in Michigan and the \nlack of willingness of the administration to work with both Senators to \nfulfill our equal responsibilities of being able to pick the best \npeople to serve our great State for a lifetime appointment.\n  These are not Cabinet appointments of this President. They are \nlifetime appointments. The reason the Framers of the Constitution \ndivided the responsibility--half with the President and half with the \nSenate, as we know--is because this is a third branch of Government \nwith lifetime appointments, and it is very important there be the \nmaximum amount of input, balance, and thoughtfulness brought to this \nprocess.\n  Unfortunately, regarding the Sixth Circuit, until we have a fair \nsolution, I believe I have no other option than to oppose this cloture \nvote and to urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. What is the \nbusiness before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination of Henry Saad to the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals is the pending business.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n               United States-Morocco Free-Trade Agreement\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes of the \nSenate's time to discuss the reasons behind my decision to vote against \nthe Morocco free-trade agreement implementing legislation which the \nSenate passed earlier today. I want to make very clear that my vote was \nnot in any way against a free-trade agreement with Morocco. My vote, as \nwas my vote against the Chilean free-trade agreement, was a protest \nagainst the continued determination by this administration to undermine \nand to do away with provisions that address labor issues, especially \nthe worst forms of child labor, that we had contained in the Jordan \nfree-trade agreement and relevant provisions in the Generalized System \nof Preferences.\n  In fact, I welcome this affirmation of the strong economic and \npolitical relationship that exists between the United States and the \nKingdom of Morocco which can be strengthened by this agreement. I \nrecognize this legislation is almost certain to pass the House this \nweek very easily, and the United States-Morocco Free-Trade Agreement \nwill go into effect next January.\n  The Kingdom of Morocco is a politically moderate Muslim nation that \nhas been a long-time friend of the United States, a friendship that has \nbeen demonstrated most recently with their support in the aftermath of \nthe tragedy of September 11, 2001.\n  Morocco has been a valuable partner in fighting the global war on \nterror, and so it is appropriate for the U.S. Government to reciprocate \nthat support with a bilateral free-trade agreement so long as it leads \nto expanded economic opportunities for both partners.\n  Once in place, this agreement will generate significant economic \nbenefits to both Morocco and the United States, and with Morocco's \nstrategic position on the continent of Africa and easy access into \nEurope through the Strait of Gibraltar, it could serve as a gateway to \neven more markets.\n  This bilateral free-trade agreement could also serve as the \nfoundation for a far wider free-trade agreement with the entire region \nof the Middle East and northern Africa.\n  With respect to agriculture, this free-trade agreement provides \nmodest but clear opportunities to a wide range of U.S. commodities.\n  The opportunities provided in the free-trade agreement in \nnonagricultural goods and services will be substantial as well, and it \nreflects the determination of the Government of Morocco to modernize \ntheir economy to the benefit of the people of Morocco.\n  So count me as a friend of Morocco. Morocco has been a strong ally of \nthe United States. It is a moderate nation. I have had the privilege of \nvisiting Morocco on at least two occasions, maybe more, and I have a \ngreat deal of respect and admiration for the Moroccan people. \nNonetheless, I decided to vote against it because I intend to call \nattention to the decision of U.S. negotiators to retreat from the \nprovisions under the Generalized System of Preferences that requires \nthe U.S. Government to monitor our trading partners on their progress \nin meeting international standards on the use of child labor, and these \nprovisions in the GSP also provide leverage to encourage those \ncountries to continue to make progress by permitting sanctions to be \nimposed against those who backtrack.\n  The Bush administration has taken a weak stand toward child labor in \nthis latest trade agreement. In 2000, I, along with then-Senator Helms \nof North Carolina, authored an amendment that unanimously passed the \nSenate that extended GSP benefits to countries that took steps to \nimplement ILO Convention 182 on the worst forms of child labor, and it \nmandated that the President report on the progress of these countries. \nIf the President determined that countries were not taking steps to \nimplement the ILO Conventions, benefits would be withheld.\n  The trade agreement that we passed with Chile earlier, and with \nMorocco, takes a step backward. As I said at the time, I first proposed \nwe have a free-trade agreement with Chile in 1993, 11 years ago. So I \nhad mixed emotions when I had to vote against the free-trade agreement \nwith Chile because Chile's Government is making great progress. But \nthis administration sought to undermine what we had achieved in the \nJordanian free-trade agreement and in the Generalized System of \nPreferences.\n  Morocco does have problems with child labor. Although not employed in \nregular manufacturing, child labor is commonly used in cottage \nindustries, such as rug making, and many Moroccan middle-class \nhouseholds use children as domestic servants. The Government of Morocco \ndid pass new labor laws last month which included raising the minimum \nworking age from 12 to 15 and reducing the workweek from 48 to 44 \nhours, but a recent U.S. Department of Labor report indicates that \nenforcement of existing laws is severely constrained.\n  So while Morocco has been a good friend, while they are trying to \nmake progress, I think our trade laws ought to bolster that progress in \ndoing away with the worst forms of child labor.\n  I take into account these considerations when I determine whether I \nwill support a given trade agreement, as well as the economic gains \nthat may be generated.\n  As in the case of Chile, my concern about the lack of direct \nprotection against the use of child labor was the overriding factor, so \nI voted no on the free-trade agreement with Morocco. Again, as I say, I \ndo not want this to be misinterpreted in any way as any lack of support \nfor our mutual friendship and the continued development of relations \nbetween the United States and Morocco.\n\n\n                             Appropriations\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was watching on the monitor when Senator Byrd was \nrecently on the floor talking about the lack of considering \nappropriations bills. In 2 days, we are going to adjourn for recess. \nWhat do we have to show for it? By this point, the Senate should have \npassed most, if not all, of the 13 appropriations bills, but this year \nunder the Republican leadership we have only passed one, the Defense \nbill. We have not even debated the 12 others, much less put them to a \nvote.\n  Why is that? Is it because we are so busy in the Senate that we \ncannot debate these? Hardly. We spent days talking about judges who \nstand no chance of being confirmed; days on an amendment to ban gay \nunions that everyone knew would not pass, could not even get a majority \nvote, let alone 67 votes needed for a constitutional amendment. We \nspent weeks on a class action bill because Republican leadership did \nnot want to consider amendments on which they thought they might lose.\n  Meanwhile, the Senate leadership has taken no action on increasing \nthe minimum wage or extending unemployment benefits that could really \nmake a difference for hard-working Americans.\n  The highway bill, which would create thousands of jobs, is now almost \na year overdue, hung up by a veto threat of the White House. The bill \nto authorize Corps of Engineers projects that are important to farmers \nin my State was passed by the committee a month ago. There is no sign \nof any consideration in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\n  According to the Senate leadership, there is no time to take up \nappropriations bills that provide funding for critically important \nGovernment services. Passing the appropriations bills ought to be one \nof our top priorities. These bills pay for everything from roads and \nveterans health to homeland security and education. But here it is, \nJuly 21, with only 21 legislative days remaining in the fiscal year, \nand we have passed one appropriations bill.\n  That is all.\n  As the ranking Democrat on the Labor, Health, Human Services and \nEducation Appropriations Committee, I find this very troubling. It is \nnot the committee chairman's fault. I know Senator Stevens is anxious \nto pass these bills. The same goes for the chairman of the Labor, \nHealth, Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Specter. Our staffs have worked together closely on a bill. We \nare ready to mark it up on a moment's notice, but the White House and \nthe Republican leadership in the Senate seem to have no interest in \nmoving any appropriations bill other than Defense.\n  The reason is simple when one thinks about it. If these \nappropriations bills get debated on the Senate floor, everyone will see \nwhat the Republican Party's priorities are. It will be very clear. The \nRepublican Party is out of touch with middle-class and low-income \nAmericans. Education is a case in point. Two and a half years after \nPresident Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act, it is obvious he \nhas no intention of providing the funding to make it work. President \nBush's budget for next year shortchanges the No Child Left Behind Act \nby a whooping $9.4 billion.\n  No wonder we hear from school boards, teachers, and principals all \nover our States complaining about the No Child Left Behind Act. It is \nan unfunded Government mandate, the biggest of all, telling our local \nschools what they have to do, and yet we do not provide the funding \nthat was promised by the President, $9.4 billion less than what he \npromised, and it is shortchanging our schools.\n\n  Look at title I in education. That is the Federal program that \nspecifically serves disadvantaged children who are at the most risk of \nfalling behind and being left behind. The President's budget \nshortchanges this program by more than $7 billion. Now we are up to $16 \nbillion in two cases of education.\n  It is the same story with kids with disabilities. The President's \nbudget provides less than half of the level Congress committed to \npaying when the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was passed \nin 1975. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush continues to oppose the bipartisan \nlegislation Senator Hagel and I have offered to fully fund this law.\n  On higher education, the President offers virtually no help to low- \nand middle-income students who cannot afford to go to college. Under \nPresident Bush's budget, the maximum Pell grant award would be frozen \nfor the third straight year while college tuitions continue to rise \nthrough the roof.\n  The level of Pell grants in the President's budget next year will be \nlower than it was in 2002. One wonders why so many students cannot \nafford to go to college now or why they are borrowing more money and \ngraduating with these big debts. Well, maybe that is the \nadministration's goal: Get these kids to borrow more money from the \nbanks, pay these big interest rates, pay it back, rather than making \nPell grants, which they should be providing.\n  Meanwhile, President Bush's budget eliminates funding entirely for \nprograms like school counselors, arts and education, gifted and \ntalented programs, and dropout prevention, all zeroed out in the \nPresident's education budget.\n  The administration says there is no money to do this, no money to \nmake good on the pledges made only 2 years ago.\n  Well, I am sorry if I strongly disagree. Bear in mind that in this \nsame budget with all of these cuts to education, the President calls \nfor another $1 trillion in tax cuts.\n  It seems to me if there is room for $1 trillion in tax cuts, surely \nthere is room for $9.4 billion to fund the No Child Left Behind \neducation bill. That would be less than 1 percent of the proposed new \ntax cuts.\n  Time and again we hear this administration say, well, education \nreform is not about money. It is true, education reform is not only \nabout money, but let's be real: If we are going to modernize school \nbuildings, it costs money. If we are going to buy up-to-date textbooks \nand school technology, guess what. It costs money. If we are going to \nreduce class sizes, it costs money. If, under the No Child Left Behind \nAct, we want highly qualified teachers in the subjects in which they \nteach, guess what. It costs money. And if we want to ensure all kids \nwith disabilities are learning at the proficient level as required by \nthe new law, guess what. It costs money. If we want to ensure all young \npeople, regardless of income, have a shot at going to college, guess \nwhat. It costs money. Unfortunately, money is something we do not get \nvery much of in the President's education budget.\n  If they want a tax break for the wealthy, they get $1 trillion. If we \nwant to fund education, forget it in the President's budget.\n  We Democrats tried to increase funding for education during the \ndebate on the budget resolution in March. We offered amendments on the \nNo Child Left Behind Act, on afterschool centers and Pell grants, but \nthe Republican majority rebuffed us every time. Now the Republican \nleadership in the Senate will not even give us a chance to debate an \neducation appropriations bill and offer amendments on the floor of the \nSenate. They will not even give us a chance to do that.\n\n  A couple of years ago when the President signed the No Child Left \nBehind bill, he seemed to think that education was an important Federal \nresponsibility--Federal, not local. The President signed the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, a Federal mandate to local schools. If the President \nthought 2 years ago that education was an important Federal \nresponsibility, why is the President so reluctant to have us take up an \nappropriations bill that would fund this law?\n  I believe I know why. The Republicans have backed themselves into a \ncorner. They are doling out so many tax cuts for the rich that they do \nnot have any money left to fund our Nation's schools. They know if they \noffer an education bill with the limited amount of money they are \nwilling to spend on students, there is going to be a huge outcry across \nthe country. The American people would see what the President really \nstands for. They would see, in black and white, that this \nadministration has no real interest in leaving no child behind.\n  Four years ago we were looking at over $5 trillion in surpluses over \n10 years, with the Federal Reserve talking about the great economic \neffects of completely paying off the Federal debt by 2009. That was 4 \nyears ago.\n  Four years later, now, this year, we are facing a record deficit of \nover $400 billion just this year. There are many reasons for that \nturnaround, but the biggest by far is the tax cuts. About half of the \ntax cuts we have passed here go to people averaging an income of over \n$1 million a year. Let me repeat that: Over one-half of those tax cuts \nthat we have passed here go to people averaging an income of over $1 \nmillion a year.\n  This administration's misguided tax policies are undermining our \nNation's fiscal strength; they are weakening our economy, jeopardizing \nSocial Security, and reducing our ability to provide for the needs of \nour children and our Nation's education. It is no wonder that the \nSenate Republican leadership wants to avoid the issue of education \nfunding. They do not want to bring the education funding bill out on \nthe floor for open debate and amendments. They just want to sweep it \nunder the rug and hope that no one notices.\n  The Republican Party controls the Senate schedule, so they have that \npower. But I urge them to reconsider. Let's mark up the bill in \nsubcommittee, to the full committee, and bring it to the floor.\n  As I said, Senator Specter has done his job. My staff worked with his \nstaff. We have a bill that is ready to go. Bring it out here. Let's \nhave a good debate about how much we want to fund education. Give the \npublic a chance to weigh in and see an open debate. Let's have \namendments. Let's vote on them. I thought that was the way the process \nwas supposed to work.\n  Maybe my friends on the other side of the aisle are right. Maybe \npeople\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\nreally do care more about tax cuts for the rich than about funding \neducation. I don't think that is so, but there is only one way to find \nout. That is to bring the education appropriations bill to the floor in \nopen debate and let Senators on both sides of the aisle offer their \namendments. Let's vote on those amendments, and let's see how the \nelected Representatives of the people of this country feel about \nfunding education after those debates and after those votes. As I said, \nit seems to me this is the way our democratic system is supposed to \nwork.\n  Again, I urge the Republican leadership: Bring out our appropriations \nbills. I focus on education because I happen to be the ranking member \non the appropriations subcommittee dealing with education, health, and \nlabor. There are so many more, as I mentioned, such as the highway bill \nand homeland security, that we need to get through on the Senate floor. \nThere are 21 days left, and we have passed only one appropriations \nbill.\n  The Senate is not doing its business. It is time we do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nto speak as if in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                             Darfur, Sudan\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 1,000 people died there yesterday, 1,000 \npeople will die there today, 1,000 more will die tomorrow and the day \nafter that, and then the next day for as long as we can possibly \nimagine. I am speaking of Darfur, Sudan. In that region of the world \nthis year, 300,000 people may be dead; 1\\1/2\\ million people in Sudan \nare homeless. Villages have been decimated, women have been \nsystematically raped, crops have been destroyed, and wells have been \npoisoned with human corpses. This is genocide. Let us not mince words. \nIt demands action.\n  The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide requires signatories, including the United States of America, \nto prevent and punish acts that are ``committed with the intent to \ndestroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethical, racial or religious \ngroup.'' That is exactly what is taking place in Sudan today.\n  We in the United States have to join with civilized nations around \nthe world to stop the genocide in Darfur because we have failed \nsometimes before. We failed knowingly time and time again in the 20th \ncentury. Ten years ago we failed the people of Rwanda.\n  Samantha Power is the author of a book which I have read, a book \nwhich haunts and inspires me. It is a book entitled ``A Problem From \nHell: America and the Age of Genocide.'' She wrote, ``The United States \nhad never in its history intervened to stop genocide and had in fact \nrarely even made a point of condemning it as it occurred.''\n  That is a terrible condemnation on our Nation, and it is one that I \nthink calls us all to action in Sudan.\n  This is not a partisan issue. I want to salute my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side, Senator Jon Corzine of New Jersey, and on the \nRepublican side Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas and Senator Mike DeWine \nof Ohio. They have spoken out on this floor time and time again about \nthe genocide in Sudan. They remember, as I remember, what happened in \nRwanda--what happened while I was a Member of Congress, and while I did \nnot pay as much attention as I should have.\n  Ten years ago, between 800,000 and a million people were butchered in \nRwanda. The killings took place with terrifying efficiency. The weapons \nof mass destruction were simple: the machete, the club, the torch. \nThose with enough money in Rwanda were sometimes able to pay their \nkillers to shoot them rather than hack them to death with a machete. \nThese killings were crudely carried out and executed, but they were \ncarefully orchestrated. They were designed to wipe out an ethnic group, \nthe Rwandan Tutsis, from the face of the Earth, along with any other \nmoderate Hutus who dared to question the ruling ideology.\n  Bill Clinton, a man I count as a friend, was President of the United \nStates when this occurred. He read a series of articles about the \nkillings in Rwanda. He turned to his National Security Adviser Sandy \nBerger and asked, Is what they are saying true? How did this happen? \nBill Clinton came to realize after the genocide in Rwanda that the \nUnited States had made a historic, tragic mistake of not speaking up, \nof not moving with other nations to stop what happened in Rwanda. He \nvisited that country and apologized on behalf of our country and the \nrest of the world for ignoring, for standing idly by, while a million \npeople died. That happened in Rwanda because the United States allowed \nit to happen.\n  I am dwelling on Rwanda today, but the crisis is in Sudan. Why? \nBecause years from now I don't want those of us serving in Congress to \nbe asked about Sudan, How did this happen? We know how it is happening, \nand we know it continues to happen even as we speak.\n  Ten years ago, seven Tutsi pastors trapped in a hospital that was no \nsanctuary wrote to the world pleading for intervention and assistance. \nHere are their words: ``We wish to inform you that we have heard that \ntomorrow we will be killed with our families.'' There was no \nintervention. There was no help. And the next day, these Christian \npastors and their families were killed, and hundreds of others with \nthem.\n  We failed to act in Rwanda. We cannot fail to act in Darfur, Sudan. \nFor months, in western Sudan, the janjaweed, Arab militias--death \nsquads--have waged war on the ethnic African villagers. They have \nkilled thousands outright. They have engaged in massive, systematic \nrape and told their victims that they hoped they would produce ``light-\nskinned'' babies. They have made 1.5 million people homeless, some \ninternally displaced and some forced into Chad and other neighboring \nnations. The Sudanese Government, a government which should be \nprotecting its people, has conspired in this mass murder and \ncontributed to it by deliberately shutting out international \nhumanitarian efforts to reach the refugees. Starvation, disease, and \nexposure to the elements are also the weapons of genocide.\n  My family grew up in Springfield, IL in a typical American community \nand typical American neighborhood. Next door were our closest friends, \nthe Mays family. There was a young woman, a young girl when I first met \nher, who grew up with my kids. Her name is Robin Mays. She is an \namazing young woman who succeeded in so many different facets of life \nand decided to enlist in the Air Force right out of college. She was in \nthe Air Force for 7 years as an officer in charge of logistics. When \nshe came out of the Air Force, she came to me and said, I would like to \ndo something that uses my skills that might help people. I put her in \ncontact with the World Food Program. She went to Ethiopia, and she was \ninvolved in dealing with the refugee problems and feeding thousands. \nShe came back to the United States and went to work for USIA. A few \nmonths ago, she was sent to the Sudan, and she is there. She is working \nin Sudan now with the victims of genocide, with the refugees. The other \nday she sent an e-mail to her family. She shared it with me. She was so \nexcited because she heard there were actually people in the United \nStates talking about what was happening in Sudan. It was encouraging to \nher that the rest of the world even knew what was happening in Sudan. \nShe didn't hold any great hope that we would run to her aid and find \nsome relief for these poor victims, but she was so encouraged that we \neven knew and that we even cared.\n  What a sad commentary on a great nation like the United States and \nmany other great nations around the world, that that is the best we can \ndo to acknowledge the problem, to express our concern.\n  An estimated 180,000 Sudanese have fled to Chad, one of the poorest \ncountries in the world. Hundreds of thousands more are displaced within \nSudan, roaming around, trying to look for a safe place or something to \nfeed their children. When you look at the images\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\nof the mothers in the Darfur region, Sudanese mothers and their \nchildren with matchstick legs, covered with flies, dying, starving \nright before our eyes, we have to ask, are we doing what we should? Is \nthe United States doing what it should?\n  We have to take steps, and we have to take them now, to stop this \nmass slaughter. We start by calling it what it is--genocide--and by \nlabeling it a genocide. It calls all who signed the treaty to action to \nprevent genocide, not just to care but to do something. The United \nStates and the United Nations must both label this for what it is. \nSecretary of State Powell has stated that Sudan is ``moving toward a \ngenocidal conclusion.'' That is short of calling it a genocide, but I \ngive the Secretary of State credit. In many times gone by, when a \ngenocide was occurring, we could not even bring ourselves at the \nofficial level to acknowledge it. Secretary of State Powell is doing \nthat, and I salute him for it. Sudan has reached the stage of genocide, \nbut that genocide has not reached its final conclusion. There is still \ntime to save the lives of hundreds of thousands.\n  On Friday of this week, many of us will leave this Chamber. We will \nbe off to political conventions, campaigns, time with our families, \nvacations. The first part of September, we will return. Six weeks from \nnow, 45 days from now, we will be back, but during that 45-day period \nof time, 40,000 or 50,000 innocent people will die in the Sudan. There \nis no vacation from genocide. There is certainly no vacation from the \nSudan. I try to imagine, as I stand here with all the comforts of being \na U.S. Senator in this great country, what it must be like to be a \nmother or a father in that country now watching your children starve to \ndeath, fearing systematic rape, torture, and killing, which have become \nso routine.\n  We have to do something. We have to do it now. Congress should move \nto pass resolutions to let the world know we are prepared to move \nforward. Senator Brownback, a Republican from Kansas, and Senator \nCorzine, a Democrat from New Jersey, are pushing forward a resolution \nthat we should not leave this city for any length until it is enacted. \nBut we need not just words. We need to continue to send assistance, as \nwe have, and we deserve credit as a nation for caring and reaching out, \nbut we need to do more--food, water, medicine, but also security for \nforeign aid workers to get in and to allow the Sudanese refugees to \nreturn home.\n  The United Nations Security Council has failed as well. It has been \nstymied by several nations which don't want to hold the Sudanese \nGovernment responsible for what is happening. We need to move \nimmediately. I know our new U.N. ambassador, Jack Danforth, a man whom \nI greatly respect, a man of conscience, understands this, as we do. He \nneeds to push those members of the Security Council to get the United \nNations to act on Darfur and the Sudan immediately. We need to \nintervene. We need to see whether, in the 21th century, international \ninstitutions such as the United Nations can succeed where others have \nfailed.\n\n  The United States also has rich intelligence resources and \ncapabilities that track militia activity. We have 1,800 troops on \nDijibouti who could join an international humanitarian mission. \nUltimately, it is the African Union that must supply the personnel to \nenforce security, but we can help.\n  President Bush--and I disagree with him on so many things, but I have \nto give him credit where it is due--helped in Liberia with a handful of \nmarines prepared to act. They brought stability to a situation that \nseemed out of control. We need that same leadership again from this \nWhite House, from this Department of Defense, from the State \nDepartment, and from this Congress.\n  Security is a prerequisite in this country of Sudan for helicopter \nand truck transport which is going to carry supplies to those who are \nliterally starving to death. The Sudanese Government has to rein in \nthese militias. It cannot continue to look the other way. It recently \nallowed some relief supplies to be offloaded, but the Government has \nhelped unleash the genocide in the Sudan, helped arm and direct the \nJanjaweed. They cannot be trusted to see to their disarmament without \ninternational supervision. We have voted to extend millions in \nemergency assistance to Sudan, but that assistance will never reach \nthem unless we create conditions on the ground that allow its \ndistribution.\n  Mine is only one voice in a Chamber of 100 Senators, in a nation of \nmillions of people. I don't know that what I have to say in the Senate \nwill have an impact on anyone, but I could not and many of my \ncolleagues could not countenance leaving Washington in good conscience \nfor an August vacation recess and acting like the carnage in Sudan is \nnot occurring. It is genocide. Those in the civilized world must stand \nup and not only condemn it but take action to bring it to an end as \nquickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak on a matter different \nthan what my friend and colleague from Illinois has spoken about, but \nbefore I do, I associate myself with his comments.\n  I stand with him and others on both sides of the aisle in asking the \nquestion, Are we doing all that we should be doing in the Sudan? \nGenocide is occurring. We can have debate about the legal definition of \ngenocide, but for the folks who are experiencing the pain and the \nsuffering, the torture, they are not interested in legal debate.\n  I hope we heed the call of my friend from Illinois, that before we \nleave, before we go home to be with our families and do the things we \ndo in our State and throughout this country, that we at a minimum speak \nout, that at a minimum the voice of this Congress be heard, and that we \nthen move forward on the path, beyond speaking out, that will provide \nsome action, that will provide a level of safety, security, and \ncomfort, the basic things that need to be done in the Sudan.\n  As I listened, I want my friend from Illinois to know that his words \nhave had impact. I hope they echo far beyond these halls and that we do \nwhat should be done, that we make a statement in this Congress, that \nstatement be turned into action, and that action has some impact.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Coleman pertaining to the introduction of S. 2715 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

Madam President, I rise today to congratulate El Mundo on \nits 24th anniversary and to recognize the tremendous importance of this \nweekly newspaper to Nevada's Spanish-speaking community.\n  The oldest continuing Spanish language newspaper in southern Nevada, \nEl Mundo has grown dramatically over the last 24 years to a current \nreadership of more than 120,000. The newspaper not only provides \ninsightful coverage of important issues facing Nevada and the Nation, \nbut also provides a window into the life and times of southern Nevada's \nLatino community.\n  By giving consumers the information they need to make important \npurchase decisions about everything from clothing to cars to homes, El \nMundo's commercial listings have helped thousands of new residents \nacclimate to life in the region, and fueled the economic engine of \nsouthern Nevada.\n  The growth of El Mundo has paralleled the growth of Nevada's Latino \ncommunity. When El Mundo was founded in 1980, about 50,000 Latinos \nlived in Nevada, representing 6 to 7 percent of the population. Today \nthe Latino population approaches the half million mark and accounts for \nas much as 25 percent of our State's population.\n  El Mundo not only reflects the growing prominence of Latinos in \nSouthern Nevada but also provides a channel through which this vibrant \nand diverse community is helping to shape the future of Nevada's \neconomic, political, and cultural life.\n  I also want to take a moment to recognize Edward Escobedo, the \nfounder and publisher of El Mundo, whose dedication and leadership has \nbeen indispensable to the growth of the newspaper. He and his \ncolleagues can take great pride in transforming their vision into a \nsouthern Nevada institution. Eddie has been a leader in charitable and \ncivic affairs in the greater Las Vegas area for decades. Nevada is a \nbetter place because of Eddie Escobedo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8536-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LAS VEGAS INTERNATIONAL FOLK FESTIVAL\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the Las Vegas \nInternational Folk Festival, which was held June 18 through 20.\n  Hosted by the Mexico Vivo Dance Company, the Festival brought \ntogether artists from around the world to celebrate the artistic \ntraditions of the United States, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, \nand the Caribbean.\n  All of the festival's performances were free to the public, providing \nthe residents of Las Vegas with a wonderful opportunity to experience \nthe world's diverse artistic and cultural heritages. Some 500 \nperforming artists and dance students participated in this 3-day event.\n  I want to take a moment to recognize Ixela Gutierrez, the festival's \nfounder and artistic director, who helped make this wonderful event \npossible. Among the leading artists in Nevada, Ms. Gutierrez has \nenjoyed a successful soloist dance career with The National Folkloric \nBallet of Mexico, served as company director of Ballet Ollimpaxqui, and \nchoreographed six seasons for the Las Vegas Civic Ballet. She also \nfounded the Mexico Vivo Dance Company in Las Vegas in 1995 to preserve \nand share the rich artistic heritage of Mexican and Latin American folk \ndances.\n  Ms. Gutierrez has been recognized by many organizations throughout \nher career, and she received a special Award of Distinction in Culture \nfrom the Latin Chamber of Commerce of Las Vegas. She also has enjoyed \nthe honor of performing for President Bush at the White House's Cinco \nde Mayo celebration. She is now focusing her energy and talent on \nbuilding a new Las Vegas tradition, by making the International Folk \nFestival an annual event.\n  I also recognize the sponsors of this outstanding event: Fitzgerald's \nHotel and Casino, Fremont Street Experience, Nevada Youth Alliance, and \nMexican Patriotic Committee.\n  The inaugural Las Vegas International Folk Festival was a great \nsuccess, and I am sure everyone who attended is looking forward to next \nyear's event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8536-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8536-S8537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                SERGEANT 1ST CLASS LINDA TARANGO-GRIESS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

She selflessly gave her time and her \nexpertise to preserving American ideals through her service to the \nGuard. At the time of her death, she was serving in Samarra, Iraq, when \nan improvised explosive device detonated near her convoy vehicle.\n  Those who knew Sergeant First Class Tarango-Griess were continually \ninspired by the example of leadership she set, her positive attitude \nand her confidence were great assets to her and her colleagues. Her \nfamily recently set up a memorial in North Platte, NE. One poster, \nespecially, demonstrated the ongoing optimism that she helped others to \nsee. This poster reads: ``We will miss you. No goodbyes. See you \nlater.''\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of SFC Linda \nTarango-Griess, but she will remain as a beacon of dedication and \npatriotism to all Americans from her shining example of commitment \nthrough her service to the Armed Forces.\n\n\n                        sergeant jeremy fischer\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Sergeant Fischer was deployed in February from Fort Riley, KS, \nand was serving in Samarra, Iraq at the time of his death on July 11, \n2004, when an improvised explosive device detonated near his convoy \nvehicle.\n  While SGT Fischer was in Iraq, he used his knowledge and skills to \nserve\n\n[[Page S8537]]\n\nthe National Guard as a chemical repair specialist, and was part of a \nteam that installed armor kits on Humvees to protect soldiers.\n  Those who knew him know that he embodied all the qualities people \nadmire about Nebraskans.

Madam President, August 3, 2004 marks the \n60th anniversary of what is believed to be the worst military aviation \ndisaster in the history of the State of Nebraska. At 8:25 p.m. an Army \nC-47 transport airplane dropped from the sky near Naper, NE, killing 28 \nbrave World War II servicemen. The dead included 26 Army pilots, one \nflight surgeon, and an aircraft crew chief. They were traveling from \nthe Bruning, NE air base to Pierre, SD to complete their training \nbefore being shipped off to war.\n  On August 8, Naper Historical Society of Boyd County, NE will \ndedicate a permanent memorial to the Naper 28. They raised funds for \nthe Naper 28 Memorial through a donation campaign. What is perhaps most \ntouching about this fundraising effort is not the funds themselves, not \neven the speed with which they came, but it was the sentiments attached \nby way of note or letter from other World War II veterans or their \nwidows. At the time of the disaster, very little attention was paid to \nthis aviation disaster. Though it commemorates the tragedy that befell \nthe Naper 28, the memorial at Knollcrest Cemetery in Naper, NE, also \nbears witness to a more enduring lesson in bravery and valor and \npreserving the freedom that defines America.\n  No doubt, the town of Naper, and citizens throughout Boyd County are \ndelighted finally to have a fitting memorial for the 28 servicemen who \nlost their lives in 1944. It is fitting that the Naper 28 Memorial will \nbe dedicated the same year as the National World War II Memorial in \nWashington, DC. This year marks an especially commemorative year for \nAmerica's veterans, and is a year when all Americans gratefully \nremember and honor the bravery and valor with which America fought in \nWorld War II.\n  Anniversaries, like the 60th anniversary of D-Day and the 60th \nanniversary of the Naper 28, are important reminders about our history \nas a Nation, and about our character as Americans.\n  As America pauses to recall the thankless bravery and sacrifice of \nthose who died protecting our freedoms on D-Day, the people of Naper \nand all Nebraska also pause to remember the tragedy and sacrifices and \nlost opportunities of the Naper 28.\n  I submit the names of the brave souls of the Naper 28, as they appear \non the memorial in Naper, NE, as further commemoration of their \nsacrifice.\n  They are as follows:\n\n                              The Naper 28\n\n     F/O John F.

Madam President, during World War II, some 23,000 Roma \nwere sent to Auschwitz, mostly from Germany, Austria, and the occupied \nCzech lands. Sixty Years ago, on the night of August 2 and 3, the order \nwas given to liquidate the ``Gypsy Camp'' at Auschwitz. Over the course \nof that night, 2,898 men, women, and children were put to death in the \ngas chambers. In all, an estimated 18,000 Roma died at Auschwitz-\nBirkenau.\n  During the intervening years, Aug. 2 and 3 have become days to \nremember the Porrajmos, the Romani word that means ``the Devouring,'' \nand to mourn the Romani losses of the Holocaust.\n  As the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has suggested, Roma are \n``understudied victims'' of the Nazis. What we don't know about the \nRomani experiences during the war is far greater than what is known.\n  But we do know that the fate of the Roma varied from country to \ncounty, and depended on many factors. We know that, in addition to the \natrocities in Auschwitz, thousands of Roma were gassed at Chelmno. We \nknow that an estimated 90 percent of Croatia's Romani population--tens \nof thousands of people--were murdered. We know that approximately \n25,000 Roma were deported by the Romanian regime to Transnistria in \n1942, where some 19,000 of them perished there in unspeakable \nconditions. We know that in many places, such as Hungary, Roma were \nsimply executed at the village edge and dumped into mass graves. We \nknow that in Slovakia, Roma were put into forced labor camps, and that \nin France, Roma were kept in internment camps for fully a year after \nthe war ended.\n  Still, far more research remains to be done in this field, especially \nwith newly available archives like those from the Lety concentration \ncamp in the Czech Republic. I commend the Holocaust Museum for the \nefforts it has made to shed light on this still dark corner of the \npast, and I welcome the work of nongovernmental organizations, such as \nthe Budapest-based Roma Press Center, for collecting the memories of \nsurvivors.\n  I do not think I can overstate the consequences of the Porrajmos. \nSome scholars estimate that as many as half of Europe's Romani minority \nperished. For individuals, for families, and for surviving communities, \nthose losses were devastating. Tragically, the post-war treatment of \nRoma compounded one set of injustices with others. Those who were most \ndirectly involved in developing the Nationalist-Socialist framework for \nthe racial persecution of Roma--Robert Ritter and Eva Justin--were \nnever brought to justice for their crimes and were allowed to continue \ntheir medical careers after the war. The investigative files on \nRitter--including evidence regarding his role in the forced \nsterilization of Roma--were destroyed. German courts refused to \nrecognize, until 1963, that the persecution of Roma based on their \nethnic identity began at least as early as 1938. By the time of the \n1963 ruling, many Romani survivors had already died.\n  During my years of service on the leadership of the Helsinki \nCommission, I have been struck by the tragic plight of Roma throughout \nthe OSCE region. It is not surprising that, given the long history of \ntheir persecution, Roma continue to fight racism and discrimination \ntoday.

Madam President, I am delighted to join my \ncolleagues Senator Wyden, Senator Lott and Senator Snowe in introducing \na bipartisan bill that will begin to address our Government's dangerous \ntendency toward excessive secrecy.\n  I start from the belief that, in our democratic society, the people \nshould have access to all information which their Government holds in \ntheir behalf. The only exceptions should be for necessary personal and \ncompany privacy concerns, such as tax returns, and for\n\n[[Page S8538]]\n\nlegitimate national security threats, such as protecting the sources \nand methods of gathering extremely sensitive information. The current \nlevel of abuse of our classification system is so egregious as to be \nlaughable.\n  To make matters worse, when the Congress has sought to declassify \nimportant information, we have allowed the fox to guard the henhouse--\nwe have allowed the CIA and other agencies to determine what gets \nreleased to the American public from reports that are critical of their \nconduct.\n  I am personally most familiar with the report of the House and Senate \nIntelligence Committees' Joint Inquiry into the intelligence failures \nsurrounding 9/11. After our report was filed in December 2002, it took \n7 months to get a declassified version that we could release. And after \nall those months, the intelligence agencies and the White House refused \nto declassify pages and pages of information that might have caused \nthem embarrassment--but certainly did not threaten our national \nsecurity.\n  The most famous instance of censorship is the 27 pages that detail \nforeign sources of support of two of the 19 hijackers while they were \nliving among us and finalizing their evil plot. For all we know, that \npattern of support continues to this day. But our report found a number \nof instances where failures to share information were in and of \nthemselves threats to national security.\n  Had Federal agencies' watch lists of terrorist suspects been shared, \nespecially with State and local law enforcement officials, police might \nhave detained prior to 9/11 several of the hijackers when they were \nstopped for traffic offenses. We also have learned that the President's \nDaily Brief of August 6, 2001, listed a number of pending threats to \nour homeland, including hijackings of commercial aircraft. If only that \ninformation had been shared with the airlines through the FAA, the \nairlines could have heightened security on board aircraft and more \nthoroughly screened their passenger lists. Instead, no steps were \ntaken.\n  One of the Joint Inquiry's recommendations, No. 15, called on the \nPresident and the intelligence agencies to review executive orders, \npolicies and procedures that govern national security classification of \nintelligence information:\n\n     in an effort to expand access to relevant information for \n     Federal agencies outside the Intelligence Community, for \n     State and local authorities, which are critical to the fight \n     against terrorism, and for the American public.\n\n  The recommendation also called on Congress to review statutes, \npolicies and procedures governing classification. As the recommendation \nstates:\n\n       Among other matters, Congress should consider the degree to \n     which excessive classification has been used in the past and \n     the extent to which the emerging threat environment has \n     greatly increased the need for real-time sharing of sensitive \n     information.\n\n  The report called on the Director of Central Intelligence, the \nAttorney General, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity and the Secretary of State to review and report to the House \nand Senate committees with ``proposals to protect against the use of \nthe classification process as a shield to protect agency self-\ninterest.''\n  Regrettably, none of the executive branch agencies have responded to \nthe Joint Inquiry's directives on this issue. So I am pleased to join \nmy colleagues in cosponsoring this legislation, which will create an \nIndependent National Security Classification Board within the executive \nbranch to force the administration and the intelligence agencies to \nrespond and to implement new procedures and standards. Once a new \nclassification system has been adopted, the independent board will have \naccess to all documents that are classified on the basis of national \nsecurity concerns and the authority to review classification decisions \nmade by executive branch employees. If the board disagrees with a \ndecision, it can make a recommendation to the President to reverse or \nalter the classification.\n  If the President doesn't adopt the board's recommendation, he must \nwithin 60 days explain his decision to Congress:\n\n     and post such notification and written justification on the \n     White House website.\n\n  This will, at the very least, let the American people know that they \nare being denied information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8538-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COSPONSORSHIP OF S. 2623\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I discuss a very important issue to my \nhome State of Wisconsin, and that is the time limits placed on \nSupplemental Security Income, SSI, benefits for refugees and other \nhumanitarian immigrants.-\n  Due to a provision included in the 1996 welfare reform law, some \nrefugees and other humanitarian immigrants legally residing in the \nUnited States, including many members of the Hmong ethnic group, are \nbeginning to lose their eligibility for SSI. The provision states that \nrefugees and other humanitarian immigrants are only eligible for SSI \nfor 7 years. Some of these legal immigrants have already lost their \nbenefits, and for others the 7-year deadline is quickly approaching.\n  Many of the Hmong who currently reside in Wisconsin and throughout \nthe U.S. provided invaluable assistance to the U.S. military during the \nVietnam War. The Hmong made great sacrifices in fighting against \ncommunists in Laos and providing intelligence to the CIA, and could no \nlonger stay in the region out of fear for their safety. In return for \ntheir sacrifices for our Nation, we relocated them to the United \nStates, along with their families, to live under refugee or \nhumanitarian immigrant status.\n  The refugees and other humanitarian immigrants who depend on SSI are \nelderly or disabled and often lack any other financial resources. Many \nHmong currently have applications for citizenship pending, and have \nbeen waiting for over 2 years for their applications to be processed by \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service and now the Department of \nHomeland Security. Others are suffering from serious mental or physical \ndisabilities that prevent them from completing the requirements \nnecessary to obtain citizenship. Losing their SSI eligibility will \ncause significant strain to those Hmong who rely on SSI as their only \nfinancial means.\n  I am proud to cosponsor S. 2623, the SSI Extension for Elderly and \nDisabled Refugees Act, which was introduced by Senator Smith. This bill \nwould extend the 7-year deadline by 2 years, giving those refugees who \ndepend on SSI some additional time to navigate the naturalization \nprocess.\n  It is my sincere hope that this bill will be taken up and passed \nquickly, since time is of the essence for this population. Many of the \nHmong risked their lives to help the United States and I believe that \nthe U.S. Government should do all it can to provide for them in their \ntime of need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8538-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8538-S8539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICAN HOSTAGES IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, last February, I rose before the Senate to \ndraw attention to the fate of three Americans taken hostage by the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)--Marc Gonsalves, Keith \nStansell, and Thomas Howes. It has been 5 months since then--17 months \nsince Marc, Keith and Tom were captured. Since that tragic day, these \nAmericans and their families have lived in fear, never knowing what \ntomorrow may bring. I say today what I said then--there must be no \nhigher priority than ensuring that Marc, Keith and Tom return safely \nhome. I commend the actions taken thus far by United States and \nColombian officials to find these brave Americans, but I urge them to \nredouble their efforts.\n  Marc, Keith and Tom were taken captive when their plane crashed in \nFARC controlled territory on February 13, 2003. Two individuals, an \nAmerican pilot, Tom Janis, and a Colombian intelligence officer, were \nkilled by the FARC at the crash site, and Marc, Keith and Tom have \nremained in captivity since that time. A video documentary released \nlast year containing interviews with the three men dramatically \nunderscores the urgency of their dire situation.\n  I know that all of our prayers remain with these Americans and their \nfamilies. As any parent knows, it is impossible to describe the pain \nthese families suffer knowing that their sons are in danger, unable to \ncommunicate with them, and uncertain whether they will ever see them \nagain. Marc Gonsalves' mother, Jo Rosano, is a Connecticut\n\n[[Page S8539]]\n\nresident. When I met with her in February, I pledged that I would do \neverything possible to return her son. I stand by that pledge today.\n  To that end, I have met with President Uribe and Colombian officials \nand urged them to secure Marc, Keith and Tom's release. President Uribe \nhas assured me that Colombian authorities are working to locate these \nAmericans and that Colombia will not end its search until they are \nfound.\n  I have likewise urged the Bush administration to provide all \nnecessary assistance to locate and gain the release of Marc, Keith and \nTom. During a hearing last year before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I urged William Wood, Ambassador to Colombia, to make their \nwell-being and safe release his highest priority. Ambassador Wood \nagreed to do so and promised to keep me informed about developments as \nthey occur. I thank him for his efforts to date.\n  Unfortunately, rescuing these three Americans will not be easy. But \nwhile doing so may not be easy, it is essential--it is our duty. We \nmust leave no stone unturned in our efforts to secure their release. \nAnd we must make sure that their families know that we have not \nforgotten their sons and will not rest until we find them. I will \ncontinue to work tirelessly on behalf of Marc, Keith and Tom, and I \nurge the Bush administration and the Colombian government, to do \neverything in their power to expedite their return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8539-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF WILLIAM G. MYERS III\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, yesterday the Senate voted on the \nnomination of William G. Myers III who has been nominated for a \nposition on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit \nincludes most western States as well as Alaska and Hawaii. These \nwestern States contain a vast portion of our natural resources and is \nhome to many of our Native Americans, Alaskan Natives and Hawaiian \nnatives.\n  President Bush nominated Mr. Myers on May 15, 2003 while he served as \nSolicitor General for the Department of Interior. He was voted out of \nthe Judiciary Committee on April 1, 2004, by a party line vote of 10-9.\n  A large portion of Mr. Myers' 22-year legal career has been in \nWashington working as a lobbyist and as a governmental lawyer in \nRepublican administrations. During his legal career, Mr. Myers has \nnever served in a judiciary capacity; he has never participated in a \ntrial, and has received a partial Not Qualified rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association, its lowest rating.\n  During his tenure as Solicitor General he has shown his contempt for \nenvironmental protections and has disregarded the necessary input of \nNative Americans into decisions that directly affect them. As \nSolicitor, he reversed an opinion made by his predecessor during the \nClinton administration regarding the interpretation of a statute. This \nreversal led to the issuanc of a permit to the Glamis Company to open \nand operate the Glamis Imperial Mine on Quechan Indian Sacred land. The \ndecision to overturn this opinion was done without government-to-\ngovernment consultation with the Quechan Indian Tribe, which is \nrequired by the policies implemented by the executive branch. Despite \nrequests made by the Quechan Indian Tribe to meet with the Interior \nDepartment, he never made any attempts to convene with the tribe while \nSolicitor, yet had several meetings with the Glamis Company regarding \nthis gold mine.\n  Mr. Myers placed his mining industry ties before all others. It is \nhis judgment demonstrated here that lead the nonpartisan National \nCongress of American Indians to oppose this judicial nomination for the \nfirst time in this organization's 60-year existence.\n  The nomination of Mr. Myers is opposed by more than 175 \nenvironmental, Native American, labor, civil rights, disability rights, \nwomen's rights and other organizations. The New York Times, the Los \nAngeles Times, and the San Francisco Chronicle have editorialized in \nopposition to his confirmation.\n  Now, I point out that I have voted and the Senate has confirmed many \nconservative judges. Do I like their politics? Probably not. Will I be \nhappy with their rulings all of the time? No. Do I think they can \nresist partisan activism while serving on the bench? Yes. Regardless of \na judge's political leanings, I will support a nominee who understands \nand is respectful of the rule of law. It is apparent that Mr. Myers \nwill put industry ahead of our environment, the sacred land rights of \nNative Americans, and most importantly what is in the best interest of \nthe general public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8539-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8539-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           NATIONAL VETERANS BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION\n\n Mr. KERRY.

This opinion by \nthe admiration not only goes against congressional intent, but it \nseverely undermines the ability of the corporation to deliver needed \nassistance to veteran entrepreneurs.\n  As a supporter of the original legislation that established the \nVeterans Corporation, I can tell you that Congress fully intended the \nVeterans Corporation to be a private entity and not a Federal agency. \nThis bipartisan legislation simply clarifies the status of the Veterans \nCorporation and reaffirms Congress's original objective.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation, which we \nseek to pass today. Passing this legislation expeditiously will mean \nthat the Veterans Corporation can continue to carry out its \ncongressionally mandated mission and that our veteran-owned small \nbusiness are able to receive the development assistance they need to \nstart and expand. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8539-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8539-S8540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE SMART PROGRAM\n\n Mr. SMITH.

The program gives children who have difficulty reading \nthe extra support and one-on-one attention they need to learn to read \nand succeed.\n  Each year, SMART matches more than 11,000 young children in Oregon \nwith adult volunteers for weekly one-on-one reading sessions. \nIndependent research shows that these relationships have a measurable \nimpact on the students' reading performance. At a time when we are \nstriving to better serve our Nation's students, this Oregon program is \na model for the Nation. SMART has improved young Oregonians' \nperformance on important benchmark exams, and has given students an \nimportant boost of confidence for continued academic success.\n  Twelve years ago, Johnell Bell was a first grader struggling to learn \nto read.\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\nHis teacher noted Johnell toiling to keep pace with his classmates, and \nrecommended him for SMART. For several years, Johnell worked with one \nof SMART's 10,000 volunteers to develop his reading skills. With free \nbooks at his disposal, Johnell practiced reading at home and quickly \ndeveloped into a star student and a dynamic young leader. Now a student \nat Portland State University, he is returning the favor. Every week, he \nspends time between classes with two SMART readers.\n  We should learn from proven successes and invest in programs that \nhave a measurable impact on our children's future. By successfully \nmobilizing communities to improve the lives of thousands of children, \nSMART, and other programs like it, provide hope for America's \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8540-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8540-S8541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    U.S. INSTITUTE OF PEACE 2004 NATIONAL PEACE ESSAY CONTEST WINNER\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I would like to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention the nationally recognized essay of one of my \nconstituents, Vivek Viswanathan, a junior at Herricks High School in \nNew Hyde Park, NY. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Viswanathan on \nJune 23, 2004, when he visited my office during the United States \nInstitute of Peace 2004 National Peace Essay Contest, NPEC Awards Week \nin Washington. The mandate of the United States Institute of Peace, as \nestablished by Congress, is to support the development, transmission, \nand use of knowledge to promote peace and curb violent international \nconflict. The Institute's annual NPEC, one of its oldest programs, is \nbased on the belief that expanding the study of peace, justice, freedom \nand security is vital to civic education.\n  Mr. Viswanathan's essay, ``Establishing Peaceful and Stable Postwar \nSocieties Through Effective Rebuilding Strategy'' was awarded first-\nplace among the essays of his peers representing all 50 States, U.S. \nterritories and overseas schools. In his essay, Mr. Viswanathan argues \nthat to be effective, reconstruction efforts should be tailored to the \nspecific post-war situation, obtain a large commitment of resources and \nassistance from the international community, and involve ``a nation's \nown people in a way that allows them to ultimately control their \ndestiny and that eventually provides a clear exit strategy for \ninternational actors.'' I am proud of Mr. Viswanathan's commendable \nessay and congratulate him and his teachers at Herricks High School. \nMr. Viswanathan is a bright and energetic student who will be a leader \nin his future endeavors. I would like to share with my colleagues a \ncopy of Mr. Viswanathan's first-place essay. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Establishing Peaceful and Stable Postwar Societies Through Effective \n                          Rebuilding Strategy\n\n       While the resolution of armed conflict may bring initial \n     order within a war-torn nation, it does not guarantee long-\n     term peace and stability. Establishing an orderly society \n     from the ruins of war--enacting a workable political, \n     economic, and social structure in a place where violence and \n     instability have been the rule--is an undertaking that is \n     necessarily complex. Moreover, the discontinuation of armed \n     conflict does not imply resolution of the underlying concerns \n     that caused the conflict. Humanitarian crises can compound \n     problems. An inability to deal with these factors \n     intelligently and effectively can cripple the rebuilding \n     process and lead to renewed strife.\n       History has shown that the most effective rebuilding \n     efforts integrate three important strategies. Firstly, they \n     are tailored to the postwar situation with which they are \n     dealing. An assessment of which factors-pose the gravest \n     challenges to rebuilding in each post-conflict situation is \n     absolutely necessary. Factors that destabilize rebuilding \n     must not be addressed haphazardly but rather at their roots. \n     Secondly, successful rebuilding involves a vast commitment of \n     resources and assistance on the part of the international \n     community. Piecemeal efforts will not suffice. Finally, \n     rebuilding efforts must involve a nation's own people in a \n     way that allows them to ultimately control their destiny and \n     that eventually provides a clear exit strategy for \n     international actors.\n       Case studies of the Marshall Plan in Western Europe and the \n     U.N. and U.S.'s rebuilding efforts in Somalia in the early \n     1990s demonstrate the necessity of correctly identifying the \n     most fundamental and pressing challenges of rebuilding, \n     dealing with them in a powerful and forceful way, and \n     involving a nation's people in rebuilding efforts in order to \n     build a strong, self-sustaining society.\n       The Marshall Plan is a study in successful rebuilding. When \n     World War II ended in 1945, the European continent was in \n     tatters. America initially believed that limited aid and \n     relaxed trade barriers would be enough to spur Europe to \n     economic recovery. But by 1947, the economic situation was \n     dire. The UN reported that postwar labor productivity in \n     Europe was 40-50% of prewar levels, and low wages and food \n     shortages compounded the problems. As the economy tanked, \n     support for the Communist party in various countries began to \n     grow. The U.S. began to fear Soviet domination of Western \n     Europe.\n       By 1947, Secretary of State George Marshall understood the \n     plight of the European continent and the danger it faced. \n     ``The patient is sinking while the doctors deliberate,'' he \n     told the American people. In a now-famous speech that year at \n     Harvard University, Marshall laid out the European Recovery \n     Program--the Marshall Plan--and brilliantly addressed the \n     three important strategies of rebuilding. Firstly, he \n     correctly assessed the situation in Europe. Marshall realized \n     that the root problem that afflicted rebuilding efforts was \n     economic and not political in nature. He emphasized that the \n     effective way to stifle Communism was to address Europe's \n     economic troubles. ``Our policy is directed not against any \n     country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation, \n     and chaos,'' Marshall said. ``Its purpose should be the \n     revival of a working economy . . . to permit the emergence of \n     political and social conditions in which free institutions \n     can exist.''\n       Secondly, Marshall understood that for rebuilding to \n     succeed, a massive investment of resources into Europe on the \n     part of the U.S. was necessary. ``Assistance . . . must not \n     be on a piecemeal basis . . . [it] should provide a cure \n     rather than a mere palliative,'' he said.\n       Finally, Marshall understood that the chances of a rational \n     and cohesive rebuilding effort would be greatly increased by \n     allowing Europeans to retain much control over the rebuilding \n     program. The U.S., he said, should limit itself to ``friendly \n     aid'' and advice. The Marshall Plan's four-year timetable \n     also provided a framework for success.\n       Eventually, between 1948 and 1952, the U.S. appropriated \n     $13.3 billion dollars--a staggering sum in that day--for the \n     Marshall Plan. The money was spent toward greatly increasing \n     European productivity and modernizing factory and transport \n     systems. And the Europeans had a hand in formulating a \n     workable rebuilding policy.\n       The Plan was incredibly successful. Western Europe's gross \n     national product climbed 32 percent during the Marshall Plan, \n     and by 1952 agricultural production and industrial output \n     exceeded prewar levels by 11 and 40 percent, respectively. \n     Through the revived economy, Western Europe had been re-\n     integrated into the free world; even as the U.S.S.R. \n     dominated Eastern Europe, Western Europe would stand for four \n     decades as a bulwark against Soviet expansion. Calling him a \n     man who ``offered hope to those who desperately needed it,'' \n     TIME named him its 1947 Man of the Year. And in 1953, \n     Marshall was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n       In contrast, the U.N. and U.S.'s post-conflict \n     reconstruction experience in Somalia in the early 1990s \n     demonstrates the consequences of an incompetent and \n     halfhearted approach to nation-building. With the collapse of \n     Mohamed Siad Barre's regime in 1991, Somalia plunged into \n     civil war as various Somali clans engaged in a power \n     struggle. The chaos triggered a great humanitarian crisis. \n     Finally, after thousands were killed in intense fighting \n     in Mogadishu, a U.N.-brokered cease-fire between rival \n     clan leaders Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed was \n     achieved in March of 1992.\n       However, the U.N. and U.S.'s response afterward showed a \n     disregard for the three important strategies of rebuilding. \n     Firstly, the U.N. and the U.S. did not accurately assess the \n     Somali situation. The immense humanitarian crisis blinded the \n     international actors to the fact that the root problem that \n     was afflicting reconciliation was political in nature. The \n     initial U.N. and U.S. response in Operation Restore Hope \n     sought to be purely hunianitarian in nature, when in fact the \n     humanitarian and political situations were intertwined. The \n     U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission to Somalia later wrote, ``The \n     country's entire political and economic systems essentially \n     revolved around plundered food'' that was stolen from the \n     relief effort. Eventually, confronted with the deteriorating \n     political situation, the U.N. Security Council authorized \n     Resolution 794 in December of 1992, which allowed U.S. and \n     international troops to use ```all necessary means'' to \n     establish ``a secure environment for humanitarian relief \n     operations in Somalia.'' Even at this point, guaranteeing \n     political stability was seen as only a means for providing \n     humanitarian relief, rather than an end in itself. This is a \n     fine strategy for saving people's lives in the short-term--in \n     fact, the intervention in Somalia saved tens of thousands of \n     lives--but it is a poor strategy for rebuilding the fabric of \n     a nation.\n       Secondly, the international community was not eager to put \n     forth the significant monetary and troop commitment that \n     successful nation-building entails. However, reductions in \n     the troop force--from 25,000 to 4,200 by June of 1993--\n     ultimately proved counterproductive. As James Dobbins, who\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\n     oversaw various postwar reconstruction efforts (including \n     Somalia) while serving Bush and Clinton, put it, ``Only \n     when the number of stabilization troops has been low in \n     comparison to the population have U.S forces suffered or \n     inflicted significant casualties.'' The international \n     effort in Somalia was strikingly deficient.\n       Finally, the Somali mission failed to include many of the \n     Somali people in rebuilding efforts. The cease-fire efforts \n     attempted to treat the conflict as one between two major \n     warlords, when there were actually many other disaffected \n     people who went uninvited to peace talks. In fact, warlord \n     Ali Mahdi Mohamed, given stature by his inclusion in the \n     talks, attacked smaller clans the day after the U.N. \n     invitation to talks. One U.N. advisor wrote that the \n     international community's inability to recognize the \n     importance of representation in Somali politics was ``central \n     to nearly every failed peace conference.'' In the end, the \n     concept of an effective exit strategy for international \n     actors, which is designed to focus efforts on goals and \n     results, instead degenerated in Somalia into a rationale for \n     getting out.\n       After a clash between warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid and a \n     U.N. force on June 5, 1993, and the battle between Aidid and \n     U.S. forces on October 3, 1993 that left eighteen soldiers \n     dead, Clinton ordered a withdrawal of American troops that \n     was completed by March of 1994. The final U.N. troops left in \n     February of 1995 as rival clans continued to fight. As his \n     troops prepared to leave Somalia, Pakistani brigadier general \n     Saulat Abbas lamented, ``We've been able to save a lot of \n     people from hunger, disease. But we've not been able to \n     contribute anything politically.'' The nation-building effort \n     had failed.\n       The lessons of the Marshall Plan and international efforts \n     in Somalia are clear. For those nations overrun by war, the \n     cessation of violence is only a beginning. A careful and \n     well-reasoned rebuilding and reconciliation effort that is \n     uniquely relevant to the intricacies of each situation is \n     necessary for the re-emergence of a strong society that can \n     endure. In addition, international actors such as the U.N. \n     and U.S. must truly be committed to investing all the \n     resources necessary to build an orderly environment. This \n     often means going against the prevailing political winds. \n     Finally, the rebuilding of a nation must involve that \n     nation's own people and provide for their society to \n     eventually prosper on its own. With the proper approach and \n     commitment in place, post-conflict rebuilding efforts can \n     lead to societies that are peaceful, stable, and \n     secure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8541-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WALTER JOHNSON--HALF A CENTURY OF SERVICE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am pleased and honored to \nsalute Walter Johnson, the distinguished secretary-treasurer of the San \nFrancisco Labor Council, AFL-CIO. Walter is retiring after nearly two \ndecades in this position and more than 50 years of outstanding service \nto the labor community and the people of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n  Born in North Dakota, Walter Johnson served his country in World War \nII and settled in San Francisco after his discharge. He got a job as an \nappliance salesperson at Sears Roebuck and joined Local 1100 of the \nDepartment Store Employees Union. Rising through the ranks of the \nunion, he became its business agent in 1957 and was elected president a \nyear later. He was elected secretary-treasurer in 1964 and reelected 11 \ntimes.\n  Walter was elected secretary-treasurer of the labor council in 1985, \nand has held this top post ever since. As the leader of more than \n80,000 workers in 140 local unions and constituency groups, Walter \nJohnson represents the face and voice of San Francisco's labor \nmovement.\n  He also embodies its heart. Walter's compassion and commitment to \nsocial justice are legendary. In the 1950s, he played a key role in \nbreaking the color line by helping the first African American woman \nsecure a position behind the counter at Woolworth's. Over the past half \ncentury, he has fought for workers' rights at home and in foreign lands \nincluding China and South Korea. A cancer survivor himself, he has been \na leader in the fight against breast cancer. He is also active in his \nchurch, in promoting sports for children, and in the United Way of the \nBay Area.\n  Walter has become a trusted friend and adviser to me and to other \nelected officials, but he never lets us forget that we work for the \npeople not the other way around. Even after he retires, I will still \nhear Walter's voice and feel him tapping on my shoulder, reminding me \nnever to forget the working men and women I represent.\n  After more than 50 years of service, even Walter Johnson needs a \nlittle time off. Along with thousands of his friends and admirers \nthroughout the Bay Area, I wish him a long and pleasurable \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8541-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8541-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8541-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3574.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to emergency \n     supplemental appropriations to strengthen security and \n     increase staffing at United States-Canada border crossings; \n     to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 118\n\n       Whereas, for generations, the friendly, shared border of \n     4,000 miles between our country and our Canadian neighbors \n     has been a symbol of the blessings of peace. The recent \n     terrorist attacks have, however, shattered our sense of \n     security and prompted a reexamination of how we can better \n     protect ourselves; and\n       Whereas, a major component of any new strategy must be \n     making a stronger investment of resources and personnel along \n     our northern border, especially at the crossings between the \n     United States and Canada. The free flow of people and \n     materials crossing our northern border every day reflects our \n     close economic and cultural ties with Canada. The hard \n     lessons learned on September 11, 2001, make it clear that \n     greater scrutiny must be applied at entry points. The United \n     States Customs Service processed 489 million passengers in \n     2000. To monitor this volume of traffic effectively, \n     especially in the era of increased terrorist threats we now \n     face, will require a far greater allocation of staffing, \n     funding, and technology; and\n       Whereas, there is widespread agreement that the Customs \n     Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service are \n     seriously understaffed. This seems to be especially true \n     along our Canadian border when compared to efforts along the \n     Mexican frontier. Allocating a significant portion of the \n     emergency appropriations the President has called for is \n     fundamentally important to our national security and the \n     security of our Canadian neighbors: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize Congress and \n     the President of the United States to provide emergency \n     supplemental appropriations to strengthen security and \n     increase staffing at United States-Canadian border crossings; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-477. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the General Assembly of the state of Ohio relative to \n     retention and expansion of all military bases and centers in \n     Ohio; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 31\n\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Defense is \n     required by law to prepare a list of military bases to be \n     closed or realigned for the Base Closure and Realignment \n     Commission by May 16, 2005. The Department has announced that \n     the 2005 round of closures could have an impact as great as \n     the previous four rounds combined, closing nearly 100 bases; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Commission will submit its list to the \n     President of the United States by September 8, 2005, and, if \n     the President approves the list, he will forward it to the \n     United States Congress by September 23, 2005. The Congress \n     will either vote on the approved list, or it will become \n     effective 45 days after submission; and\n       Whereas, Ohio's military bases and centers are critical to \n     our national security and impact the present and future \n     capability of our defense force structure nationwide. The \n     state of Ohio has always worked on behalf of a strong \n     national defense and has a long history of outstanding \n     community and state support of Ohio's military bases and \n     centers; and\n       Whereas, Ohio has 38,000 defense jobs with a more than $4 \n     billion economic impact on our state and local economies, \n     including Wright Patterson Air Force Base as the largest \n     single-site employer in Ohio. Thus, significant closures or \n     defense job losses during the 2005 base realignment and \n     closure process would have an extremely detrimental effect at \n     both the state and local levels: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 125th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, express our support for \n     retention and expansion of all military bases and centers in \n     Ohio\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\n     and encourage all local governments to support the continued \n     operation of those bases and centers at full capacity; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 125th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, urge the Governor's All-Ohio \n     Task Force to Save Defense Jobs to work with communities, \n     legislators, local officials, and industry and labor leaders \n     to protect any threatened defense bases and centers and urge \n     local governments and community, industry, and labor leaders \n     to work with the Task Force to enhance the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of Ohio's military bases and centers so that \n     the Department of Defense will fully appreciate the military \n     value of Ohio's defense contributions and exploit those \n     capabilities by moving additional missions to our state, \n     thereby strengthening national defense; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit copies of \n     this resolution to the President of the United States, to the \n     United States Secretary of Defense, to the Speaker and Clerk \n     of the United States House of Representatives, to the \n     President Pro Tempore and the Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, to the members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, \n     to the Governor of Ohio, and to the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-478. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of New \n     Hampshire relative to the posthumous promotion of Colonel \n     Edward Ephraim Cross; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, Colonel Edward Ephraim Cross, a native of \n     Lancaster, New Hampshire, was named a colonel by the governor \n     of New Hampshire in 1861 at the outbreak of the Civil War and \n     was given command of the 5th Regiment, New Hampshire \n     Volunteers; and\n       Whereas, Colonel Cross valiantly led his regiment through \n     many battles of the Civil War, including the battles of Fair \n     Oaks, Glendale, Antietam, Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg, \n     and Gettysburg, and was wounded several times; and\n       Whereas, prior to Colonel Cross's untimely death after \n     suffering a wound by a sniper at the Battle of Gettysburg on \n     July 2, 1863, he was informed by his division commander, \n     Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, that he was to be \n     promoted to brigadier general; and\n       Whereas, a number of Civil War historians and enthusiasts \n     have over the years made requests of New Hampshire's governor \n     and congressional delegation that Colonel Cross be promoted \n     to brigadier general or brevet brigadier general: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring:\n       That the New Hampshire general court finds that Colonel \n     Cross's record of conduct, performance, and devotion to duty \n     reflect his allegiance to the highest standards of the \n     military profession and that, if not for his untimely death \n     at Gettysburg, Colonel Cross would have received a promotion \n     to brigadier general; and\n       That the New Hampshire general court urges the governor and \n     the federal government to take the procedural steps necessary \n     to posthumously promote New Hampshire native Colonel Edward \n     Ephraim Cross to the rank of brigadier general; and\n       That copies of this resolution be sent by the house clerk \n     to the governor, the President of the United States, the Vice \n     President of the United States, the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, and the members of the New \n     Hampshire Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-479.

It is unacceptable for us to stand by and let the \n     burdens that our Reservists, National Guard members, and \n     their families face continue to mount. It is time for the \n     people of Colorado to take action and stand in the gap here \n     at home for Colorado's fighting men and women; and\n       Whereas, neighbors helping neighbors is a Western tradition \n     that is still alive and well here in Colorado; and\n       Whereas, we, the people of Colorado, must do our part to \n     ensure that our fighting forces may take comfort in knowing \n     that the entire state of Colorado is helping to fill the gap \n     occasioned by their absence from their families so that they \n     may focus on protecting us; and\n       Whereas, our role as citizens in the War on Terrorism is \n     not only to function at a heightened state of vigilance \n     throughout our daily lives in order to help prevent another \n     terrorist attack, but also to ensure that our brave Colorado \n     fighting men and women and their families are supported \n     financially, emotionally, and spiritually; and\n       Whereas, currently, no Colorado organization exists that \n     allows citizens to help their fellow citizen soldiers who \n     serve either in the Reserves or National Guard lessen these \n     financial burdens; and\n       Whereas, recently, The Stand in the Gap Project, Inc., was \n     formed as a not-for-profit organization under section \n     501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to unite leaders and \n     citizens in working toward a real, financial, and long-term \n     solution for the burdens carried by military families; and\n       Whereas, the Stand in the Gap Project, Inc., aims to \n     provide a method by which Colorado citizens can help by \n     contributing their time, treasure, and talent to assist their \n     fellow Coloradans who are standing in the gap through \n     military service; and\n       Whereas, the Stand in the Gap Project, Inc., hopes to serve \n     as a catalyst and a focal point for other organizations \n     within the state to help effectively and efficiently reduce \n     the stresses experienced by National Guard and Reserve \n     families here in Colorado: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-\n     fourth General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein:\n       (1) That we, the members of the Sixty-fourth General \n     Assembly, support the efforts of The Stand in the Gap \n     Project, Inc., and urge our fellow Coloradans to join us in \n     taking responsibility for our troops and their families who \n     struggle to help protect us.\n       (2) That we, as Colorado citizen legislators, are committed \n     to doing everything humanly possible to address this problem \n     and that we pledge to stand in the gap for Colorado \n     Reservists, National Guard members, and their families in our \n     own districts and throughout Colorado.\n       (3) That we encourage our fellow Coloradans to contact The \n     Stand in the Gap Project, Inc., at \n     www.thestandinthegapproject.org to find out how to contribute \n     to this effort, both financially and through the organization \n     of Stand in the Gap events in their own communities.\n       (4) That we urge all Coloradans to join in this effort and \n     to continue to work to stand in the gap for our citizen \n     soldiers until they all come safely home; be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this joint resolution be sent to \n     George W.

These public \n     transportation routes include access to public and private \n     facilities, including boat ramps and marinas. Thousands of \n     people use the canals each year; and\n       Whereas, with no dredging of the Gibraltar canals since the \n     late 1950s, the use of the canals is today significantly \n     threatened by the buildup of sediment throughout the system. \n     Boating traffic is hampered by the buildup. The task of \n     dealing with the Gibraltar canals is made more complex by the \n     results of testing that has identified contamination in the \n     sediment. This fact will greatly increase the costs of \n     dredging and disposal of the sediment; and\n       Whereas, the costs of dredging the canals is far beyond the \n     resources available within the community of Gibraltar, and \n     the canals are available to and used by many more people than \n     residents of Gibraltar. This work clearly needs to be \n     completed. The Gibraltar canals are notable components of the \n     Detroit River system, and maintaining the quality of the \n     canals is work that is strongly related to the quality of \n     this vital part of our water transportation network. It is \n     essential that necessary resources be directed to this task: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to provide funding for the dredging of \n     canals around the city of Gibraltar; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-482.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Arizona \n     relative to Luke Air Force Base and Yuma Army Proving Ground; \n     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Memorial No. 2011\n\n       Whereas, the State of Arizona, its local governments and \n     its people recognize the vital role Arizona's Barry M. \n     Goldwater Range and other military facilities play in \n     ensuring our military's unparalleled training, combat \n     readiness and air superiority in protecting American freedom; \n     and\n       Whereas, Luke Air Force Base has operated continuously \n     since 1951 as a top rate pilot training facility, plays a \n     vital role in our nation's military superiority, is the home \n     of the largest fighter wing in the United States Air Force, \n     trains all F-16 pilots and crew chiefs for the United States \n     Air Force and is strategically located within fifty miles of \n     the Barry M. Goldwater Range; and\n       Whereas, in 1951 Luke Air Force Base and its related \n     auxiliary fields was located in an unurbanized, agricultural \n     portion of the Phoenix metropolitan area, but is now within \n     one of the fastest growing counties and municipal areas in \n     the Nation and State of Arizona, which has exacerbated the \n     challenges caused by urbanization in the Phoenix metropolitan \n     area; and\n       Whereas, the preservation of Luke Air Force Base is an \n     issue of national, state and local concern; and\n       Whereas, the State of Arizona, local communities and \n     landowners surrounding Luke Air Force Base and its related \n     auxiliary fields have made substantial strides in preserving \n     the mission of Luke Air Force Base and those efforts have \n     been held as a model around the Nation for military \n     facilities preservation; and\n       Whereas, the preservation efforts have placed a \n     considerably disproportionate burden on the surrounding \n     landowners of protecting a vital national defense asset; and\n       Whereas, despite the efforts Luke Air Force Base and its \n     related auxiliary fields continue to face the increasing \n     challenges caused by considerable growth; and\n       Whereas, additional land use restrictions surrounding Luke \n     Air Force Base and its related auxiliary fields are \n     impractical to implement without imposing an even greater and \n     disproportionate burden on the landowners, many of whom's \n     families have owned and farmed the surrounding lands before \n     the presence of Luke Air Force Base; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has extraordinary \n     landholdings in Arizona and the best long-term public policy \n     solution for the preservation of Luke Air Force Base and its \n     related auxiliary fields is a voluntary land exchange between \n     the United States Bureau of Land Management and the owners of \n     the vacant land and farm land within the high noise or \n     accident potential :ones surrounding Luke Air Force Base and \n     its related auxiliary fields; and\n       Whereas, the United States Army Yuma Proving Ground was \n     established in 1942 and has continuously operated as a \n     multipurpose training and testing facility able to test \n     nearly every weapon system in the ground combat arsenal; and\n       Whereas, at one thousand three hundred square miles, Yuma \n     Army Proving Ground has the size to allow Army weapon systems \n     to fully exercise their capabilities, and to continue testing \n     advanced systems capable of reaching greater distances \n     requiring a\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\n     larger footprint without endangering the public; and\n       Whereas, Yuma Army Proving Ground is a national and \n     international testing site for innovations in security, \n     surveillance and weaponry systems; and\n       Whereas, Yuma Army Proving Ground is the United States \n     Army's center for desert natural environment testing and its \n     climate, terrain and excellent range facilities make almost \n     perfect testing and training conditions; and\n       Whereas, in the last ten years, Yuma Army Proving Ground \n     has become a key location for training operations for all \n     services because of the similarity of its terrain and climate \n     to the Middle East; and\n       Whereas, the mission of Yuma Army Proving Ground is an \n     issue of national, state and local concern; and\n       Whereas, there remains within the boundaries of the Yuma \n     Army Proving Ground testing and training ranges many parcels \n     of property owned by both private land owners and the State \n     of Arizona; and\n       Whereas, these privately and publicly owned lands within \n     the boundaries of the Yuma Army Proving Ground testing and \n     training ranges are a safety concern and compromise the \n     overal1 mission and safety of the base; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has vast land holdings in \n     the vicinity of Yuma Army Proving Ground and the best long \n     term policy solution for the preservation of the Yuma Army \n     Proving Grounds is a voluntary exchange of land between the \n     United States Bureau of Land Management and the owners of \n     private property, and between the Bureau of Land Management \n     and the State of Arizona for the property that is located \n     within the boundaries of the testing and training ranges; and\n       Whereas, such land exchanges would otherwise compromise the \n     overall safety establish protections needed to eliminate the \n     challenges caused by growth, pressures.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to Mississippi River Gulf Outlet; to the Committee \n     on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 68\n\n       Whereas, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO), a \n     seventy-mile long manmade navigation channel which connects \n     the Gulf of Mexico to the Port of New Orleans was authorized \n     by the United States Congress in 1956 to be six hundred fifty \n     feet wide at the surface, five hundred feet at the bottom, \n     and to have a guaranteed channel depth of thirty-six feet; \n     and\n       Whereas, initial expectations were that the channel would \n     create a regional economic boom in the short term due to \n     construction jobs, but also in the long term due to the \n     industrial development associated with the commerce that \n     would come to the area through the shipping concerns; and\n       Whereas, the impact of the MRGO on the surrounding parishes \n     has been more loss than boom--loss of nearly three thousand \n     five hundred acres of fresh and intermediate marsh, loss of \n     over ten thousand acres of brackish marsh, loss of over four \n     thousand acres of saline marsh, loss of nearly fifteen \n     hundred acres of cypress swamps and forest; and\n       Whereas, although the channel was authorized for only six \n     hundred fifty feet across and thirty-six feet deep, today the \n     channel is more than twenty-two hundred feet across, and the \n     United States Army Corps of Engineers has routinely dredged \n     the channel to over forty feet deep to accommodate bigger \n     ships than were authorized by the United States Congress at \n     an average cost of more than twenty-two million dollars; and\n       Whereas, the loss of marsh and land has put the surrounding \n     area at much greater risk for more frequent and more drastic \n     tidal surges and more prolonged flooding as a result of \n     tropical storms and hurricanes, with the severity getting \n     worse as there is greater and greater loss; and\n       Whereas, the loss of marsh habitat has altered the \n     ecosystem throughout the basin resulting in the loss of \n     habitat for more than six hundred fifty thousand fur-bearing \n     animals and similar losses to waterfowl, a movement from a \n     dominant white shrimp fishery toward a dominant brown shrimp \n     fishery, and the movement of oyster production farther and \n     farther inland with the movement inland of the saltwater \n     line, all of which alters the economic foundation for the \n     region; and\n       Whereas, in addition to the alterations caused in the \n     fishery and wildlife dependent enterprises, there are impacts \n     on the everyday lives of the people who live in the area--\n     impacts which are being felt by a significantly larger \n     population that must live with the threat of storm-driven \n     flood surge, which will cause death and destroy personal \n     property, both land and homes, and their communities through \n     the loss of schools, libraries, public facilities including \n     water purification plants and sewerage treatment plants; and\n       Whereas, also in danger of destruction due to the loss of \n     land caused by the MRGO are major oil refineries and miles of \n     pipelines, a sugar refinery, gas condensate recovery plants, \n     and manufacturing plants which together can be valued in \n     excess of three hundred billion dollars with a work force of \n     nearly fifty thousand people at a time when the state is \n     desperately seeking economic development opportunities; and\n       Whereas, as long ago as the 1960s it was becoming apparent \n     that the anticipated economic benefits were not likely to \n     materialize, and St. Bernard Parish officials began to call \n     attention to the environmental impacts and damages to the \n     point where by the 1980s the MRGO began to be termed an \n     ``environmental nightmare''; and\n       Whereas, in 1993 the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation \n     first called for the closure of the MRGO because of its \n     environmental impact throughout the Pontchartrain Basin, and \n     this was followed in 1998 by the ``Coast 2050 Plan'', adopted \n     by the Department of Natural Resources, including its \n     recommendation for closure of the MRGO; and\n       Whereas, in 1999, a MRGO task force convened by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency at the request of Congressman \n     Tauzin also recommended closure of the channel; and\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has authorized \n     the construction of a new lock on the Inner Harbor Navigation \n     Canal which will serve to provide access to ocean going \n     vessels which are now using the MRGO; and\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has failed to \n     provide full funding capability for the lock project and \n     thereby delayed its completion: Therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of Louisiana, That the United \n     States Congress and the Louisiana Congressional Delegation \n     are hereby memorialized to authorize the full funding \n     capability of the United States Army Corps of Engineers for \n     the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal lock project; be it further\n       Resolved by the Legislature of Louisiana, That the time for \n     study and recommendation has passed and that the United \n     States Congress, the Louisiana Congressional Delegation, and \n     the United States Army Corps of\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\n     Engineers are hereby memorialized to promptly close the \n     Mississippi River Gulf Outlet in the manner contemplated by \n     the Coast 2050 Plan; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to \n     the United States Congress, the Louisiana Congressional \n     Delegation, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-490. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to a \n     hurricane evacuation route in Louisiana Mississippi; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 20\n\n       Whereas, every hurricane season raises the prospect and \n     threat of a hurricane hitting southeastern Louisiana from \n     such a direction as to wreak enormous flooding, loss of life, \n     and other devastation; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's hurricane evacuation routes are \n     growing increasingly vulnerable to coastal storm surge and \n     flooding, and measures need to be taken as soon as possible \n     to ensure the safe navigation of the residents inland; and\n       Whereas, due to the large population in the southern part \n     of Louisiana and vulnerability to the destruction of property \n     and businesses due to hurricanes and tropical storms, the \n     development of a hurricane evacuation route is necessary for \n     the protection and safe evacuation of the residents of south \n     Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the proposed evacuation route would offer a four-\n     lane route from New Orleans, Louisiana along Highway 25 to \n     the Mississippi state line, and continue along Mississippi \n     Highway 27 to Crystal Springs, Mississippi to intersect with \n     Interstate 55; and\n       Whereas, additionally, the proposed evacuation route should \n     include a four-lane route from Paris Road, which is also \n     known as Louisiana Highway 47, and connect in New Orleans \n     into the proposed four-lane evacuation route from New \n     Orleans, Louisiana to the Mississippi state line; and\n       Whereas, since Highway 25 and Highway 47 are already \n     designated as evacuation routes, each of the proposed four-\n     lanes would become a critical element to move thousands of \n     people from New Orleans and the North Shore to safe areas \n     northward: therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to appropriate and expedite \n     funding for the development of a hurricane evacuation route \n     in Louisiana and Mississippi; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-491. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to ownership of \n     mineral rights and surface rights on state and federal lands \n     in Michigan; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 171\n\n       Whereas, State-owned land in Michigan amounts to \n     approximately 12 percent of the acreage, and the federal \n     government manages another 8 percent of Michigan's surface \n     area. This large percentage of state and federal land \n     ownership is especially significant in the situations in \n     which ownership of mineral rights is not consistent with the \n     ownership of the surface rights; and\n       Whereas, the degree to which the rights to minerals do not \n     align with rights to the surface of the land is cause for \n     considerable litigation and frustration in Michigan. This \n     frustration is felt by citizen groups, energy companies, \n     local units of government, and all consumers of gas and oil; \n     and\n       Whereas, the state of Michigan has jurisdiction over both \n     mineral and surface rights on 3.8 million acres of land and \n     mineral rights alone on another 2.1 million acres. Maps \n     showing ownership of property in Michigan reflect a crazy \n     quilt of ownership. The common situation of surface land \n     ownership differing from ownership of the mineral rights \n     below presents many problems to our state. This nonalignment \n     of ownership makes it difficult to protect land from \n     development and difficult to develop to extract the energy \n     that our society needs. Instead, expensive and minimally \n     productive litigation can be the result; and\n       Whereas, it would be far more productive for the state and \n     federal governments to work together to do all possible to \n     minimize conflicts in ownership between surface rights and \n     mineral rights: now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States, the Department of Interior, the Bureau of \n     Land Management, the National Forest Service, and the \n     Department of Energy to work with Michigan officials to \n     exchange property to align the ownership of mineral rights \n     and surface rights on state and federal lands in Michigan and \n     to express our intent to take actions to achieve this goal; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, the Bureau of Land \n     Management, the Department of Interior, the National Forest \n     Service, and the Department of Energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8548-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Ms. COLLINS for the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n       *Neil McPhie, of Virginia, to be Chairman of the Merit \n     Systems Protection Board.\n       *Barbara J.

A bill to provide incentives for the sharing of homeland \nsecurity information, promote the development of an information sharing \nnetwork, provide grants and other support to achieve communications \ninteroperability, and establish an Office of Information Sharing, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today with Senator Collins to \nintroduce legislation that would promote the sharing of homeland \nsecurity information across all levels of our Government, and to \nprovide funding and support necessary to enable our first responders to \ncommunicate better with one another than they are able to do now during \na terrorist attack.\n  I am delighted that the chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Collins, is my lead cosponsor on this legislation, \nand that another member of the committee, Senator Akaka, is a \ncosponsor, as is Senator Clinton.\n  One of the most painful and enduring lessons we should have learned \nfrom the September 11 attacks is that information about terrorist \nactivities must be shared among Federal and other agencies to protect \nthe American people's security. Unfortunately, almost 3 years after the \nattacks we have still not seen the kind of improvement and information \nsharing at all levels we need to have.\n  The widely respected, nonpartisan Markle Foundation, in alliance with \nthe Brookings Institution and the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies, has looked at this problem at length and \nconcluded that an entirely new approach is needed to the sharing of \nsecurity information.\n  According to the Markle Foundation, the cold war paradigm that \nstrictly limited access to information is simply ill-suited to the \nchallenges we face today in an age of terrorism. Sharing information \namong relevant law enforcement agencies and other public agencies is \nvital to protecting our people's security precisely because we cannot \npredict from which direction the first signs of potential attack will \ncome as we pretty much could during\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\nthe cold war. Yet the Federal Government has still developed neither a \ncomprehensive strategy nor actual policies to change the 50-year-old \ncold war paradigm. We have to catch up quickly to win the war on \nterrorism.\n  Equally troubling is that too many first responders still lack, \nbelieve it or not, the basic ability to talk to one another when \nresponding to emergencies, including, of course, a terrorist attack, \nbecause their equipment does not communicate directly. We use a \ncomplicated term called ``interoperability'' to describe this \nsituation.\n  One of the most painful parts of the September 11 attacks in New York \nwas the loss of more than 300 New York City firefighters and other law \nenforcement personnel who perished inside the collapsing Twin Towers of \nthe World Trade Center. The look-backs at that day, probably including \nthe one we will hear tomorrow from the September 11 Commission, lead a \nlot of people to conclude that we lost a lot of New York's finest--\nfirefighters, police officers, other public servants--because they \ncould not communicate with one another on the equipment they had. That \nis no longer acceptable.\n  The legislation we are introducing today addresses those challenges. \nFirst, we authorize $3.3 billion over 5 years to provide reliable and \nconsistent funding to help law enforcement agencies around the country \nfind solutions to this so-called interoperability problem. We create an \nOffice of Information Sharing within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to develop and implement a national strategy to achieve that \ngoal. It simply is outrageous that those who are in uniform every day \nto protect our security cannot communicate with one another in a time \nof emergency because we have not given them good enough equipment to do \nthat.\n  Second, our legislation would require the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, in conjunction with the intelligence community and other \nFederal agencies, to establish a broad information exchange network \nmodeled after the Markle Foundation recommendations which would break \nout of the cold war paradigm and allow full sharing of security \ninformation.\n  Third, our legislation requires implementation of performance \nmeasures and genuine incentives to encourage employees to implement the \nchanges that are necessary.\n  As part of the continuing fight to keep America safe from terrorism, \nthe test of our generation, all the cultural, technological, and \nadministrative barriers that impede the flow of critically important \nhomeland security information among different levels of Government and \namong agencies at the same level simply must be broken down. That \nrequires an act of will and leadership, and then it requires funding. \nIt is not going to come cheaply, but security of the American people \nnever does come cheaply. We have the best military in the history of \nthe world because we have invested in it. We are only going to have the \nbest security at home from terrorism if we invest with similar \ngenerosity.\n  A nonpartisan task force of the Council on Foreign Relations \nrecommended that the Nation spend double what Senator Collins and I are \nproposing in this bill to ensure dependable interoperable \ncommunications. What we are asking seems like a lot of money, but it is \nhalf of what an independent group thinks is necessary to protect our \nNation. This legislation will help us develop a new structure, a new \nparadigm of information sharing to guarantee that first responders and \npreventers can communicate effectively with one another and with other \ngovernmental agencies when they respond to terrorist attacks or any \nother emergencies that threaten the safety or well-being of people \nthroughout our country.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that text of the legislation \nSenator Collins and I are introducing today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2701\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security \n     Interagency and Interjurisdictional Information Sharing Act \n     of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The effective use of information is essential to the \n     Nation's efforts to protect the homeland. Information that \n     may prove important to those efforts, however, is often \n     widely dispersed and may be uncovered or held by any of a \n     number of Federal agencies, by 50 States or by the Nation's \n     650,000 local law enforcement officers who form the front \n     lines of the war against terrorism, among others. Finding \n     ways to share this information in an efficient and timely \n     manner with those who need it is central to both preventing \n     and responding to potential terrorist attacks on our Nation.\n       (2) Current approaches to information sharing are woefully \n     inadequate and largely ad hoc. State and local officials \n     frequently report that they do not receive adequate homeland \n     security information from Federal officials, nor is there a \n     consistent, easy way for State and local officials to \n     effectively provide homeland security information in their \n     possession to Federal officials. Federal agencies have often \n     not shared information even with other Federal agencies, and \n     State and local governments have few formalized means to \n     share information with other States and localities.\n       (3) There are a number of barriers, both structural and \n     cultural, to the more effective sharing of homeland security \n     information including--\n       (A) a lingering cold war paradigm that emphasizes \n     information security and maintaining strict limits on access \n     to information;\n       (B) mistrust among historically rival agencies and between \n     Federal and State officials; and\n       (C) few incentives to reward Government employees who share \n     information outside their agencies.\n       (4) A further barrier to information sharing among police, \n     firefighters and others who may be called on to respond to \n     terrorist attacks and other large-scale emergencies is the \n     lack of interoperable communications systems, which can \n     enable public safety agencies to communicate and share \n     important, sometimes critical, information in an emergency.\n       (5) A new approach to the sharing of homeland security \n     information (a new ``information architecture'') is urgently \n     needed to overcome these barriers and to meet the homeland \n     security needs of the Nation. One useful model for such a \n     network is the Systemwide Homeland Analysis and Resource \n     Exchange Network (SHARE) proposed by the Markle Foundation in \n     reports issued in October 2002 and December 2003. Like the \n     envisioned SHARE Network, a new approach, to be successful, \n     must be comprehensive, encompassing the many participants, at \n     many levels of government, who strive to protect the \n     homeland, and the system should be largely decentralized, \n     permitting participants throughout the system to exchange \n     information directly in a timely and effective matter without \n     having to go through a central hub.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, I am very pleased to join my good \nfriend, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, in introducing \nlegislation that will strengthen our capabilities to prevent and \nrespond to acts of terrorism. The bill we are introducing will improve \ncommunications among the various levels of Government and will assist \nour State and local first responders in upgrading their communications \nequipment. I thank Senator Lieberman and his staff for their efforts in \nputting together this very important legislation and for working with \nme to make this bill a bipartisan effort.\n  In the immediate aftermath of September 11, the phrase ``connect the \ndots'' gained a prominent place in our national lexicon. The agencies \ncharged with intelligence gathering, analysis, and enforcement did not \nhave structures in place that would have enabled them to effectively \nshare information and coordinate responses. The dots were there, but \nour intelligence and law enforcement personnel were, in far too many \ncases, unable to connect them.\n  The heroism of our first responders on September 11 will never be \nforgotten. Their devotion to duty, their courage, and their training \nsaved a great many lives that terrible day. Yet we now know that the \nlack of a unified command structure, the uneven and in some cases \noutright absence of interdepartmental coordination and incompatible \ncommunications equipment may have prevented them from saving even more \nlives, and it cost many first responders their own lives.\n  Throughout the Nation on that day, there was another problem. False \nreports of car bombings and other terrorist acts spread quickly, \noverwhelming the immediate efforts and response, preventing a full \ncomprehension of what had actually occurred, and causing needless fear. \nOur frontline civilian and military agencies struggled to improvise a \ndefense against an attack of unknown nature and scope. As the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the 9/11 Commission:\n\n       We fought many phantoms that day.\n\n  The enemy we are fighting is no phantom. It is real, and it is \ndeadly. From the agencies of the Federal Government down to the State \nand local levels, we have dedicated personnel who can defeat that \nenemy. We must enable them to work together more effectively in this \ngreat cause. We cannot expect them to connect the dots if so many dots \nare hidden from view.\n  Although the Department of Homeland Security has made remarkable \nprogress in forging cohesive strategies, State and local officials \nstill tell Senator Lieberman and they still tell me that they have \ndifficulty in obtaining needed information from Federal agencies and \nthat they lack a reliable way to convey their own information to \nFederal officials.\n  Turf battles, unfortunately, are still being fought among some \nagencies. There still is no effective system in place for State and \nlocal governments to share information with one another.\n  From computer systems to emergency radios, the technology that should \nallow these different levels of government to communicate with each \nother too often is silenced by incompatibility. Clearly, the barrier to \na truly unified effort against terrorism is a matter of both culture \nand equipment. This legislation will help break down that barrier.\n  A General Accounting Office report on interoperable communications \nreleased last week notes that the lives of first responders and those \nthey are trying to assist can be lost when first responders cannot \ncommunicate effectively. That is the crux of the matter that the \nLieberman-Collins bill seeks to address. A substantial barrier to \neffective communications, according to the GAO, is the use of \nincompatible wireless equipment by many agencies and levels of \ngovernment when they are responding to a major emergency.\n  Among the GAO recommendations are that Federal grants be used to \nencourage States to develop and implement plans to improve \ninteroperable communications and that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity needs to establish a long-term program to coordinate these \nsame communications upgrades throughout the Federal Government. Our \nlegislation would do much to implement these sensible recommendations.\n  It is vitally important that we assist the States in getting the \nright communications technology into the hands of their first \nresponders. That would be accomplished by the interoperability grant \nprogram in this legislation. I believe that grant program is the most \nimportant feature of our legislation.\n  At a homeland security conference held in my home State of Maine in \nMay, one of the most persistent messages that I heard from Maine's \nfirst responders concerned the lack of compatibility in communications \nequipment. It remains a substantial impediment to their ability to \nrespond effectively in the event of a terrorist attack. For a State \nlike mine that has three deepwater cargo ports, two international \nairports, key defense installations, hundreds of miles of coastline, \nand a long international border, compatible communications equipment is \nessential. Yet it remains an illusive goal.\n  Maine's firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical \npersonnel do an amazing job in providing aid when a neighboring town is \nin need. Fires, floods, and accidents are local matters in which they \nhave great expertise and experience. Their defense of the front lines \nin the war against terrorism, however, is a national matter. Maine's \nfirst responders, along with first responders across the country, are \ndoing their part, but they need and deserve Federal help.\n  The grant program established by our bill would guarantee every State \na share of interoperability funding and makes additional funding \navailable for States with special needs and vulnerabilities. It is \ndesigned to get this vital funding to first responders quickly, in \ncoordination with a statewide plan.\n  At that Maine conference, I was joined by Under Secretary Asa \nHutchinson. He, perhaps, best described the mutual responsibilities of \nthis Federal-State partnership when he said:\n\n       We cannot secure the homeland of America from Washington, \n     D.C.\n\n  In other words, we have to rely on State and local officials and on \nour first responders.\n  There is no question, however, that the security of the homeland \nrequires\n\n[[Page S8555]]\n\nthe involvement, leadership, and expertise of Washington, DC, and, yes, \nit also requires our financial commitment.\n  As Senator Lieberman mentioned, a recent study by the Council on \nForeign Relations estimates the total cost of nationwide communications \ncompatibility at $6.8 billion. Our legislation authorizes $3.3 billion \nover 5 years. That is a reasonable and necessary contribution by the \nFederal Government to this important partnership.\n  The legislation will also help to foster a culture of information \nsharing through all levels of government and across all boundaries.\n  It directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a homeland \nsecurity information-sharing network that will expedite the gathering, \nanalysis, and distribution of information that is relevant to \npreventing or responding to terrorism anywhere in the Nation. The \ncouncil established by this legislation will bring together \nrepresentatives from all the relevant Federal agencies, and from State \nand local governments as well, to develop, monitor, and update \nprocedures to enhance information sharing.\n  This bill would make an important contribution to the security of our \nNation and the safety of our people. It would help us clear the \nbarriers that now prevent agencies at all levels of government from \ncooperating and communicating to the fullest extent, whether those \nbarriers are due to a lack of coordination or whether they are due to \ntechnology and incompatible equipment.\n  At the risk of piling one cliche on top of another, it is apparent to \nme that in order to connect the dots, we must think outside the box. \nOur enemy is cunning and remorseless. We must be clever and \nresourceful. This legislation is designed to foster innovative thinking \nby rewarding it, through a program that provides cash awards or other \nforms of recognition to agency employees who solve a homeland security \nproblem. We already use pay-for-performance awards to recognize Federal \nemployees who devise ways to deliver Government services more \neffectively and efficiently. We certainly can do the same for employees \nwho think up ways to make our country safer.\n  The new Office of Information Sharing this legislation would \nestablish in the Department of Homeland Security will continue the \nsubstantial progress being made by addressing specific issues related \nto improving cooperation among the various levels of government. A key \nelement of improved cooperation will be getting technology, computer \nsystems and communications equipment in particular, to work across the \nfrontiers of government agencies.\n  The security of our Nation and the safety of our people require that \nwe clear the barriers that prevent agencies at all levels of government \nfrom cooperating and communicating to the fullest extent. There is an \nadditional reason why this is important.\n  Effective information-sharing is the best way in which we can protect \nourselves from harm as we protect the civil liberties we cherish. We \nneed borders that are closed to our enemies, but that remain open to \nour friends. We need to be able to travel safely, but also freely. We \nneed to be able to protect ourselves against threats from abroad, but \nwe also need to engage in open and vigorous trade. The greatest threats \nto these freedoms are the fear, suspicion and doubt that come from not \nknowing as much as we can about the enemy and from having the best, \nmost coordinated defense possible.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to \nbuild a better and stronger homeland security partnership.\n  I hope the legislation that Senator Lieberman and I have introduced \nwill enjoy widespread support.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues Senators \nLieberman and Collins in introducing the Homeland Security Interagency \nand Interjurisdictional Information Sharing Act of 2004, a piece of \nlegislation critical to improving the communication capabilities of \nfirst responders and among all levels of government.\n  One of the most important lessons our Nation learned on September 11 \nis that information sharing, both between agencies and levels of \ngovernment and between emergency first responders, is critical to the \nprevention of and response to a terrorist attack on our homeland. There \nhas been much talk about breaking down stove pipes and fully equipping \nour heroic first responders in the past 3 years, but this bill points \nout those goals have not yet been met.\n  The world watched as firefighters perished in the World Trade Center \nbecause their radios could not function inside the buildings and they \ndid not have updated information about the imminent collapse of the \ntowers. Ten months later it was reported that officers responding to a \nshooting at Los Angeles International Airport missed crucial \ninformation because they were not using the same radio frequency.\n\n  Yet almost all cities and counties in the United States still lack an \ninteroperable communications system today and many still lack the \ninfrastructure to provide 100 percent coverage for the radio systems \nthey do have. In my home State of Hawaii, first responders are unable \nto communicate through radios in 25 percent of the island of Hawaii \nbecause of a combination of lack of infrastructure and diverse \ngeography.\n  This problem can be solved, but it will require a commitment of not \nonly funding but planning, communication and cooperation. The current \nSAFECOM initiative, which is supposed to address the interoperability \nproblem, has failed in most, if not all, of these areas. While this \nissue clearly cannot be solved by one agency alone, the cross-\ngovernment nature of SAFECOM crippled the program from the start. \nSAFECOM is supposed to be funded by multiple agencies meaning that if \none agency is not in agreement with the others it can withhold funding \nand slow or stop activities. This formula has proven ineffective.\n  The Homeland Security Interagency and Interjurisdictional Information \nSharing Act will address these issues. The bill creates an Office of \nInformation Sharing within the Department of Homeland Security to \ndevelop and implement a national strategy and provide the leadership, \noutreach, and technical assistance necessary to achieve \ninteroperability. The new office would receive a direct line of funding \nfor its operations as well as to provide grants to States and \nlocalities to develop interoperable networks.\n  The bill would also require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \ndevelop a Homeland Security Information Sharing Network. The problem of \ninformational stove piping will not be eradicated with ad hoc measures \nas is the practice today. The administration must institutionalize a \nsystem of sharing critical homeland security information among all \nlevels of government. We are no longer in a ``need to know'' world. We \nmust switch to a ``need to share'' mentality.\n  Three years is too long for the lessons of September 11 to not be \nimplemented. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation and I thank Senators Lieberman and Collins for their work \non this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Allen, and Mr. \n        Lott):\n  S. 2702. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nrepeal the requirement that persons making disbursements for \nelectioneering communications file reports on such disbursements with \nthe Federal Election Commission and the prohibition against the making \nof disbursements for electioneering communications by corporations and \nlabor organizations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the First \nAmendment Restoration Act of 2004, a companion bill to H.R. 3801, which \nwas introduced earlier this year in the House by my former colleague, \nCongressman Roscoe Bartlett. In the last few years, we've seen some \nremarkable restrictions placed on the ability of organizations to \nexercise their first amendment rights with respect to campaign \ncontributions. One particular example is the Bipartisan Campaign Reform \nAct of 2002, or BCRA, which contains some provisions that have always \ntroubled me. Although in McConnell v. FEC, the Supreme Court upheld \nBCRA's restrictions as constitutional, this is not the first time that \nI've disagreed with the Court's conclusions on\n\n[[Page S8556]]\n\nwhat kind of conduct I think is or is not constitutionally protected.\n  Specifically, I am concerned with the provisions of BCRA that limit \nthe ways in which some organizations can contribute funds within \ncertain time frames before an election. Under BCRA, labor unions and \ncorporations, which include trade associations and interest groups as \ndiverse as the ACLU and the NRA, are limited to only contributing PAC \nfunds within 30 days of a primary and 60 days of a general election. \nThese limitations apply to contributions for what are know as \n``electioneering communications,'' which are any broadcast, cable, or \nsatellite communications that refer to a clearly identified Federal \ncandidate and that reach 50,000 or more people in the relevant district \nor State.\n  I believe that Congress can go beyond what the Supreme Court's \ndecision in McConnell v. FEC envisions as what is constitutionally \nprotected speech and that Congress should provide further first \namendment protections for organizations wanting to make political \ncontributions. This is why today I am introducing the First Amendment \nRestoration Act. This bill would repeal those provisions of BCRA that \nlimit corporations and labor unions from making any other contributions \nthan those run through political action committees within the 30- and \n60-day periods set out in the act. I am proud to say that Senators Jim \nInhofe, George Allen, and Trent Lott have agreed to cosponsor this \nbill. I look forward to the debate on the First Amendment Restoration \nAct and on issues of campaign-finance reform in general, as we see how \nthe restrictions we place on speech really play out in the real world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. DeWINE):\n  S. 2705. A bill to provide assistance to Sudan, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2705\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Peace for \n     Sudan Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of Sudan has engaged in an orchestrated \n     campaign of genocide in Darfur, Sudan, and has severely \n     restricted humanitarian and human rights workers' access to \n     Darfur in an attempt to inflict further harm on the Fur, \n     Masalit, and Zaghawa people of Darfur and to prevent the \n     collection of evidence of war crimes and crimes against \n     humanity.\n       (2) As a result of this campaign, as many as 30,000 people \n     have been killed, more than 1,000,000 people have been \n     displaced within Sudan, and approximately 200,000 have been \n     made refugees in Chad.\n       (3) As many as 320,000 people may die unless humanitarian \n     aid is immediately delivered to the affected individuals.\n       (4) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n     issued a report which ``identified . . . massive human rights \n     violations in Darfur perpetrated by the Government of Sudan \n     and its proxy militia, which may constitute war crimes and/or \n     crimes against humanity''.\n       (5) The Government of Chad, under President Idriss Deby, \n     has served an important role in facilitating a renewable \n     ``humanitarian cease-fire'' between the Government of Sudan \n     and the two rebel groups challenging that Government in \n     Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan \n     Liberation Movement, and has been a crucial partner in \n     permitting humanitarian assistance to reach refugees who have \n     crossed from Darfur to Chad in the tens of thousands.\n       (6) The cooperation and mediation of the SPLM is critical \n     to bringing about a political settlement between the \n     Government, the Sudanese Liberation Army, and the Justice and \n     Equality Movement.\n       (7) Practical implementation of a comprehensive peace \n     agreement between the SPLM and the Government of Sudan is \n     impossible without the implementation of a peace agreement \n     for Darfur.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) SPLM.--The term ``SPLM'' means the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement.\n\n      SEC. 4.

A bill to establish kinship navigator programs, to establish \nkinship guardianship assistance payments for children, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be introducing \nlegislation that expands the supports and services available to \ngrandparents and other relatives who are raising children when their \nbiological parents can no longer take care of them. I am happy to have \nworked with my friend and colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe, in crafting \nthis important bill.\n  Today there is a phenomenon that is quietly changing the face of the \nAmerican family and creating new challenges for our Nation's child \nwelfare system--the growth of kinship care. According to the Census, \nmore than 6 million children--1 in 12--live in households headed by \ngrandparents or other relatives.\n  New York alone has over 409,000 children living in these households. \nThe majority of these children--54 percent--live with their \ngrandparents, while the rest live with aunts, uncles, siblings, and \ncousins. Sadly, one-fifth of families headed by grandparents are living \nin poverty.\n  While extended families have always stepped in to raise children when \nparents could not, over the past two decades we've seen a rise in the \nnumber of children living with grandparents and other relatives. A \nstudy conducted by the American Association of Retired Persons found \nthat the number of children living in grandparent-headed households \nincreased by 30 percent between 1990 and 2000.\n  Parents are unable to raise their own children for many different \nreasons, and we still have a lot to learn about this trend, but a few \nstatistics are illuminating: Mothers are the fastest growing segment of \nthe U.S. prison population. Approximately 7 in 10 women in correctional \nfacilities have children under age 17. The number of women living with \nHIV/AIDS increased from 4,000 in the early 80s to close to 60,000 in \n2000.\n  Many of these women are unable to raise their children and often rely \non their relatives to fill in. Many other parents die or contract \ndebilitating diseases that also make it impossible for them to fulfill \ntheir parental obligations.\n  Grandparents and other relatives have stepped forward, often at great \npersonal sacrifice, to provide safe and loving homes for the children \nin their care. This has allowed tens of thousands of children to live \nwith extended family rather than strangers.\n  Extended families can provide a sense of belonging and a connection \nwith their family history. Children are traumatized when they are \nseparated from their natural parents--being cared for by grandparents \nor other relatives can soften that blow.\n  But kinship families, especially those without formal legal custody \nof the children under their care, face a number of unnecessary \nbarriers. Let me give you an example. Maria Lemmons, of Albany, lost \nher daughter, a single mother of 3, in a tragic car crash when Maria \nwas 67. Maria immediately stepped in to take custody of her \ngrandchildren, aged 11, 13, and 15. But as you can imagine, she \nstruggled. Maria was financially secure, but she hadn't raised a \nteenager in over 20 years. She needed guidance about parenting and a \nsupport group to help her navigate the tough terrain of parenting.\n  At the other extreme is Susan Smith. Susan's daughter Cathy almost \nlost custody of her son, Jacob, when she became addicted to heroin and \nneglected him for days at a time. Susan intervened to take care of \nJacob even though doing so required a significant financial sacrifice. \nSusan lives on a Social Security check of less than $300 a month. She \ncan barely afford her groceries and her medicine. But she was not \nwilling to let Jacob be raised by a stranger.\n  At the very least, both of these women need and deserve our \ncompassion. But I believe they also deserve our support as they assume \nthe awesome responsibility of raising children. The Kinship Caregiver \nSupport Act will help women like Maria and Susan in three important \nways.\n  First, it will establish a ``kinship navigator'' program. This \nprogram will provide funds to social service agencies to establish \ntoll-free hotlines, websites, and resource guides on the local and \nState parenting support available to kinship families. These hotlines \nand websites will give grandparents critical information about \nenrolling children in school, obtaining SCHIP, Medicaid and other \nhealth insurance, safeguarding their homes for small children, applying \nfor housing assistance, obtaining legal services, finding childcare, \nand identifying parental support groups so that women like Maria have \nsomeone to talk to about their experiences.\n  The kinship navigator program will promote partnerships between \ngovernment agencies, not-for-profit and faith-based organizations to \nhelp them better serve the needs of kinship care families.\n  The second part of this legislation will make it possible for kinship \nfamilies who serve as permanent legal guardians to receive the same \npayments that foster families would receive. This is extremely \nimportant because many grandparents want to raise their grandchildren \nbut, like Susan, simply cannot afford to do so.\n  States will have the option to use their title IV-E funds to provide \npayments to grandparents and other relatives who have assumed legal \nguardianship of the children they've cared for as foster parents. \nFamilies would be eligible if the child has been under the care of the \nState agency for at least 12 months and was eligible for foster care \nmaintenance payments.\n\n[[Page S8558]]\n\n  There are a few States, such as Illinois and Maryland, that have \nalready implemented subsidized guardianship waivers through the Health \nand Human Services demonstration project. These States have shown that \nsubsidized guardianship is a cost-neutral and effective way to keep \nfamilies together. My legislation will make it possible for all States \nto follow in their path. It values families that care for each other.\n  The final part of this legislation will require States to notify \ngrandparents when children enter the foster care system. Unfortunately, \ngrandparents and other relatives often do not know when their \ngrandchildren or nieces and nephews come under the care of the State. \nBy notifying grandparents and other relatives when children enter the \nfoster care system, we can make it a lot easier for families to stay \ntogether.\n  I also want to note that in May of this year, the Pew Commission on \nChildren in Foster Care recommended that children who live with a \npermanent legal guardian should receive federal guardianship \nassistance. This commission is widely considered to be one of the most \ncomprehensive investigation of child welfare financing policy in \ndecades and is chaired by a bipartisan group of child welfare experts, \nincluding legislators, state administrators, family service providers, \njudges, foster and adoptive parents, and former foster youth. It is \nencouraging that their recommendations are in line with the legislation \nI am introducing today.\n  I am very pleased with this legislation; it shows that we are moving \nin the right direction toward helping the thousands of children and the \nrelatives that care for them in this country. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to pass this bill in the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 2708. A bill to develop the National Strategy for Homeland \nSecurity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto forge a comprehensive and effective strategy for our homeland \nsecurity.\n  Before 9/11, we did not truly perceive the threat of terrorism on our \nown soil, and what homeland security efforts we did have underway were \nbadly divided. Dozens of agencies responsible for pieces of our \nhomeland security were scattered across the Federal Government, and \nwere largely unconnected to state and local officials and first \nresponders on the front lines in our Nation's cities and towns. There \nwere confusing overlaps and, more critically, treacherous gaps. And \nbecause everyone was responsible for parts of the effort, no one was \nultimately in charge.\n  We took one large step to remedy these weaknesses by creating the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. The Department brings more than two \ndozen of the Federal Government's critical homeland security agencies \nand programs under one roof, allowing for unprecedented coordination \nand cooperation. It also created a Cabinet Secretary charged with \nmanaging the budgets and personnel of these agencies, and capable of \nproviding a focal point for homeland programs and issues in the Cabinet \nand beyond.\n  But we knew that in addition to creating a better organization, we \nwould need to lay out a clear roadmap to galvanize our homeland \ndefenses--at all levels of government and the private sector. That is \nwhat many of us called for and, regretfully, it is something this \nNation still sorely lacks.\n  The Administration did produce a ``National Strategy for Homeland \nSecurity'' in July 2002 that correctly identified many of the \nchallenges we face in preparing to meet the threat of terrorism. But \nthat document predates the creation of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and is already out of date. More significantly, it failed to \nset priorities, clear deadlines and accountability for the vast array \nof homeland security tasks we face.\n  As the highly regarded Gilmore Commission on terrorism noted in its \nfinal report last December: ``Much is still required in order to \nachieve an effective, comprehensive, unified national strategy and to \ntranslate vision into action. Notably absent is a clear prioritization \nfor the use of scarce resources against a diffuse, unclear threat as \npart of the spectrum of threats--some significantly more common than \nterrorism. The panel has serious concern about the current state of \nhomeland security efforts along the full spectrum from awareness to \nrecovery, worried that efforts by the government may provide the \nperception of enhanced security that causes the Nation to become \ncomplacent about the many critical actions still required.''\n  While it is true that the Department of Homeland Security is \nproceeding with some more targeted strategies regarding specific areas \nof concern, these cannot replace a comprehensive strategy that sets the \nultimate policies and priorities for our homeland effort.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation requiring a new homeland \nsecurity strategy that can provide the strong, precise national \nguidance we need on this critical issue.\n  In a February 3, 2004 report, the General Accounting Office surveyed \nseven existing Federal strategies related to terrorism--including the \nNational Strategy for Homeland Security--and laid out guiding \nprinciples to improve these strategies. My legislation incorporates \nthese principles, which stress accountability and prioritization as \nrequirements for a new homeland security strategy. The new strategy \nmust include a hierarchy of strategic goals and indicate the specific \nactivities needed to achieve those goals, as well as the likely costs, \nand how such funds should be generated. In other words, the strategy \nmust make real choices about priorities and resources. The current \nstrategy identifies many goals, but rarely provides deadlines for \naction, standards or performance measures to assess progress, or \ndetails on the resources required for stated initiatives.\n  The strategy must clearly spell out organizational roles and \nresponsibilities, including the proper roles of State, local, private \nand international actors and the coordinating mechanisms to bring these \nactors together. Almost three years after 9/11, we still too often must \nask ``who is in charge?'' of key pieces of our homeland security \nagenda. And, critically, the homeland security strategy must address \nhow it relates to other Federal strategies regarding terrorist threats, \nand how the strategies will be integrated.\n  The legislation also highlights certain substantive areas that should \nbe addressed, such as a thoroughgoing strategy to maximize information \nsharing related to homeland security throughout the Federal Government \nand with state and local officials and, where appropriate, the private \nsector. The strategy must look at preparing the public health sector to \ndetect and respond to terrorist attacks, at integrating military \ncapabilities into our homeland security planning, at building all-\nhazards preparedness throughout all levels of government and the \nprivate sector, and securing our critical infrastructure, much of which \nis in private hands.\n  The bill would require that the strategy be written every four years, \nwith updates every two years and annual progress reports to be \nsubmitted in conjunction with the President's annual budget request. \nRecognizing that many Federal agencies outside the Department of \nHomeland Security play a critical part in homeland security, it calls \non the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security to help the \nSecretary construct the strategy.\n  Importantly, it would create an independent panel of experts to \nreview the strategy and offer alternative proposals as appropriate--a \nso-called ``Team B'' to provide decision makers with alternative \nperspectives and solutions for consideration. This nonpartisan panel, \nto be called the Homeland Security Commission, would consist of nine \nmembers appointed by the Secretary in consultation with Congress. The \nmembers would be recognized experts in the field of homeland security \nand cannot be current officers or employees of the Federal Government. \nThis Commission is modeled on the successful National Defense Panel, \nwhich helped guide strategic planning for our military forces. This \nCommission can help ensure that we marshal all the best ideas to defend \nour homeland and do not fall into complacent, or narrow ways of \nthinking about the threats we face. We know that terrorists are always \nadapting their strategies and techniques. We must do no less.\n\n[[Page S8559]]\n\n  We meet today amid ongoing, and indeed heightened, threats of \nterrorist attacks on our homeland. We need not be intimidated, but we \nmust be prepared. A new and more forceful national strategy will help \nenergize and organize our resources--at all levels of government and \nwithin the private sector--to meet this threat. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation to give us such a strategy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2708\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a National Windstorm Impact Reduction \nProgram; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a \nbill I introduced today to set up a national program to reduce the loss \nof life and property due to windstorms.\n  This bill recently passed the House of Representatives and it will be \naddressed and hopefully passed during the Senate Commerce Committee \nmarkup tomorrow.\n  We all know the catastrophic damage that windstorms can cause. In \nfact, the highest level of material damage and loss of life in this \ncountry has been attributed to hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes \nand thunderstorms.\n  My State of Florida, as a coastal State, has been especially \naffected.\n  In 1992, Hurricane Andrew caused losses in excess of $26.5 billion.\n  And annually the average financial loss due to tornadoes, \nthunderstorms and hurricanes is $6.3 billion. So increasing our \nunderstanding of windstorms, assessing the performance of our \nbuildings, structures and infrastructures during windstorms, reducing \nthe impact of wind hazards through retrofitting buildings and changing \nconstruction practices and transferring this knowledge to the pubic and \nbuilding professionals is desperately needed.\n  And this bill accomplishes all of those things.\n  It is a coordinated plan to reduce material losses and human \nsuffering.\n  An interagency working group consisting of representatives of the \nNational Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency will be responsible for \nplanning and managing this program.\n  The program will have three goals: Improved understanding of \nwindstorms, windstorm impact assessment, and windstorm impact \nreduction.\n\n  How do we achieve this? Data collection and analysis, outreach, \ntechnology transfer, and research and development.\n  As a result of this program, we will translate existing and future \ninformation and research findings into cost-effective and affordable \npractices for design and construction professionals, and State and \nlocal officials.\n  And this interagency group will provide biennial updates of their \nprogress to Congress so we know what progress has been made and what \nmore needs to be done.\n  We'll also get a broad cross-section of interests involved through an \nadvisory committee--so that real-life issues are addressed and onsite \nexpertise is utilized.\n  And my hope is that the devastation of Hurricane Andrew will never be \nexperienced again in my State of Florda or in any other State.\n  This bill and help us achieve that and I urge my collegues' support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2713. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise the \namount of minimum allotments under the Projects for Assistance in \nTransition from Homelessness program; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend Senator \nKennedy to introduce a bill that will raise the minimum grant amounts \ngiven to States and territories under the PATH program. The PATH \nprogram provides services through formula grants of at least $300,000 \nto each State, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and $50,000 to \neligible U.S. territories. Subject to available appropriations, this \nbill will raise the minimum allotments to $600,000 to each State and \n$100,000 to eligible U.S. territories.\n  When the PATH program was established in FY1991 as a formula grant \nprogram, Congress appropriated $33 million. That amount has steadily \nincreased over the years with Congress appropriating $50 million this \npast year. However, despite these increases, States and territories \nsuch as New Mexico that have rural and frontier populations, have not \nreceived an increase in their PATH funds. Under the formula, as it \ncurrently exists, many States and territories will never receive an \nincrease to their PATH program, even with increasing demand and \ninflation. This problem is occurring in my home state of New Mexico as \nwell as twenty-five other States and territories throughout the United \nStates.\n  The PATH program is authorized under the Public Health Service Act \nand it funds community-based outreach, mental health, substance abuse, \ncase management and other support services, as well as a limited set of \nhousing services for people who are homeless and have serious mental \nillnesses. Program services are provided in a variety of different \nsettings, including clinic sites, shelter-based clinics, and mobile \nunits. In addition, the PATH program takes health care services to \nlocations where homeless individuals are found, such as streets, parks, \nand soup kitchens.\n  PATH services are a key element in the plan to end chronic \nhomelessness. Every night, an estimated 600,000 people are homeless in \nAmerica. Of these, about one-third are single adults with serious \nmental illnesses. I have worked closely with organizations in New \nMexico such as Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless and I have seen \nfirst-hand the difficulties faced by the more than 15,000 homeless \npeople in New Mexico, 35 percent of whom are chronically mentally ill \nor mentally incapacitated.\n  PATH is a proven program that has been very successful in moving \npeople out of homelessness. PATH has been reviewed by the Office of \nManagement and Budget and has scored significantly high marks in \nmeeting program goals and objectives. Unquestionably, homelessness is \nnot just an urban issue. Rural and frontier communities face unique \nchallenges in serving PATH eligible persons and the PATH program \nfunding mechanisms must account for these differences.\n  Thank you and I look forward to working with my colleague Senator \nKennedy on this important issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2713\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF ALLOTMENT.\n\n       ``(a) Determination Under Formula.--Subject to subsection \n     (b), the allotment required in section 521 for a State and \n     Territory for a fiscal year is the product of--\n\n[[Page S8561]]\n\n       ``(1) an amount equal to the amount appropriated under \n     section 535 for the fiscal year; and\n       ``(2) a percentage equal to the quotient of--\n       ``(A) an amount equal to the population living in urbanized \n     areas of the State involved, as indicated by the most recent \n     data collected by the Bureau of the Census; and\n       ``(B) an amount equal to the population living in urbanized \n     areas of the United States, as indicated by the sum of the \n     respective amounts determined for the States under \n     subparagraph (A).\n       ``(b) Minimum Allotment.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the allotment \n     for a State under section 521 for a fiscal year shall, at a \n     minimum, be the greater of--\n       ``(A) the amount the State or Territory received under \n     section 521 in fiscal year 2004; and\n       ``(B) $600,000 for each of the several States, the District \n     of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and \n     $100,000 for each of Guam, the Virgin Islands, American \n     Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n       ``(2) Condition.--If the funds appropriated in any fiscal \n     year under section 535 are insufficient to ensure that States \n     and Territories receive a minimum allotment in accordance \n     with paragraph (1), then--\n       ``(A) no State or Territory shall receive less than the \n     amount they received in fiscal year 2004; and\n       ``(B) any funds remaining after amounts are provided under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be used to meet the requirement of \n     paragraph (1)(B), to the maximum extent possible.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 2714. A bill to amend part D of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct, as added by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \nModernization Act of 2003, to provide for negotiation of fair prices \nfor Medicare prescription drugs; read the first time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Recently, the Majority Leader pulled the class-action \nreform legislation from consideration after the Senate failed to invoke \ncloture on the bill. We all know he would have had the votes for \ncloture if he had not played games with the amendment process. Instead, \nhe proposed allowing Democrats only five non-germane amendments and \ninsisted that he choose which amendments could be offered. He insisted \nthat under no circumstances could we offer a bipartisan bill to \nlegalize the safe importation of lower-priced prescription drugs from \nCanada and other industrialized countries. The Majority Leader no doubt \nfeared that the re-importation legislation would pass as a result of \nthe broad bipartisan support it enjoys. But the drug industry didn't \nwant lower prices, and we were prevented from offering our amendment.\n  The re-importation bill is just one of many health measures currently \npending in Congress that would help Americans who are struggling with \nthe high costs of care, drugs, and insurance. These bills have broad \nsupport--some even have Republican lead sponsors--and we should be \nconsidering them here in the Senate. In fact, it is our obligation to \ndo so. Yet most of these bills continue to languish in committee while \nthe majority plays procedural games with the amendment process and \nspends countless hours on bills and measures that the Majority Leader \nknows do not have the votes to pass.\n  In response, over the past week, we have begun the process of putting \nthese measures on the calendar. We are doing so to highlight that these \ncritical bills are available for consideration on the Senate floor, and \nto show how important it is to pass them and send them to the President \nfor his signature as soon as possible.\n  Today, I would like to discuss a measure I first introduced on the \nday the conference report to the Medicare bill passed the Senate. This \nproposal was included in a broader piece of legislation that we \nintroduced that day in response to the conference report, and, on \nDecember 9, I introduced it as a stand-alone measure. It is a very \nsimple bill. It would strike the prohibition contained in last year's \nMedicare legislation that prohibits the government from using the power \nof 41 million beneficiaries to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have expressed support for striking \nthat provision. Senators who supported the conference report have \njoined with those who opposed it, such as myself, in cosponsoring my \nbill. That's because it just makes sense.\n  The new Medicare law does almost nothing to rein in skyrocketing \nprescription drug costs. In fact, it actually prohibits Medicare from \nusing its bargaining power to negotiate lower prices. We have seen the \nVA's success at negotiating lower prices. Similarly, we should use the \npower of Medicare's beneficiary population to obtain lower prices for \nseniors and people with disabilities. Rather than fragmenting the \npopulation to dilute our ability to negotiate lower costs, we have an \nobligation--both to Medicare beneficiaries and to American taxpayers--\nto secure the lowest possible prices. That's what my bill would do.\n  It's time for the Senate to side with seniors and taxpayers over the \ndrug industry. It's time for the Senate to pass this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2714\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve access to graduate schools in the United \nStates for international students and scholars; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, September 11, 2001, was a day that \nchanged America forever. It taught us that oceans cannot protect us \nfrom those who are fanatically devoted to harming us. The world has \nchanged after September 11. The American experience, realities, changed \nafter September 11. We live with greater uncertainty. We live with \ngreater fear and concern about attack. We have, even those in this \nChamber, gone through the process of thinking the unthinkable, thinking \nabout attacks on our soil, on our towns, on our country.\n  The good news is that in the last 2\\1/2\\ years since September 11, \nAmerica has not experienced another experience like that. It appears as \nif the measures we have taken have had some effect. The PATRIOT Act was \npassed with overwhelming support. It is now the subject of some debate, \nbut let's not debate the importance of doing those things that protect \nthis country from attack. The PATRIOT Act has clearly been part of \nthat.\n  The efforts of our President in rooting out the Taliban and getting \nrid of Saddam have all had an impact on making this country safer. But \nthere are no guarantees. Clearly, even today--we have the September 11 \nCommission report coming out tomorrow; we have the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee report coming out, reviewing what we did, should have done, \nand what we could do better.\n  The bottom line is we want to make sure this never happens again. The \neffort to improve our safety and security is important. This is not a \ngame. This is not to raise the fear for political purposes; this is the \nreality of the world in which we live.\n  But I do believe there is at least one area where our policy \nregarding security and measures we are taking to improve security \nshould be examined and changed. That is why today I am introducing the \nInternational Student and Scholar Access Act.\n  Again, we all know there is absolutely no such thing as an absolute \nguarantee of absolute security in a free society, so what we do is \nmeasure the level of threat against the loss of certain other values \nand then we try to strike a balance. In the area of student visas, I \nbelieve we have pushed security concerns beyond the logical point and\n\n[[Page S8562]]\n\nneed to make adjustments to our policy.\n  This is what I am talking about. America has been home to foreign \nstudents in great numbers for many years. If you go to the University \nof Minnesota, you see students from all over the world. The same is \ntrue in our private schools in Minnesota. The University of St. Thomas \nhas a great international student program. Those are good programs.\n  What those programs do is provide young people from around the world \nan opportunity to study in America, to understand the American \nexperience, to understand American values, to understand the American \nway of life. That is a good thing.\n  Unfortunately, I believe one of the terrorist hijackers on September \n11 was an individual who had a student visa. He did not attend school. \nNo one followed up. As a result of that, what happened is we looked at \nthat student visa policy and said: We have to make changes.\n  I understand that. I understand we have to tighten up standards. I \nunderstand we have to be more careful about those who claim to be \nstudents who come into our country.\n  But I believe the result of what has been well intentioned--what is \nimportant, the security of our country; nothing is more important than \nthe role of Government to make sure we are secure--in regard to student \nvisas has been to push the ball a little too far. I think what we are \nseeing now is there are scores of young people who would like to be \npart of the American experience, who would like to study in our \nschools, who would like to understand American culture and American \nvalues, young people who, 20 or 30 years from now, when they are the \nPresidents and Vice Presidents and Ambassadors and Ministers of their \ncountry, would have a relationship, saying: I went to the University of \nMinnesota. I went to the University of Maine. I went to the University \nof Saint Thomas. I went to Bowdoin College. I understand what you are \nabout and would like to be a partner with you.\n  I think we are at a point now where, in reaction to 9/11, what we are \ndoing with student visas is to have kind of turned it around. Now that \nit is a national security issue, I think we are missing the opportunity \nfor a lot of young people to become part of and understand and share in \nthe American experience.\n  So now we have visa processes that are structured in a way that \nproduces results that I don't think we want. They require that consular \nofficers in our Embassies spend far too much time on people who do not \nthreaten this country and excluding too many of them. That does not \nleave them enough time to deal with those folks who are a genuine \nthreat.\n  It is the equivalent of a police roadblock. We are stopping so many \ninnocent people that it calls into question if this is a good use of \nGovernment resources and power.\n\n  Again, it is in the interest of the United States of America to bring \nin the best and brightest foreign students to study in America. These \nare people who will lead their nations one day. The experience they \ngain with our democratic system and our values gives them a better \nunderstanding of what America is and who Americans are.\n  I had an opportunity the other day to spend time with a young woman \nfrom Iraq, a Kurd from Kirkuk. She was there to kind of shadow us and \nunderstand a little bit about American--this system of government. I \nthought--she had 1 day--just think if we had 4 years of her being here, \nor 5 years, and she came to understand this country and its history and \nits people and its culture and its ways and its values, and she carried \nthat in her heart back to her country, with the opportunities we would \nhave along the way to strengthen those relationships.\n  We hear so much today about anger at Americans, about hate directed \ntoward Americans. But this is in a world that, at times, I think may \nhate us because they don't know us. They don't know us. They know what \nthey see on Al-Jazeera or they know what they hear from some political \nleader who may disagree with the kind of government and the democracy \nand the values we have.\n  International education represents an opportunity to break down those \nbarriers. I think some who hate this Nation do so out of ignorance. \nForeign students who return to their nations many times become \nambassadors of good will and understanding.\n  And don't discount the personal relationships. In our lives, we may \nsee friends who we met back in college, people we have not seen in 20 \nyears. When we run into those friends, there is a bond. Our young \neducated people become our leaders, not just in Government but in \nbusiness, in industry, in education. The same is true throughout the \nworld. The world is not such a big place. It is not such a big place \nwhen you have these human connections.\n  So these young people go back to their countries, young people who \nstudied here, who learned of our ways, and they become ambassadors of \ngood will and understanding, and they speak with credibility about the \nfreedoms that spur American success.\n  Foreign students also help our economy. Higher education is a major \nservice sector export, bringing in $12 billion to the U.S. economy \nevery year. Competitors, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and \nAustralia are gaining market share while the United States is losing. \nTotal international applications to U.S. graduate schools for the fall \nof 2004 declined 32 percent from the fall of 2003. Fifty-four percent \nof English as a second language programs have reported declines in \napplications.\n  When you think about the economy, it is not just a tourist economy. \nPeople are coming here to spend money. I had an opportunity to be \ninvolved in a series of meetings with some of my colleagues, chaired by \nSenator Baucus, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, and \nbringing in leaders of American industry, the CEOs of some of the \nlargest corporations in America, to talk about what we have to do to \nensure American competitiveness in this global economy. One of the \nissues these CEOs mentioned was the difficulty in having foreign \nstudents come to our country and the impact it has on their \nopportunities for success and innovation, and the impact that has on \nthe American economy.\n\n  It is not just a long-term national security issue; it is an economic \ndevelopment and opportunity issue. We are shortchanging ourselves by \nlosing access to talent.\n  The legislation I introduce today is an effort to reverse the decline \nin foreign access to U.S. education. My legislation seeks to promote \nforeign study in America by urging strategic thinking and by making \ncommonsense changes to the way we process visa applications.\n  This legislation would help to clarify the often overlapping roles \nbetween lead agencies that work on international education--the \nDepartments of State, Commerce, Homeland Security, and Education.\n  It proposes improvements related to SEVIS fees for tracking foreign \nstudents, by prorating fees for short-term students and allowing them \nto make payments in their local currencies. There is a process of \npayments that are made. If you are here for a short term, you pay as \nmuch as for a long term. It is another barrier, another impediment to \nproviding an opportunity for foreign students to be here.\n  It would set goals for more timeliness and certainty in the visa \nprocess. It would press the State Department for commonsense \nimprovements to give more discretion on personal appearance \nrequirements and on the duration of security clearances. It would \nimprove the interoperability between databases of the FBI and the State \nDepartment.\n  Perhaps the most critical part of my bill deals with the criteria for \nstudent visas. Currently, consular officers have to prove that a \nstudent visa applicant has essential ties which will ensure his or her \nreturn to his or her own country after study is complete. This \nrequirement poses an unrealistic burden on students who are typically \nnot yet sufficiently well established in their societies to be able to \ndemonstrate a likelihood of return. In reality, international students \nare often encouraged to stay in the U.S. after they have completed \ntheir studies, by changing their status to that of H-1B, for example.\n  An observation on this, and let me go just a little bit more about \nthe legislation, because what it does is it calls for\n\n[[Page S8563]]\n\na more realistic standard for student visas. That is what we really \nneed.\n  My legislation replaces the criteria of expected return with two \nother criteria. Students would have to demonstrate that they intend to \ncome to the U.S. to complete a legitimate course of study, and that \nthey have the financial means for doing so.\n  Let me explain why that makes so much more sense. The reality is, if \nwe have a bright and enterprising student from Africa, from Uganda, or \nfrom Argentina, from Latin America somewhere, the issue we need to be \nconcerned about is whether they are really coming here to study. The \nconcern over 9/11 is, you had folks who came here who were using that \nto gain entry into this country. Are they coming here to study? Is it a \nlegitimate course of study? Do they have the means to do so? Are they \ncoming here for the purpose they intended?\n  Afterwards, if we have a highly trained and highly qualified college \ngraduate from Uganda and they do whatever has to be done legally in \nterms of dealing with immigration, what is the issue? Why would you not \nwant to have them here a little longer if they are going to contribute \nto the economic growth, to the increase in brainpower, to all the \nthings that need to be done to make sure America stays competitive in \nthis new global economy?\n  America is never going to compete with low-scale wages. We are past \nthat. There is no way we can compete with China. Mexico can't compete \nwith China today. America's economic success is tied to innovation and \nbrainpower. That is our future. What we do to encourage that, certainly \namong folks here but also students from other countries who become part \nof that pool, who help us become more creative and entrepreneurial, is \nimportant.\n  I have to say--and I wouldn't be surprised if the Senator from Maine \nhas not had the same experience--this issue consumes a lot of my time \nand that of my case workers back in Minnesota. Time and again they are \nasked by Minnesota colleges and universities to make a plea to the \nState Department to help process a foreign student's visa. These are \nstudents who want to come to the United States, who have the \nintellectual assets that all can gain from, who have scholarships or \nother resources to take care of themselves while in America. But \nbecause they don't have spouses or homes in their native lands, they \nare rejected for their student visas. What sense does that make? How \ndoes that further the interests of those in the United States? How does \nit further the interests of our colleges and universities that benefit \nfrom quality students, benefit from the diversity brought by students \nfrom Africa or from Asia, benefit from having a broader kind of dialog \nand exchange about what this world is all about?\n  I had a particular case of a talented young man from Uganda named \nHumphrey. Humphrey had a full ride to St. Thomas University in St. \nPaul, MN, which--I note with great pride--my son entered. He had his \norientation just the other day. I have a personal interest in St. \nThomas, but that is not the reason I advocated for Humphrey. Humphrey \nwas a research assistant with Professor Martin O'Reilly at Uganda \nMartyrs University. Dr. O'Reilly stated:\n\n       With service for 22 years in African countries, this is the \n     most impressive student and human being I have ever known. He \n     is one in a million.\n\n  Humphrey is a psychology student. His goal is to return to Africa and \noffer counseling services on a continent where the psychological scars \nare so deep. We just heard my friend and colleague from Illinois \ntalking about the brutality, the genocide in Sudan. We know of what \nhappened in Rwanda. We know the scars that need to be healed. Humphrey \nwants to go back and offer services where psychological scars are deep. \nYet his visa application was rejected more than once because he could \nnot prove to a consular officer that he intended to return to Uganda. I \ncalled that consular officer at one time, not to pressure as a Senator \nbut just to ask them to take a look at the application. Don't let it \njust kind of get processed run of the mill because we have a process \nnow that makes it difficult for students to come here. Take a look at \nit and then make a judgment, if the judgment is pretty clear.\n\n  I am happy to say that Humphrey's visa application was finally \naccepted and he began study in January. I fear that there are too many \npeople like him who will not be educated in America. We will lose not \nonly their wisdom but also the chance to show them what makes America \nso great. I believe in the tougher measures we implemented after \nSeptember 11, but I think we have to be smarter with how we use these \ntools. I think we can strike a better balance between security and the \nvalue of bringing the world here to be educated. And that is in \nAmerica's long-term interest.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this important issue and to support \nthis legislation. It is in many ways a national security issue, \nnational security not just in having a process in place that weeds out \nthose who shouldn't be here but long-term national security, making \nsure that America has those relationships and those contacts with the \nfuture leaders of countries around this world and gives them the \nopportunity to be educated here. Right now they are being educated in \nother places, in England and France and Germany. We are missing an \nopportunity. There is no reason. We can do better than that.\n  Let us look at this issue. It is still my first term, and I haven't \nfinished yet. I haven't finished the second year. I know it takes a \nwhile to get things done. But I think the clock is ticking on this \nissue. Each and every day we are missing an opportunity. Each and every \nday as we see the numbers of international student applications \ndecline, as we see less and less of the opportunities to establish \nthose relationships because of the policies we have in place, it cries \nout for change.\n  My legislation offers that change. I hope this body considers it, and \nI hope we make the change. As a result, I know we will build a stronger \nAmerica. We will build a better America. That is the reason I think we \nare all here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2715\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Student and \n     Scholar Access Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has a strategic need to improve its \n     student visa screening process to protect against terrorists \n     who would abuse the system to harm the United States.\n       (2) At the same time, openness to international students \n     and exchange visitors serves longstanding and important \n     United States foreign policy, educational, and economic \n     interests, and the erosion of such exchanges is contrary to \n     United States national security interests.\n       (3) Educating successive generations of future world \n     leaders in the United States has long been an important \n     underpinning of United States international influence and \n     leadership.\n       (4) Open scientific exchange, which enables the United \n     States to benefit from the knowledge of the world's top \n     scientists, has long been an important underpinning of United \n     States scientific leadership.\n       (5) The United States has seen a dramatic increase in \n     requests for Visa Mantis checks designed to protect against \n     illegal transfers of sensitive technology, from 1,000 in \n     fiscal year 2000 to 20,000 in fiscal year 2003.\n       (6) Delays in issuing Visa Mantis security clearances have \n     discouraged some international scholars from coming to the \n     United States.\n       (7) International students and their families studying in \n     the United States contribute close to $12,000,000,000 to the \n     United States economy each year, making higher education a \n     major service sector export.\n       (8) Delays in obtaining student visas have discouraged many \n     international students from studying in the United States.\n       (9) Total international applications to graduate schools in \n     the United States for fall 2004 declined 32 percent from fall \n     2003.\n       (10) The number of international students enrolled in the \n     United States, which in raw numbers consistently increased \n     over time and grew by 6 percent during both the 2000-2001 and \n     2001-2002 school years, leveled off dramatically during the \n     2002-2003 school year to an increase of only .6 percent.\n       (11) Concerns related to the anticipated international \n     student monitoring system known as ``SEVIS'' have contributed \n     to the decline in the number of foreign applicants to \n     educational institutions in the United States.\n       (12) The United States requires a visa system for exchange \n     programs that maximizes United States national security.\n\n[[Page S8564]]\n\n       (13) The United States requires a comprehensive strategy \n     for recruiting international students as well as enhancing \n     the access of international students to higher education in \n     the United States.\n\n TITLE I--NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR ENHANCING INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACCESS \n                          TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n     SEC. 101.

WASHINGTON, AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Craig, Mr. Biden, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \nDeWine) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 130\n\n       Whereas Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 \n     to provide certainty and fairness in sentencing, avoid \n     unwarranted disparities among defendants with similar records \n     found guilty of similar offenses, and maintain sufficient \n     flexibility to permit individualized sentences when \n     warranted;\n       Whereas Congress established the United States Sentencing \n     Commission as an independent commission in the Judicial \n     branch of the United States to establish sentencing policies \n     and practices for the Federal criminal justice system that \n     meet the purposes of sentencing and the core goals of the \n     Sentencing Reform Act;\n       Whereas Congress has prescribed both statutory minimum and \n     statutory maximum penalties for certain offenses and the \n     Sentencing Reform Act authorizes the Sentencing Commission to \n     promulgate guidelines and establish sentencing ranges for the \n     use of a sentencing court in determining a sentence within \n     the statutory minimum and maximum penalties prescribed by \n     Congress;\n       Whereas the statutory maximum penalty is the maximum \n     penalty provided by the statute defining the offense of \n     conviction, including any applicable statutory enhancements, \n     and not the upper end of the guideline sentencing range \n     promulgated by the Sentencing Commission and determined to be \n     applicable to a particular defendant;\n       Whereas both Congress and the Sentencing Commission \n     intended the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to be applied as a \n     cohesive and integrated whole, and not in a piecemeal \n     fashion;\n       Whereas in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989), \n     the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the \n     constitutionality of the Sentencing Reform Act and the \n     Federal Sentencing Guidelines against separation-of-powers \n     and non-delegation challenges;\n       Whereas in Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), \n     the Supreme Court held that the sentencing guidelines of the \n     State of Washington violated a defendant's Sixth Amendment \n     right to trial by jury;\n       Whereas despite Mistretta and numerous other Supreme Court \n     opinions over the past 15 years affirming the \n     constitutionality of various aspects of the Guidelines, the \n     Blakely decision has raised concern about the continued \n     constitutionality of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines;\n       Whereas the Blakely decision has created substantial \n     confusion and uncertainty in the Federal criminal justice \n     system;\n       Whereas the lower Federal courts have reached inconsistent \n     positions on the applicability of Blakely to the Federal \n     Sentencing Guidelines;\n       Whereas there is a split among the circuit courts of appeal \n     as to the applicability of Blakely to the Federal Sentencing \n     Guidelines, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has \n     certified the question to the Supreme Court;\n       Whereas the orderly administration of justice in pending \n     and resolved trials, sentencings and plea negotiations has \n     been affected by the uncertainty surrounding the \n     applicability of the Blakely decision to the Federal \n     Sentencing Guidelines;\n       Whereas the current confusion in the lower Federal courts \n     has and will continue to produce results that disserve the \n     core principles underlying the Sentencing Reform Act;\n       Whereas two and one-half weeks after the Supreme Court \n     issued its decision in Blakely, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee convened a hearing to consider the implications of \n     the decision for the Federal criminal justice system; and\n       Whereas the Department of Justice, the Sentencing \n     Commission, and others advised the Committee that corrective \n     legislation was not necessary at this time, with the hope \n     that the Supreme Court would clarify the applicability of its \n     Blakely decision to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in an \n     expeditious manner: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), Thatit is the sense of Congress that the Supreme \n     Court of the United States should act expeditiously to \n     resolve the current confusion and inconsistency in the \n     Federal criminal justice system by promptly considering and \n     ruling on the constitutionality of the Federal Sentencing \n     Guidelines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8566-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8566-S8568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable and any statements related to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Res. 125\n\n       Whereas August 1, 2004, marks the 60th anniversary of the \n     Warsaw Uprising, when against seemingly insurmountable odds \n     and extreme hardships, Polish citizens revolted against the \n     Nazi occupiers in Warsaw, Poland, in one of the most heroic \n     battles during World War II;\n       Whereas the Warsaw Uprising was a part of a nationwide \n     resistance against the Nazi occupation, was started by the \n     underground Home Army, and lasted 63 days;\n       Whereas the Polish resistance, many of them teenagers, \n     while heavily outnumbered and armed with mostly homemade \n     weapons, fought bravely against the German soldiers and lost \n     approximately 250,000 civilians and troops;\n       Whereas, to punish Poland for the uprising, the Nazis \n     systematically razed 70 percent of Warsaw, including \n     monuments, cultural treasures, and historical buildings;\n       Whereas the heroism and spirit of the Polish resistance are \n     an inspiration to all peoples in their pursuit of liberty and \n     democracy and are evident today in Polish contributions to \n     the global war against terrorism and the more than 2,300 \n     Polish troops currently deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom; \n     and\n       Whereas the heroic undertaking of the Polish underground \n     represents one of the most important contributions to the \n     Allied war effort during World War II and remains venerated \n     in the Polish consciousness, even for the generations born \n     after it ended: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress recognizes the 60th anniversary of \n     the Warsaw Uprising during World War II which will forever \n     serve as a symbol of heroism in the face of great adversity \n     and the pursuit of freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8569-5", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8569-S8572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN SLAVERY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 414, which was submitted earlier \ntoday by Senator Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 414) encouraging States to consider \n     adopting comprehensive legislation to combat human \n     trafficking in slavery and recognizing the many efforts made \n     to combat human trafficking and slavery.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to speak on the resolution that I \nbelieve will be passed by unanimous consent of the Senate which \npertains to something I thought we would never be talking about now in \nthe year 2004, and that is human slavery and trafficking in human \nbeings.\n  The good work that has been done by the U.S. Congress, since, of \ncourse, the ratification of the 13th amendment in 1865 abolishing \nslavery and involuntary servitude, includes a remarkable tradition, and \na bipartisan tradition, I might add, starting, after 1865, in 1909, \nwhen the United States Code criminalized slavery.\n  In 2000, the late Senator Paul Wellstone and Senator Sam Brownback \njoined together as the lead sponsors, together with a number of other \nSenators and Representatives, to advance legislation to strengthen \nthose laws, specifically the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of \n2000, which was later signed into law by President Bill Clinton. That \nlegislation was reauthorized in 2003 by a bipartisan effort and signed \ninto law by President George W. Bush.\n  I expressly recognize the contributions of Senator Schumer, Senator \nGraham of South Carolina, Senator Leahy of Vermont, and Senator \nClinton, who joined in cosponsoring this resolution. Indeed, this \nresolution lays out the terrible tale of the fact that as many as \n800,000 human beings are literally bought and sold worldwide into\n\n[[Page S8570]]\n\nsome form of slavery or involuntary servitude. Approximately 16,000 of \nthose human beings are brought into the United States each year, \ncoerced into lives of forced labor or sexual servitude which, of \ncourse, is another way of describing slavery.\n  This has been a bipartisan effort. It is refreshing to know, \nparticularly during an election year where there are differences that \ndivide us, where we know sometimes the rhetoric gets a little \noverwrought, that we can come together on such an important issue.\n  The fact is the current administration has responded to the call by \ndramatically increasing efforts into devoting substantially more \nresources toward combating human trafficking. This has been done \nprincipally under the auspices of the civil rights division at the \nJustice Department which has prosecuted and convicted three times the \nnumber of traffickers over the past 3 years as had been done in the \npreceding 3 years, three times more in this last 3 years than had been \ndone in the preceding 3 years.\n  The Department of Justice has created the Office of Special Counsel \nfor Trafficking Issues to coordinate antitrafficking efforts. It has \nalso published educational and awareness-raising materials and \ncirculated them to officials across America and provided assistance to \nvictims of this trafficking by installing among other things a toll-\nfree hotline. Last week the Department of Justice sponsored a historic \nnational conference on human trafficking in Tampa, FL, bringing \ntogether Federal, State, and local officials, social service agencies, \nand nongovernmental organizations to provide training and coordination \nto antihuman trafficking efforts across the country as provided in the \nfiscal year 2004 appropriations bill.\n  The problem we uncovered was brought home during a recent hearing I \nchaired for the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and \nProperty Rights of the Judiciary Committee. We heard testimony about \nthe men, women, and children who continue to be trafficked into the \nUnited States. Each of these stories is tragic, disturbing, and \nheartrending. It is hard to imagine that this sort of thing continues \nto happen today. Let me mention two of them.\n  In January of 2004, several defendants were sentenced to prison terms \nranging from 4 months to 14 years after a ringleader of a human \ntrafficking ring admitted to running a human trafficking operation \nbringing women from Central America and then holding them in this \ncountry once they were smuggled into the country. They were held \nagainst their will. Many of them were sexually assaulted. All of them \nwere forced to work against their will until their smuggling fees were \npaid by their families.\n  Another instance involved a research assistant and his wife at a \nuniversity located in my State of Texas who were prosecuted for leading \na trafficking ring that victimized young women. These young women were \nbrought from Uzbekistan. They were lured to the United States by \npromises of lucrative modeling jobs, extravagant lifestyles, and also \nbased on the promise that they would be able to bring their families \nonce they were established here in the United States.\n\n  The defendants in this case used fraudulently obtained J-1 visas to \nbring women into the United States through El Paso, TX. The visas \npurported to show that the women were scientists traveling to the \nUnited States to do scientific research. But once here, their \nimmigration documents were confiscated, and these women were forced to \nwork at local strip clubs for the benefit of the defendants who \nultimately collected more than $700,000 as a result of their criminal \nenterprise. These defendants were ultimately convicted and sentenced to \n5 years in prison and ordered to pay more than a half million dollars \nin restitution to their victims.\n  One of the things that was brought home to me as a result of this \nhearing was that the same routes, the same criminal enterprises that \nengage in smuggling of human beings, who prey on their hopes or their \ndesire for jobs and economic opportunity, it is the same people in many \ninstances and the same routes and organizations that engage in illegal \nsmuggling of human beings who want nothing more than to be able to come \nhere and work and then send money home to their families. It is just \nthat the ones who are the victims of this trafficking are not freed \nwhen they are brought into this country but literally kept in \ninvoluntary servitude and slavery, some approximately 16,000, we think, \nalthough the numbers have to be suspect. They have to be low because, \nindeed, we know the victims of this activity are reluctant to come \nforward because they may have come illegally into the country.\n  This is a persistent problem, one that touches on a larger issue, and \nthat is, as we go forward with border security measures, to try to make \nsure that we protect our sovereign borders and to make sure our \nimmigration laws are brought into modern times and the realities of our \ndemand and indeed our reliance on labor provided by immigrants in this \ncountry. I hope we will view this as one of the terrible symptoms of a \nlarger problem, and that is the need for us, as we establish the \nsecurity of our borders, consistent with the post 9/11 world, that we \nalso address the need to bring our immigration laws into this century. \nThe President's call for immigration reform is part of it.\n  Particularly for those who are, once they are brought into this \ncountry based on promises of jobs and opportunity, but then enslaved, \nthat we redouble our efforts to make sure we bring an end to this \nscourge.\n  I appreciate the bipartisan effort we have seen, the expressions of \nsupport for the work that has been done across the years by this \nadministration, by previous administrations in combating the scourge of \nhuman slavery. I commend the Justice Department in particular for \ntripling the number of prosecutions they have obtained in these last 3 \nyears over the preceding 3 years. This is a fight worth fighting. These \nare some of the most vulnerable victims we could possibly imagine. \nTheir punishment is well deserved.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about a \nbipartisan measure; that is, the resolution Senator Cornyn and I are \nsubmitting on human trafficking. I thank my friend from Texas for \nworking with me to address this growing problem that devastates the \nlives of so many.\n  Human trafficking is one of the most heinous crimes in our world \ntoday. Everyone knows it is a heinous crime to take a person, often a \nyoung woman, kidnap her, and put her into, basically, sexual servitude. \nIt is an absolute abomination.\n  What I think most people are not aware of is the large number of \npeople who are so enslaved. Our State Department estimates 800,000 \npeople are trafficked across international borders each year. Some are \nfor domestic slavery, some are for farm slavery, and many are for \nsexual servitude.\n  According to these State Department estimates, approximately three-\nquarters of those trafficked are female, and 70 percent of these women \nare trafficked for sexual exploitation. So a little quick math would \nindicate it is pretty close to 400,000 a year who are engaged in sexual \nexploitation, and you cannot be too relieved that the other half are in \nother kinds of slavery.\n  The victims are kidnapped or lured with false promises of money, and \nthen thrown into slavery. Their captors subject their victims to forced \nprostitution. They are sexually assaulted sometimes 20 times a day. The \nlack of protection against HIV and AIDS means an effective death \nsentence for many sexual trafficking victims.\n  The victims of forced labor fare only slightly better.\n  In the vast majority of cases, they are worked to near death. They \nare routinely assaulted, sometimes killed. The truly sad fact is that \nat least half of the human trafficking victims are children, sometimes \nas young as 9 or 10 years old. The traffickers abuse the children, keep \nthem in line by threatening to kill their parents or other family \nmembers if they don't comply. Beatings and rape are part of their \neveryday experience. Their lives are more horrific than many of us \ncould even imagine. To think I am the father of two daughters, just \nthink of your young children being put in this situation, and you can \nsee the gravity and the horror of the situation.\n  Here is another thing I will bet most Americans are not aware of. We \nthink maybe this is happening in Africa or Asia or Europe. No, it is \nalso occurring\n\n[[Page S8571]]\n\nright here in the United States. Sixteen thousand people are trafficked \ninto the United States every year. Most are forced into sexual slavery \nin our own country. I have read in newspapers in New York about how \nsome of these rings have been exposed. It is often among immigrant \ngroups, but we are not immune.\n  We have taken some important strides against this evil. In the year \n2000, President Clinton signed into law the bipartisan Trafficking \nVictims Protection Act. This act gave law enforcement real tools to \nfight against sexual trafficking and the money to fund that fight. Last \nyear I was proud to join Senator Brownback as the Democratic sponsor of \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003.\n  Of course, with the death of Senator Wellstone, who had been such a \nleader on this issue, a void has been left. I am doing my best to at \nleast fill a little bit of it. We added new tools to fight against \nthese traffickers and refined the tools we already had created to \nbetter serve law enforcement. We have made some strides. The laws are \nworking. But the bottom line is, there is still a whole lot more to be \ndone.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Cornyn today in sponsoring this \nresolution. I thank him for his important work on this issue. The \nresolution recognizes the fact we need more awareness of this horrible \ncrime, particularly at the State and local level. State and local law \nenforcement officers are often the first point of contact with victims \nin trafficking in the course of their normal work. This resolution puts \nthe Senate on record supporting efforts to educate and empower State \nand local law enforcement officers in identifying trafficking victims. \nBy raising awareness at the State and local level, we can better make \nuse of the many tools we have in this fight.\n  T-visas are a vital part of the fight against sex trafficking. These \nvisas enable victims of trafficking to testify against their \ntraffickers and help put these criminals in jail. We have had the \nsituation where we have the victims and they are sent home, and the \npeople who did it go free. Currently, we issue less than 2 percent of \nthe T-visas available, and yet we know that tens of thousands of \nvictims go without T-visas every year, condemning them to lives of \nabuse and terror instead of the protection they deserve and that is \navailable under the visa.\n  By educating and empowering State and local law enforcement officers \nto recognize trafficking crimes and raising awareness of this issue, we \ncan identify more victims and get them the help they need and, most \nimportantly, take their traffickers off the streets. We are also \ncalling on the States to do a close examination of their current laws \nto see if they are adequate in the face of the human trafficking \nthreat.\n  We must make sure we are prepared to deal with this crime at all \nlevels. We must also make sure the victims of trafficking receive the \nsame level of services regardless of what laws are used to prosecute \ntheir traffickers.\n  Far too often we find ourselves at odds with one another in the \nSenate. Our efforts on this issue show we can work together in a \nbipartisan way to protect some of the most endangered children in our \nworld and put some of the most awful criminals behind bars. This \nresolution is an important step in the battle to save the lives of \nhundreds of thousands of women and children who are trafficked each \nyear.\n  Along with Senator Cornyn, I urge my colleagues to support its \nimmediate passage. Together, if we work hard, we can greatly and \ndramatically reduce this horrible crime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nsubmitting the resolution about which he has just spoken.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased to sponsor this anti-\ntrafficking resolution with Senators Cornyn, Schumer, Lindsey Graham, \nand Clinton, and to have worked with Senator Cornyn to emphasize the \nbipartisan commitment to eliminate trafficking. The resolution \nencourages States to join the 106th and 108th Congresses in passing \nlegislation to combat human trafficking.\n  We cannot know with any certainty how many people are trafficked, but \nsome experts estimate that nearly a million people worldwide every year \nare bought, sold, or trafficked, with about 16,000 of those people \ntrafficked to the United States. These people are forced into \ninvoluntary servitude or, often, prostitution. Until recently, this \nissue was not a priority for governments around the world, but we are \nseeing signs of change, some prompted by our passage in 2000 of the \nbipartisan Trafficking Victims Protection Act, (TVPA) and last year's \nreauthorization of that law.\n  In 2000, I served on the conference committee for the TVPA, which \npassed in the House and Senate by overwhelming margins and was signed \nby President Clinton, whose Justice Department was intimately involved \nin the legislative process. This bill--on which our late colleague \nSenator Wellstone worked so tirelessly--signaled a bipartisan \ncongressional commitment to the prosecution of traffickers and the \nprotection of their victims. I am proud to have played a role in \ncreating the law, and in reauthorizing it.\n  In forging the TVPA, Senators Wellstone and Brownback, and \nCongressmen Christopher Smith and Gejdensen, sought both to eliminate \ntrafficking at home and to make combating trafficking and slavery a \nforeign policy priority. We are seeing signs of progress in this area, \nand I believe we will see even more if States become more involved in \nthis issue.\n  Combating trafficking has been a bipartisan issue. Senators and \nRepresentatives who are otherwise ideological opposites have worked \ntogether closely on anti-trafficking legislation, and the Justice \nDepartments under both President Clinton and Bush have made it a \npriority to prosecute those who would deprive others of their most \nbasic liberties. This resolution, too, provides an example of Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle working together to further the cause of \neliminating trafficking by punishing its perpetrators. I urge the \nSenate to pass it today.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements be printed in the \nappropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 414) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 414\n\n       Whereas it has been nearly 2 centuries since the abolition \n     of the transatlantic slave trade, and well over a century \n     since the ratification of the 13th amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States;\n       Whereas most Americans would be shocked to learn that the \n     institutions of slavery and involuntary servitude continue to \n     persist today--not just around the world, but hidden in \n     communities across the United States;\n       Whereas according to Federal Government estimates, \n     approximately 800,000 human beings are bought, sold, or \n     forced across the world's borders each year--including \n     approximately 16,000 human beings into the United States each \n     year--and are coerced into lives of forced labor or sexual \n     servitude that amount to a modern-day form of slavery;\n       Whereas the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States, ratified in 1865, abolishes the institutions \n     of slavery and involuntary servitude;\n       Whereas numerous provisions of chapter 77 of title 18 of \n     the United States Code have criminalized slavery since 1909;\n       Whereas the late Senator Paul Wellstone joined in a \n     bipartisan manner with Senator Sam Brownback and many other \n     Senators and Representatives to advance legislation to \n     strengthen those laws, leading to the enactment of the \n     Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et \n     seq.), which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton;\n       Whereas Congress made further bipartisan improvements to \n     the law when it enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection \n     Reauthorization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-193), which was \n     signed into law by President George W. Bush;\n       Whereas the Department of Justice, under the leadership of \n     its Civil Rights Division, has worked during the Clinton and \n     Bush presidencies to strengthen anti-trafficking laws and to \n     increase its own efforts to combat human trafficking and \n     slavery in light of those recent bipartisan enactments;\n       Whereas the Trafficking in Persons Office of the Department \n     of State continues to fight human trafficking around the \n     world;\n       Whereas many nongovernmental organizations have made \n     exceptional contributions to the prevention of human \n     trafficking and\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\n     to the care and rehabilitation of victims of human \n     trafficking;\n       Whereas survivors of human trafficking crimes risk their \n     lives and the lives of their families to assist in the \n     investigation and prosecution of their former captors;\n       Whereas effective prosecution of human trafficking crimes \n     will not be possible unless adequate protections are offered \n     to the survivors;\n       Whereas the fight to eliminate human trafficking and \n     slavery requires the involvement of State and local law \n     enforcement officials, as well as Federal law enforcement \n     efforts;\n       Whereas the enactment of comprehensive State laws \n     criminalizing human trafficking and slavery may be necessary \n     to ensure that Federal efforts are accompanied by robust \n     efforts at the State and local levels;\n       Whereas the States of Texas, Washington, Missouri, and \n     Florida have recently enacted comprehensive State criminal \n     laws against human trafficking and slavery;\n       Whereas the Department of Justice recently announced a \n     comprehensive model State anti-trafficking criminal statute, \n     and encouraged States to adopt such laws, at its first \n     ``National Conference on Human Trafficking,'' held in Tampa, \n     Florida; and\n       Whereas the Department of Justice's model State anti-\n     trafficking criminal statute is available at the Department's \n     website, http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/crim/model_state_law.pdf: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the bipartisan efforts of Congress, the \n     Department of Justice, and State and local law enforcement \n     officers to combat human trafficking and slavery;\n       (2) strongly encourages State legislatures to carefully \n     examine the Department of Justice's model State anti-\n     trafficking criminal statute, and to seriously consider \n     adopting State laws combating human trafficking and slavery \n     wherever such laws do not currently exist;\n       (3) strongly encourages State legislatures to carefully \n     examine the Federal benefits and protections for victims of \n     human trafficking and slavery contained in the Trafficking \n     Victims Protection Act of 2000 and the Trafficking Victims \n     Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003, and to seriously \n     consider adopting State laws that, at a minimum, offer these \n     explicit protections to the victims; and\n       (4) supports efforts to educate and empower State and local \n     law enforcement officers in the identification of victims of \n     human trafficking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8572-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8572-S8574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       EXPEDITIOUS SUPREME COURT ACTION IN BLAKELY V. WASHINGTON\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 130.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 130) expressing the \n     sense of Congress that the Supreme Court of the United States \n     should act expeditiously to resolve the confusion and \n     inconsistency in the Federal criminal justice system caused \n     by its decision in Blakely v. Washington, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, S. Con. Res. 130 expresses the sense of \nCongress that the Supreme Court should expedite consideration of the \napplicability of Blakely v. United States to the Federal Sentencing \nGuidelines.\n  As one of the original cosponsors of the Sentencing Reform Act of \n1984, which created the United States Sentencing Commission, and a \nproponent of reducing sentencing disparity across the nation, I have a \nstrong interest in preserving the integrity of the Federal guidelines \nagainst constitutional attack. Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform \nAct to reduce unwarranted disparity in Federal sentencing, including \nracial, geographical, and other unfair sentencing disparities by \nestablishing standardized sentencing rules while leaving judges enough \ndiscretion to impose just sentences in appropriate cases.\n  As many here may already know, criminal defendants are routinely \nsentenced by judges who decide sentencing facts based upon a \npreponderance of the evidence standard. This has all changed in recent \nweeks. On June 24, 2004, in Blakely v. Washington, the Supreme Court \nheld that any fact that increases the maximum penalty under a State \nstatutory sentencing guidelines scheme must be presented to a jury and \nproved beyond a reasonable doubt even though the defendant's sentence \nfalls below the statutory maximum sentence.\n  Although the Supreme Court explicitly stated in a footnote that ``The \nFederal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on \nthem,'' it also characterized the government's amicus brief as \nquestioning whether differences between the State and Federal \nsentencing schemes are constitutionally significant. The ambiguity \napparent in Blakely and the strong suggestions by the dissent that it \nwill apply to the Federal sentencing guidelines, has understandably \ncreated angst throughout the Federal justice system.\n  In just 2\\1/2\\ weeks after the Supreme Court's decision, we already \nhad a split among the Federal circuit courts of appeal. In addition, at \nleast two dozen lower Federal courts--and probably many more--have \nruled the Federal Sentencing Guidelines unconstitutional. Some judges \ndisregard the Federal sentencing guidelines in their entirety. Other \njudges apply mitigating sentencing factors but disregard any relevant \naggravating factors. Still other judges are convening juries to decide \nsome of these sentencing facts.\n  In fact, as I learned when the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on \nthis very issue just last week, in my home State of Utah, the district \njudges adopted four different approaches to sentencing defendants after \nBlakely.\n  Let me briefly describe a couple of examples of the havoc caused by \nthis Blakely decision. I'm sure we all recall Dwight Watson, the man \nwho sat in a tractor last year outside the U.S. Capitol for 47 hours \nand threatened to blow up the area with organophosphate bombs. The day \nbefore the Blakely opinion, Mr. Watson was sentenced to a 6-year prison \nsentence. Less than a week after the Supreme Court's opinion, he was \nresentenced to 16 months, which was essentially time served. He is now \na free man.\n  A defendant in West Virginia had an offense level that was off the \nsentencing charts. Although he would have been subject to a life \nsentence under the guidelines, the statutory maximum penalty was 20 \nyears. He was given a 20-year sentence three days before Blakely was \ndecided. A week later, his sentence was drastically reduced to 12 \nmonths. The judge did not rely on any relevant conduct or any \nsentencing enhancements in calculating the defendant's sentence. In \nother words, he only applied a portion of the sentencing guidelines--\nthose that he thought remained valid after Blakely.\n  The concurrent resolution I introduce today urges the Supreme Court \nto act expeditiously to resolve whether the Federal sentencing \nguidelines can be constitutionally applied in light of Blakely v. \nWashington. While I wish we could have done more, unfortunately, we \nwere unable to do so in such a short period of time.\n  As we go forward, I believe we should adopt legislation that would \nrender the Federal sentencing guidelines constitutional regardless of \nwhether Blakely applies. Unfortunately, while I have worked diligently \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses, we \nsimply just ran out of time. While I hope that the Supreme Court will \nfind application of the Federal sentencing guidelines constitutional \nunder the 6th Amendment, I will continue to work with my colleagues \nover the next several months in preparation of a contingency plan to \nensure that regardless of what the Supreme Court decides, that we will \nbe able to preserve a system that promotes uniformity and reduces \nsentencing disparity across this country.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Supreme Court's decision last month in \nBlakely v. Washington has raised significant concerns about the \nvalidity of the Federal sentencing guidelines. Blakely held that \nsentencing procedures used by the State of Washington violated the \ndefendant's constitutional right to a jury trial because they allowed \nthe judge to impose an enhanced sentence based on facts that were \nneither found by a jury nor admitted by the defendant.\n  Within days of this decision, a split developed among the Federal \ndistrict and circuit courts regarding the applicability of Blakely to \nthe Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and one circuit court invoked a \nrarely used procedural mechanism to certify the question to the Supreme \nCourt. Lower Federal courts continue to reach inconsistent positions on \nBlakely issues on virtually a daily basis. By all accounts, the \nconfusion and uncertainty is frustrating the orderly administration of \njustice in courts across the country.\n\n[[Page S8573]]\n\n  Two and one-half weeks after the Court issued its Blakely decision, \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee convened a hearing to consider the \nimplications of the decision for the Federal criminal justice system. \nAs witness after witness described the disarray in the lower Federal \ncourts, it became increasingly clear that the not-hypothetical \napplication of Blakely to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines is \nthreatening to undo 20 years of sentencing reform.\n  Twenty years after enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, we \nmust remind ourselves about the core values and principles that \naccounted for the bipartisan popularity of the original Federal \nGuidelines concept. The 1984 act was written and enacted against a \nhistory of racial, geographical, and other unfair disparities in \nsentencing. Congress sought to narrow these disparities while leaving \njudges enough discretion to do justice in the particular circumstances \nof each individual case. The task of harmonizing sentencing policies \nwas deliberately placed in the hands of an independent, expert \nSentencing Commission.\n  The Guidelines as originally conceived were about fairness, \nconsistency, predictability, reasoned discretion, and minimizing the \nrole of congressional politics and the ideology of the individual judge \nin sentencing. Blakely threatens a return to the bad old days of fully \nindeterminate sentencing when improper factors such as race, geography \nand the predilections of the sentencing judge could drastically affect \nthe sentence. While I favor Federal judges exercising their discretion \nin pursuit of individual justice in individual cases, I do not want to \nsee a return to the bad old days.\n\n  It may be that the Blakely decision was occasioned in part by recent \ntinkering with the Sentencing Reform Act that went too far. In recent \nyears, Congress has seriously undermined the basic structure and \nfairness of the Federal Guidelines system through posturing and \nideology. There has been a flood of legislation establishing mandatory \nminimum sentences for an ever-increasing number of offenses, determined \nby politics rather than any systemic analysis of the relative \nseriousness of different crimes. There has been ever-increasing \npressure on the Sentencing Commission and on individual district court \njudges to increase Guidelines sentences. The culmination of these \nunfortunate trends was the so-called Feeney Amendment to the PROTECT \nAct, in which this Congress cut the Commission out altogether and \nrewrote large sections of the Guidelines manual, including commentary, \nand in which Congress also provided for a judicial ``black list'' to \nintimidate judges whose sentences were insufficiently draconian to suit \nthe current Justice Department.\n  The Feeney Amendment was a direct assault on judicial independence. \nIt was forced through the Congress with virtually no debate and without \nmeaningful input from judges or practitioners. That process was \nparticularly unfortunate given that the Republican majority's \njustification for the Feeney Amendment--a supposed ``crisis'' of \ndownward departures--was unfounded. In fact, downward departure rates \nwere well below the range contemplated by Congress when it authorized \nthe Federal Sentencing Guidelines, except for departures requested by \nthe Government itself. But having a false factual predicate for forcing \nsignificantly flawed congressional action has become all too familiar \nduring the last few years.\n  The attitude underlying too many of these recent developments seems \nto be that politicians in Washington are better at sentencing than the \nFederal trial judges who preside over individual cases, and that longer \nsentences are always better. Somewhere along the line we appear to have \nforgotten that justice is not just about treating like cases alike; it \nis also about treating different cases differently.\n  These are issues that need to be examined in the future, in a \nthoughtful and deliberative fashion. The Sentencing Reform Act was the \nproduct of many years of work by members on both sides of the aisle. \nThe current Sentencing Guidelines reflect more than a decade of work by \nthe Sentencing Commission. If the Blakely decision ultimately requires \nsome modification of our Federal sentencing system, we must proceed \nwith extreme care. The last thing that any of us want is to risk making \nan already chaotic situation even worse by enacting ill-considered \nlegislation that is itself subject to constitutional attack.\n  The Department of Justice, the Sentencing Commission, and other \nexperts who testified before the Judiciary Committee have urged \nCongress not to act precipitously. I agree that corrective legislation \nis not immediately necessary and could be counter-productive, provided \nthat the Supreme Court expeditiously clarifies the scope of its Blakely \ndecision.\n  For these reasons, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch and other \nJudiciary Committee members in introducing a resolution regarding the \nBlakely decision. The words of the resolution are clear, unambiguous \nand unassailable: The Supreme Court of the United States should act \nexpeditiously to resolve the current confusion and inconsistency in the \nFederal criminal justice system by promptly considering and ruling on \nthe constitutionality of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Congress \nshould take up and pass this resolution without delay.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and any statements related to this matter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Con. Res. 130) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 130\n\n       Whereas Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 \n     to provide certainty and fairness in sentencing, avoid \n     unwarranted disparities among defendants with similar records \n     found guilty of similar offenses, and maintain sufficient \n     flexibility to permit individualized sentences when \n     warranted;\n       Whereas Congress established the United States Sentencing \n     Commission as an independent commission in the Judicial \n     branch of the United States to establish sentencing policies \n     and practices for the Federal criminal justice system that \n     meet the purposes of sentencing and the core goals of the \n     Sentencing Reform Act;\n       Whereas Congress has prescribed both statutory minimum and \n     statutory maximum penalties for certain offenses and the \n     Sentencing Reform Act authorizes the Sentencing Commission to \n     promulgate guidelines and establish sentencing ranges for the \n     use of a sentencing court in determining a sentence within \n     the statutory minimum and maximum penalties prescribed by \n     Congress;\n       Whereas the statutory maximum penalty is the maximum \n     penalty provided by the statute defining the offense of \n     conviction, including any applicable statutory enhancements, \n     and not the upper end of the guideline sentencing range \n     promulgated by the Sentencing Commission and determined to be \n     applicable to a particular defendant;\n       Whereas both Congress and the Sentencing Commission \n     intended the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to be applied as a \n     cohesive and integrated whole, and not in a piecemeal \n     fashion;\n       Whereas in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989), \n     the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the \n     constitutionality of the Sentencing Reform Act and the \n     Federal Sentencing Guidelines against separation-of-powers \n     and non-delegation challenges;\n       Whereas in Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), \n     the Supreme Court held that the sentencing guidelines of the \n     State of Washington violated a defendant's Sixth Amendment \n     right to trial by jury;\n       Whereas despite Mistretta and numerous other Supreme Court \n     opinions over the past 15 years affirming the \n     constitutionality of various aspects of the Guidelines, the \n     Blakely decision has raised concern about the continued \n     constitutionality of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines;\n       Whereas the Blakely decision has created substantial \n     confusion and uncertainty in the Federal criminal justice \n     system;\n       Whereas the lower Federal courts have reached inconsistent \n     positions on the applicability of Blakely to the Federal \n     Sentencing Guidelines;\n       Whereas there is a split among the circuit courts of appeal \n     as to the applicability of Blakely to the Federal Sentencing \n     Guidelines, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has \n     certified the question to the Supreme Court;\n       Whereas the orderly administration of justice in pending \n     and resolved trials, sentencings and plea negotiations has \n     been affected by the uncertainty surrounding the \n     applicability of the Blakely decision to the Federal \n     Sentencing Guidelines;\n       Whereas the current confusion in the lower Federal courts \n     has and will continue to produce results that disserve the \n     core principles underlying the Sentencing Reform Act;\n\n[[Page S8574]]\n\n       Whereas two and one-half weeks after the Supreme Court \n     issued its decision in Blakely, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee convened a hearing to consider the implications of \n     the decision for the Federal criminal justice system; and\n       Whereas the Department of Justice, the Sentencing \n     Commission, and others advised the Committee that corrective \n     legislation was not necessary at this time, with the hope \n     that the Supreme Court would clarify the applicability of its \n     Blakely decision to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in an \n     expeditious manner: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     Supreme Court of the United States should act expeditiously \n     to resolve the current confusion and inconsistency in the \n     Federal criminal justice system by promptly considering and \n     ruling on the constitutionality of the Federal Sentencing \n     Guidelines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/21/senate-section/article/S8574-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2694, S. 2695, AND H.R. 4492\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
