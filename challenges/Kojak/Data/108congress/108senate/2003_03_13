Mr. President, while reflecting on Dr. Ogilvie's tenure as \nSenate Chaplain, I came across a letter of his dated March 31, 1995. He \nwas just 3 weeks on the job. You could already see his devotion not \nonly to his official duties as Senate Chaplain, but his unofficial \nduties as the spiritual leader of the entire Senate family.\n  In that letter, he writes about the importance of interceding \n``personally'' for Senators--for praying for Members, for our families, \nand for our staff. He says that he is just as close as a phone call and \nprovides not only his work phone number, but his home phone number, as \nwell. He asks that we keep him up-to-date about the needs of others in \nthe Senate family. And he talks about building a ``caring network of \npeople who support each other.''\n  Yes, this is a man who knew early on the Senate needs more than one \nprayer at the start of each day. We needed a lot of support from him, \nfrom God, and from each other. And that is exactly the kind of \nspiritual climate Lloyd Ogilvie fostered for 8 years as Senate \nChaplain.\n  He conducted Bible studies--which Karyn and I and many in this \nChamber regularly attended. He hosted weekly prayer breakfasts and \nsmall faith groups. He researched theological questions and advised us \non the great moral issues of our times. And when he took time to offer \nhis own private thoughts to God, he always forwarded our petitions with \nhis.\n  He even filled in at the last minute when my office needed a third \nbaseman on our Senate softball team. Now that is going above and beyond \nthe call of duty.\n  Dr. Ogilvie consoled us during our darkest hours--September 11th, the \nOctober anthrax attacks, the loss of two Capitol Police officers and \nthree Senate colleagues come to mind. But he was also there for us \nevery day. To help us cope with the stress of our jobs. To help us \novercome struggles in our personal lives. And, most of all, to help us \nkeep things in perspective by reminding us we serve the United States \nin our offices, but we serve God in our lives.\n  So I simply want to say thank you to Dr. Ogilvie, for his many \nprayers on our behalf, for the many hours he dedicated to his position, \nand for being there--as the spiritual leader of the Senate family--\nevery day in the Chamber and every day in our lives.\n  And, lastly, I want to thank him for being such a wonderful and \nsupportive friend. I wish him the best in California with Mary Jane. \nAnd though Karyn and I will miss them both dearly, we are certain we \nwill hear from them because they will always be family. And there is \nnothing more precious to the Ogilvies--as they have demonstrated time \nand again--than family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in a few moments the Senate will offer a \nresolution which honors a member of our Senate family who, as the \nmajority leader noted, will be leaving us soon. Lloyd Ogilvie has the \nappreciation of every one of the Members of this body. I join in \nexpressing my heartfelt appreciation to him and his family as they \nbegin the next chapter in their lives.\n  A Senate chaplain was once asked: You pray for the Senate? He \nreplied, no, I look at those Senators as I stand on the dais and I pray \nfor the country.\n  For the last 8 years, Lloyd Ogilvie has done a lot of praying--for \nour Nation, for the Members of this Senate, and for our families, for \nour staffs, and all the people who work in this building, and for those \nwho come to visit the Senate from all over the world. He has prayed for \nus and with us. For many of us, he has been a source of guidance and \nsupport. We are grateful to him for his wisdom, for his friendship, and \nfor his service to this Senate and our Nation.\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\n  The Senate has been through many challenges these last 8 years, as \nthe majority leader has noted. During those challenges, many of us have \nfound hope and direction in Dr. Ogilvie's words. He comforted us and \nled us through the deaths of three of our colleagues, our friends John \nChafee, Paul Coverdell, and Paul Wellstone. He consoled us when two \nfine, brave members of the Capitol Police, officers J.J. Chestnut and \nDetective John Gibson, were murdered guarding this building. He helped \nus find courage and faith after our Nation was attacked on September \n11, and again after the anthrax attack that closed the Hart Building. \nHe has helped many of us grapple with the profound moral and spiritual \nquestions that underscore all questions of public policy.\n  One lesson Dr. Ogilvie has always stressed is the importance of \nkeeping our priorities straight. In his words: Put God first, then \nfamily, then Nation, then career, and things will turn out as they are \nmeant to.\n  Now Dr. Ogilvie is living that lesson. He is putting his family ahead \nof his career and returning to California to be with and care for \nanother treasured member of our Senate family, his wife Mary Jane. As \nmuch as we will miss him, we respect his decision greatly.\n  Everyone who knows Lloyd Ogilvie knows he has a special place in his \nheart for St. Andrew. That seems fitting for two reasons. The first and \nmost obvious reason is that St. Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland, \nand we all know how proud Dr. Ogilvie is of his family's roots in that \nbeautiful country. The other reason is St. Andrew never got the \nattention he deserved. In the Bible, it was Andrew's brother, Peter, \nwho got the headlines, even though it was Andrew who first recognized \nthat Jesus was an extraordinary teacher. It was Andrew who told Peter \nto pay attention to Jesus' words.\n  Here in the Senate, it is Senators who get most of the headlines. But \nfor many of us for the last 8 years it is Lloyd Ogilvie who has been \nthere to remind us of the important lessons.\n  Our thanks and our prayers will go to Lloyd Ogilvie as he returns to \nCalifornia. We wish him and Mary Jane, their children, Andrew, Scott \nand Heather, and their grandchildren, much happiness in the days, \nmonths, and years ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know a vote was scheduled and many wish to \nspeak, but I ask unanimous consent the vote may be delayed so I may \nspeak at this time. I feel compelled to ask for that time so I may \nspeak about our friend, Lloyd Ogilvie.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. The first time I heard Lloyd Ogilvie speak, it was in a \nprayer, and I remember looking up because I thought I had just heard \nwhat God's voice must sound like. What a magnificent voice he has. What \na magnificent prayer he always prayed. But as Benjamin Franklin said:\n\n       Well done is better than well said.\n\n  In spite of the magnificent messages he has delivered on this floor, \nhis prayers, and our private counsel sessions with him, what he has \ndone has been even more valuable; the way he has come to us all in \ntimes of great celebration and times of stress and times of despair. In \nthe good times and the bad times he has been there for me and for many \nof us--all of us, at one time or another. In spite of all the good \nthings he said, what he has done will be what will stay with us the \nlongest.\n  Each morning I get up, the first thing I read is ``One Quiet \nMoment,'' a passage from the Bible and a brief prayer that Lloyd \nOgilvie prepared for all of us. It begins my days in the right way. \nMany nights, just before I go to sleep, I pray for Lloyd and Mary Jane, \nI pray for their safety, and for their future.\n  He has been a magnificent influence on this body and on me \npersonally.\n  This morning I looked up the definition of ``chaplain,'' and it is \nnot enough to describe what he did. He wasn't just a person who was a \ncounselor to this institution and our whole family. I looked up \n``pastor''--maybe that was the right word. That wasn't sufficient \neither because he was more than just a pastor to a flock in a narrow \narea.\n  No, he has been a spiritual counselor in the broadest sense. The \nBible says, in Proverbs:\n\n       Where there is no vision the people perish.\n\n  That, of course, refers to the way we really should think about the \nvision. I think it is true for a country, a country that seeks \ndemocracy and freedom and liberty. But it also is true in the broader \nsense. Lloyd has given us a vision of what life is really about. Thank \nyou, Lloyd John Ogilvie. Well done--ay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3650-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3650-S3652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMENDING THE SERVICE OF DR. LLOYD J. OGILVIE, THE CHAPLAIN OF THE \n                          UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I send a resolution to the desk and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (Res. 83) commending the service of Dr. Lloyd \n     J. Ogilvie, the Chaplain of the United States Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we had the opportunity this morning to \nhear the last prayer of our Senate Chaplain, Lloyd Ogilvie, a man who \nhas touched each of our lives in a different and very special way. All \nof us in here have reached an age where if we took a few moments and \ntried to list the people outside of our immediate families who really \nhad an impact on us, it would probably be a pretty short list, if we \nwere candid with ourselves.\n  I have been doing a bit of that the last couple of days, thinking \nabout Lloyd, his contribution here, and the fact he is now going home \nto take up the challenge of providing care for his wonderful wife Mary \nJane.\n  I have decided my list would be very short, indeed, outside of my \nimmediate family. On that list would, indeed, be Lloyd Ogilvie, who has \nhad a powerful impact on my life. I will never, ever forget him.\n  We all love him and we care for him. Even though we will not see him \nas much in the coming years, I hope each of us for whom he has made \nsuch a difference will make an extra effort to stay in touch with our \ndear friend in the coming years.\n  So, Lloyd Ogilvie, thanks for all you did for all of us. Good luck in \nthe future. Thanks for making a difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I join the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky in saying a word about the Chaplain, Lloyd Ogilvie.\n  I am a new Senator, as is the Presiding Officer, and there have been \na great many wonderful things about coming to the Senate. But nothing \nhas surpassed the privilege of getting to know Lloyd Ogilvie in these \nfirst couple of months. I have watched him and listened, and I have \nlearned from him. I have been comforted by him. I am deeply grateful \nfor that.\n  This month in Billy Graham's publication, ``Decision,'' Lloyd \nOgilvie's picture is on the front, and there is an interview with him \nabout his 8 years in the Senate. It is a clue about why he has been \nsuch an inspiration to so many Senators. The questioner notes:\n\n       A current Senator remarked that your prayers often ``make \n     reference to specific turmoil'' in the Senate.\n\n  The questioner goes on:\n\n       I understand that sometimes following your opening prayer \n     you sit through the Senate sessions.\n\n  And Lloyd's answer was:\n\n       The task of any spiritual leader is to listen. You can't \n     minister to individuals or to a group unless you know what is \n     going on. That is the reason that I have to be there.\n\n  Lloyd Ogilvie has been a counselor. He is a minister. He is a \nlistener--maybe a listener above all. I have found in my conversations \nwith him that I suspect he knows more about the Senate than any other \nindividual because he knows the hearts of the Senators.\n  So I rise to thank him, to wish him the very best with his wife Mary \nJane, and to let him know that one more Senator has been touched by his \npresence here in a very short period of time.\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the interview \nwith Dr. Ogilvie that appears in the March 2003 edition of \n``Decision,'' the Billy Graham publication.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       After serving eight years as U.S. Senate Chaplain, Lloyd \n     John Ogilvie is retiring this month. He has provided \n     spiritual guidance to senators, to Senate staff and to \n     families during some of the most tumultuous events in the \n     history of the United States. Decision recently spoke with \n     Ogilvie about his Senate experiences and about where God is \n     leading him now.\n       Q: Describe a typical day in the life of Lloyd John \n     Ogilvie.\n       A: I usually get up around 6 a.m. and walk for my exercise. \n     As I walk around the Capitol, I pray for 20 senators each \n     day. I cover all 100 senators in a week. Often God puts on my \n     mind and heart people who have needs or concerns. Then, \n     during the day, I often have an opportunity to talk with \n     those people.\n       After walking, I have my own personal Bible study, and then \n     I walk to work. I live on the Hill--it's 10 minutes from my \n     breakfast table to the floor of the Senate. I give the \n     opening prayer for the Senate. I write the prayers in \n     segments, perhaps a month ahead of time, and as crises change \n     in the nation or in the world or in the life of the Senate, I \n     can change the prayers to that they are current and relevant.\n       The opening prayer is an extremely important part of my \n     day, because it is on the Senate floor that I speak a work \n     about God that is crucial to American history and to our \n     future. That word is sovereign. As I studied the prayers of \n     those who founded this nation, a word they frequently used \n     for God is Sovereign, because they came to this country \n     seeking a land where God could be the Sovereign of the land.\n       So very often in my prayers, I use the world sovereign in \n     describing God's nature and His lordship over this nation. \n     Then I pray for God's power and direction and specifically \n     for the needs that I know might be coming up that day.\n       I usually spend the rest of the morning in preparation for \n     my Bible studies. I have five Bible studies during the week: \n     for the senators, for senators' spouses, for the chiefs of \n     staff of the senators' offices, and two studies for the \n     Senate staff. It makes for a busy schedule, but I feel that \n     my task is to lower the plumb line of God's justice and \n     righteousness and mercy on the issues that we are facing in \n     the nation. And I can do that by teaching the Bible.\n       Q: How do you make the Gospel relevant to the issues that \n     our nation and world face?\n       A: I believe that the Holy Spirit, who inspired the writing \n     of the Scripture, is present in the room as I teach the \n     Scripture. That's awesome, when you stop and think of it. It \n     forces you to study and pray and get ready, because there is \n     a Word from the Lord, and He will speak through the \n     Scriptures if we are faithful to communicate them.\n       Q: What is one message that we need to hear today?\n       A: We need to know that God is the Sovereign of this \n     nation. We have a responsibility to trust Him, to seek His \n     will and to live in accordance with His righteousness and \n     justice.\n       As you trace U.S. history, it is fascinating to see how our \n     founders were very clear about wanting God to guide them. In \n     the First Continental Congress, Samuel Adams stood up and \n     said, ``I believe we need to pray,'' and they went down and \n     got the pastor of Christ Church Philadelphia to come to \n     Carpenters' Hall to pray. Then, when there were deadlocks in \n     the Constitutional Convention, crucial people stood up and \n     said, ``We cannot make it without God's power.''\n       Q: You have led the Senate spiritually during some \n     extremely trying times, including the impeachment hearings \n     and the Sept. 11 tragedy. What were those times like?\n       A: I can't imagine that in eight years we've been through \n     all of this. I think of the impeachment, for example, when it \n     was so important to reaffirm God's sovereignty and His grace. \n     As I was standing outside the Chamber, the senators and \n     leaders would go by and say, ``What are you going to pray \n     today?'' Then Chief Justice William Rehnquist would say, \n     ``What have you got to say to God today?'' Then at the end of \n     the prayer, he would give an ``Amen'' with gusto. But it was \n     a painful time. I'm so thankful that when the Senate leaders \n     got together prior to the impeachment, they opened their \n     meeting with prayer. Trent Lott was majority leader at that \n     time, and he constantly called them back to trust God.\n       Then, of course, the aftermath of Sept. 11 was a time of \n     helping people to realize that God has not caused that \n     tragedy. He did not send that on America in judgment. But it \n     did bring us to a place of asking what He had to say through \n     all of this.\n       We had the long process of healing and taking care of \n     people who were traumatized by that event. We had many \n     different services during that period. I remember one in \n     particular, when the senators went over to the National \n     Cathedral to take part in a time of prayer following 9/11. \n     I had the feeling that I should stay here at the Capitol; \n     the staff needed someone to take care of them. So I asked \n     for a large room that seated 300 people, and I made a \n     simple announcement that we would have a prayer time. When \n     I arrived, people were standing in the room, squeezed in \n     shoulder to shoulder. Instead of 300 people, there were \n     600 in the room and out in the hall. By the end, 1,000 \n     people had come.\n       Q: A current senator remarked that your prayers often \n     ``Make reference to specific turmoil'' in the Senate.\n       A: I feel that this is part of my responsibility as \n     chaplain. Answers to unasked questions are foolish, but \n     Biblical answers to the real questions people are asking are \n     powerful. It is our task to listen, to be sensitive to where \n     people are and then to respond to what's going on inside of \n     them and around them.\n       When the senators are under a great deal of pressure and \n     stress, I'll pray about that and talk about the pressure \n     cooker of politics. When they are at odds with each other, I \n     can ask God to bring understanding and peace for the good of \n     the American people and for His glory, and to help us depend \n     on Him to bring understanding, to break deadlocks.\n       Q: I understand that sometimes following your opening \n     prayer you sit through the Senate sessions.\n       A: The task of any spiritual leader is to listen. You can't \n     minister to individuals or to a group unless you know what is \n     going on. That is the reason that I have to be there. When I \n     sense there is great tension or frustration, I go down on the \n     floor, slip into the chair where I sit, and pray for those \n     who are in conflict. Afterwards, I often go to them \n     individually, talk with them about what's happened and see if \n     I can bring them together.\n       I am pleased when I see greatness emerge in the senators \n     and they reach beyond their parties and their own particular \n     persuasions to have deep communication with each other. I see \n     that in our Bible studies on Thursdays, when members of both \n     parties study the Scriptures together and try to come to \n     grips with what God might be saying.\n       Q: Our culture is heavily saturated with the message of \n     separation of church and state, but you have often said that \n     there is no separation of God and state. What do you mean?\n       A: There is no statement in the literature of U.S. history \n     that is more misunderstood than this phrase, ``separation of \n     Church and State.'' It was included in a letter by Thomas \n     Jefferson to the Danbury Baptists in Danbury, Conn. He was \n     trying to protect the church from government and was \n     establishing the fact that he was a different kind of leader \n     than the sovereigns of Europe. The phrase, however, stuck and \n     has been used to diminish the role of God in American life \n     and in politics.\n       I believe that there is no separation between God and \n     State. We need God in the affairs of government, and those \n     who are involved in leadership desperately need Him and His \n     guidance and direction. If we take God out of the affairs of \n     government, we are left to our human devices without the \n     empowerment that comes through a relationship with God.\n       I was very gratified when the Senate dealt with the recent \n     question raised about the phrase ``one nation under God.'' \n     All of the Senators were in their seats, and we gave the \n     Pledge of Allegiance together. No one was missing in \n     affirmation of the fact that they all really believe in this \n     historic declaration that we are a ``nation under God.''\n       Q: How can we pray for the Senators and their families?\n       A: Pray that they will know God, that they will trust God, \n     that they will depend on supernatural power rather than on \n     human talents, that they will pray for and receive the gift \n     of courage, and that they will speak with boldness and dare \n     to give the leadership that's necessary.\n       Q: What has led you to retire as Senate Chaplin on March \n     15?\n       A: My wife, Mary Jane, contracted a bad case of bacterial \n     pneumonia last April, and it lodged in some scar tissue in \n     her lungs from a previous cancer operation. They had such a \n     hard time getting that dislodged that in the process they had \n     to put her on a respirator. That was eight months ago, and \n     she has been in three different hospitals since then \n     struggling to get off the respirator, to get back to \n     breathing on her own and to get back to health.\n       I'm so thankful for the way she has trusted God in this \n     dark, dark valley of suffering. I realized that it would be \n     much better for her to be near our family in California. She \n     is in a respiratory hospital there that specializes in just \n     the kind of illness she has. I thought I would go back and \n     forth as frequently as I could and stay as long as I could, \n     but I realized this was not adequate. For eight years, I have \n     asked the senators to put God first, family second, the \n     Senate third and ambition fourth.\n       It was time for me to live any message. So I told the \n     officers of the Senate that I needed to be with my wife. Just \n     as soon as she's strong enough, I'll be available to preach \n     and to teach and to speak, here and around the world.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may before the Senator from \nTennessee leaves, he may not have been in the Senate very long--a \ncouple of months--but the Senator from Tennessee has picked up the \nessence of Lloyd Ogilvie and why he is so widely admired, respected, \nand loved around here.\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his contribution.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the retirement of our Senate Chaplain, \nLloyd Ogilvie, leaves me with a profound sense of loss. He has been a \npersonal friend to me, as well as a wise counselor and adviser. I know \nI will miss him greatly. He has served the Senate with great \ndistinction. His daily prayers were works of art and poetry, delivered \nin his deep rich voice, with conviction and a seriousness of purpose.\n  He has warmed our hearts with his genuine concern for our spiritual \nwell-being and reached out to touch the souls of staff members and \nSenate employees, as well, who sought his advice and his message of \nhope and reassurance. We have all been richly blessed by the presence \nand the ministry of Lloyd Ogilvie. Our thoughts and sincerest best \nwishes and our love go with him.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have been in the Senate more than 36 \nyears and there is no question that Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie has been the \nbest Senate Chaplain I've ever seen, by far. On this his last day, I \njoin my colleagues in thanking him for the spiritual care he has \nprovided to all of us and our families, and especially for his daily \nprayers as we tackle the monumental responsibilities before us.\n  My wife, Peatsy, and I pray for the health of his loving wife Mary \nJane. And we are confident that as the Chaplain leaves Washington and \nreturns to California good things await him. For in Psalm 92 it is \nwritten that the righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree and that \nin maturity they shall bring forth fruit and be full of vitality and \nrichness. There is no more worthy son of the Creator to flourish in \nretirement than Dr. Ogilvie.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to \nLloyd Ogilvie, our Chaplain. I have told him of the deep affection that \nI and my wife Joyce have for him and Mary Jane. I wish I could reach as \ndeeply into the writings of Robert Burns as he is able to and come up \nwith exactly the right epigram.\n  I will point out that he and I share the common experience of living \nin Scotland as young men. He, there while he was studying for the \nministry, and I, there while I was serving as a missionary for my \nchurch. In that experience, each of us gained deep respect for the \nScottish people and Scottish traditions.\n  That is why you find me today sporting the tartan of my family, the \nWallace tartan. My father served in this body as Wallace Bennett, \ncoming from a long line of Wallaces, including one William Wallace. \nWhether it was the William Wallace who morphed as Mel Gibson onto the \nsilver screen or not, I am not sure.\n  Lloyd Ogilvie has made his mark here in a tremendous way, and he \ndeserves all of the wonderful things everyone has said about him. I \nsimply quote a hymn that we sing often in our church. I don't think it \nis unique to our church, but we sing at this time when young men go out \nin the circumstance I have just described--go off to a foreign land or \nto a foreign part of the world to preach the gospel. We sing to them:\n\n       God be with you till we meet again;\n       When life's perils thick confound you;\n       Put His arms unfailing round you;\n       God be with you till we meet again.\n\n  This is what I say to Mary Jane and Lloyd Ogilvie, from all of us. \nGod be with you till we meet again.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of the \ncontributions and service to the Nation, the U.S. Senate, to my family \nand myself made by Dr. Lloyd J. Ogilvie as Chaplain of the U.S. Senate, \nI joined the U.S. Senate just over three months ago and I am repeatedly \nimpressed and reminded about the history and tradition of this body. \nThe Office of the Chaplain has served the Senate each day with prayer \nstrongly reaffirming this institution's commitment to faith in God and \nour recognition of God being the ultimate sovereign over this Nation. \nThe daily guidance and reminder of our Maker helps us all keep \nperspective on our duties and activities as we debate and make \ndecisions of weighty issues confronting our country.\n  The Chaplain of the Senate has been an integral part of the U.S. \nSenate since 1789 when the first Senate elected the first Chaplain. The \ndaily prayers of the Chaplains have been published over the years. In \ntimes of great turmoil and in times of the mundane the Chaplain reminds \nus of our obligation to keep the moral compass pointed in the right \ndirection. This body has been brought together in times of conflict \nwith the help of the Chaplain. Dr. Ogilvie has served us well as the \nsixty-first Chaplain since 1995.\n  Just last week the U.S. Senate passed a resolution reaffirming that \nthe term ``under God'' was an essential part of the pledge of \nallegiance. I am confident that Dr. Ogilvie could have contributed to \nour insight and debate. but there is no dispute that this body and this \nNation remain under the graceful guidance of God. We have been helped \nto understand this grace by the spiritual guidance of Dr. Ogilvie.\n  I have known of the Chaplain Ogilvie for longer than my service in \nthe U.S. Senate. My parents, Senator Frank Murkowski and Nancy \nMurkowski, share a warm and special relationship with Dr. Ogilvie and \nhis wife Mary. Through them I learned about Dr. Ogilvie and his \ncompassion and commitment to his faith. They join me in sending their \nprayers, best wishes and expressions of warmth to him upon his \nretirement.\n  Dr. Ogilvie will be missed by all his flock and all who know him in \nhis role as Chaplain in the U.S. Senate. He has served this institution \nin the tradition of this body with honor and excellence.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President. Eight years ago today, Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie \nbecame our Senate Chaplain. Today, as he leaves the Senate, I wish to \nthank Dr. Ogilvie for his spiritual guidance and friendship.\n  Dr. Ogilvie is a greet scholar and preacher. Yet he has been so much \nmore to our Senate family. I am particularly grateful for the \nhospitality Dr. Ogilvie has shown to all religions. He hosted Jewish \nseders. He invited Cardinals to the Senate. He made sure that religious \nleaders of all faiths have led the Senate in prayer.\n  I also appreciate the creative and energetic way he reached out to \nthe entire Senate family. He has led Bible study groups and prayer \nmeetings for Senators and staff. He has provided individual counseling \nfor anyone who has asked for it.\n  Since September 11, our Nation and our Senate have faced great stress \nand uncertainty. On September 11, during the anthrax attacks, and now \nas our Nation prepares for a possible war, Dr. Ogilvie has helped the \nSenate family to become stronger through faith and prayer.\n  I also wish to thank Reverend Ogilvie's wife, Mary Jane, who has been \nsuch an important partner to him and such a dear friend to all of us in \nthe Senate. I wish the Ogilvies well as they move to California to \nbegin a new chapter in their lives. They will always be in my thoughts \nand prayers.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 83) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 83\n\n       Whereas Dr. Lloyd J.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record prior to the vote on S. 3, four letters from specialists \nin maternal fetal medicine in response to the letter the Senator from \nCalifornia had printed in the Record yesterday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Rockford Health System, Division of Maternal-Fetal \n           Medicine,\n                                     Rockford, IL, March 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: I am writing to contest the letter \n     submitted to Senator Feinstein by Philip D. Darney, MD \n     supporting the ``medical exemption''; to the proposed \n     restriction of the partial birth abortion (or as abortionists \n     call it ``intact D'').\n       I am a diplomate board certified by the American Board of \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology in general Obstetrics and \n     Gynecology and in the sub-specialty of Maternal-Fetal \n     Medicine. I serve as a Visiting Clinical Professor in \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Illinois at Chicago, \n     Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Medicine \n     at Rockford, Rockford, Illinois; as an Adjunct Professor of \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology, at Midwestern University, Chicago \n     College of Osteopathic Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and \n     Gynecology; and as an Adjunct Associate Professor of \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology Uniformed Services University of \n     Health Sciences, F. Edward Herbert School of Medicine, \n     Washington, D.C. I have authored over 50 peer review articles \n     in the obstetrics and gynecologic literature, presented over \n     100 scientific papers, and have participated in over 40 \n     research projects,\n       In my over 14 years as a Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist \n     I have never used or needed the partial birth abortion \n     technique to care for my complicated or life threatening \n     conditions that require the termination of pregnancy. Babies \n     may need to be delivered early and die from prematurity, but \n     there is never a medical need to perform this heinous act.\n       I have reviewed both cases presented by Dr. Darney, and \n     quite frankly, do not understand why he was performing the \n     abortions he indicates, yet alone the procedure he is using. \n     If the young 25 year old woman has a placenta previa with a \n     clotting disorder, the safest thing to do would be to place \n     her in the hospital, transfuse her to a reasonable \n     hematocrit, adjust her clotting parameters, watch her closely \n     at bed rest, and deliver a live baby. If the patient had a \n     placenta previa, pushing laminaria (sterile sea weed) up into \n     her cervix, and potentially through the previa, is \n     contraindicated. It is no surprise to anyone that the patient \n     went, from stable without bleeding, to heavy bleeding as they \n     forcibly dilated her cervix to 3 centimeters with laminaria. \n     The use of the dangerous procedure of blinding pushing \n     scissors into the baby's skull (as part of the partial birth \n     abortion) with significant bleeding from a previa just \n     appears reckless and totally unnecessary.\n       Regarding the second case of the 38 year old woman with \n     three cesarean sections with a possible accreta and the risk \n     of massive hemorrhage and hysterectomy due to a placenta \n     previa, it seems puzzling why the physician would recommend \n     doing an abortion with a possible accreta as the indication. \n     Many times, a placenta previa at 22 weeks will move away from \n     the cervix so that there is no placenta previa present and no \n     risk for accreta as the placenta moves away from the old \n     cesarean scar. (virtually 99.5% of time this is the case with \n     early previas). Why the physicians did not simply take the \n     woman to term, do a repeat cesarean section with preparations \n     as noted for a possible hysterectomy, remains a conundrum. \n     Dr. Darney actually increased the woman's risk for bleeding, \n     with a horrible outcome, by tearing through a placenta \n     previa, pulling the baby down, blindly instrumenting the \n     baby's skull, placing the lower uterine segment at risk, and \n     then scraping a metal instrument over an area of placenta \n     accreta. No one I know would do such a foolish procedure in \n     the mistaken belief they would prevent an accreta with a D\n       Therefore, neither of these cases presented convincing \n     arguments that the partial birth abortion procedure has any \n     legitimate role in the practice of maternal-fetal medicine or \n     obstetrics and gynecology. Rather, they demonstrate how \n     cavalierly abortion practices are used to treat women instead \n     of the second medical practices that result in a live baby \n     and an unharmed mother.\n           Sincerely,\n     Byron C. Calhoun, MD.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: I have reviewed the letter from Dr. \n     Darney describing two examples of what he believes are high \n     risk pregnancy cases that show the need for an additional \n     ``medical exemption'' for partial birth abortion (also \n     referred to as intact D). I am a specialist in maternal-\n     fetal medicine with 23 years of experience in obstetrics. I \n     teach and do research at the University of Minnesota. I am \n     also co-chair of the Program in Human Rights in Medicine at \n     the University. My opinion in this matter is my own.\n       In the rare circumstances when continuation of pregnancy is \n     life-threatening to a mother I will end the pregnancy. If the \n     fetus is viable (greater than 23 weeks) I will recommend a \n     delivery method that will maximize the chance for survival of \n     the infant, explaining all of the maternal implications of \n     such a course. If an emergent life-threatening situation \n     requires emptying the uterus before fetal viability then I \n     will utilize a medically appropriate method of delivery, \n     including intact D\n       Though they are certainly complicated, the two cases \n     described by Dr. Darney describe situations that were not \n     initially emergent. This is demonstrated by the use of \n     measures such as dilation of the cervix that required a \n     significant period of time. In addition, the attempt to \n     dilate the cervix with placenta previa and placenta accreta \n     is itself risky and can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. \n     There may be extenuating circumstances in Dr. Darney's \n     patients but most obstetrical physicians would not attempt \n     dilation of the cervix in the presence of these \n     complications. It is my understanding that the proposed \n     partial birth abortion ban already has an exemption for \n     situations that are a threat to the life of the mother. This \n     would certainly allow all measures to be taken if heavy \n     bleeding, infection, or severe preeclampsia required \n     evacuation of the uterus.\n       The argument for an additional medical exemption is \n     redundant; furthermore, its inclusion in the legislation \n     would make the ban virtually meaningless. Most physicians and \n     citizens recognize that in rare life-threatening situations \n     this gruesome procedure might be necessary. But it is \n     certainly not a procedure that should be used to accomplish \n     abortion in any other situation.\n       Passage of a ban on partial birth abortion with an \n     exemption only for life-threatening situations is reasonable \n     and just. It is in keeping with long-standing codes of \n     medical ethics and it is also in keeping with the provision \n     of excellent medical care to pregnant women and their unborn \n     children.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steve Calvin, MD.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  Redmond, WA,\n\n                                                   March 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Rick Santorum:\n     U.S. Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: The purpose of this letter is to \n     counter the letter of Dr. Philip Darney, M.D. to Senator \n     Diane Feinstein and to refute claims of a need for an \n     exemption based on the health of the mother in the bill to \n     restrict ``partial birth abortion.''\n       I am board certified in Maternal-Fetal Medicine as well as \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology and have over 20 years of \n     experience, 17 of which have been in maternal-fetal medicine. \n     Those of us in maternal-fetal medicine are asked to provide \n     care for complicated, high-risk pregnancies and often take \n     care of women with medical complications and/or fetal \n     abnormalities.\n       The procedure under discussion (D, or intact dilation and \n     extraction) is similar to a destructive vaginal delivery. \n     Historically such were performed due to the risk of caesarean \n     delivery (also called hysterotomy) prior to the availability \n     of safe anesthetic, antiseptic and antibiotic measures and \n     frequently on a presumably dead baby. Modern medicine has \n     progressed and now provides better medical and surgical \n     options for the obstetrical patient.\n       The presence of placenta previa (placenta covering the \n     opening of the cervix) in the two cases cited by Dr. Darney \n     placed those mothers at extremely high risk for catastrophic \n     life-threatening hemorrhage with any attempt at vaginal \n     delivery. Bleeding from placenta previa is primarily \n     maternal, not fetal. The physicians are lucky that their \n     interventions in both these cases resulted in living healthy \n     women. I do not\n\n[[Page S3654]]\n\n     agree that D was a necessary option. In fact, a bad outcome \n     would have been indefensible in court. A hysterotomy \n     (caesarean delivery) under controlled non-emergent \n     circumstances with modern anesthesia care would be more \n     certain to avoid disaster when placenta previa occurs in the \n     latter second trimester.\n       Lastly, but most importantly, there is no excuse for \n     performing the D procedure on living fetal patients. Given \n     the time that these physicians spent preparing for their \n     procedures, there is no reason not to have performed a lethal \n     fetal injection which is quickly and easily performed under \n     ultrasound guidance, similar to amniocentesis, and carries \n     minimal maternal risk.\n       I understand the desire of physicians to keep all \n     therapeutic surgical options open, particularly in life-\n     threatening emergencies. We prefer to discuss the \n     alternatives with our patients and jointly with them develop \n     a plan of care, individualizing techniques, and referring \n     them as necessary to those who will serve the patient with \n     the most skill. Nonetheless I know of no circumstance in my \n     experience and know of no colleague who will state that it is \n     necessary to perform a destructive procedure on a living \n     second trimester fetus when the alternative of intrauterine \n     feticide by injection is available.\n       Obviously none of this is pleasant. Senator Santorum, I \n     encourage you strongly to work for passage of the bill \n     limiting this barbaric medical procedure, performance of D \n     on living fetuses.\n           Sincerely,\n     Susan E. Rutherford, MD.\n                                  ____\n\n         University of Southern California, Department of \n           Obstetrics and Gynecology,\n                                  Los Angeles, CA, March 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum, I am writing in support of the \n     proposed restrictions on the procedure referred to as \n     ``partial birth abortion,'' which the Senate is now \n     considering.\n       I am chief of the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine in \n     the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University \n     of Southern California in Los Angeles. I have published more \n     than 100 scientific papers and book chapters regarding \n     complications of pregnancy. I direct the obstetrics service \n     at Los Angeles County Women's and Children's Hospital, the \n     major referral center for complicated obstetric cases among \n     indigent and under-served women in Los Angeles.\n       I have had occasion to review the cases described by Dr. \n     Philip Darney, offered in support of the position that \n     partial birth abortion, or intact D, was the best care for \n     the patient in those situations. Mindful of Dr. Darney's \n     broad experience with surgical abortion, I nevertheless \n     disagree strongly that the approach he describes for these \n     two cases was best under the circumstances. Such cases are \n     infrequent, and there is no single standard for management. \n     However, it would certainly be considered atypical, in my \n     experience, to wait 12 hours to dilate the cervix with \n     laminaria while the patient was actively hemorrhaging, as was \n     described in his first case. Similarly, the approach to \n     presumed placenta acreta, described in the second case, is \n     highly unusual. Although the mother survived with significant \n     morbidity, it is not clear that the novel approach to \n     management of these difficult cases is the safest approach. \n     It is my opinion that the vast majority of physicians \n     confronting either of these cases would opt for careful \n     hysterotomy as the safest means to evacuate the uterus.\n       Although I do not perform abortions, I have been involved \n     in counseling many women who have considered abortion because \n     of a medical complication of pregnancy. I have not \n     encountered a case in which what has been described as \n     partial birth abortion is the only choice, or even the better \n     choice among alternatives, for managing a given complication \n     of pregnancy.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this opinion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           T. Murphy Goodwin, M.D,\n                       Chief, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom Dr. Daniel J.

Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum, I am writing in response to the \n     letter from Dr. Phillip Darney which was introduced by \n     Senator Feinstein.\n       I have cared for pregnant patient patients for almost 29 \n     years, and have worked exclusively in the field of Maternal-\n     Fetal Medicine (high risk pregnancy) for over 15 years. I am \n     board certified in Obstetrics & Gynecology, and also in the \n     subspecialty of Maternal-Fetal Medicine. I am an assistant \n     professor in Obstetrics & Gynecology for the Michigan State \n     College of Human Medicine, and co-director of Maternal-Fetal \n     Medicine in Saginaw Michigan.\n       I have never seen a situation in which a partial birth \n     abortion was needed to save a mother's life. I have never had \n     a maternal death, not ever.\n       I am familiar with Dr. Darney's letter describing two of \n     his cases. My comments are not meant as a criticism of Dr. \n     Darney as a person or as a physician. I have great respect \n     for anyone in our field of medicine, which is a very \n     rewarding specialty but which requires difficult decisions on \n     a daily basis. We are all working to help mothers and their \n     children make it through difficult pregnancies. Still, I do \n     disagree with his stand that the legal freedom to do partial \n     birth abortions is necessary for us to take good care of our \n     patients. For example, in the second case he describes, I \n     believe that patient could have carried the pregnancy much \n     further, and eventually delivered a healthy child by repeat \n     caesarean section followed by hysterectomy. Hemorrhage is \n     always a concern with such patients, but we have many \n     effective ways to handle this problem, which Dr. Darney knows \n     as well as I. Blood vessels can be tied off at surgery, blood \n     vessels can be occluded using small vascular catheters, cell-\n     savers can be used to return the patients own blood to them, \n     blood may be given from donors, pelvic pressure packs can be \n     used for bleeding following hysterectomy, and other blood \n     products (platelets, fresh frozen plasma, etc) can be given \n     to treat coagulation abnormalities (DIC). His approach of \n     placing laminaria to dilate the cervix in a patient with a \n     placenta praevia is not without it's own risk.\n       If Dr. Darney performed the partial birth abortion on this \n     patient to keep from doing another c-section, or even to \n     preserve her uterus, I'm hopeful he counseled the patient \n     that if she becomes pregnant again, she will once again have \n     a very high risk of having a placenta praevia and placenta \n     accreta.\n       Lastly, I believe that for some abortionists, the real \n     reason they wish to preserve their ``right'' to do partial \n     birth abortions is that at the end of the procedure they have \n     only a dead child to deal with. If they were to abort these \n     women by either inducing their labor (when there is no \n     placenta praevia present), or by doing a hysterotomy (c-\n     section), they then need to deal with a small, living, \n     struggling child--an uncomfortable situation for someone \n     who's intent was to end the child's life.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Daniel J. Wechter, M.D.,\n                           Co-Director of Maternal-Fetal Medicine,\n\n                               Synergy Medical Education Alliance.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 \nis not about a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. Regardless \nof one's views on abortion in general, the partial-birth abortion \nprocedure should have no place in a civilized society such as ours. \nPartial-birth abortion is an undeniably abhorrent procedure, and most \nphysicians believe it is never medically necessary. The American \nMedical Association, the largest association of doctors in the United \nStates, and the medical community at large, has endorsed banning this \nlate-term abortion procedure. It is time for the Congress to follow \nsuit.\n  Since 1995, at least 31 States have enacted laws banning partial-\nbirth abortion. On June 28, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated a \nNebraska statute that prohibited the performance of partial-birth \nabortions. The Supreme Court determined that the Nebraska statute was \nunconstitutional because it failed to include an exception to protect \nthe health of the mother, and because the language defining the \nprohibited procedure was too vague. We must not allow the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act to be diluted by amendments that would limit the \napplication of this bill to a time after a child is determined to be \nviable. Such language would allow this procedure to continue being \nperformed as late as the sixth month of pregnancy. Additionally, such \namendments would create loopholes allowing this cruel procedure to be \nused even as late as the third trimester of pregnancy, a time at which \nmany babies can sustain life outside the womb.\n  Passing the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act would prohibit any \nphysician or other individual from knowingly performing a partial-birth \nabortion, except when necessary to save the life of a mother who is \nendangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury. Experts have \nestimated that the partial-birth abortion procedure is used 3,000-5,000 \ntimes annually, and that the vast majority of these procedures are \nperformed on a healthy mother and a healthy fetus. The Physicians' Ad \nHoc Coalition on Truth--PHACT--a group of over 600 physicians-\nspecialists--has spoken out to dispute the claims that some women need \npartial-birth abortions to avoid serious physical injury. In September \n1996, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and other PHACT members \nsaid:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to \n     protect a mother's health or her\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\n     future fertility. On the contrary, this procedure can pose a \n     significant threat to both.\n\n  Banning partial-birth abortion has been addressed in every Congress \nsince the 104th session, and banned in both the 104th and 105th \nsessions. We now have a President in office who has vowed to sign this \nPartial-Birth Ban Act when it comes before him without hostile \namendments that would allow the continuance of this procedure. It is \nour moral duty to ban this repulsive practice once and for all, and it \nis my sincere hope that Congress will be able to finally pass the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support for the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.\n  As a father of five, a grandfather of nine, and a proud great-\ngrandfather, I regard life as a precious gift. During my tenure in the \nCongress--that is, since 1974--I have long supported policies that \nstand up for life and protect the unborn.\n  We made great strides in the 104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses on \nbanning partial-birth abortions. It was unfortunate that President \nClinton vetoed the ban. Not once, but twice.\n  Then, in 2000, the Supreme Court considered and struck down as \nunconstitutional the Nebraska State law making partial-birth abortion \nillegal. In Stenberg v. Carhart, the Court believed that the Nebraska \nlaw (1) did not contain an exception for the health of a mother, and \n(2) was too broad and could be construed to cover other types of \nprocedures. The bill before us specifically addresses the Supreme \nCourt's concerns.\n  I am disappointed and sickened that these abortion procedures are \nlegal in the United States of America. I'm not alone. According to a \nrecent Gallup poll, 70 percent of Americans want a ban.\n  My constituents want a ban on partial-birth abortions:\n  A woman from Tabor, IA, wrote, ``I'm horrified that under current \nlaw, thousands of partial-birth abortions are committed in America \nevery year.''\n  A man from Atlantic, IA wrote, ``I believe that when women would see \nthat they would be terminating a life then they would opt `no' to \nabortion.''\n  A woman from Nora Springs wrote, ``Abortions are actually murder \nbecause even though the child may not be out of the womb, it's still \ndeveloping into a person.''\n  A woman from Waverly, IA, wrote, ``Partial-birth abortions are never \nmedically necessary.''\n  A young man in the 6th grade from West Union, IA, wrote, ``A child \nmight die, and in the future that small child could grow up to create a \ncure for a disease, or be a fireman and save many lives. Just think, \nyou could have been aborted.''\n  It's time for us to stand up against such an extreme medical practice \nthat stops the beating heart of an unborn child.\n  Most medical professionals would agree that this specific abortion \nprocedure is outrageous. In fact, the American Medical Association \nsupported a ban in 1999.\n  You will hear many on the other side argue about a woman's health and \nreproductive rights. As the bill states, the physician credited with \ndeveloping the partial-birth abortion procedure has testified that he \nhas never encountered a situation where a partial-birth abortion was \nmedically necessary to achieve the desired outcome. His testimony \nwaters down their theory that this procedure is necessary in certain \nsituations to preserve the mother's health.\n  If we know that the procedure can pose a threat to both a woman's \nimmediate health and future reproductive capacity, why do you want to \nexpose women to the risks?\n  Condoning partial-birth abortion is bad medicine, and bad policy.\n  When abortion advocates say that abortion is a matter just between a \nwoman and her doctor, they are rejecting the rights of an innocent \nhuman being.\n  The unborn baby is alive from the moment of fertilization, the unborn \nbaby has a heartbeat at 3 weeks and brain waves at 6 weeks, the unborn \nbaby has 46 chromosomes in the cells of his or her body, the unborn \nbaby is a living human being.\n  Dr. Seuss said it just right: A person is a person, no matter how \nsmall.\n  Let's pass this bill to protect the innocent and unborn.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this legislation \nbecause I believe it is unconstitutional, and because its language is \nso broad that it effectively would ban standard and safe abortion \nprocedures. I am concerned that, if approved, this bill would not only \nundermine a woman's right to choose, but it would endanger the lives of \nthousands of women who no longer would have access to safe abortion \nprocedures when their health or their life is in jeopardy.\n  Before I go further, let me say that I fully understand the very real \nand legitimate concerns of those who support this legislation. The \nissue of abortion raises the most profound of moral and ethical \ndilemmas. These are emotional issues. They raise many hard questions. \nAnd the practical reality of abortion, all types of abortion, is hard \nfor all involved.\n  Speaking for myself, I support a woman's right to choose. And I \nsupport it strongly. As I see it, a decision about abortion generally \nshould be made by a woman and her doctor, not by politicians.\n  Having said that, I recognize that men and women of good faith can \nand will reach different conclusions about the difficult ethical \nquestions involved in the debate on this legislation. And, I share \nconcerns raised by many bill proponents about some of the most \ndisturbing examples of procedures conducted post-viability. That's why \nI intend to support an amendment to restrict such procedures. The \nlegislation I am supporting, however, is much more carefully crafted \nthan the underlying bill, and it complies with the constitution by \nproviding an exception where the health of the woman is at stake.\n  While I understand the genuine concerns of many advocates for this \nlegislation, the language of the bill actually goes well beyond a ban \non late-term abortions. In fact, its real effect would be to deny \nwomen's access to some of the safest abortion procedures at all stages \nof pregnancy. Because the legislation omits any mention of fetal \nviability, it bans abortions throughout all stages of pregnancy. And it \nbans one of the safest abortion methods--the ``intact D''--that is \nused when a woman's life and health are in danger and for severe fetal \nanomalies.\n  I hope my colleagues will think long and hard about the implications \nof the legislation before us. We need to be very careful to avoid \nreturning to a period in which abortion was illegal and the only choice \nwomen had was to seek an illegal and unsafe abortion. In those days, \nthousands of women died each year as a direct result of these legal \nprohibitions. And it would be tragic if this Congress were to forget \nthe lessons of that history.\n  It also would be unconstitutional. In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court \nheld that a woman has the right to choose legal abortion until fetal \nviability. States have the authority to ban abortion post-viability, so \nlong as exceptions are made to protect a woman's life and health. And, \nindeed, 41 States have chosen to ban postviability abortions in \ninstances in which a woman's life and health are not at stake. But, \nunder no circumstances do the Congress or the States have the authority \nto ban medical procedures that are essential to preserving a woman's \nlife or health, nor do they have the authority to completely ban access \nto abortion previability. This is a constitutionally protected right.\n\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader has brought to the Senate floor an \nabortion ban that has been struck down by courts in 21 States, \nincluding my State of New Jersey, and the Supreme Court. Based on that \nprecedent, there is little doubt that, if this bill is enacted, it also \nwill be struck down, and therefore it won't reduce the number of \nabortions at all. It makes you wonder: Why are we even spending our \ntime debating this legislation?\n  If we really are interested in reducing the number of abortions in \nthis country, we should ensure that all women have access to the full \narray of family planning services, including prescription \ncontraception, emergency contraception, and prenatal care. We also \nshould support an expansion of comprehensive sex education. I fully \nsupport the amendment offered by Senator Murray and Reid that would \nhave addressed these issues.\n\n[[Page S3656]]\n\n  Every week, 8,500 children in our country are born to mothers who \nlacked access to prenatal care. Too many of these children are born \nwith serious health problems because their mothers lacked adequate care \nduring their pregnancies. As a result, 28,000 infants die each year in \nthe United States. That, Mr. President, is the real tragedy. And we \nought to act immediately to address this issue by expanding access to \nprenatal care, as several of my colleagues and I have proposed.\n  What we should not do, however, is pass legislation that we know is \nunconstitutional, that would ban a common and safe form of abortion at \nall stages of pregnancy, and that would increase maternal mortality--\nall without improving the health of a single child.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record two letters, one from \nPhysicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, and the other from Mr. \nFelicia Stewart, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the \nUniversity of California. I believe these letters describe better than \nI the important medical reasons for voting against this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Physicians for Reproductive\n\n\n                                            Choice and Health,\n\n                                     New York, NY, March 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Jon S. Corzine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Corzine: We are writing to urge you to stand \n     in defense of women's reproductive health and vote against \n     S.3, legislation regarding so-called ``partial birth'' \n     abortion.\n       We are practicing family physicians; obstetrician-\n     gynecologists; academics in obstetrics, gynecology and \n     women's health; and a variety of other specialties in \n     medicine. We believe it is imperative that those who perform \n     terminations and manage the pre- and post-operative care of \n     women receiving abortions are given a voice in a debate that \n     has largely ignored the two groups whose lives would be most \n     affected by this legislation: physicians and patients.\n       It is misguided and unprincipled for lawmakers to legislate \n     decision-making in medicine. We all want safe and effective \n     medical procedures for women; on that there is no dispute. \n     However, the business of medicine is not always palatable to \n     those who do not practice it on a regular basis. The \n     description of a number of procedures--from liposuction to \n     cardiac surgery--may seem distasteful to some, and even \n     repugnant to others. When physicians analyze and refine \n     surgical techniques, it is always for the best interest of \n     the patient. The risk of death associated with childbirth is \n     about 11 times as high as that associated with abortion. \n     Abortion is proven to be one of the safest procedures in \n     medicine, significantly safer than childbirth, and in fact \n     saves women's lives.\n       While we can argue as to why this legislation is dangerous, \n     deceptive and unconstitutional--and it is--the fact of the \n     matter is that the text of the bill is so vague and \n     misleading that there is a great need to correct the \n     misconceptions around abortion safety and technique. It is \n     wrong to assume that a specific procedure is never needed; \n     what is required is the safest option for the patient, and \n     that varies from case to case.\n\n\n                               the facts\n\n       (1) So-called ``partial birth'' abortion does not exist.\n       There is no mention of term ``partial birth'' abortion in \n     any medical literature. Physicians are never taught a \n     technique called ``partial birth'' abortion and therefore are \n     unable to medically define the procedure.\n       What is described in the legislation, however, could ban \n     all abortions. ``What this bill describes, albeit in non-\n     medical terms, can be interpreted as any abortion,'' stated \n     one of our physician members. ``Medicine is an art as much as \n     it is a science; although there is a standard of care, each \n     procedure--and indeed each woman--is different. The wording \n     here could apply to any abortion patient.'' The bill's \n     language is too vague to be useful; in fact, it is so vague \n     as to be harmful. It is intentionally unclear and deceptive.\n       (2) Physicians need to have all medical options available \n     in order to provide the best medical care possible.\n       Tying the hands of physicians endangers the health of \n     patients. It is unethical and dangerous for legislators to \n     dictate the details of specific surgical procedures. Until a \n     surgeon examines the patient, she does not necessarily know \n     which technique or procedure would be in the patient's best \n     interest. Banning procedures puts women's health at risk.\n       (3) Politicians should not legislate medical decision-\n     making.\n       To do so would violate the sanctity and legality of the \n     physician-patient relationship. The right to have an abortion \n     is constitutionally-protected. To falsify scientific evidence \n     in an attempt to deny women that right is unconscionable and \n     dangerous.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \n     representing 45,000 ob-gyns, agrees: ``The intervention of \n     legislative bodies into medical decision making is \n     inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.''\n       The American Medical Women's Association, representing \n     10,000 female physicians, is opposed to an abortion ban \n     because it ``represents a serious impingement on the rights \n     of physicians to determine appropriate medical management for \n     individual patients.''\n\n\n                              the science\n\n       We know that there is no such technique as ``partial \n     birth'' abortion, and we believe this legislation is a \n     thinly-veiled attempt to outlaw all abortions. Those \n     supporting this legislation seem to want to confuse both \n     legislators and the public about which abortion procedures \n     are actually used. Since the greatest confusion seems to \n     center around techniques that are used after the first \n     trimester, we will address those: dilation and evacuation \n     (D), dilation and extraction (D), instillation, \n     hysterectomy and hysterotomy (commonly known as a c-section).\n       Dilation and evacuation (D) is the standard approach for \n     second-trimester abortions. The D is similar to first-\n     trimester vacuum aspiration except that the cervix must be \n     further dilated because surgical instruments are used. \n     Morbidity and mortality studies indicate D is preferable to \n     labor induction methods (instillation), hysterotomy and \n     hysterectomy because of issues regarding complications and \n     safety.\n       From the years 1972-76, labor induction procedures carried \n     a maternal mortality rate of 16.5 (note: all numbers listed \n     are out of 100,000); the corresponding rate for D was 10.4. \n     From 1977-82, labor induction fell to 6.8, but D dropped to \n     3.3 From 1983-87, induction methods had a 3.5 mortality rate, \n     while D fell to 2.9. Although the difference between the \n     methods shrank by the mid-1980s, the use of D had already \n     quickly outpaced induction.\n       Morbidity trends indicate that dilation and evacuation is \n     much safer than labor induction procedures and for women with \n     certain medical conditions, labor induction can pose serious \n     risks. Rates of major complications from labor induction, \n     including bleeding, infections, and unnecessary surgery, were \n     at least twice as high as those from D There are instances \n     of women who, after having failed inductions, acquired \n     infections necessitating emergency D as a last resort. \n     Hysterotomy and hysterectomy, moreover, carry a mortality \n     rate seven times that of induction techniques and ten times \n     that of D\n       There is a psychological component which makes D \n     preferable to labor induction; undergoing difficult, \n     expensive and painful labor for up to two days can be \n     extremely emotionally and psychologically difficult, much \n     more so than a surgical procedure that can be done in less \n     than an hour under general or local anesthesia. Furthermore, \n     labor induction does not always work: Between 15 and 30 \n     percent or more of cases require surgery to complete the \n     procedure. There is no question that D is the safest method \n     of second-trimester abortion.\n       There is also a technique known as dilation and extraction \n     (D). There is a limited medical literature on D because \n     it is an uncommonly used variant of D However, it is \n     sometimes a physician's preferred method of termination for a \n     number of reasons: It offers a woman the chance to see the \n     intact outcome of a desired pregnancy, to speed up the \n     grieving process; it provides a greater chance of acquiring \n     valuable information regarding hereditary illness or fetal \n     anomaly; and D provides a decreased risk of injury to the \n     woman, as the procedure is quicker than induction and \n     involves less use of sharp instruments in the uterus, \n     providing a decreased chance of uterine perforations or tears \n     and cervical lacerations. The American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists addressed this in their \n     statement in opposition to so-called ``partial birth'' \n     abortion when they said that D ``may be the best or most \n     appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save \n     the life or preserve the health of a woman, and only the \n     doctor, in consultation with the patient, based on the \n     woman's particular circumstances, can make this decision.\n       It is important to note that these procedures are used at \n     varying gestational ages. both D and D are options for \n     surgical abortion prior to viability. D and D are used \n     solely based on the size of the fetus, the health of the \n     woman, and the physician's judgment, and the decision \n     regarding which procedure to use is done on a case-by-case \n     basis.\n\n\n                            the legislation\n\n       Because this legislation is so vague, it would outlaw D \n     and D (and arguably techniques used in the first \n     trimester). Indeed, the Congressional findings--which go into \n     detail, albeit in non-medical terms--do not remotely \n     correlate with the language of the bill. This legislation is \n     reckless. The outcome of its passage would undoubtedly be \n     countless deaths and irreversible damage to thousands of \n     women and families. We can safely assert that without D and \n     D, that is, an enactment of S. 3, we will be returning to \n     the days when an unwanted pregnancy led women to death \n     through illegal and unsafe procedures, self-inflected \n     abortions, uncontrollable infections and suicide.\n       The cadre of physicians who provide abortions should be \n     honored, not vilified. They are heroes to millions of women, \n     offering the opportunity of choice and freedom. We urge you \n     to consider scientific data rather than partisan rhetoric \n     when voting on such far-\n\n[[Page S3657]]\n\n     reaching public health legislation. We strongly oppose \n     legislation intended to ban so-called ``partial birth'' \n     abortion.\n           Sincerely,\n       Nassim Assefi, MD, Attending, Women's Clinic and Adult \n     Medicine, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, WA.\n       Jonathan D.

Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I understand that you will be \n     considering Senate S. 3, the ban on abortion procedures, soon \n     and would like to offer some medical information that may \n     assist you in your efforts. Important stakes for women's \n     health are involved: if Congress enacts such a sweeping ban, \n     the result could effectively ban safe and common, pre-\n     viability abortion procedures.\n       By way of background, I am an adjunct professor in the \n     Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive \n     Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, \n     where I co-direct the Center for Reproductive Health Research \n     and Policy. Formerly, I directed the Reproductive Health \n     program for the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and served \n     as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs for the \n     United States Department of Health and Human Services. I \n     represented the United States at the International Conference \n     on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, Egypt, and \n     currently serve on a number of Boards for organizations that \n     promote emergency contraception and new contraceptive \n     technologies, and support reducing teen pregnancy. My medical \n     and policy areas of expertise are in the family planning and \n     reproductive health, prevention of sexually transmitted \n     infections including HIV/AIDS, and enhancing international \n     and family planning.\n       The proposed ban on abortion procedures criminalizes \n     abortions in which the provider ``deliberately and \n     intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus . . . for the \n     purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will \n     kill the partially delivered living fetus . . .'' The \n     criminal ban being considered is flawed in a number of \n     respects:\n       It fails to protect women's health by omitting an exception \n     for women's health;\n       It menaces medical practice with the threat of criminal \n     prosecution;\n       It encompasses a range of abortion procedures; and\n       It leaves women in need of second trimester abortions with \n     far less safe medical options: hysterotomy (similar to a \n     caesarean section) and hysterectomy.\n       The proposed ban would potentially encompass several \n     abortion methods, including dilation and extraction (d, \n     sometimes referred to as ``inact d), dilation and \n     evacuation (d), the most common second-trimester procedure. \n     In addition, such a ban could also apply to induction \n     methods. Even if a physician is using induction as the \n     primary method for abortion, he or she may not be able to \n     assure that the procedure could be effected without running \n     afoul of the proposed ban. A likely outcome if this \n     legislation is enacted and enforced is that physicians will \n     fear criminal prosecution for any second trimester abortion--\n     and women will have no choice but to carry pregnancies to \n     term despite the risks to their health. It would be a sad day \n     for medicine if Congress decides that hysterotomy, \n     hysterectomy, or unsafe continuation of pregnancy are women's \n     only available options. Williams Obstetrics, one of the \n     leading medical texts in Obstetrics and Gynecology, has this \n     to say about the hysterotomy ``option'' that the bill leaves \n     open: ``Nottage and Liston (1975), based on review of 700 \n     hysterotomies, rightfully concluded that the operation is \n     outdated as a routine method for terminating pregnancy.'' \n     (Cunningham and McDonald, et al, Williams Obstetrics, 19th \n     ed., (1993), p. 663.)\n       Obviously, allowing women to have a hysterectomy means that \n     Congress is authorizing women to have an abortion at the \n     price of their future fertility, and with the added risks and \n     costs of major surgery. In sum, the options left are less \n     safe for women who need an abortion after the first trimester \n     of pregnancy.\n       I'd like to focus my attention on that subset of the women \n     affected by this bill who face grievous underlying medical \n     conditions. To be sure, these are not the majority of \n     women who will be affected by this legislation, but the \n     grave health conditions that could be worsened by this \n     bill illustrate how sweeping the legislation is.\n       Take for instance women who face hypertensive disorders \n     such as eclampsia--convulsions precipitated by pregnancy-\n     induced or aggravated hypertension (high blood pressure). \n     This, along with infection and hemorrhage, is one of the most \n     common causes of maternal death. With eclampsia, the kidneys \n     and liver may be affected, and in some cases, if the woman is \n     not provided an abortion, her liver could rupture, she could \n     suffer a stroke, brain damage, or coma. Hypertensive \n     disorders are conditions that can develop over time or spiral \n     out of control in short order, and doctors must be given the \n     latitude to terminate a pregnancy if necessary in the safest \n     possible manner.\n       If the safest medical procedures are not available to \n     terminate a pregnancy, severe adverse health consequences are \n     possible for some women who have underlying medical \n     conditions necessitating a termination of their pregnancies, \n     including: death (risk of death higher with less safe \n     abortion methods), infertility, paralysis, coma, stroke, \n     hemorrhage, brain damage, infection, liver damage, and kidney \n     damage.\n       Legislation forcing doctors to forego medically indicated \n     abortions or to use less safe but politically-palatable \n     procedures is simply unacceptable for women's health.\n       Thank you very much, Senator, for your efforts to educate \n     your colleagues about the implications of the proposed ban on \n     abortion procedures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Felicia H.

Without objection, it is ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  The bill (S. 3), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                  S. 3\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares the following:\n       (1) A moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the \n     practice of performing a partial-birth abortion--an abortion \n     in which a physician delivers an unborn child's body until \n     only the head remains inside the womb, punctures the back of \n     the child's skull with a Sharp instrument, and sucks the \n     child's brains out before completing delivery of the dead \n     infant--is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never \n     medically necessary and should be prohibited.\n       (2) Rather than being an abortion procedure that is \n     embraced by the medical community, particularly among \n     physicians who routinely perform other abortion procedures, \n     partial-birth abortion remains a disfavored procedure that is \n     not only unnecessary to preserve the health of the mother, \n     but in fact poses serious risks to the long-term health of \n     women and in some circumstances, their lives. As a result, at \n     least 27 States banned the procedure as did the United States \n     Congress which voted to ban the procedure during the 104th, \n     105th, and 106th Congresses.\n       (3) In Stenberg v. Carhart (530 U.S. 914, 932 (2000)), the \n     United States Supreme Court opined ``that significant medical \n     authority supports the proposition that in some \n     circumstances, [partial birth abortion] would be the safest \n     procedure'' for pregnant women who wish to undergo an \n     abortion. Thus, the Court struck down the State of Nebraska's \n     ban on partial-birth abortion procedures, concluding that it \n     placed an ``undue burden'' on women seeking abortions because \n     it failed to include an exception for partial-birth abortions \n     deemed necessary to preserve the ``health'' of the mother.\n       (4) In reaching this conclusion, the Court deferred to the \n     Federal district court's factual findings that the partial-\n     birth abortion procedure was statistically and medically as \n     safe as, and in many circumstances safer than, alternative \n     abortion procedures.\n       (5) However, the great weight of evidence presented at the \n     Stenberg trial and other trials challenging partial-birth \n     abortion bans, as well as at extensive Congressional \n     hearings, demonstrates that a partial-birth abortion is never \n     necessary to preserve the health of a woman, poses \n     significant health risks to a woman upon whom the procedure \n     is performed, and is outside of the standard of medical care.\n       (6) Despite the dearth of evidence in the Stenberg trial \n     court record supporting the district court's findings, the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and the \n     Supreme Court refused to set aside the district court's \n     factual findings because, under the applicable standard of \n     appellate review, they were not ``clearly erroneous''. A \n     finding of fact is clearly erroneous ``when although there is \n     evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire \n     evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a \n     mistake has been committed''. Anderson v. City of Bessemer \n     City, North Carolina (470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985)). Under this \n     standard, ``if the district court's account of the evidence \n     is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, \n     the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced \n     that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have \n     weighed the evidence differently'' (Id. at 574).\n       (7) Thus, in Stenberg, the United States Supreme Court was \n     required to accept the very questionable findings issued by \n     the district court judge--the effect of which was to render \n     null and void the reasoned factual findings and policy \n     determinations of the United States Congress and at least 27 \n     State legislatures.\n       (8) However, under well-settled Supreme Court \n     jurisprudence, the United States Congress is not bound to \n     accept the same factual findings that the Supreme Court was \n     bound to accept in Stenberg under the ``clearly erroneous'' \n     standard. Rather, the United States Congress is entitled to \n     reach its own factual findings--findings that the Supreme \n     Court accords great deference--and to enact legislation based \n     upon these findings so long as it seeks to pursue a \n     legitimate interest that is within the scope of the \n     Constitution, and draws reasonable inferences based upon \n     substantial evidence.\n       (9) In Katzenbach v. Morgan (384 U.S. 641 (1966)), the \n     Supreme Court articulated its highly deferential review of \n     Congressional factual findings when it addressed the \n     constitutionality of section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of \n     1965. Regarding Congress' factual determination that section \n     4(e) would assist the Puerto Rican community in ``gaining \n     nondiscriminatory treatment in public services,'' the Court \n     stated that ``[i]t was for Congress, as the branch that made \n     this judgment, to assess and weigh the various conflicting \n     considerations. . . . It is not for us to review the \n     congressional resolution of these factors. It is enough that \n     we be able to perceive a basis upon which the Congress might \n     resolve the conflict as it did. There plainly was such a \n     basis to support section 4(e) in the application in question \n     in this case.'' (Id. at 653).\n       (10) Katzenbach's highly deferential review of Congress's \n     factual conclusions was relied upon by the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia when it upheld \n     the ``bail-out'' provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \n     (42 U.S.C. 1973c), stating that ``congressional fact finding, \n     to which we are inclined to pay great deference, strengthens \n     the inference that, in those jurisdictions covered by the \n     Act, state actions discriminatory in effect are \n     discriminatory in purpose''. City of Rome, Georgia v. U.S. \n     (472 F. Supp. 221 (D. D. Col. 1979)) aff'd City of Rome, \n     Georgia v. U.S. (46 U.S. 156 (1980)).\n       (11) The Court continued its practice of deferring to \n     congressional factual findings in reviewing the \n     constitutionality of the must-carry provisions of the Cable \n     Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. \n     See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Federal \n     Communications Commission (512 U.S. 622 (1994) (Turner I)) \n     and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Federal \n     Communications Commission (520 U.S. 180 (1997) (Turner II)). \n     At issue in the Turner cases was Congress' legislative \n     finding that, absent mandatory carriage rules, the continued \n     viability of local broadcast television would be ``seriously \n     jeopardized''. The Turner I Court recognized that as an \n     institution, ``Congress is far better equipped than the \n     judiciary to `amass and evaluate the vast amounts of data' \n     bearing upon an issue as complex and dynamic as that \n     presented here'' (512 U.S. at 665-66). Although the Court \n     recognized that ``the deference afforded to legislative \n     findings does `not foreclose our independent judgment of the \n     facts bearing on an issue of constitutional law,' '' its \n     ``obligation to exercise independent judgment when First \n     Amendment rights are implicated is not a license to reweigh \n     the evidence de novo, or to replace Congress' factual \n     predictions with our own. Rather, it is to assure that, in \n     formulating its judgments, Congress has drawn reasonable \n     inferences based on substantial evidence.'' (Id. at 666).\n       (12) Three years later in Turner II, the Court upheld the \n     ``must-carry'' provisions based upon Congress' findings, \n     stating the Court's ``sole obligation is `to assure that, in \n     formulating its judgments, Congress has drawn reasonable \n     inferences based on substantial evidence.' '' (520 U.S. at \n     195). Citing its ruling in Turner I, the Court reiterated \n     that ``[w]e owe Congress' findings deference in part because \n     the institution `is far better\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n\n     equipped than the judiciary to ``amass and evaluate the vast \n     amounts of data'' bearing upon' legislative questions,'' (Id. \n     at 195), and added that it ``owe[d] Congress' findings an \n     additional measure of deference out of respect for its \n     authority to exercise the legislative power.'' (Id. at 196).\n       (13) There exists substantial record evidence upon which \n     Congress has reached its conclusion that a ban on partial-\n     birth abortion is not required to contain a ``health'' \n     exception, because the facts indicate that a partial-birth \n     abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a \n     woman, poses serious risks to a woman's health, and lies \n     outside the standard of medical care. Congress was informed \n     by extensive hearings held during the 104th, 105th, and 107th \n     Congresses and passed a ban on partial-birth abortion in the \n     104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses. These findings reflect \n     the very informed judgment of the Congress that a partial-\n     birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a \n     woman, poses serious risks to a woman's health, and lies \n     outside the standard of medical care, and should, therefore, \n     be banned.\n       (14) Pursuant to the testimony received during extensive \n     legislative hearings during the 104th, 105th, and 107th \n     Congresses, Congress finds and declares that:\n       (A) Partial-birth abortion poses serious risks to the \n     health of a woman undergoing the procedure. Those risks \n     include, among other things: an increase in a woman's risk of \n     suffering from cervical incompetence, a result of cervical \n     dilation making it difficult or impossible for a woman to \n     successfully carry a subsequent pregnancy to term; an \n     increased risk of uterine rupture, abruption, amniotic fluid \n     embolus, and trauma to the uterus as a result of converting \n     the child to a footling breech position, a procedure which, \n     according to a leading obstetrics textbook, ``there are very \n     few, if any, indications for . . . other than for delivery of \n     a second twin''; and a risk of lacerations and secondary \n     hemorrhaging due to the doctor blindly forcing a sharp \n     instrument into the base of the unborn child's skull while he \n     or she is lodged in the birth canal, an act which could \n     result in severe bleeding, brings with it the threat of \n     shock, and could ultimately result in maternal death.\n       (B) There is no credible medical evidence that partial-\n     birth abortions are safe or are safer than other abortion \n     procedures. No controlled studies of partial-birth abortions \n     have been conducted nor have any comparative studies been \n     conducted to demonstrate its safety and efficacy compared to \n     other abortion methods. Furthermore, there have been no \n     articles published in peer-reviewed journals that establish \n     that partial-birth abortions are superior in any way to \n     established abortion procedures. Indeed, unlike other more \n     commonly used abortion procedures, there are currently no \n     medical schools that provide instruction on abortions that \n     include the instruction in partial-birth abortions in their \n     curriculum.\n       (C) A prominent medical association has concluded that \n     partial-birth abortion is ``not an accepted medical \n     practice,'' that it has ``never been subject to even a \n     minimal amount of the normal medical practice development,'' \n     that ``the relative advantages and disadvantages of the \n     procedure in specific circumstances remain unknown,'' and \n     that ``there is no consensus among obstetricians about its \n     use''. The association has further noted that partial-birth \n     abortion is broadly disfavored by both medical experts and \n     the public, is ``ethically wrong,'' and ``is never the only \n     appropriate procedure''.\n       (D) Neither the plaintiff in Stenberg v. Carhart, nor the \n     experts who testified on his behalf, have identified a single \n     circumstance during which a partial-birth abortion was \n     necessary to preserve the health of a woman.\n       (E) The physician credited with developing the partial-\n     birth abortion procedure has testified that he has never \n     encountered a situation where a partial-birth abortion was \n     medically necessary to achieve the desired outcome and, thus, \n     is never medically necessary to preserve the health of a \n     woman.\n       (F) A ban on the partial-birth abortion procedure will \n     therefore advance the health interests of pregnant women \n     seeking to terminate a pregnancy.\n       (G) In light of this overwhelming evidence, Congress and \n     the States have a compelling interest in prohibiting partial-\n     birth abortions. In addition to promoting maternal health, \n     such a prohibition will draw a bright line that clearly \n     distinguishes abortion and infanticide, that preserves the \n     integrity of the medical profession, and promotes respect for \n     human life.\n       (H) Based upon Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)) and \n     Planned Parenthood v. Casey (505 U.S. 833 (1992)), a \n     governmental interest in protecting the life of a child \n     during the delivery process arises by virtue of the fact that \n     during a partial-birth abortion, labor is induced and the \n     birth process has begun. This distinction was recognized in \n     Roe when the Court noted, without comment, that the Texas \n     parturition statute, which prohibited one from killing a \n     child ``in a state of being born and before actual birth,'' \n     was not under attack. This interest becomes compelling as the \n     child emerges from the maternal body. A child that is \n     completely born is a full, legal person entitled to \n     constitutional protections afforded a ``person'' under the \n     United States Constitution. Partial-birth abortions involve \n     the killing of a child that is in the process, in fact mere \n     inches away from, becoming a ``person''. Thus, the government \n     has a heightened interest in protecting the life of the \n     partially-born child.\n       (I) This, too, has not gone unnoticed in the medical \n     community, where a prominent medical association has \n     recognized that partial-birth abortions are ``ethically \n     different from other destructive abortion techniques because \n     the fetus, normally twenty weeks or longer in gestation, is \n     killed outside of the womb''. According to this medical \n     association, the `` `partial birth' gives the fetus an \n     autonomy which separates it from the right of the woman to \n     choose treatments for her own body''.\n       (J) Partial-birth abortion also confuses the medical, \n     legal, and ethical duties of physicians to preserve and \n     promote life, as the physician acts directly against the \n     physical life of a child, whom he or she had just delivered, \n     all but the head, out of the womb, in order to end that life. \n     Partial-birth abortion thus appropriates the terminology and \n     techniques used by obstetricians in the delivery of living \n     children--obstetricians who preserve and protect the life of \n     the mother and the child--and instead uses those techniques \n     to end the life of the partially-born child.\n       (K) Thus, by aborting a child in the manner that \n     purposefully seeks to kill the child after he or she has \n     begun the process of birth, partial-birth abortion undermines \n     the public's perception of the appropriate role of a \n     physician during the delivery process, and perverts a process \n     during which life is brought into the world, in order to \n     destroy a partially-born child.\n       (L) The gruesome and inhumane nature of the partial-birth \n     abortion procedure and its disturbing similarity to the \n     killing of a newborn infant promotes a complete disregard for \n     infant human life that can only be countered by a prohibition \n     of the procedure.\n       (M) The vast majority of babies killed during partial-birth \n     abortions are alive until the end of the procedure. It is a \n     medical fact, however, that unborn infants at this stage can \n     feel pain when subjected to painful stimuli and that their \n     perception of this pain is even more intense than that of \n     newborn infants and older children when subjected to the same \n     stimuli. Thus, during a partial-birth abortion procedure, the \n     child will fully experience the pain associated with piercing \n     his or her skull and sucking out his or her brain.\n       (N) Implicitly approving such a brutal and inhumane \n     procedure by choosing not to prohibit it will further coarsen \n     society to the humanity of not only newborns, but all \n     vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly \n     difficult to protect such life. Thus, Congress has a \n     compelling interest in acting--indeed it must act--to \n     prohibit this inhumane procedure.\n       (O) For these reasons, Congress finds that partial-birth \n     abortion is never medically indicated to preserve the health \n     of the mother; is in fact unrecognized as a valid abortion \n     procedure by the mainstream medical community; poses \n     additional health risks to the mother; blurs the line between \n     abortion and infanticide in the killing of a partially-born \n     child just inches from birth; and confuses the role of the \n     physician in childbirth and should, therefore, be banned.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Partial-birth abortions...................................1531''.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING ROE V. WADE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) abortion has been a legal and constitutionally \n     protected medical procedure throughout the United States \n     since the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 \n     (1973)); and\n       (2) the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade \n     established constitutionally based limits on the power of \n     States to restrict the right of a woman to choose to \n     terminate a pregnancy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade (410 \n     U.S. 113 (1973)) was appropriate and secures an important \n     constitutional right; and\n       (2) such decision should not be overturned.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to applaud this body for \npassing S. 3, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. I know the \npeople of my home State of Utah share my sentiments because they \nrecognize, as I do, that the practice of partial-birth abortion is \nimmoral, offensive and impossible to justify. This procedure is so \nheinous that even many that consider themselves pro-choice cannot \ndefend it.\n  While we have passed a similar measure before, it was never certain \nto be signed into law. Today it is. It saddens me that this legislation \nwas even necessary, and even more that it took 7 years to achieve. I \nthank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his outstanding leadership in \nbringing this about. I hope he knows he has my admiration and respect.\n  Basic human decency has prevailed. I pray that never again will it be \nlegal in this country to perform this barbaric procedure. \nUnfortunately, I am sure that opponents of this measure will seek to \nchallenge the law in court--where I hope good judgment will ultimately \nprevail. Even in Stenberg v. Carhart the Supreme Court confirmed, and I \nquote, ``By no means must physicians [be granted] `unfettered \ndiscretion' in their selection of abortion methods.''\n  There are those who consider every type of abortion sacrosanct and \nwill oppose any effort to apply commonsense reasoning to the debate. I \ndon't know how to get through to these people, except by forcing them \nto witness this barbaric procedure. A baby is almost fully delivered \nwith only her head remaining inside the birth canal when the doctor \nstabs scissors into the base of her skull to open a hole through which \nhe then sucks out her brain and collapses her skull. I honestly don't \nknow how anyone can avoid being truly sickened when they see a baby \nbeing killed in this gruesome manner. It is not done on a mass of \ntissue but to a living baby capable of feeling pain and, at the time \nthis procedure is typically performed, capable of living outside of the \nwomb.\n  All this bill would do is ban this one procedure. We are not talking \nabout the entire framework of abortion rights here, but just one \nprocedure. The fact is that there is no medical need to allow this type \nof procedure. It is never medically necessary, it is never the safest \nprocedure available, and it is morally reprehensible and \nunconscionable.\n  In recent years, we have heard about teenaged girls giving birth and \nthen dumping their newborns into trash cans. One young woman was \ncriminally charged after giving birth to a child in a bathroom stall \nduring her prom, and then strangling and suffocating her child before \nleaving the body in the trash. Tragically, there have been several \nsimilar incidents around the country in the past few years.\n  This is what happens, when we continue to devalue human life.\n  William Raspberry argued in a column in the Washington Post several \nyears ago that ``only a short distance [exists] between what [these \nteenagers] have been sentenced for doing and what doctors get paid to \ndo.'' How right he is.\n  When you think about it, it's incredible that there is a mere 3 \ninches separating a partial-birth abortion from murder.\n  Partial-birth abortion simply has no place in our society and rightly \nshould be banned. President Bush has described partial-birth abortion \nas ``an abhorrent procedure that offends human dignity.'' I \nwholeheartedly agree.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, few issues divide our country more \nmarkedly than the issue of abortion. This debate is a difficult one, \nand I commend those on both sides of the issue who have given their \ntime on the floor to express their very deeply held views on this \nmatter. While the debate has had some unfortunate low points, it has \nalso had some very high ones.\n  In particular, I commend those on the Democratic side Senators Boxer, \nMurray, Durbin, Harkin, and Feinstein--who have helped manage the floor \nthis week. Each of them has worked diligently to ensure these difficult \nissues were given the honest, constructive attention they deserve. I \nknow very well how thankless that job can be, and I am grateful for \ntheir efforts.\n  I am personally opposed to abortion, and I oppose Federal funding of \nabortion except in cases of rape, incest, or medical necessity. Far too \nmany abortions are performed in this country, and I want to do \neverything reasonable to discourage abortion.\n  That is why I support efforts to facilitate and promote adoption as \nan alternative to abortion, and that is why I support voluntary family \nplanning, including improved access to contraception and research on \nimproved contraceptive options for both men and women. That is why I \nsupported Senator Murray's amendment.\n  Every abortion is a tragedy. But I recognize that there are \nextraordinary medical circumstances that make abortion necessary to \nsave the mother's life or prevent grave harm to her health.\n  I also recognize and respect the Supreme Court's clear message on \nabortion stated first in the landmark Roe v. Wade decision and later in \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey.\n  The Court consistently upheld two basic tenets. First, before the \nstage of fetal viability--when the fetus is capable of living outside \nthe womb with or without life support--a woman has a constitutional \nright to choose whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. Second, a \nwoman's health must be protected throughout her pregnancy.\n  The Court has not, as the junior Senator from Pennsylvania has \nwrongly suggested, endorsed ``abortion anywhere at any time.'' In \nCasey, the Court clearly drew a distinction between abortions performed \nbefore fetal viability and those performed after viability, clearly \nallowing the Government to restrict abortion after fetal viability.\n  While I am deeply troubled by the procedure described in S. 3, and \nvoted again to ban it, I have real concerns that S. 3 is not the most \neffective means of limiting the late-term abortions the bill's sponsors \nclaim to target.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I would prefer to ban all post-viability \nabortions, regardless of the procedure used. In 1997, in an effort to \nfind a constitutional compromise that would actually stop far more \nabortions than the bill we have been debating today, I offered\n\n[[Page S3661]]\n\na broader ban much like the one offered by the Senator from Illinois \nyesterday.\n  The Durbin amendment, like the earlier Daschle amendment, banned all \npost-viability abortions, allowing an exception only if an abortion is \nabsolutely necessary to protect the mother.\n  An ironic fact that the sponsors of S. 3 don't readily acknowledge is \nthat, if their statements are accurate, S. 3 will not stop a single \nabortion. In contrast, the Durbin amendment would stop all post-\nviability abortions except those that are absolutely medically \nnecessary. This may seem counterintuitive, so let me explain why this \nis true.\n  The sponsors of S. 3 answer the Supreme Court's concern that their \nlegislation is too vague to meet constitutional muster by claiming that \ntheir legislation bans only one procedure and that it is clearly \ndefined. They also claim that the ban does not restrict a woman's \nCourt-affirmed right to choose because all other abortion procedures \nare allowed under S. 3. Finally, they claim their legislation avoids \nthe Court's concerns about protecting the life and health of the mother \nbecause the procedure described in their legislation is never necessary \nto protect the mother; thus, other available procedures could be \nemployed interchangeably.\n  If all those statements are true and I confess I am not confident \nthat they are--then S. 3 will not stop a single abortion; it will \nmerely cause women and doctors to choose a different abortion \nprocedure. While I am deeply disturbed by this procedure, I oppose any \nunnecessary abortion once a fetus becomes viable.\n  If our true desire is to protect viable fetuses whenever possible, I \nthink we can do better than S. 3.\n  An across-the-board ban on all post-viability procedures with a \nconstitutional life and health exception is the only way to achieve \nthat broader goal, and I deeply regret that the Senate has yet again \nfailed to do so. It is a principle that would win the support of the \nAmerican people and the Supreme Court, and it would actually reduce the \nnumber of abortions in this country. Yesterday's outcome is one I will \nnever understand.\n  There is yet another reason S. 3 may fail to meet its objective. The \nSupreme Court has struck down what many experts claim is a ``legally \nidentical'' bill, the Nebraska law banning this procedure. In previous \nCongresses, I have expressed my concern that this legislation may not \nwithstand an inevitable constitutional challenge.\n  Now that the Court has ruled in the Nebraska case, that concern is \neven greater. But the sponsors of this bill have chosen to take that \ngamble, claiming their ``20 word changes'' have resolved the \nconstitutional concerns. Those 20 words, by the way, are allegedly \npowerful enough to change the outcome in the Supreme Court, but not \nsignificant enough to merit a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n  If the sponsors of S. 3 are wrong, then this week's exercise will \nserve only to delay meaningful progress toward restrictions on not only \nthis procedure, but all post-viability abortions. It will also fuel the \nunnecessary bitterness surrounding this debate.\n  At this point, it is my hope that this Senate bill will go quickly to \nthe President so that the Supreme Court can rule on it. If the Court \nstrikes it down, then I hope people on both sides of this issue will be \nwilling to work together to stop all post-viability abortions except \nthose that are absolutely necessary to protect a woman's life and \nhealth.\n  Finally, I want to say a few words about the women whose lives are \nimpacted by our actions this week. One of the saddest aspects of this \ndebate is the suggestion that countless women, for frivolous reasons, \nare choosing unnecessary abortions in the last few weeks of their \npregnancies. That just isn't true.\n  Anyone willing to listen has heard the tragic stories of women and \nfamilies who have had to terminate their pregnancies either because \ntheir own health was threatened, or their child was the victim of \nsevere fetal anomalies often inconsistent with life outside the womb. \nThese are not unwanted pregnancies, and these are not abortions of \nconvenience.\n  Regardless of one's ultimate decision on this legislation, I hope \nthat in the future the Senate will show greater respect for these women \nand the tragic circumstances they have faced. As they have so \npoignantly said, you or someone you love could face similar \ncircumstances, and you would deserve better than these women and their \nfamilies have gotten.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wanted to discuss my votes on S. 3 and \nits amendments. I have long supported a ban on late term abortions. \nHowever, S. 3 would not do that because it would be struck down by the \nU.S. Supreme Court because it does not contain a health exception. Both \nin 1973 and in 2001, the Supreme Court ruled that a government may \nregulate late term abortions with an exception to both life and health \nof the woman. The Court specifically ruled in the 2001 decision in \nCarhart--that Nebraska's law was too vague and did not contain the \nrequired health exception. Therefore, I supported the amendments \noffered by Senator Feinstein and Senator Durbin to ban late term \nabortions because they both contained the requisite health exceptions, \nand which I believe the Supreme Court would uphold.\n  I am also pleased the Senate passed my amendment, 52 to 46, affirming \nRoe v. Wade. A woman's constitutional right to make a private decision \nin these matters is no more negotiable than the freedom to speak or the \nfreedom to worship. As a father, I have struggled with this issue. \nHowever, I do not believe that it is appropriate to insist that my \npersonal views be the law of the land.\n  So what should Congress do? Pass a late term abortion ban that the \nSupreme Court will uphold; increase funding for family planning and \nabstinence-only education and mandate insurance coverage for \ncontraception. All of these fall within the rules under Roe v. Wade--\nthat established a woman's fundamental right to choose.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senate had an opportunity this week to \nfind common ground on an issue that has too often been an ideological \nbattleground: abortion.\n  As the Senate debated the partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, I \ncosponsored a bipartisan amendment authored by Senator Durbin that \ncould have actually reduced the number of abortions in our country \nwhile at the same time protecting a woman's life, health, and her \nconstitutional right to choose. While the amendment was defeated, I \nremain hopeful that it will ultimately prevail someday as the most \nsound and moderate approach to addressing the troubling issue of late-\nterm abortions.\n  The Durbin amendment struck a reasonable middle-ground approach on an \nissue that has frequently been dominated by the extremes. There are \nthose who would universally ban all abortions. Others would universally \nallow all abortions. I respect the views of the people in each camp, \nbut I disagree with them both.\n  Abortions ought to be legal, safe, and rare. That is my fundamental \nview, and it's the view that the Supreme Court has affirmed and \nreaffirmed for the past three decades since its decision in Roe vs. \nWade. Abortions have never been--and should not be-- available at any \ntime for any reason. As Roe held, once a fetus achieves the point of \nviability, abortions may be regulated, but States must allow abortions \nto preserve a woman's life or health.\n  Forty-one States have already enshrined this standard, or one like \nit, into their State statutes. The Durbin amendment would have written \nit into Federal law. It would have respected a woman's constitutional \nright to choose while appropriately curbing choice after the point of \nviability where abortions are only necessary to preserve a woman's life \nor health.\n  This proposal was reasonable, it was constitutional and sensitive to \nthe wrenching circumstances that families typically face when they must \ncontemplate a late-term abortion. Unfortunately, it was adamantly \nopposed by those seeking a ban on so-called partial-birth abortions. \nTheir proposal had two serious flaws that made it impossible for me to \nsupport.\n  First, the ban on partial-birth abortions bans just one medical \nprocedure. It will not stop all late-term abortions from being \nperformed, because an alternative procedure might be found. The Durbin \namendment, on the other hand, would have limited all constitutionally-\nunprotected abortions without regard to a specific procedure. Why?\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\nBecause the wisdom of using a given medical procedure is best left with \nmedical professionals. We are legislators, not doctors.\n  Second, the partial-birth ban contained in this legislation will not \nprotect a woman's health. The few women who might require this \nprocedure to protect their health from severe injury will be completely \nbarred from receiving it. A pregnancy gone awry is a tragedy. The \npartial-birth abortion ban will only compound that tragedy by forcing a \nwoman to forego a safer procedure.\n  The partial-birth abortion ban, as its supporters readily admit, is \nintended not to find common ground and reduce unnecessary abortions, \nbut to lead to a ban of any and all abortions in America--regardless of \nwhether they are needed to protect a woman's life and health. I find \nthis argument simply unacceptable and blatantly unconstitutional in \nlight of Roe vs. Wade. Therefore, it is for this reason and the reasons \nstated above that I voted against final passage of the Partial Birth \nAbortion Ban Act of 2003.\n  While the Durbin amendment would not have ended the national debate \nover abortion, it respected the deeply held views of people on both \nsides of this issue. It offered the Senate and our country an \nopportunity--not to debate our differences, but to affirm our \nsimilarities. It would have allowed us to come together in a bipartisan \nfashion, pro-life and pro-choice--and offer something that would have \nreduced the number of abortions while preserving a woman's life, health \nand constitutional freedom.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to talk about the debate in \nthe Senate this week regarding late-term abortion. I am a strong \nopponent of late-term abortions, and I know many Americans find them as \ndeeply troubling as I do.\n  As I have done in the past, I voted this week to support a \ncomprehensive ban on late-term abortions. The comprehensive ban I \nsupported--offered as an amendment by Senator Durbin would have put an \nend to all late-term post-viability abortions, unlike Senator \nSantorum's proposal, including but not limited to those performed using \nthe procedure known as ``partial birth.'' The Durbin ban also would \nhave included a very narrow exception for the rare case when a woman's \nlife or health is threatened by a troubled pregnancy, as required by \nthe United States Supreme Court and the Constitution.\n  I want to end unnecessary late-term abortions, and I also agree with \nthe Supreme Court that it is not right for a woman who faces grievous \ninjury, or even death, to have no protection under the law. In those \nrare cases of a serious threat to a woman's life or health, the Durbin \namendment would have allowed the woman, her family and no less than two \nphysicians to pursue the best medical options. Except in an emergency, \nthe two physicians--to include her attending physician and an \nindependent non-treating physician--would have been required to certify \nin writing that in their medical judgment continuation of the pregnancy \nwould threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her \nphysical health. Grievous injury was carefully defined as a severely \ndebilitating disease or impairment specifically caused or exacerbated \nby the pregnancy, or an inability to provide necessary treatment for a \nlife-threatening condition.\n  I want to emphasize that if we are serious about ending the practice \nof late-term abortions then we must pass a law that will be upheld by \nour courts. The U.S. Supreme Court has been quite clear that to be \ndeemed constitutional, any law banning late-term abortions must be \nnarrowly focused and must include an exception for the health of the \nmother. Several previous bans ignored these tests and were struck down, \nand consequently there has been no end to this troubling practice. \nSenator Santorum's bill does not adequately meet the Court's \nrequirements for constitutionality and will almost surely meet the same \nfate.\n  The Durbin amendment, on the other hand, was a clear and \ncomprehensive ban that does comply with the constitutionality tests set \nforth by the U.S. Supreme Court. It would have ended the practice of \nlate-term abortions, with a narrow exception for protecting a woman \nfrom grievous injury to her life or health. In those rare and \nextraordinarily difficult situations, the Durbin amendment would have \nensured that a woman--not by the dictates of the Congress, but with the \nprivate counsel of her family, her doctors, and her clergy--makes the \nfinal decision.\n  I deeply regret that a majority of my Senate colleagues did not \nrecognize the Durbin amendment was a more effective ban than Senator \nSantorum's proposal. I continue to hope that in the end we will find a \nway to enact a comprehensive ban on late-term abortions that meets the \ndemands of the U.S. Supreme Court and Constitution by protecting the \nlife and physical health of the mother in extreme situations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3662-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3662-S3663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF THOMAS A.

Madam President, I am pleased the Senate has confirmed \nThomas Varlan for the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Tennessee. Mr. Varlan's distinguished record of service in \nboth the private and public sectors makes him a great addition to the \nFederal bench.\n  Mr. Varlan graduated Order of the Coif from Vanderbilt University \nSchool of Law, where he served as managing editor for the Vanderbilt \nLaw Review. In his 11 years in private practice, Mr. Varlan has focused \non governmental relations, civil litigation, labor and employment law, \nand representation of quasi-governmental corporations and schools.\n\n[[Page S3663]]\n\n  Mr. Varlan's impressive accomplishments include serving as law \ndirector for the city of Knoxville for a decade. In that capacity, he \nheaded a department of 25 employees who represented the city in a \nvariety of cases and provided legal advice to city officials.\n  Mr. Varlan's wealth of experience has made him an excellent nominee \nwho is well prepared to handle the rigors of the Federal bench. \nClearly, Mr. Varlan is the right choice to be a judge in the Eastern \nDistrict of Tennessee. I am pleased my colleagues joined me in voting \nto confirm him.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am in strong support for the confirmation \nof Thomas Varlan to be a United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Tennessee.\n  Tom grew up in Knoxville, TN as a second-generation Greek-American. \nHis parents, Alexander and Constance Varlan, instilled in their son the \ntime-honored ideals of commitment to hard work, involvement in the \ncommunity, and love for country.\n  He put those ideals to work in his studies of Political Science and \nEconomics at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, and at \nVanderbilt University's School of Law, where he was the managing editor \nof the Vanderbilt Law Review. From there, Tom practiced law in Atlanta \nfrom 1981 to 1987. In 1988, Tom began ten years of service as Law \nDirector for the City of Knoxville where he was responsible for a wide \nrange of legal issues. In this role, Tom demonstrated his keen legal \nmind and temperament suited to judicial office.\n  Tom's current position as a partner at Bass, Berry and Sims has \nenhanced his solid background in the law. Tom Varlan is a skilled \nattorney who is known for his fairness, integrity and dedication to the \nlaw.\n  Tom has worn many hats in his professional life, but he has never \nwavered from the ideals that he grew up with. In fact, his nomination \nfulfills not only the dreams of his first-generation American parents, \nI believe it epitomizes the American dream as well.\n  I am convinced that Mr. Varlan will make an ideal judge, and he has \nmy highest recommendation and unqualified support. I urge my colleagues \nto vote for his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That is a feat accomplished by just 21 \nother Senators in the history of this institution, the Senate.\n  Senator Lugar's vote places him in the company of a distinguished \nlist of Members which includes eight current Senators: Senators Biden, \nByrd, Domenici, Hollings, Inouye, Kennedy, Leahy, and Stevens.\n  Most importantly, Senator Lugar's achievement is a testament of his \ntremendous service, not only to his home State of Indiana but to the \nUnited States of America.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating Senator Lugar \nfor his important milestone.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I join the distinguished Republican \nleader in expressing my heartfelt congratulations to the senior Senator \nfrom Indiana, our colleague, Dick Lugar.\n  He was sworn in on January 3, 1977. Over the course of these 10,000 \nvotes cast, he has served as the chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee and now serves as the chairman, as we all know, of the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  With those 10,000 votes, he has made a major impact on American \nhistory. I would be willing to bet that for every vote he has cast, he \nhas made at least one more friend over all of these years. He may be a \nRepublican and I may be a Democrat, but I have never been so \nappreciative of a relationship as a Senator as I have with Senator \nLugar. He has many more than 10,000 friends since he came to the Senate \nin 1977. So we congratulate him. We tell him of his great service to \nthis country and our appreciation for that service. We hope that there \nwill be many thousands more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I congratulate our dear colleague, \nSenator Dick Lugar from Indiana, for his remarkable service to our \ncountry in many ways, not just through his leadership and years and \nvotes in the Senate; prior to his time in the Senate, his service to \nour country in the U.S. Navy and all the other contributions he has \nmade. It is a remarkable morning for our country to recognize this \nremarkable individual.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I am overwhelmed by the thoughtfulness \nand graciousness of both leaders, my friends Bill Frist and Tom \nDaschle. I thank both of them for those very wonderful comments.\n  I will take a moment, if I may, to thank some other people, people of \nIndiana, who made it possible for me to be in the Senate to cast the \n10,000 votes, those who gave me their confidence, their support, and \ntheir prayers throughout the years.\n  I especially thank the Lord above for giving me good health \nthroughout that period of time and who made it possible to do this.\n  I must pay tribute, as we all are doing today, to Lloyd Ogilvie whose \npersonal counsel and support to me and my family during the past 8 \nyears has meant so much.\n  Of course, behind all of this is the confidence and love of my wife \nCharlene, our boys, and their wives, who have really sustained me, who \nsaid this is something we ought to be doing, a commitment of our time \nand our lives in a way that has been exciting for me and I hope for \nthem.\n  My staff has made it possible for me to get to the Chamber for all of \nthese votes. Wherever we are in the country, in Washington or at the \nairport, each one of us is indebted to staff who tell us when the votes \nare going to occur and give us some reasonable idea about what is being \nvoted on. I pay tribute to each one of those persons.\n  I pay tribute to colleagues who have sustained me each day with their \nloyal friendship, likewise the sheer vigor of the experience. I feel \neach day it is an adventure, and I am sure that is shared by each of \nthe colleagues who are present today.\n  I want to mention specifically Senator Robert Byrd, who was the \nmajority leader when I first came. One of the reasons my vote total \nescalated so rapidly was that in 1977 I think Senator Byrd created an \nall-time record of rollcall votes. I am certain he will remember \nexactly how many, but I recall there were at least 650, which was a \nsubstantial amount for a freshman Senator to start out with. So we have \nhad some money in the bank ever since, thanks to Senator Byrd.\n  Finally, I want to thank the pages. They have played a very special \nrole in these votes because, as some of my colleagues know, \noccasionally I go running out on The Mall. On several occasions I have \nbeen caught as far away as 14th Street or the Washington Monument when \nthe beeper went off. I had to run swiftly. Fortunately, my pace is \nsufficient to get the mile and a half back to the Capitol during the \ntime of the vote to scramble up the back stairs, but in a disheveled \ncondition I have prevailed upon the pages to crack open the door, and \nthe reading clerk has been kind enough to read my name so that I can \npeak through and keep this voting record alive.\n  So I thank all of you. I appreciate very much this moment today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, while the two leaders are in the Chamber, \nit is my understanding that the leaders\n\n[[Page S3664]]\n\nare going to provide an opportunity for people who wish to give \nstatements regarding Pastor Ogilvie--that the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee is going to put that in booklet form. So is it \nfair to announce to everyone that they need not come now to give \nspeeches regarding Pastor Ogilvie, that they will have an opportunity \nto give a speech later or insert something in the Record so Dr. Ogilvie \nwill have all of these in one book?\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, that is correct. There has been an \noutpouring of feeling for our Chaplain on this very special day, 8 \nyears after he first gave a prayer in this Chamber. With that \noutpouring of respect, people will be given the opportunity to provide \ntheir written statements. Of course, they are welcome to come and make \nstatements, but we are encouraging people to make their written \nstatements part of a permanent book that we will be giving him. We will \nhave morning business and people can come to the Chamber. There will be \nother morning business conducted as well, but most of the tributes will \nbe going into written form, and we encourage people to do just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the first 20 minutes \nshall be equally divided between the Senator from Nebraska and the \nSenator from North Dakota, with the rest of the time until 11:30 a.m. \nto be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \n20 minutes I be notified when I have consumed 5, after which the \nSenator from Nebraska will be recognized for 5 minutes, following which \nthe Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, for 5 minutes, following \nthat Senator Brownback from Kansas for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, at a time when there is so much \ndiscussion about partisanship, let me describe legislation introduced \nin the Senate yesterday now called S. 602, which is truly bipartisan. \nWe call it the New Homestead Act. Senator Hagel, Senator Johnson, \nSenator Brownback, I, and many others, Republicans and Democrats, have \nintroduced legislation to address a very serious problem in the \nheartland of our country.\n  I will describe this problem by something a Lutheran minister from \nNew England, ND, told me. She said: In this small town in southwestern \nNorth Dakota, in my church I officiate at four funerals for every \nwedding.\n  What does that describe? It describes a small town in a rural State \nwhere the population is getting older, where they have few young \npeople, few marriages and few births, and where they are suffering from \nthe out-migration of people.\n  I will describe what is happening in the heartland of America with \nthis chart. The red on this chart shows the rural counties across \nAmerica that have experienced greater than 10-percent net out-migration \nover the last 20 years. There is a relentless engine of depopulation in \nthe heartland of our country. It is from North Dakota to Texas in an \neggshell shaped form.\n  My home county is right in the southwestern corner of North Dakota. \nIt is slightly larger than the State of Rhode Island. When I left it, \nthere were 5,000 citizens living in that wonderful county. Now there \nare 2,700 citizens, and the demographers say by the year 2020 it will \nhave 1,800 citizens. Trying to do business in that county and so many \nothers in the heartland is like doing business in a deep recession.\n  Nearly a century and a half after we populated the heartland of \nAmerica by something called the Homestead Act, which said, move here, \nbecome a part of this land, and we will give you the land, we are \nseeing this relentless depopulation. In these areas, we have \ncommunities that are wonderful places in which to live. In fact, people \naspire to recreate what we have in other parts of the country--strong \nschools, a great place to raise kids, safe streets, and wonderful \ncommunities. Yet, these rural areas are being ravaged by the out-\nmigration of people. It is ruining their economy.\n  The question is: Should we care? Do we care? Well, when our cities \nwere decaying and America's cities were in trouble, as a national \npolicy we rushed to say, let's save America's cities with the Model \nCities Program, an urban renewal program. We pumped significant \nresources into those cities to save them.\n  The question now is: Will we save the heartland in our country? Does \nit matter? S. 602, bipartisan legislation called the New Homestead Act, \nsays it matters.\n  What the heartland contributes to America is very important. We need \nto give people the tools to help rebuild their economies in the \nheartland. That is what our legislation does.\n  We do not have land to give away anymore. But we say to individuals \nand businesses, if you stay there, if you come there, if you build \nthere, if you invest there, here are financial incentives for you. We \ncan turn this around. That is what S. 602 is about. S. 602 says to \npeople, it is in your interest to help us rebuild the economies of the \nStates in the heartland.\n  The New Homestead Act offers tax and other financial rewards for \nindividuals who commit to live and work in high out-migration rural \nareas. It provides help paying college loans, offers tax credits for \nhome purchases, protects home values, and establishes Individual \nHomestead Accounts, the economic equivalent of giving them free land as \nwe did a century ago.\n  S. 602 provides tax incentives for businesses to expand or locate in \nhigh out-migration areas. Investment tax credits. Micro-enterprise tax \ncredits. Accelerated depreciation.\n  Finally, a new homestead venture capital fund will help ensure that \nentrepreneurs and companies in these areas get the capital they need to \nstart and grow their businesses.\n  We can do one of two things with respect to this problem in the \nheartland of America. We can sit here and gnash our teeth and wring our \nhands and say, this is awful. We can watch this depopulation continue \nfor the next 20 or 50 years, and lose a significant and important part \nof our country's economy, or we can decide we are not going to let this \nhappen, we are not going to be the frog in the pan of water on the \nstove only to find at this time it is too late to get out.\n  That is what this is all about. I am proud to work with my \ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, to offer this legislation.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise this morning to join my friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, in introducing the new \nHomestead Act. We have heard from Senator Dorgan as to why many believe \nthis issue, this challenge, needs attention. He laid some of those \nreasons out rather clearly.\n  Senator Dorgan and I and others introduced this legislation last \nyear. The intent of this legislation is simple. It aims to help reverse \nthe trend of population decline in rural areas and provide growth and \nopportunities in rural America. Many communities in rural America have \nnot shared in the boom that has brought great prosperity to urban \nAmerica. Instead, this out-migration of individuals and resources is \ntaking a high toll on rural America. Over the last 50 years, \nnonmetropolitan counties in the Nation lost more than a third of their \npopulation, about 34 percent. Contrast this with the fact that during \nthe same period the number of people living in metropolitan areas grew \nby over 150 percent.\n  Today, Nebraska is one of the States hardest hit by out-migration. Of \n93 counties in Nebraska, 56 have lost at least 10 percent of residents \ndue to out-migration over the past 2 years. According to the University \nof Nebraska report, most of these counties will see similar population \nlosses over the next 2 decades without an expansion of nonagriculture \nindustry.\n  Why are people leaving rural America? It is rather simple: For jobs \nand opportunities. One of the main provisions of our legislation \naddresses this issue by providing incentives to small businesses and \nother enterprises to locate and expand in rural areas. Small businesses \nare a critical element of the rural economy, as they are to all of \nAmerica, accounting for nearly two-thirds of all rural jobs.\n  Our legislation builds upon the same spirit of the Homestead Act of \n1862 which gave land to individuals who were willing to live and work \nin unsettled areas of the country. In fact, the\n\n[[Page S3665]]\n\nfirst claim made under this act was just outside Beatrice, NE.\n  Our bill targets three different categories: Individuals, businesses, \nand capital formation. For individuals who live in or move to high out-\nmigration counties, the legislation provides, as Senator Dorgan \nmentioned, three basic things: The college loan repayments and home tax \ncredits, individual homestead accounts, rural investment tax credits, \nand a venture capital fund.\n  Last year, in the Senate Finance Committee, Senators Grassley and \nBaucus called the bill a big idea. Indeed, it is a big idea. But it is \nthe kind of big idea we need to help reverse the decline of rural \nAmerica--not just the Midwest--but all of rural America.\n  I am proud of the fact our bill has the bipartisan support of 10 \ncosponsors and it has the endorsement of a diverse coalition of \norganizations across this country, all kinds of organizations. I am \npleased again to be working with my friend, Senator Dorgan, in \nreintroducing this legislation. I ask my colleagues in this body to \nlearn more about the aim, the specifics of this legislation, and that \nthey would help and join us in addressing the challenges facing rural \nareas across our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe New Homestead Act and I want to thank Senator Dorgan and Senator \nHagel for their leadership on the critically important issue. I am \npleased to cosponsor this bipartism legislation.\n  America was originally a rural place. Many of our citizens lived and \nworked on farms or in rural towns throughout our country. During the \nturn of the century, towns and communities sprang up on railroad lines \nand river crossings. They served as regional trade centers and seats of \nlocal government. Opportunity was available for the children of these \ncommunities. Too often that is no longer the case. A changing economy \nfrom agriculture to technology has reduced opportunity in rural America \nand certainly rural South Dakota. Out-migration is decimating many \ncommunities in my home State of South Dakota. Currently, 63 percent of \nSouth Dakota counties are considered high out-migration counties--\naveraging a 10 percent population loss over the past 20 years. In these \ncounties there is also a 16 percent reduction in youth population, 6 \npercent increase in the elderly population, and 25 percent of these \ncounties had more deaths than births. Once proud communities that were \nself sufficient are slowly withering away.\n  I believe that in order to forestall these trends Congress must now \nprioritize rural America. That is one reason why I am so supportive of \nthis legislation. The New Homestead Act hopes to address out-migration \nby offering individuals who make a commitment to live and work in rural \nareas to get a college degree, buy a home, start a business and build a \nnest egg for the future. This legislation will also provide incentives \nfor businesses to relocate or develop in high out-migration areas. This \ncomprehensive, approach is needed to address this huge problem. While \nthe bill will not save every community, it will provide communities \nwith the tools they need to survive. Rural communities provide \nbusinesses and families many benefits. Good schools, low crime rates, a \nhigh level of civic involvement and a talented and committed workforce \nare just some of the benefits (specifics) that rural America provides \nthis country. It is a way of life worth fighting for, and our Nation's \ncommitment to this lifestyle is long-standing.\n  In fact, in 1862 our government made a commitment to populate rural \nAmerica. The original Homestead Act made a deal with settler's willing \nto travel to the midwest; if you stay and work the land for 5 years we \nwill offer you a quarter-section of land. This was a hugely popular and \nsuccessful program. I know this first hand because my great-grandfather \nused this legislation to homestead near Centerville, SD.\n  Today we can offer tax incentives and financial rewards to \nindividuals to move into out-migration counties. A generation ago the \nUnited States used a similar approach addressing the needs of our \nmetropolitan areas. At that time, our country's cities were facing \npopulation and job losses, crumbling infrastructure--many of the same \nproblems our rural areas face today. Billions of dollars were committed \nto housing, transportation, and job creation in urban areas.\n  As a Senator from a rural area, I was proud to participate and join \nin that effort. But now many of our metropolitan areas that were \nstruggling thrive. We need this kind of commitment for our rural \ncommunities at this point in our history.\n  While this comprehensive legislation takes aim to remedy many of the \nproblems facing small towns, I believe this forward-thinking bill is \nalso important for farmers and ranchers who make a living from the \nland. It is critical to understand that prosperity in production \nagriculture can lead to robust conditions in Main Street rural America. \nAs such, a decline in the farm economy causes economic hurt for rural \nbusinesses as well. This downturn in the rural economy is one we know \nall too well in South Dakota. Volatile market conditions for crops and \nlivestock, unfair foreign trade, and the disastrous forces of Mother \nNature, have all taken a toll on our farmers and ranchers in recent \nyears.\n  Consider the sobering economic damage to South Dakota resulting from \nthe ongoing drought: South Dakota State University, SDSU, economists \nestimate $1.4 billion has been eroded from the State's economy due to \nthe drought. The impact includes $642 million in direct losses for \nlivestock and crops, which is about one-sixth, or 17 percent of the \naverage annual cash intake for agriculture.\n  I believe the New Homestead Act provides the kind of commitment and \nopportunity that our nation must be willing to once again make in order \nto sustain and grow prosperity for farmers, ranchers, and rural \nAmerica.\n  Our entire Nation suffers when rural America suffers. Some of our \ncountry's most prized virtues, like good school systems, low crime \nrates, and high levels of civic participation, are alive and well in \nthese areas, yet many are fighting for their survival. There is no \ndoubt in my mind that these areas are worth saving. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join colleagues in the \nintroduction of the New Homestead Act. I am very pleased to be a \nsupporter along with my colleagues from North Dakota, Nebraska, and \nSouth Dakota.\n  Alexander Hamilton once made a statement I think is particularly \napplicable to the current situation we are discussing--what is \nhappening in rural America, particularly in a swath of rural America \nfrom Texas north to the Canadian border that includes the State of the \nPresiding Officer and a number of States throughout the Midwest. He \nsaid:\n\n       To cherish and stimulate the activity of the human mind, by \n     multiplying the objects of enterprise, is not among the least \n     considerable of the expedients by which the wealth of a \n     nation may be promoted.\n\n  We listen to that and say: What does he mean? In other words, we must \nencourage and support intellectual activity and enterprise, and the \narea in which this has been most neglected has been in our rural \ncommunities. We must change this before some of these precious entities \nwither away.\n  Every year, rural communities become emptier and more desolate as \nfewer and fewer people remain. This out-migration of youth to more \nurban areas is due to the simple fact of a lack of economic opportunity \nwithin these beautiful settings.\n  Although America was originally rural, with most of its people living \nin rural areas and working on farms, that has changed dramatically over \nthe course of the past century. Today, after decades of decline, less \nthan 2 percent of the Nation's population live on farms in rural areas. \nIn my State alone, over half of the counties are suffering from this \nyouth drain and out-migration.\n  I have a map I want to show to my colleagues. These are counties in \nKansas. We have 105 counties. These are the counties that would qualify \nfor the New Homestead Act; that is 10-percent population decline or \nmore over the last 20 years. You can see a huge swath of our State that \nhas extensive out-migration.\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\n  You can say a lot of different factors caused this. One has been the \nconcentration and growth in agriculture, where there are fewer farmers \nfarming larger tracts of land. That is certainly accurate.\n  It is also the fact that a number of people in agriculture have, \nbecause of a lack of income, had to get off-farm jobs. There are not \nmajor urban areas in a lot of these places, so they have not been able \nto find that and they have had to move to major urban areas. So you \nhave had this combination of difficulty in agriculture, difficulty of a \nlack of jobs on an off-farm basis. It has led to this huge out-\nmigration.\n  If this were just Kansas, it would be problematic enough, but instead \nof a whole swath, particularly in the Middle West, from Texas sweeping \nup north all the way to Montana and Minnesota, you have a number of \ncounties like this.\n  I believe nearly 90 percent of counties in North Dakota qualify \nbecause of the same feature: Concentration in agriculture, fewer off-\nfarm job opportunities, and people saying: We simply don't have \nanyplace to work. We would love to live here. We would love to be able \nto stay here. We have to have a job. We have to be able to make a \nreasonable income.\n  This is the total population. If you look at the school-age \npopulation, it is even worse. It is even a more steep decline. I have \nbeen in cities in Rawlins County and far Northwest Kansas where the \nschool-age population has declined nearly a fourth over the last 5 \nyears. So while the overall population is going down like this, the \nschool-age population is plummeting. As young people don't move back in \nthe area, there are not the jobs and opportunities. They are saying: I \nwould love to live here, but I can't.\n\n  I have been around a lot of rural development efforts that tried to \npush people back to rural areas. To me, this is a way to pull people \nback to rural areas, by providing economic incentives, the likes of \nwhich we did to populate the region in the first place. This is a \nregion that was populated by the Homestead Act in the first place, \ntelling people, if they will stay there and work 160 acres for 5 years, \nit is theirs.\n  We had people self-selected. It wasn't people saying: You are going \nto go, and we will select you, we won't pick you--it was the great \nAmerican way. This is the opportunity. If you want to do it, it is your \nchoice. You don't have to do it. People took it and moved out.\n  The New Homestead Act is recognizing the new economic realities and \nsaying what can we do to pull people into these areas. These are ideas \nwe tried in major urban areas, we tried them in Washington, DC, and a \nnumber of other places where we were having the hollowing out of urban \nareas, and they have attracted people back to the core in these urban \nareas. We are trying to take those same proven models, proven tests, to \nanother area that has been hollowed out in the United States.\n  That is why I am excited about this bill. I am hopeful it is \nsomething we can move in total, or in part, quickly. We need to do so. \nWe need to move this forward aggressively.\n  It is providing new hope and new vision in areas where a lot of \npeople were of a mind that: I guess nobody is listening or paying \nattention, and we are going to have difficulty making it. Our community \nis not going to make it.\n  Here we are saying, no, we want to provide this new hope and \nopportunity with the New Homestead Act. I hope our colleagues, if they \nhave other ideas that could strengthen this bill, will bring those \nforward as well.\n  It is a very difficult issue for our State. I am delighted to be \nsupportive of this effort. My colleagues and I are going to push \naggressively here and in the House to make it happen.\n  It is simple: rural America--our history, our founding lifestyle--is \nsuffering and the Congress must not turn our backs. Take, for example, \nthe town of Nicodemus, KS, in Graham County. This town was started more \nthan a century ago when some 350 freed slaves left Kentucky and made a \nnew beginning for themselves on the plains of Kansas. For a while, the \ntown prospered, showing a new life to these newly-freed slaves. \nUnfortunately though, the railroad never moved in--a devastating lost \nopportunity that was followed by drought, depression, and, finally, a \npost-war exodus. Suddenly, the town itself and its population seemed \nalmost ghost-like. Today, Nicodemus is without a school, and there is \nonly one full-time farmer left in the area.\n  Unfortunately, this story is not an isolated one, as hard times have \nhit throughout America. In fact, this kind of situation is happening \nacross our heartland, and we are here today to provide the much needed \nincentives to preserve rural America and the values instilled there.\n  We must revitalize within our heartland that spirit of creativity and \nenterprise that has always allowed our nation to grow and adapt. It has \nlong been the key to our success both philosophically and in the wealth \nof our nation. For example, Americans who once held jobs that relied on \nthe production of natural resources, such as farming, now work in \nservice or technology industries. As a result of new technologies, \nAmerican industries, including agriculture, have become more profitable \nwith fewer employees. We in the Congress have an obligation to ensure \nthe economic viability of these rural communities, even in light of the \nmajor problems and out-migration these areas are suffering.\n  In 1862, the Homestead Act inspired many to move to places like \nKansas with promises of 160 acres of free land to those settlers who \nwould farm and live there for five years. Today, we are introducing the \nNew Homestead Act. While we aren't offering 160 acres, we are rewarding \nthose individuals willing to take a risk and locate in a high out-\nmigration county with the opportunity to get a college degree, buy a \nhome, and build a nest egg for the future. Through loan repayment, \nsmall entrepreneurship credits, home tax credits, protecting home \nvalues, and individual homestead accounts, this bill reaches out to a \nnew generation of Americans.\n  And it is this new generation of Americans that will help rejuvenate \nrural America. Since our founding, a strong and vibrant rural America \nhas been essential to a strong nation--and this principle remains only \nmore true today. Our continued national well-being depends as much, if \nnot more, on the condition of our less populated areas as on our urban \nareas.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will take a serious look at this bill \nand move quickly to implement the provisions we have set forth. I \nappreciate the work that my colleagues Senators Hagel and Dorgan have \ndone on this bill. Their vision and drive have brought this bill to \nwhere it is today, and I hope that the same spirit will help propel \nthis bill through the Senate so that we can start helping our rural \ncommunities as quickly as possible.\n  For, as we struggle through economic hard times nationwide, it would \nbe wise to remember a comment George Washington made:\n\n       A people . . . who are possessed of the spirit of commerce, \n     who see and who will pursue their advantages may achieve \n     almost anything.\n\n  I know our rural communities are not only our history, but still have \nmuch to offer our nation today. Therefore, let us enable that spirit of \ncommerce, and put these communities on the path to recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3666-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3666-S3667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, this is ``Cover the Uninsured Week'' and \nthere have been press events--and I guess you can call them rallies--\naround the country designed to inform America about the problem of the \nuninsured. I guess I am glad that is happening. It seems as though it \nhappens a lot. We have been talking about the uninsured for a long \ntime.\n  I think it is time we do something about the uninsured instead of \njust telling everybody that we have. And we can do that. I would \nsuggest we are on the brink of doing it. We in the Senate just have to \nchoose between the employees of the small businesses around the \ncountry, who are most of the uninsured, and the big insurance companies \nthat have them under their thumb currently.\n  There are about 41 million uninsured people in the country at any \ngiven time. About 60 percent of those uninsured people are either \nowners of small businesses or employees of small businesses, or \ndependents of somebody who owns or works for a small business. Most of \nthe people who are uninsured are working people. The reason they are \nuninsured and the reason they are not getting health insurance through \ntheir small business is that the small businesspeople are caught. They \nare stuck on a dysfunctional market. They are caught because all they \nbring to that market is a unit of 4 or 5 people, or maybe 20 or 30, or \nmaybe 60 or 70. And they have very few choices. They consistently pay \nhigher costs for health insurance premiums, and they get lower quality \ninsurance than people who work for big businesses or people who work \nfor the Federal Government, as we do.\n  I have seen this all over the State of Missouri and, indeed, all over \nthe country. I chaired the Small Business Committee for two terms in \nthe House. In that capacity and since then, I have visited personally \nwith hundreds and hundreds of small businesspeople and with thousands \nof their employees. This is their No. 1 issue. It is not fair for them \nto be laboring under impediments that the rest of us do not have.\n  I was in Farmington, MO, over the weekend. I stopped by an \noptometrist's office run by a couple of optometrists, and a couple of \ntheir employees were there. They gathered around and told me a very \nfamiliar story. In 1999--I think it was--they said, we just felt we had \nto start providing health insurance to our people, as expensive as it \nwas and as difficult as it was.\n  They had to spend hours and hours soliciting bids, maneuvering, and \ntrying to get insurance for their people. So they started it.\n  They said: When we started, it was a little over $200 a month per \nemployee. Now, 4 years later, it is over $500 a month per employee.\n  They are not able to give wage increases to their people because \nhealth insurance costs are increasing so fast.\n  Everywhere I go, small business health insurance costs are going up \n20 or 25 percent a year.\n  There is a further human side to this story. One of their employees--\na really neat lady--I talked with for a while. She is a single mom and \na cancer survivor. She is trapped, and the small business is trapped \nwith her, because if they drop the insurance, she will never get \nreinsured anyplace else. They feel a moral obligation to continue that \ninsurance for her. The other employees are doing without wage increases \nand dealing with substandard insurance in order to help their fellow \nemployee.\n  I have seen this story over and over again. And it is not necessary. \nWe can do something about it, and we need to.\n  Here is what we can do.\n  The House passed several times in the 1990s--and the President now \nsupports the plan--a plan that would simply allow small businesses to \npool through their national trade associations or their professional \nassociations and get health insurance on the same terms and under the \nsame regulatory apparatus as the big businesses, the unions, and the \nGovernment currently do.\n  That is all we need to do, just empower the small businesspeople. It \nwill not cost the taxpayers a dime because it is not a Government \nprogram. It is just allowing people to do what is already happening all \nover the United States.\n  So here is how it would work: Let's say the National Restaurant \nAssociation would sponsor national health insurance plans. They would \nstart an employee benefit side, just like the big companies do. They \nwould contract with national insurance companies. They would have a \nself-insured side. And then, if you are a restaurant employee, by \njoining the restaurant association, you would automatically be entitled \nto get this insurance. They would have to offer it to you. They could \nnot tell you you could not have it. And you would be part of a pool of \n20,000 or 30,000 people instead of in a unit by yourself with two or \nthree or five or ten people, like my brother's situation. He has a \nlittle tavern kind of restaurant in St. Louis. Actually, it may be more \nof a saloon. But, in any event, he could join the National Restaurant \nAssociation to get coverage. It is just him and my sister-in-law who \nrun this place. Apart from the money, which is impossible for him, he \ndoes not have the time and does not want to incur the risk of going out \ntwo or three times a year and soliciting bids.\n  And then, all of a sudden, what often happens to small businesspeople \nis they get called up because somebody actually filed a claim. The big \ninsurance company tells them their rates went up astronomically. They \nhave no power in this market. They are caught with few choices, with \nsmall groups, with high administrative costs. It is not necessary, and \nit does not even cost anything for us to fix it.\n  I was talking about this at a dinner the other day with six or seven \npeople who were there to talk about how we could serve the underserved \nbetter with health care. This is part of the answer to it. We had a \nreal good dialog with these folks. Many of them are operating a \ncharitable enterprise where they are helping people get health care.\n  I laid this out for them, and one of the men said to me: Well, who \nwouldn't support that? Indeed, who wouldn't support it? I will tell you \nwho doesn't support it: the big insurance companies, who control this \nsmall group market now. They are operating like monopolists. \nMonopolists ratchet down their output and raise their prices. That is \nwhat is happening. Fewer and fewer people are covered, and prices are \ngoing higher and higher. They are making money, and people around this \ncountry do not have health insurance. It is wrong, and it ought to \nstop.\n  One argument I hear about this is: Look, if we do this, the \nassociation health plans will engage in cherrypicking. What that means \nis, the healthy small business groups will go into the big plans, the \nsicker small business groups will prefer to stay out there in the small \nbusiness market. This is actually an argument that the big insurance \ncompanies are raising. It is the exact opposite of the truth.\n  Common sense tells you if you have a history of illness, if you have \ncancer or had cancer or diabetes or kidney problems, or something \nsimilar to that, and somebody says to you, look, you can be\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\nin a small group market, you can work for a small business and be part \nof a group of 4 or 5 people or 40 or 50 people, or you can work for a \nbig business and be part of a group of 10,000 people, which would you \nchoose?\n  I have asked that question in small business groups around the \ncountry. I have not had a single person say: If I were sick, I would \nrather be part of the small group. Of course you would rather be part \nof the bigger group.\n\n  This is a haven for small business people who want to help themselves \nand their employees, and particularly the ones who are sick and need \nthe insurance, such as that lady in the optometrist shop in Farmington. \nIt is a haven for them. And it will cut the cost of their health \ninsurance, on average, 10 to 20 percent and make insurance available to \nmillions of people who currently do not have it. It does not cost the \ntaxpayers anything. It is just like a big co-op.\n  We have a lot of support in the Senate. I am very pleased about our \nprogress. The chairman of the Small Business Committee, the senior \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, is a strong supporter and is leading the \nfight. Senator Bond is supportive. The Senator who is presiding over \nthe Senate today is supportive. Senator McCain is supportive. I have \nbeen talking with a number of my friends and colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. I am hoping to get support there.\n  In the House, it passed on a strong bipartisan basis. I believe we \ncan do the same. It is just a question of the choices we want to make. \nWe can choose these small businesspeople and their employees who have \nbeen telling us, year after year after year: We are working full time; \nWe care about our jobs; We care about our fellow employees; Let us help \nourselves, or we can choose the big insurance companies that have a \nmonopoly on this market and are charging higher and higher prices and \nproviding fewer and fewer policies of insurance for people who need it.\n  I think the choice is clear. I urge the Senate to look at this bill, \nthe association health plans. We can get it passed. We can make a \ndifference, and we can do it now.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                        Senator Graham's Return \n\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Florida in the Chamber. \nFirst, I will say on a personal basis, I am delighted to see him back. \nHe is looking as healthy as he did before he left. I understand he is \neven more healthy now. For someone like myself who has probably a \ncouple pounds more than I would like to be carrying, I noticed that he \nhas found a way of losing a little weight. I suspect that what he has \ngone through is not something that is going to catch on with the \nvarious diet fads.\n  I had a chance to chat with the distinguished senior Senator last \nnight, and he not only sounds even healthier than when he left, but he \nhas the same sense of verve and sense of humor as he had before he \nleft.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Florida, if he would like \nto take the floor at this point, such time as he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I extend to you and to my \ncolleagues deep appreciation from me and my family for the many \nexpressions of concern and best wishes which have flowed to us over the \npast 6 weeks. I report to the Senate that this is my second day back on \nthe job since my operation. I feel increasingly strong and energetic, \nsufficiently so that I feel this is the time to come to the Senate \nfloor and talk about the issue before us.\n  Before I do that, I especially extend my appreciation to the \nRepublican leader and our colleague and friend, Senator Bill Frist. As \nwe know, before becoming a Senator, it was Dr. Bill Frist. He happened \nto be a cardiac surgeon. When it was clear to me I was going to have to \nhave cardiac surgery, and when that fact became known by a number of my \nfriends, I had an almost mountain of suggestions as to what I should \ndo, where I should go, who the surgeon should be.\n  Finally, my friend and former colleague, Connie Mack, called me and \nsuggested I should talk to Senator Frist, who actually knows something \nabout this, which I did. He gave me excellent advice and a substantial \namount of reassurance. Then after the operation, while I was still in \nthe hospital, he came and visited. That was a touching moment for Adele \nand myself that he would make that effort.\n  I particularly thank Senator Frist for his display of humanity during \nthis period.\n  I am here to discuss my vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada to the District of Columbia Circuit Court \nof Appeals.\n  It will be my vote today to not invoke cloture. I want to explain the \nreasons for this. There are many issues raised by this nomination. I \nconsider the most fundamental issue is the issue of the independence of \nthe judiciary. That has been a matter of concern to thoughtful \nAmericans from before our country was a country.\n  In the brilliant and Pulitzer Prize-winning book by David McCullough, \n``John Adams,'' John Adams is quoted from a paper he wrote called \n``Thoughts on Government.'' This was written before the War for \nIndependence, anticipating that after a successful independence, there \nwould be the need to establish a government. And these were some \nprinciples John Adams thought government should contain. Let me read \none paragraph:\n\n       ``Essential to the stability of government and to enable an \n     impartial administration of justice,'' Adams stressed, ``with \n     separation of judicial power for both legislative and the \n     executive, there must be an independent judiciary, men of \n     experience on the laws, of exemplary morals, invincible \n     patience, unruffled calmness, indefatigable application, and \n     should be subservient to none and appointed for life.''\n\n  Those were the characteristics John Adams laid out as crucial to the \nessential stability of government and to have an able and impartial \nadministration of justice. Those words, written before the war, then \nbecame the guiding star for our Founding Fathers at the Constitutional \nConvention in 1787.\n  In order to preserve the political independence of judges, the \nConstitution provides they shall, as John Adams suggested they should, \nserve a lifetime appointment. In order to protect from economic \nintrusion into the\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\njudiciary, this Congress is prohibited from reducing the salary of \njudges, so that they will be free of intimidation. But maybe the most \ndifficult issue the Constitutional Convention faced--and it was one of \nthe last matters to be resolved by that convention--was how should \njudges secure their place on the bench. Up until the very end of the \nConstitutional Convention, the idea was that this Senate would directly \nappoint Federal judges. However, late concern arose that this very \nprinciple of the independence of the judiciary might be at risk if one \nbranch were solely responsible for the appointment of Federal judges. \nAnd so a compromise was struck. That compromise was that the President \nwould nominate persons to be Federal judges, and that the role of the \nSenate would be to advise and then consent, through the confirmation \nprocess, to those nominations.\n  So the issue we are debating today--the relative role of the \nexecutive and legislative--is not a trivial issue. It goes to the \nheart, as John Adams said, of the stability of government, because it \ngoes to the independence of the judiciary.\n  Having said that and having read some words from the 18th century, I \nwould like to read you some words from the 21st century as printed in \nthe New York Times Magazine of last Sunday. It is an article on one of \nour Federal intermediate appellate courts, a court of almost, but not \nquite, the same influence as the DC Circuit Court. One of its justices \nis J. Michael Luttig. It says this:\n\n       Luttig told me that he thinks the politics surrounding \n     judicial appointments makes judges hyperconscious of their \n     political sponsors. ``Judges are told, `You're appointed by \n     us to do these things.' So then judges start thinking, well, \n     how do I interpret the law to get the result that the people \n     who pushed for me to be here want me to get?''\n\n  Judge Luttig continued:\n\n       I believe that there is a natural temptation to line up as \n     political partisans that is reinforced by the political \n     process. And it has to be resisted, by the judiciary and by \n     the politicians.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe we are at a time when we are being called \nupon to resist an effort to inappropriately utilize the executive power \nto the exclusion of the legislative role in the appointment of Federal \njudges. I consider myself to be a pragmatist. I find very few things in \nlife that are black and white. I do not think this issue is black and \nwhite.\n  I have been dealing with this issue in another dimension over the \npast weeks of recuperation. In my State of Florida, we have had for \nover 20 years a process of nominating Federal judges through a citizen-\nbased judicial nominating commission. Persons who want to be a Federal \njudge in Florida submit their application to the judicial nominating \ncommission, which reviews their submission and has personal interviews \nwith those candidates that it believes are eligible for Federal \njudicial consideration. Then that commission used to recommend three \npeople to the Senators. Senator Mack and myself worked for over 12 \nyears in a very collaborative, nonpartisan manner to determine what \nrecommendations should be made to the President. Under the system now, \nthe number of persons to be recommended will be increased from three to \nsix, and the role Senator Nelson and I will play--recognizing the fact \nthat we are Democrats and the administration is Republican--is we will \nreview those six nominations and make a judgment as to whether, in our \nopinion, any of those nominations would have difficulty being confirmed \nby the Senate. If that is not the case, then all six will go to the \nPresident for his consideration.\n  I highly commend to my colleagues the article I quoted from in The \nNew York Times Magazine of March 9, 2003, written by Deborah Sontag.\n  I ask unanimous consent that some materials about this recent \nagreement that has been reached between the White House, the chairman \nof the Florida Judicial Commission, and Senator Nelson and myself, \nwhich I believe will well serve the Federal judiciary and the people of \nFlorida, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         [News From Bob Graham]\n\n         White House Commits To Honor Florida Nominating System\n\n\n          Graham Says Judiciary Needs to Maintain Independence\n\n       Washington (March 12, 2003).--Senator Bob Graham, D-\n     Florida, announced today that the White House has committed \n     to honor Florida's non-partisan process for selecting \n     nominees for federal judgeships, federal prosecutors and U.S. \n     marshals. The agreement culminates months of discussion about \n     the importance of the role of the state's nominating \n     commissions.\n       ``This is an important assurance from Chief of Staff Andy \n     Card that the White House will abide by the nominating \n     process that has allowed the federal court system in Florida \n     to retain public confidence and maintain its independence \n     from political influence,'' Graham said. ``For nearly two \n     decades, this merit-based process has produced judges and \n     other officials of the highest caliber, while allowing our \n     state to outpace the nation in filling vacancies. We need to \n     ensure that this tradition continues.''\n       Graham released a letter from White House Chief of Staff \n     Andrew H. Card Jr., that reads, in part: ``I want to \n     reiterate that the President is committed to following the \n     commission process in Florida and intends to abide by the \n     rules of procedure of the Florida Federal Nominating \n     Commission, consistent with `the Constitutional and statutory \n     powers, duties, or prerogatives of the President of the \n     United States or the Senate in the filling of vacancies by \n     nomination and confirmation' (Rule 30).''\n       Graham said it was agreed that the White House commitment \n     to following the reformed rules of the nomination process \n     will be prospective, meaning that persons already nominated \n     or who are under consideration for a vacancy will not be \n     subject to the new process.\n       Upon receiving Card's letter, Graham said he would \n     encourage prompt consideration of and support before the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee the pending nominee for a District \n     Court judgeship in the Southern District of Florida, as well \n     as the nominees for U.S. marshal in the three federal \n     judicial districts in Florida.\n       If confirmed, judicial nominee Cecilia M. Altonaga would be \n     the first Cuban-American woman to sit on the federal bench. \n     The pending nominees for U.S. marshal are Dennis A. \n     Williamson in the Northern District; Thomas Hurlburt Jr., in \n     the Middle District; and Christina Pharo in the Southern \n     District.\n       ``My complaint has never been with the qualifications of \n     these individual nominees, but with the fact that the White \n     House deviated from the nominating process which has so well \n     served Floridians,'' Graham said.\n       ``I am hopeful that, with the White House commitment, we \n     will to return to a selection process that gives assurances \n     of merit-based and non-partisan selection of jurists, \n     expedites non-partisan consideration of those jurists by the \n     Senate and maintains the independence of the judiciary.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, March 12, 2003.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Thank you for the numerous \n     opportunities to discuss our mutual efforts to ensure that \n     Florida's judicial vacancies are filled through an orderly \n     process.\n       I know that you and Judge Gonzales have communicated \n     previously about the important work and role of Florida's \n     Federal Judicial Nominating Commission. I want to reiterate \n     that the President is committed to following the commission \n     process in Florida and intends to abide by the rules of \n     procedure of the Florida Federal Judicial Nominating \n     Commission, consistent with ``the Constitutional and \n     statutory powers, duties, or prerogatives of the President of \n     the United States or the Senate in the filling of vacancies \n     by nomination and confirmation'' (Rule 30).\n       The Administration shares your desire to promptly fill the \n     federal judicial and United States Marshals vacancies in \n     Florida.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Andrew H.

You have \n     my admiration and respect.\n       With warm personal regards, I remain,\n           Sincerely,\n     Roberto Martinez.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Jan. 16, 2003]\n\n           Florida's Judicial-Nomination Process Under Threat\n\n                            (By Bob Graham)\n\n       For more than a decade, through both Democratic and \n     Republican presidencies, Florida had an outstanding record of \n     filling federal judicial vacancies through a nonpartisan, \n     merit-based process.\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\n       The process was driven by the judicial nominating \n     commissions, which took applications, interviewed candidates \n     and submitted three names for consideration for each judicial \n     vacancy. These commissions, appointed by the two senators, \n     were made up of volunteers who represented a cross-section of \n     our state: lawyers and lay persons, Democrats and \n     Republicans. Both Florida senators interviewed the three \n     finalists and passed their recommendations onto the White \n     House.\n       The process worked. Over 10 years, we filled 26 District \n     Court vacancies without a single significant controversy. \n     Because of the confidence that the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     vested in the Florida judicial-nominating process, between \n     the 101st and 106th Congress, those vacancies were filled in \n     an average of 108 days. This compares to the average time for \n     all U.S. District Court vacancies of 151 days.\n       The process attracted highly qualified candidates for \n     federal judicial vacancies. This is sometimes difficult \n     because the open process makes all the information submitted \n     by the candidates publicly available. However, because \n     decisions were made on merit, candidates of the highest \n     quality from private practice as well as the state courts and \n     federal magistrates were attracted to apply.\n\n\n                            Raising Concerns\n\n       After George W. Bush became president, the process changed. \n     Now the governor, along with the most senior Republicans in \n     our state's congressional delegation, are responsible for \n     naming the nominating commission's members.\n       While Sen. Bill Nelson and I can interview the candidates, \n     we cannot make recommendations to the White House anymore. We \n     can only indicate whether any of the candidates might \n     encounter difficulty in winning Senate confirmation.\n       Since this new system has taken effect, there have been two \n     instances that raise concerns about the politicization of the \n     judicial-nominating process, threatening to undermine the \n     credibility of our judiciary.\n       A year ago, the nominating commission announced groups of \n     three finalists to fill three U.S. marshals positions in \n     Florida, including one in the Southern District of Florida. \n     In March 2002, my office was informed that the three \n     finalists for the position in the Southern District were \n     being put aside in favor of a candidate who had not even \n     applied. This candidate has been renominated in the 108th \n     Congress and is now awaiting action by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       In February 2002, the Judicial Nominating Commission \n     announced that it had selected three finalists for a Southern \n     District court vacancy. The candidates included two state \n     circuit-court judges and the sitting U.S. attorney for the \n     Southern District, who were interviewed by the Judicial \n     Nominating Commission and found to be qualified. Nelson and I \n     informed the White House that, if nominated, any of the three \n     would be expeditiously confirmed.\n       By April, however, the process took a mystifying turn. The \n     nominating commission's chairman informed the fellow \n     commissioners that the White House had requested three \n     additional names, effectively disregarding the three initial \n     candidates. A month later, at the direction of the governor \n     and two U.S. House members, the commission met again and \n     selected three new finalists. A nominee is expected from the \n     White House any day now.\n       The qualifications of these three new candidates are not to \n     be questioned. Rather, the concern is the deviation from a \n     process that has been successful for more than a decade. The \n     independence and integrity of our judicial system are at \n     stake.\n       The legal counsel to the president, Alberto Gonzalez, said \n     that the initial panel had been rejected because of \n     inadequate diversity. I found this surprising because half of \n     the federal court officers nominated in Florida by the \n     Republican-appointed Judicial Nominating Commission and \n     selected by the president were minorities.\n       With this record, if this recent set of recommendations by \n     the Judicial Nominating Commission was found by the president \n     to be insufficient, what recommendation would Gonzalez make \n     to satisfy the diversity sought by the president?\n\n\n                            PROUD TRADITION\n\n       We must live up to the words said by former Florida Bar \n     President Herman J. Russamanno about our federal courts: \n     ``Florida has been blessed with competent, experienced, \n     compassionate and highly professional judges. These \n     distinguished individuals bring to the court the highest \n     standards and strong commitments to the administration of \n     justice.''\n       I am committed to this proud tradition, which is why we \n     must honor a system of nonpartisanship and cooperation in the \n     selection of Florida's federal judges.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Having said that, I believe the standard for \nthe kind of information the Senate has a right and a need for in order \nto be able to carry out its advise and consent function is not an \nideological or even a precedential standard but, rather, a pragmatic \nstandard. If a person has been, for instance, an academic and has \nwritten, as they typically do, extensive articles or books, there is \nsome means by which you can get below and beneath the resume and get \nsome feel of the person who is being considered.\n  Similarly, if a person has been a judge at the State level, or at \nother levels within the Federal judiciary, it is likely that they have \nwritten opinions or other statements of their jurisprudential feelings \nwhich, again, would give you means by which to evaluate and cast an \ninformed vote to consent to a Presidential nomination.\n  I have been away from the Senate most of the time this matter has \nbeen under consideration. I do not serve on the Judiciary Committee, \nbut colleagues whose judgment I respect have indicated they do not feel \nthat as of today we have the information to, in an informed manner, \nprovide that consent.\n  I believe this is an issue upon which honorable men and women can \nreach agreement, just as after a series of negotiations, Senator Nelson \nand I have reached an agreement on the means by which the Florida \njudicial nominating process will be ordered and respected.\n  I urge those of my colleagues who have been particularly involved in \nthis to not see today's vote as the last chapter but, rather, as a call \nto find an honorable way to provide us with the information, given the \nstatus of this nominee and the dearth of information which might \notherwise be available.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, I find some irony in the issues with which \nthis Senate is currently dealing. We may be at war as early as next \nweek. This Senate has already voted to authorize that war. There have \nbeen a number of rationales submitted for the war.\n  One of the rationales that has been recently advanced with a great \ndeal of intellectual fervor has been the concept that by taking down \nSaddam Hussein, we could create a new climate throughout the region of \nthe Middle East and that in that new climate could sprout the seeds of \ndemocratic institutions which would, in turn, lead to democracy. That \nwould be a very admirable consequence.\n  The irony is that at the same time we are hoping that our actions of \nwar will lead to democracy in a region of the world thousands of miles \naway which has little history of democracy, we are today debating a \nprocess that, in my judgment, if not carefully balanced between the \nexecutive and legislative branches, has the prospect, as John Adams \nsuggested, of destabilizing one of the key institutions of our more \nthan two centuries of democracy.\n  I return to my hope that people of good will can find a way to \nprovide to this institution the information that it legitimately \nrequires, and which the Constitution imposes upon us, to make an \ninformed consent to the President's nomination.\n  I offer as an example of that spirit of cooperation the good deeds \nthat were extended to me by Senator Frist. Maybe some people who \nobserve this debate observe the Senate in other highly partisan \nconflicts, such as the one we voted on earlier today, to believe that \nwe are warring armies. Yes, we are people who have strong views and \nopinions, and we will express those views and support them with our \nvotes. But we also are people who have a respect for our colleagues and \na humanity towards them. I think this is the time to draw upon that \nrespect and appreciation for humanity, as well as our responsibilities \nunder the Constitution, to see if we can find a means to close this \nimpasse and move on to the other important business of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity. I again thank you and \nmy colleagues for all the expressions of good will during my absence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Florida for his \nstatement. I again welcome him back. I heard in his absence statements \nfrom both Republicans and Democrats worried about him. I am glad to see \nhim back. The Senator and his wife are dear and close friends of mine \nand my wife.\n  Sometimes people forget the Senate is a family. There are only 100 of \nus. We tend to know each other and spend time with each other. No \nmatter what political positions we take, we worry about each other's \nhealth. We talk about each other's children and where they are going to \nschool.\n  This is an example of those who were concerned about a very popular \nSenator. I am glad to see him looking in such great health. I welcome \nhim back.\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\nI thank him, of course, for his very thoughtful statement. I am glad to \nhear the quotes from a book that I probably enjoyed as much as any in \nthe last 10 years, David McCullough's book on John Adams. I do not own \nthe publishing company or anything else, but I recommend that book to \nanyone who wants to read it.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is not a question, but I wish to say, \nSenator Graham and I came to the Senate together. I have been so \nimpressed with Bob Graham his entire tenure in the Senate because he \nnever does anything halfway; it is always all the way. Whenever he \ncomes to the floor to speak, he is prepared and has thought about what \nhe is going to talk about. Today is no different.\n  Of course, I am happy to see him back stronger than ever and \ncertainly wish him well in his ambitions politically, even though he \nmay have had a slight setback, but knowing how hard the Senator from \nFlorida works, I am sure he will catch up with the pack.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it was just 2 days ago we welcomed the Vice \nPresident to the Senate for debate scheduled by the majority. I said at \nthat time that I am always glad to see the Vice President here, even \nthough it is a rare appearance for a Vice President of either party.\n  I wish he had been here for debate about the impending war with Iraq. \nWe are probably the only parliamentary body in the democratic world \nthat has not had a major debate during the past few weeks on Iraq and \nthe war. Or he might have been here for debate on terrorism or homeland \ndefense or the need for action to stimulate the economy and improve the \nlives of the millions of Americans who have lost jobs over the last 2 \nyears. Actually, there are more Americans losing jobs in a 2-year \nperiod than I think has occurred since I have been old enough to vote. \nOr the Senate might have been acting on a prescription drug benefit for \nseniors.\n  Apparently, we are not here to have that debate today nor did the \nmajority schedule debate in the Senate on Tuesday on those important \nmatters. Instead, we are here to hear again the arguments about Mr. \nEstrada. But not much has changed since last week or since this \nTuesday. The administration's obstinacy continues to impede Senate \nconsideration of this nomination.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, pointed a way \nout of this impasse in a letter to the President on February 11. It is \nregrettable the President did not respond to that reasonable letter to \nresolve the issue. Instead, the letter sent this week to the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Frist, was not a response to \nSenator Daschle's realistic approach, but a further effort to minimize \nthe Senate's role in this process by proposing radical changes in \nSenate rules.\n  I have great respect for the Office of the Presidency, for whoever \nholds it. One thing I have learned in 29 years is that Presidents come \nand Presidents go. The Office of the Presidency exists with its \nresponsibilities, its duties, its rules, its traditions. Just as \nSenators come and go. No Senator holds a seat for life. No Senator owns \na seat in the Senate. But the Senate stays, and the Senate has its \nrights, and it has its privileges, and it also has its obligations. It \nhas its constitutional duties.\n  I have been in the Senate with six different Presidents. I have never \nbeen in the Senate with a White House that seems to have less \nunderstanding of the role of the Senate or more of a desire to overturn \nwell over 200 years of practice and procedures in the Senate. I have \nnever known a White House that thinks more just for the moment and not \nfor the long term.\n  This may be why we are fast approaching the point where, as some \nsuggest, the White House may get half of its goal of regime change, but \nthey may get it in Great Britain. But I digress.\n  The real double standard in the matter of the Estrada nomination is \nthat the President selected Mr. Estrada in large part based upon his \n4\\1/2\\ years of work in the Solicitor General's Office, as well as for \nhis ideological views. The administration undoubtedly knows what those \nviews are and have seen those work papers. They know what he did. They \npicked him based on that, but they said even though we picked him based \non that, we do not want the Senate to know what it was. We in the \nSenate cannot read his work, the work papers that would shed the most \nlight on why this 41-year-old should have a lifetime seat on the \nNation's second highest court.\n  We are to a point where the White House simply says, trust us, we \nknow what he wrote and how he thinks and will make decisions, but we do \nnot want you to know what he wrote, just rubberstamp him.\n  Actually, I would remind them of that made-up quote that President \nReagan used to such effect--I happen to agree with President Reagan on \nit--trust but verify. We would like to verify. President Reagan said, \n``Trust but verify.'' They say, trust us. We say, let us verify.\n  So actually this whole matter is in the hands of the White House. \nThey could move forward with Mr. Estrada easily if they wanted to. \nInstead, the White House has taken on the attitude that they want to \ncarry out the responsibilities of the Presidency, as awesome as they \nare, but they also want to carry out the responsibilities of the \nSenate.\n  I think they have their hands full carrying out the duties of the \nWhite House, with the impending war. We have millions of Americans out \nof work. We have a stock market that has tanked. We have runaway budget \ndeficits. This is an administration that inherited the largest \nsurpluses in history, and they are about to create the largest deficits \nin history; an administration that inherited a robust stock market, and \nwe are about to see the stock market go to an all-time low. They have \nenough to worry about. Let us worry about carrying out the duties of \nthe Senate.\n  If they would simply cooperate, we could go forward with Mr. Estrada. \nI mention this because I do not want anybody to make a mistake. The \ncontrol and the scheduling of whether there will be a vote on Mr. \nEstrada is in the hands of the White House.\n  There seems to be a perversion to require the Senate to stumble in \nthe dark about Mr. Estrada's views when he shared these views quite \nfreely with others, and when the administration selected him for this \nhigh office based on these views.\n  Justice Scalia wrote just last year:\n\n       Even if it were possible to select judges who do not have \n     preconceived views on legal issues, it would hardly be \n     desirable to do so. Proof that a Justice's mind at the time \n     he joined the Court was complete tabula rasa in the area of \n     constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of \n     qualification, not lack of bias.\n\n  It was just a week ago that I thanked the Democratic leader and \nassistant leader and Democratic Senators for speaking and voting in \nfavor of preserving the integrity of the confirmation process. We are \nacting to safeguard our Constitution and the special role of the Senate \nin ensuring that our Federal courts have judges who will fairly \ninterpret the Constitution and the statutes we pass for the sake of all \nAmericans.\n  The administration's obstinacy continues to impede progress to \nresolve this standoff. The administration remains intent on packing the \nFederal circuit courts and on insisting that the Senate rubber-stamp \nits nominees without fulfilling the Senate's constitutional advice and \nconsent role in this most important process. The White House could have \nlong ago helped solved the impasse on the Estrada nomination by \nhonoring the Senate's role in the appointment process and providing the \nSenate with access to Mr. Estrada's legal work. Past administrations \nhave provided such legal memoranda in connection with the nominations \nof Robert Bork, William Rehnquist, Brad Reynolds, Stephen Trott and Ben \nCiviletti, and even this administration did so with a nominee to the \nEPA. Senator Durbin noted this week that the administration is giving \nMr. Estrada bad advice. Instead, the administration should instruct the \nnominee to answer questions about his views--consistent with last \nyear's Supreme Court opinion by Justice Scalia--and to stop pretending \nthat he has no views.\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\n  The White House is using ideology to select its judicial nominees but \nis trying to prevent the Senate from knowing the ideology of these \nnominees when it evaluates them. It was not so long ago when then-\nSenator Ashcroft was chairing a series of Judicial Committee hearings \nat which Edwin Meese III testified:\n\n       I think that very extensive investigations of each \n     nominee--and I don't worry about the delay that this might \n     cause because, remember, those judges are going to be on the \n     bench for their professional lifetime, so they have got \n     plenty of time ahead once they are confirmed, and there is \n     very little opportunity to pull them out of those benches \n     once they have been confirmed--I think a careful \n     investigation of the background of each judge, including \n     their writings, if they have previously been judges or in \n     public positions, the actions that they have taken, the \n     decisions that they have written, so that we can to the \n     extent possible eliminate people eliminate persons who would \n     turn out to be activist judges from being confirmed.\n\n  Timothy E. Flanigan, an official from the administration of the \nPresident's father, and who more recently served as Deputy White House \nCounsel, helping the current President select his judicial nominees, \ntestified strongly in favor of ``the need for the Judiciary Committee \nand the full Senate to be extraordinarily diligent in examining the \njudicial philosophy of potential nominees.'' He continued:\n\n       In evaluating judicial nominees, the Senate has often been \n     stymied by its inability to obtain evidence of a nominee's \n     judicial philosophy. In the absence of such evidence, the \n     Senate has often confirmed a nominee on the theory that it \n     could find no fault with the nominee.\n       I would reverse the presumption and place the burden \n     squarely on the shoulders of the judicial nominee to prove \n     that he or she has a well-thought-out judicial philosophy, \n     one that recognizes the limited role for Federal judges. Such \n     a burden is appropriately borne by one seeking life tenure to \n     wield the awesome judicial power of the United States.\n       Although the Senate Judiciary Committee has long recognized \n     correctly, in my view, that positions taken as an advocate \n     for a client do not necessarily reflect the nominee's own \n     judicial philosophy, a long history of cases in which a \n     nominee has repeatedly urged courts to engage in judicial \n     activism may well be probative of a nominee's own philosophy.\n\n  Now that the President is not a popularly elected Democrat but a \nRepublican, these principles seem no longer to have any support within \nthe White House or the Senate Republican majority. Fortunately, our \nconstitutional principles and our Senate traditions, practices and \ngoverning rules do not change with the political party that occupies \nthe White House or with a shift in majority in the Senate.\n  Along with this current impasse, the administration has shown \nunprecedented disregard for the concerns of Senators in taking other \nunprecedented actions, including renominating both Judge Charles \nPickering, despite his ethical lapses, and Judge Priscilla Owen, \ndespite her record as a conservative ``activist'' judge. Both were \nrejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee after fair hearings and open \ndebate last year. Sending these re-nominations to the Senate is \nunprecedented. No judicial nominee who has been voted down has ever \nbeen re-nominated to the same position by any President. This morning \nthe Republican majority took another unprecedented step in holding a \nhearing on the re-nomination of Judge Owen, whose nomination had been \nrejected earlier by the committee. The White House, in conjunction with \nthe new Republican majority in the Senate, is choosing these battles \nover nominations purposefully. Dividing rather than uniting has become \ntheir modus operandi.\n  Among the consequences of this partisan strategy is that for the last \nmonth, the Senate has been denied by the Republican leadership \nmeaningful debate on the situation in Iraq. I commend Senator Byrd, \nSenator Kennedy and the other Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nhave nonetheless sought to make the Senate a forum for debate and \ncareful consideration of our nation's foreign policy. The decision by \nthe Republican Senate majority to focus on controversial nominations \nrather than the international situation or the economy says much about \ntheir mistaken priorities. The Republican majority sets the agenda and \nthey schedule the debate, just as they have again here today.\n  One of the most disconcerting aspects of the manner in which the \nSenate is approaching these divisive judicial nominations is what \nappears to be the Republican majority's willingness to sacrifice the \nconstitutional authority of the Senate as a check on the power of the \nPresident in the area of lifetime appointments to our Federal courts. \nIt should concern all of us and the American people that the Republican \nmajority's efforts to re-write Senate history in order to rubber-stamp \nthis White House's Federal judicial nominees will cause long-term \ndamage to this institution, to our courts, to our constitutional form \nof government, to the rights and protections of the American people and \nto generations to come. I have served in the Senate for 29 years, and \nuntil recently I have never seen such stridency on the part of an \nadministration or such willingness on the part of a Senate majority to \ncast aside tradition and upset the balances embedded in our \nConstitution so as to expand Presidential power. What I find \nunprecedented are the excesses that the Republican majority and this \nWhite House are willing to indulge to override the constitutional \ndivision of power over appointments and longstanding Senate practices \nand history. It strikes me that some Republicans seem to think that \nthey are writing on blank slate and that they have been given a blank \ncheck to pack the courts. They show a disturbing penchant for reading \nthe Constitution to suit their purposes of the moment rather than as it \nhas functioned for over 200 years to protect all American through \nchecks and balances.\n  The Democratic Leader pointed the way out of this impasse again in \nhis letter to the President on February 11. It is regrettable that the \nPresident did not respond to that reasonable effort to resolve this \nmatter. Indeed, the letter he sent this week to Senator Frist was not a \nresponse to Senator Daschle's reasonable and realistic approach, but a \nfurther effort to minimize the Senate's role in this process by \nproposing radical changes in Senate rules and practices to the great \nbenefit of this administration. A distinguished senior Republican \nSenator saw the reasonableness of the suggestions that the Democratic \nleader and assistant leader have consistently made during this debate \nwhen he agreed on February 14 that they pointed the way out of the \nimpasse. Sadly, his efforts and judgment were also rejected by the \nadministration.\n  More recently, in its edition for next Monday, March 17, a writer in \nThe Weekly Standard suggests that other Senate Republicans, ``several \nveteran GOP Senate staffers'' and ``a top GOP leadership aide'' asked \nthe White House to shown some flexibility and to share the legal \nmemoranda with the Senate to resolve this matter, but were rebuffed. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of the article from The Weekly \nStandard be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Weekly Standard, Mar. 17, 2003]\n\n  Filibuster Si, Estrada No!--The Great Republican Divide Over How To \n                   Fight for Bush's Judicial Nominee\n\n                           (By Major Garrett)\n\n       It's not clear whether the constitutional definition of \n     ``advice and consent'' will become a casualty of Miguel \n     Estrada's fight for a seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, but the possibility is serious and sobering. In a \n     55-44 vote, Democrats last week defeated a Republican attempt \n     to break their unprecedented partisan filibuster of Estrada's \n     nomination, opening the way for the simple-majority standard \n     for Senate confirmation of judicial nominees to be replaced \n     with a super-majority requirement. The Republic isn't there \n     yet. But it's close.\n       ``If we go very much further there will be obvious \n     consequences,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican. \n     ``This standard will have to be applied to both parties and \n     by both parties. This is very close to the point where you \n     can't pull it back.''\n       The strain on the Constitution and Senate precedent is now \n     obvious. Less obvious is the toll the Estrada fight has taken \n     on the relationship between the new Senate GOP leadership \n     team and the Bush White House. While GOP senators are loath \n     to admit it, the Estrada debate has drifted on this long \n     because the White House and the GOP leadership could not \n     fashion a cohesive strategy.\n       Estrada is not the first fight new majority leader Bill \n     Frist would have chosen--at least not under the restrictions \n     imposed by the White House. Senate Republicans believe the \n     White House has severely limited their room to negotiate.\n       Early on, several veteran GOP Senate staffers warned the \n     White House and Justice Department to prepare for a brawl. \n     They then gingerly asked two questions: Would Estrada answer \n     more questions from Democrats? And was there any flexibility \n     in the\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\n     White House's objection to releasing the working memos \n     Estrada wrote while deputy solicitor general in the Clinton \n     Justice Department?\n       Senior Senate GOP staff told White House and Justice \n     Department officials that cutting a deal on limited \n     Democratic access to Estrada's working papers could lead to \n     his confirmation. The White House refused. There would be no \n     access to Estrada's working papers. Period. This adamantine \n     posture, in the eyes of some in the Senate GOP leadership \n     circles, handcuffed Frist.\n       ``There's some frustration,'' said a top GOP leadership \n     aide. ``From the very beginning we told them that was the \n     only way out and a face-saver for everyone. But it came down \n     to the fact that no one on the White House or Justice team \n     wanted to walk into the Oval Office and say to the president, \n     `You might have to give up these memos.' ''\n       The administration's position on the memos reflects its \n     deeply held ethic of aggressively defending executive branch \n     prerogatives. Though the White House has never \n     characterized the Estrada matter as one of executive \n     privilege (it is more akin to lawyer-client privilege), it \n     falls into the broad category of executive branch \n     muscularity. And while most Republicans generally support \n     this posture, some Bush allies on and off Capitol Hill \n     have come to question the administration's fastidiousness \n     in the Estrada fight.\n       ``I understand the principle, and I support it, but on this \n     one it feels belligerent,'' said a longtime Republican \n     lobbyist and ally of the Bush White House.\n       When a reporter last week asked Sen. Rick Santorum, the GOP \n     conference chairman, if opposition to divulging Estrada's \n     Justice Department memos was permanent, he snapped, ``Ask the \n     White House.''\n       Conservatives like Sen. Kyl see the Estrada fight as purely \n     ideological and strongly oppose cutting any deal on access to \n     his working papers.\n       ``It's a phony issue, a manufactured issue,'' said Kyl. \n     ``We want to win this, but you don't win it by breaking a \n     principle that has served this nation well for 200 years. And \n     if we deal on the papers, it will be something else.''\n       But Sen. Harry Reid, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, has said \n     he will support Estrada if the papers are turned over and \n     nothing objectionable emerges. Enough Democrats to break the \n     filibuster would surely follow Reid, senior Democratic \n     sources say.\n       ``Their guy's not going to get confirmed without them,'' \n     said a top Democratic lawyer who backs Estrada. ``This is not \n     complicated. The White House is not going to confirm him \n     without paying a price.''\n       If that price seems too high, the White House may want to \n     reexamine the price of the alternative, an increasingly \n     bitter filibuster fight. While protecting the privacy of \n     internal memos at the Justice Department, the White House may \n     be sacrificing the 50-vote majority as the historic benchmark \n     of constitutional fitness for the federal bench. Some Senate \n     Republicans believe a new 60-vote standard for judicial \n     appointments could severely hamper this president and all \n     future presidents. And some Senate Republicans wonder why \n     it's more important to protect executive privilege than a \n     president's power to have judicial nominees confirmed by \n     simple majority vote.\n       The White House wants the fight to drag out and political \n     pressure to build on centrist Democrats. The White House \n     likes the Hispanic dimension of the Estrada fight and is \n     counting on the weight of editorial and public opinion to \n     turn the tide.\n       But numerous Republican senators say the Estrada fight, for \n     all its constitutional implications, has yet to resonate with \n     the public. Democratic senators report no political backlash \n     at home and see it as their duty to defend Daschle.\n       ``This is an ideological fight, and this is a fight for \n     Daschle to be taken seriously,'' said a senior aide to a \n     Democratic senator who has teamed up with the White House on \n     economic policy. ``And my boss is with Daschle. He knows he's \n     taken, and will take, enough flak on fiscal policy. This is a \n     fight he's prepared to stick with.''\n       Absent a deal on the working memos, all Estrada can bank on \n     is White House and Republican promises to fight until they \n     prevail. But no one in the GOP Senate leadership or the Bush \n     White House can explain how or when that will happen.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is too bad that the White House will not listen to \nreason from Senate Democrats or Senate Republicans. If they had, there \nwould be no need for this cloture vote. The White House is less \ninterested in making progress on the Estrada nomination than in trying \nto make political points and to divide the Hispanic community.\n  The Supreme Court, in an opinion authored by none other than Justice \nScalia, one of this President's judicial role models, instructs that \njudicial ethics do not prevent candidates for judicial office or \njudicial nominees from sharing their judicial philosophy and views.\n  With respect to ``precedent,'' Republicans not only joined in the \nfilibuster of the of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the United \nStates Supreme Court, they joined in the filibuster Stephen Breyer to \nthe 1st Circuit, Judge Rosemary Barkett to the 11th Circuit, Judge H. \nLee Sarokin to the 3rd Circuit, and Judge Richard Paez and Judge Marsha \nBerzon to the 9th Circuit. The truth is that filibusters on nominations \nand legislative matters and extended debate on judicial nominations, \nincluding circuit court nominations, have become more and more common \nthrough Republicans' actions.\n  Of course, when they are in the majority Republicans have more \nsuccessfully defeated nominees by refusing to proceed on them and have \nnot publicly explained their actions, preferring to act in secret under \nthe cloak of anonymity. From 1995 through 2001, when Republicans \npreviously controlled the Senate majority, Republican efforts to defeat \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees most often took place through \ninaction and anonymous holds for which no Republican Senator could be \nheld accountable. Republicans held up almost 80 judicial nominees who \nwere not acted upon during the Congress in which President Clinton \nfirst nominated them and eventually defeated more than 50 judicial \nnominees without a recorded Senate vote of any kind, just by refusing \nto proceed with hearings and Committee votes.\n  Beyond judicial nominees, Republicans also filibustered the \nnomination of Executive Branch nominees. They successfully filibustered \nthe nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to become Surgeon General of the \nUnited States in spite of two cloture votes in 1995. Dr. David \nSatcher's subsequent nomination to be Surgeon General also required \ncloture but he was successfully confirmed.\n  Other Executive Branch nominees who were filibustered by Republicans \nincluded Walter Dellinger's nomination to be Assistant Attorney General \nand two cloture petitions were required to be filed and both were \nrejected by Republicans. In this case we were able finally to obtain a \nconfirmation vote after significant efforts and Mr. Dellinger was \nconfirmed to that position with 34 votes against him. He was never \nconfirmed to his position as Solicitor General because Republicans had \nmade clear their opposition to him. In addition, in 1993, Republicans \nobjected to a number of State Department nominations and even the \nnomination of Janet Napolitano to serve as the U.S. Attorney for \nArizona, resulting in cloture petitions. In 1994, Republicans \nsuccessfully filibustered the nomination of Sam Brown to be an \nAmbassador. After three cloture petitions were filed, his nomination \nwas returned to President Clinton without Senate action. Also in 1994, \ntwo cloture petitions were required to get a vote on the nomination of \nDerek Shearer to be an Ambassador. And it likewise took two cloture \npetitions to get a vote on the nomination of Ricki Tigert to chair the \nFDIC. So when Republican Senators now talk about the Senate Executive \nCalendar and presidential nominees, they must be reminded that they \nrecently filibustered many, many qualified nominees.\n  Nonetheless, in spite of all the intransigence of the White House and \nall of the doublespeak by some of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, I can report that I believe the Senate will by the end of \nthis week have moved forward to confirm 111 of President Bush's \njudicial nominations since July 2001. That total would include 11 \njudges confirmed so far this year and of those, seven would be \nconfirmed this week. With the time agreement on the controversial \nnomination of Jay S. Bybee to the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit in place for later today, it also includes a circuit \njudge. Those observing these matters might contrast this progress with \nthe start of the last Congress in which the Republican majority in the \nSenate was delaying consideration of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees. In 1999, the first hearing on a judicial nominee was not \nuntil mid-June. The Senate did not reach 11 confirmations until the end \nof July of that year. Accordingly, the facts show that Democratic \nSenators are being extraordinarily cooperative with a Senate majority \nand a White House that refuses to cooperate with us. We have made \nprogress in spite of that lack of comity and cooperation.\n  Indeed, by close of business today, we will have reduced vacancies on \nthe federal courts to under 55, which includes\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\nthe 20 judgeships the Democratic-led Senate authorized in the 21st \nCentury Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act last \nyear. That is an extremely low vacancy number based on recent history \nand well below the 67 vacancies that Senator Hatch termed ``full \nemployment'' on the federal bench during the Clinton Administration.\n  Our D.C. Circuit has special jurisdiction over cases involving the \nrights of working Americans as well as the laws and regulations \nintended to protect our environment, safe work places and other \nimportant federal regulatory responsibilities. This is a court where \nprivacy rights will either be retained or lost, and where thousands of \nindividuals will have their final appeal in matters that affect their \nfinancial future, their health, their lives and their liberty, as well \nas the lives of their children and generations to come.\n  If a nominee's record or responses raise doubts or concerns, these \nare matters for thorough scrutiny by the Senate, which is entrusted to \nreview all of the information and materials relevant to a nominee's \nfairness and experience. No one should be rewarded for stonewalling the \nSenate and the American people. Our freedoms are the fruit of too much \nsacrifice to fail to assure ourselves that the judges we confirm will \nbe fair judges to all people and in all matters.\n  It is unfortunate that the White House and some Republicans have \ninsisted on this confrontation rather than working with us to provide \nthe needed information so that we could proceed to an up-or-down vote. \nSome on the Republican side seem to prefer political game playing, \nseeking to pack our courts with ideologues and leveling baseless \ncharges of bigotry, rather than to work with us to resolve the impasse \nover this nomination by providing information and proceeding to a fair \nvote. I was disappointed that Senator Bennett's straightforward \ncolloquy with Senator Reid and me on February 14, which pointed to a \nsolution, was never allowed by hard-liners on the other side to yield \nresults. I am disappointed that all my efforts and those of Senator \nDaschle and Senator Reid have been rejected by the White House. The \nletter that Senator Daschle sent to the President on February 11 \npointed the way to resolving this matter reasonably and fairly. \nRepublicans would apparently rather engage in politics.\n  The Republican majority is wedded to partisan talking points that are \nlight on facts but heavy on rhetoric. There has often been an absence \nof fair and substantive debate and a prevalence of name calling by the \nother side.\n  I urge the White House and Senate Republicans to end the political \nwarfare and join with us in good faith to make sure the information \nthat is needed to review this nomination is provided so that the Senate \nmay conclude its consideration of this nomination. I urge the White \nHouse, as I have for more than two years, to work with us and, quoting \nfrom a recent column by Thomas Mann of The Brookings Institute, to \nsubmit ``a more balanced ticket of judicial nominees and engag[e] in \ngenuine negotiations and compromise with both parties in Congress.''\n  The President promised to be a uniter not a divider, but he has \ncontinued to send us judicial nominees that divide our nation and, in \nthis case, he has even managed to divide Hispanics across the country, \nunlike any of the prior nominees of both Democratic and Republican \npresidents. The nomination and confirmation process begins with the \nPresident, and I urge him to work with us to find a way forward to \nunite the nation on these issues, instead of to divide the Nation.\n  The presiding officer. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is the fifth week of debate on Mr. \nEstrada's nomination. My Democratic colleagues have had unlimited \nopportunities to make their case. Some of them oppose him; others \nsupport him. But one thing has remained clear through this debate: \nThere is no good reason to continue this route of obstruction by \ndenying Mr. Estrada an up or down vote.\n  If my count is accurate, we have sought more than 17 times to come to \nan agreement with the Democratic leadership for a time to vote on Mr. \nEstrada's nomination. Each time, they rejected our efforts.\n  Yet, the Democratic leadership has complained that the Senate should \nmove on to consider other important matters. All the while, they have \ncontinued to fight voting on Mr. Estrada's nomination--the very thing \nthat would allow the Senate to focus its energies on other matters.\n  This filibuster of Mr. Estrada's nomination is just another step in a \ncalculated effort to stall action on President Bush's judicial \nnominees. A few weeks ago, I spoke at length on the Senate floor about \nthe Senate Democrats' weapons of mass obstruction. I mentioned that \nwhen the Democrats controlled the Senate, we saw them bottle up \nnominees in committee despite more than 100 vacancies in the federal \njudiciary. They have continued to try to inject ideology into the \nconfirmation process by demanding that nominees like Miguel Estrada \nanswer questions that other nominees rightly declined to answer, but \nwere nevertheless confirmed. They have sought production of all \nunpublished opinions of nominees who are sitting Federal judges--a \ndemand that has resulted in the production of hundreds of opinions and \nrequired the expenditure of a significant amount of resources, money, \neffort, the time. Most recently, they have demanded that a nominee, Mr. \nEstrada, produce confidential internal memoranda that are not within \nhis control. Although this tactic made its debut with Mr. Estrada, I \nexpect that we will see it repeated with other nominees.\n  Each of these weapons of obstruction were at their most potent when \nDemocrats controlled the Judiciary Committee. Now things have changed, \nand Democrats can no longer keep nominees like Miguel Estrada bottled \nup in committee while they made demands for answers to questions that \nare unanswerable, and for confidential documents that are not subject \nto production. Democrats no longer control the committee, and as a \nresult Miguel Estrada nomination has made it to the Senate floor. This \nmeans that the obstructionists among the Senate Democrats have turned \nto their ultimate weapon--the filibuster.\n\n  Filibusters of judicial nominees allow a vocal minority to prevent \nthe majority of Senators from voting on the confirmation of a Federal \njudge--a prospective member of our third, coequal branch of Government. \nIt is tyranny of the minority, and it is unfair to the nominee, to the \njudiciary, and to the majority of the Members of this body who stand \nprepared to fulfill their constitutional responsibility by voting on \nMr. Estrada's nomination.\n  I have taken to the floor time and time again, for Democratic and \nRepublican nominees alike, to urge my fellow Senators to end debate by \nvoting to invoke cloture, which requires the vote of 60 Senators. Most, \nif not all, of these occasions did not represent true filibusters, but \nwere situations in which nominees were nevertheless forced to overcome \nthe procedural obstacle of a cloture vote. And no lower court nominee \nhas ever been defeated through use of a filibuster--all previous lower \ncourt nominees who endured a cloture vote were ultimately confirmed.\n  I am not alone in my disdain for forcing judicial nominees through a \ncloture vote. I think that it is appropriate at this point to note that \nmany of my Democratic colleagues argued strenuously on the floor of the \nSenate for an up-or-down vote for President Clinton's judicial \nnominees.\n  The distinguished minority leader himself once said:\n\n       As Chief Justice Rehnquist has recognized: ``The Senate is \n     surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, \n     but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him \n     up or vote him down.'' An up or down vote, that is all we ask \n     . . . .\n\n  The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee echoed these sentiments \nwhen he said:\n\n       . . . I, too, do not want to see the Senate go down a path \n     where a minority of the Senate is determining a judge's fate \n     on votes of 41.\n\n  Another one of my Democratic colleagues, Senator Kennedy, himself a \nformer chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had this to say:\n\n       Nominees deserve a vote. If our Republican colleagues do \n     not like them, vote against them. But do not just sit on \n     them--that is obstruction of justice.\n\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\n\n  The distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, who also \nserves on the Judiciary Committee, likewise said in 1999:\n\n       A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them \n     down.\n\n  She continued:\n\n       It is our job to confirm these judges. If we do not like \n     them, we can vote against them. That is the honest thing to \n     do. If there are things in their background, in their \n     abilities that do not pass muster, vote no.\n\n  My other colleague from California, Senator Boxer, said in 1997:\n\n       It is not the role of the Senate to obstruct the process \n     and prevent numbers of highly qualified nominees from even \n     being given the opportunity for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  My colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, also said in 1997:\n\n       I . . . respectfully suggest that everyone who is nominated \n     is entitled to have a shot, to have a hearing and to have a \n     shot to be heard on the floor and have a vote on the floor.\n\n  I could go on, but I think I have made my point. I had hoped that I \ncould count on each of my Democratic colleagues who made statements \nsupporting an up-or-down vote for President Clinton's judicial nominees \nto join me in voting for cloture on Miguel Estrada. I had hoped that \ntheir remarks in the past were not merely about partisanship, but about \nthe fairness that should be extended to all judicial nominees, \nregardless of which President nominated them.\n  Last week, I was wrong. But today, there is a second chance--another \nchance to set aside partisanship for fairness.\n  For this cloture vote to succeed, a supermajority of 60 Senators must \nvote to end the filibuster of Mr. Estrada's nomination. I regret that \nit has come to this, because forcing a supermajority vote on any \njudicial nominee is a maneuver that needlessly injects even more \npolitics into the already over-politicized confirmation process. I \nbelieve that there are certain areas that should be designated as off-\nlimits from political activity. The Senate's role in confirming \nlifetime-appointed article III judges--and the underlying principle \nthat the Senate perform that role through the majority vote of its \nmembers--are such issues. Nothing less depends on the recognition of \nthese principles than the continued, untarnished respect in which we \nhold our third branch of Government--the one branch of Government \nintended to be above political influence.\n  So I now say once again to my Democratic friends: Vote for Miguel \nEstrada or vote against him. Do as their conscience dictates you must. \nBut do not prolong the obstruction of the Senate by denying a vote on \nhis nomination. Do not cast their vote against cloture today. Do not \ncontinue to treat the third branch of our Federal Government--the one \nbranch intended to be insulated from political pressures--with such \ndisregard that we filibuster its nominees. Do not perpetuate this \ncampaign of unfairness. Vote for him or vote against him, but just \nvote.\n  This first filibuster in the history of the Senate on a substantive \njudgeship for a circuit court of appeals nominee is unprecedented, \nsomething that should never happen, that we prevented from happening \nwhen I was chairman of the committee during the Clinton administration. \nMy friends on the other side are using a fiction that they know the \nadministration cannot fulfill, and that is demanding a fishing \nexpedition into all of the papers in the Solicitor General's Office \npertaining to Mr. Estrada's recommendations on appeals, certiorari, and \namicus curiae. They know the administration cannot do that. They knew \nthat when they wrote the letter making that unreasonable demand. This \nis what we call fiction, a red herring, so they can justify the \nfilibuster they are undergoing and act very pious, that they are really \ntrying to learn more about this man, in spite of the fact that they \nconducted the hearings.\n  The hearings went all day. The transcript is almost 300 pages. They \nhave all of his Supreme Court briefs. They have all of his Supreme \nCourt arguments. They know more about Mr. Estrada than they know about \nany circuit court of appeals judgeship nominee we have had over the \nlast 27 years that I have been in the Senate, as far as I know. There \nmight be one or two they might know as much about as they do Mr. \nEstrada, but this is a fiction. It is a red herring. We have a letter \nfrom seven former Solicitors General, all living former Solicitors \nGeneral, from Archibald Cox to Seth Waxman, four of the seven Democrat \nSolicitors General, three of who worked with Miguel Estrada in the \nSolicitor General's Office, because he worked, I might add, 4 years for \nthe Clinton administration and 1 year for the Bush administration. \nThose former Solicitors General say these types of documents should \nnever be given, because it would chill the ability of the Solicitor \nGeneral to get honest and decent opinions on very important matters for \nthe people's business, and the people's business does not make any \ndelineation between Democrats and Republicans. The Solicitor General \nrepresents all of the people.\n  I will now say a few words about Priscilla Owen before I go back to \nthe hearing.\n  I rise for the purpose of reading a Dear Colleague letter that I have \nwritten and distributed today concerning the nomination of Justice \nPriscilla Owen of Texas to be a judge on the US Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit. I have distributed this to every Senator in the \nSenate.\n\n       Dear Colleague: On September 4 of last year I took the \n     unusual step of writing to the entire Senate to express my \n     outrage at the untruthful and misleading attacks made against \n     Justice Priscilla Owen of Texas, who was nominated by \n     President Bush to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. As you know, Justice Owen enjoyed the support of \n     both of her home-state Senators last Congress, and again \n     enjoys such support. I am writing today so that you have all \n     information related to this important information.\n       In September, I expressed my concern that a continued \n     pattern of misinformation about a nominee, like the one \n     generated about Justice Owen, could undermine the integrity \n     both of the judiciary and of the branch of government in \n     which we are privileged to serve. A day later, the Judiciary \n     Committee refused to allow Justice Owen a vote by the whole \n     Senate on a party-line vote of 10 to 9.\n       Notably, one week later The Washington Post joined scores \n     of other newspapers across the country in expressing support \n     for Justice Owen and severely criticized the Committee's \n     conduct. I have enclosed its editorial. The Post described \n     the Committee's vote as ``a message to the public that the \n     confirmation process is not a principled exercise but an \n     expression of political power.'' The Post also noted that \n     although they disagreed with some of her opinions, ``none \n     seems beyond the range of reasonable argument.''\n       Despite the independent support of dozens of newspapers, \n     prominent Democrats, and fourteen past Texas bar presidents, \n     critics have portrayed Justice Owen as being ``far from the \n     mainstream.'' Yet Texas voters have twice elected her \n     overwhelmingly to statewide office. The American Bar \n     Association has unanimously rated her well qualified, its \n     highest rating. In fact, Justice Owen was the first judicial \n     nominee with the ABA's highest rating to be voted down by the \n     Judiciary Committee.\n       In my opinion, Justice Owen is perhaps the best sitting \n     judge I have ever seen nominated. She is brilliant as well as \n     compassionate. Justice Owen's record of applying the law as \n     written is among the very best of any judicial nominee ever \n     presented to the Senate. This is particularly true in her now \n     famous decisions concerning the Texas law requiring parental \n     notification when minor children obtain abortions. In \n     these cases, no one's right to choose was implicated. The \n     only right at stake was the right articulated by the Texas \n     legislature of parents to have knowledge of, and an \n     opportunity for involvement in, one of the most important \n     decisions of their children's lives. In those cases, \n     Justice Owen did exactly what any restrained judge should \n     do: She applied Texas statutory law as directed by Supreme \n     Court's precedent, including Roe v. Wade. Ironically, it \n     is Justice Owen's opponents--the same ones who accuse her \n     of being an ``activist''--who would have her ignore the \n     legislature and the Supreme Court in order to reach a \n     political result.\n       Justice Owen is also accused of deciding cases against \n     consumers, workers, and the injured and sick. This charge is \n     not only factually without basis, but also belies the \n     accusation of ``activism.'' Only those obsessed with \n     outcomes, rather than the law governing the facts of a \n     particular case, would be compelled by a mere counting up of \n     wins and losses among categories of parties before a judge.\n       Working as a judge is like being an umpire; Justice Owen \n     cannot be characterized as pro-this or pro-that any more than \n     an umpire can be analyzed as pro-strike or pro-ball. I hope \n     you will agree that a judge's job is to apply the law to the \n     case at hand, not to mechanistically ensure that court \n     victories go 50/50 for plaintiffs and defendants, consumers \n     and corporations.\n       Justice Owen was also notably assailed by her critics using \n     incorrectly the words of one of her biggest supporters, \n     Alberto Gonzales, President Bush's White House Counsel. Judge \n     Gonzales served with Justice Owen on the Texas Supreme Court \n     and has written publicly that she is ``extraordinarily well\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\n     qualified to serve as a judge on the federal appeals court.'' \n     Rather than focus on his ringing endorsement, however, \n     detractors instead sensationalized a disagreement that Judge \n     Gonzales had not with Justice Owen, but with other dissenting \n     judges in a case involving the Texas parental notification \n     law.\n       Justice Owen is an excellent judge. Her opinions, whether \n     majority, concurrences, or dissents, could be used as a law \n     school text book illustrating exactly how an appellate judge \n     should think, write, and do the people justice by effecting \n     their will through the laws adopted by their elected \n     legislatures. She clearly approaches these tasks with both \n     scholarship and mainstream American common sense.\n       As a new Congress takes a fresh look at this nomination, I \n     hope you will join me in informing the American people of the \n     truth about Justice Owen and in warning them of the grave \n     danger posed by an uninformed politicization of the federal \n     judiciary. I hope you will urge our colleagues to do the \n     right thing when Justice Owen is again voted on by the \n     Committee and goes to the Senate floor for confirmation.--\n     Signed, Orrin G. Hatch.\n\n  We are holding a hearing today on Justice Owen's nomination. I invite \nall of my colleagues to attend. In fact, I encourage them to do so. I \nwant everyone to get to know Justice Owen and have the opportunity to \nhear from her firsthand. This is a very unusual invitation, I know. But \nthese are unusual times in the Senate for judicial nominations, and \nJustice Owen is a particularly important and impressive nominee. I urge \nmy colleagues to come to the hearing taking place in Dirksen 106 and \nsee for themselves what an extraordinary person and jurist she is.\n  We are having difficulty with the President's judicial nominees. \nEvery one of these circuit nominees is being contested, some more than \nothers, but all of them are quite rabidly being contested. Miguel \nEstrada is a perfect illustration of someone who is totally competent, \ntotally equipped to do the job, honest, decent, has earned his stripes, \nhas the highest rating from the American Bar Association, the gold \nstandard, according to our colleagues on the other side. Yet he is \nbeing filibustered here now in the fifth or sixth week.\n  We have a cloture vote today. I hope my colleagues will consider \nthis. I hope we can get some of the more clear thinking colleagues on \nthe other side to start voting for Mr. Estrada, to start voting for \ncloture, so we can end this outrageous debate and put a qualified \nperson on the court. Let's not hide behind a fishing expedition to get \ndocuments they know no self-respecting administration is going to give \nto them, and using that as a basic shield to say they are not doing \nsomething unjust to Miguel Estrada. They are being very unjust, very \nunfair. It is not right. We ought to stop it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me take this opportunity, first, to express my \nappreciation and the appreciation of the Senate for the outstanding \nwork that is being done by Senator Hatch as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. That is a tough job. It always has been. It seems to be \ngetting tougher with every passing Congress. I know from personal \nexperience during my tenure as the Republican Leader, both in the \nmajority and the minority, of the diligent work and good work that has \nbeen done by Senator Hatch to move judicial nominations through the \nprocess.\n  Quite often, it was very difficult in the committee and on the floor. \nThere have been accusations that, perhaps, he had unfairly delayed \njudges in the past. But I can tell you this: My knowledge was, and \nmemory is, that he worked very hard to move a lot of judges, several of \nwhom were highly controversial but were eventually confirmed anyway.\n  Yes, at the end of the last term some judicial nominees of the \nClinton administration were not completed, but if you compare the \nnumber that were left over to similar situations in the past, it was a \nsmaller number. When you look at the number of judges that have been \nconfirmed under the stewardship and leadership of Senator Hatch, it has \nto be a record in terms of overall numbers compared with previous \nchairmen and previous administrations.\n  I will talk more about specifics, but while Senator Hatch is here I \nwanted to recognize the untiring and patient and effective efforts of \nthe Senator from Utah on this very worthwhile effort.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my dear colleague for those kind remarks. As he \nknows, there have been some on our side that did not want hardly any of \nthe Clinton judges, especially the more liberal ones, some of whom have \ngone to circuit court of appeals.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will allow me to interject, I remember the \nSenator from Utah received some criticism from this side of the aisle, \nand so did I, as we tried to move some of these judges through the \nprocess. We may have voted against them, which I did in at least a \ncouple of instances, but I thought they deserved a vote. And we made \nsure that those votes took place.\n  Mr. HATCH. We did that.\n  I thank my colleague because as the leader he helped me to do the job \nfor the Clinton administration. The President deserved the best we \ncould do. Do we get everything done? No one has ever gotten everything \ndone at the end of anyone's administration.\n  He is right. Our record was much superior to when the Democrats \ncontrolled the committee.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. LOTT. I again thank Senator Hatch for the effort. I remember even \nlast year at one point I think we had approximately 70 judges on the \ncalendar, a large number, and there was disagreement about how to \nproceed. There was an indication we would have to have a recorded vote \non every one of them, even though many of them could be moved on a \nvoice vote with no problem. It looked like we were not going to be able \nto move them, but Senator Daschle and I kept talking about them and \nkept working on it, and we began to move them in blocks. We finished \nthe process and we had moved, I think, almost all of them, if not all \nof them. That was an example of how there can be cooperation in this \nvery important area of confirmation of judges.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask the Senator on our side, when he concludes, Senator \nKennedy has 2 minutes. We yielded our time.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts \nwhen I have finished my remarks.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me talk briefly about the situation we find ourselves \nin, specifically, the nomination of Miguel Estrada to be a DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals Judge.\n  I made a brief speech about a month ago saying I thought this was a \nhighly qualified candidate, one who had lived the American dream, \nhaving been born in Honduras, coming here when he was 17, and \nhighlighting the phenomenal life he has lived. I thought it was a \nmatter we would do pro forma. I assumed we would have some debate and \nsome disagreement, but since he is a great nominee, I thought he would \nbe confirmed a month ago or more. But here we are still.\n  I will not go back and recount all of his qualifications. All the \nSenators know, and most of America knows now, Miguel Estrada is \ncertainly qualified to be a circuit court of appeals judge. He is \nqualified by education. He went to some of the best schools in America \nwhere he was Phi Beta Kappa, a Magna Cum Laude graduate, editor of the \nHarvard Law Review at that citadel of great conservative legal \nthinking. Now, he is accused of being conservative; a committed \nconservative, despite his broad background. He was editor of the \nHarvard Law Review, if you will. So by education he is qualified.\n  There are some points and comments from the Federalist Papers, a \ncouple of considerations, that you should look into when you consider a \njudge. One is whether or not they are fit in the area of character. \nThis is a man that has lived an exemplary life. There is no allegation \nof impropriety, no allegation of ethical misconduct. None whatsoever. \nSo by education, by character, by ethics, and by experience he is an \nincredible nominee.\n  Some say he has not been a lower court judge. That is not always the \ncriteria. We have a lot of people who have gone to the circuit court of \nappeals, even the Supreme Court, without having earlier been a judge in \nanother court. But he has been involved by working with the Federal \njudiciary, and by serving as an Assistant to the Solicitor General. He \nhas argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court. I have only been able to \nwitness one case where I sat in the audience and listened to the snail \ndarter case before\n\n[[Page S3677]]\n\nthe Supreme Court. Listening to the arguments in that one case was \nenough for me. I left and never returned. But surely, clearly, everyone \nin this body knows this man is qualified to be a judge on the circuit \ncourt of appeals.\n\n  So what is the problem? What are they saying?\n  There is the suggestion that maybe he has a certain philosophy or a \ncertain ideology, and that is a disqualification. If that were a \ndisqualification, there are many judges I voted on during the Clinton \nyears and at other points during my service in this chamber whom I \nwould have voted against. I voted for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg even \nthough I didn't agree with her philosophy and knew I probably wouldn't \nagree with a lot of her decisions, but she was qualified. She was the \nPresident's choice.\n  I think the burden is on the Senate to show why we should not confirm \na nominee if they are qualified, have the proper experience, and don't \nhave ethical problems. She met those criteria. I voted for her.\n  What is the problem here? Some Senators want more questions asked? \nAlright, that is a legitimate point. It is part of the advice and \nconsent role of the Senate. Let's hear what the nominees have to say.\n  He had a long hearing before the Judiciary Committee. Every question \nin the world that could be thought of was asked of this nominee. He was \nasked hypothetical cases to which I personally would not respond. I \nthought that on a lot of things he was asked, he was very careful in \nhow he responded. You don't want to prejudice your decision. You don't \nwant to pass judgment on a Supreme Court decision on which your future \ndecisions as a judge may be based. The number one factor for the Senate \nto keep in mind on this point, however, is that he has offered to meet \nwith any Senator personally who wants to meet with him.\n  Secondly, Senators on both sides have been told if you want to ask \nmore questions, then submit the questions, and he will answer the \nquestions.\n  Finally, even a day or so ago, Senator Frist--against some advice \nthat perhaps this pattern should not be started--said Mr. Estrada would \nbe willing to go back to the Judiciary Committee so that interested \nSenators could ask him some more questions, with an understanding he \nwould get a vote. Unfortunately, that offer was turned down, too. They \nsay they want to ask him more questions, but when they are given a \nchance to meet with the nominee or a chance to ask more questions, they \ndon't ask them. When we say he is willing to go back for another \nhearing under these circumstances--no, they don't want that either. \nWhat do they say they want? They want internal memos from the time that \nhe was working as an Assistant to the Solicitor General.\n  I believe that maybe something can be worked out on that. But you \ncannot set that precedent. Let me tell you why. If all these internal \nmemos are made public in this instance, I guarantee future young \nattorneys in the Solicitor's Office, they will not be giving honest \nadvice. No, no, they will pull their punches because they will know, \nanything I say in this written document may someday be used against me \nbeing confirmed as a Federal judge or in some other way. So this is not \nan insignificant request.\n  Should we try to find a way to work it out? I think so. But then I \nhave been accused in the past of trying to get things done.\n\n  If everybody wants to make a statement around here to make their \nconstituency happy, great. This is the way to do it. The People for the \nAmerican Way and other liberal organizations--if Estrada is blocked--\nthey will be happy. These political reasons are why many Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle are opposing Mr. Estrada, but I want to \npoint out that there are some notable exceptions, and I hope there will \nbe more.\n  But on our side, we are able to say: This is an Hispanic nominee, and \nour core constituency groups are going to be happy. Republicans are \nhappy, with us duking it out for this nominee to be on the Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Many will say that they are taking a stand, which is \ngreat.\n  How great is it when he is not confirmed? That is the goal here. I am \nnot interested in blaming somebody or appeasing someone on our side. \nThis man is qualified. We have vacancies on this court that should be \nfilled. It is irresponsible for us not to find a way to work this out \nand get this nominee on the court.\n  So I say a pox on everybody's house if we are just trying to find a \nway to score political points with this man's life on hold while we do \nthis thing that we are doing here. I really do think we are setting a \ndangerous precedent here, one we did not set in the past. We have not \nfilibustered Federal judicial nominees. It is clearly not in the \nConstitution. I think advice and consent means 51 votes, not two-\nthirds; not 60--51.\n  You might say the Constitution doesn't make that clear. In the \nConstitution, article II, section 2, when the Framers of the \nConstitution were writing this out, when they intended supermajority \nvotes, they said so. It clearly says in article II, section 2: To make \ntreaties provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur. They \nspecify two-thirds. When they said advice and consent, I believe they \nintended and expected, unless there were serious problems, that these \nnominees to the Federal judiciary would be confirmed with a vote, an \nup-or-down vote of 51.\n  I think what we are doing here is questionable constitutionally. We \nhave never done this on a district or circuit court nominee before. Now \nwe are about to do it.\n  Let me tell you what is scary. It may not be just about nominee \nEstrada. Next it is going to be Priscilla Owen. They are going to \nfilibuster Priscilla Owen, a qualified woman who is a brilliant Supreme \nCourt Justice in the State of Texas. I am sure they will extend it to \nother nominees, as well--maybe Sutton, maybe Cook, maybe Pickering. Is \nthis a pattern?\n  Who in this room, and outside this room, believes that this tit-for-\ntat will not continue? Do they think that once we, Heaven forbid, ever \nhave another Democrat President, that Republicans are not going to \nreturn the favor? We are going to filibuster them.\n  We have to stop this. I think we, the leaders, the Republicans, the \nDemocrats, past and present, have to assume responsibility for how this \nhas continued to escalate.\n  Did we do some things during the Clinton years with judges that we \nshould not have done? Yes. But did we take up the cause and try to do \nthe right thing on many occasions? Yes. That is why I am here today, \nbecause I do believe I have been a part of the solution and part of the \nproblem in the past. I acknowledge it. But when I was the Majority \nLeader, I called up nominations that were controversial.\n  I remember on one occasion we did have a threatened filibuster and a \ncloture vote which was defeated. I made a speech standing right there \nsaying: My colleagues, we don't want to do this. This was a judge \nnominated by President Clinton, but really it was a judge whom Orrin \nHatch recommended. His name was Brian Theodore Stewart. Unfortunately, \nthough, cloture was defeated. So we started talking about that, and \ncooler heads prevailed. Shortly thereafter, we confirmed this judge. \nThat was the only time we came close, during the past 7 years, to \nhaving a filibuster on a judge. We got right up to it, but we didn't do \nit, because we knew we couldn't do it and that it was wrong. So, \nfortunately we backed away from it.\n  In terms of what was done in the past, again, I resisted filibusters. \nI didn't want to have filibusters, even though I voted against Judges \nPaez and Berzon on their up-or-down confirmation votes. But Senator \nHatch and I took a lot of grief. We said, no, they have come out of \ncommittee, they deserve an up-or-down vote. They got the vote, and they \nwere confirmed. They each got an up-or-down vote, not a filibuster. \nSome people thought they should have been filibustered. I didn't think \nthey should have been, and they weren't.\n  My colleagues, I ask us here today: Where do we go from here? What is \nnext?\n  The argument can be made that you filibuster a lot of different ways. \nYou don't let them out of committee; I know about that approach. The \nlast Congress, I know two judges who were defeated on a straight party-\nline vote in the Judiciary Committee. They were not allowed to come to \nthe floor to have a vote, and I believe the Constitution requires they \nshould come here\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\nand have a vote, not be killed by 11 Senators in the Judiciary \nCommittee, or 10, or whatever the number may be.\n  So, I accept part of the blame. I acknowledge that Republicans have \nnot always handled judges in the right way. But I ask the question \nagain, what next? We are going to kill them in committee? We are going \nto kill them by filibuster? This is wrong, my colleagues. We should not \ndo this.\n  We are starting down a trail that is unfair, and it is going to come \nback to haunt this institution, haunt both parties, and damage the \nlives of innocent men and women.\n  I urge my colleagues, find a way to move this judicial nominee, \nMiguel Estrada. He deserves better. He should be confirmed.\n  Some people say: Wait, if we don't stop him now, he may be on the \nSupreme Court. Well let's test him. Let's confirm him. Let's see how he \ndoes. We might be surprised. We might even be disappointed. I have been \nsurprised at times. I voted for a couple of Supreme Court Justices and \nwished I could take the vote back because when they got there, they \nwere not what I thought they were going to be. Men and women can do \nsurprising things when they become Federal judges for life.\n  So I just felt a need to come down and recall some of the things that \nhave happened, admit some of the mistakes, try to sober this \ninstitution up. This is a great institution that does pay attention to \nprecedents. It does, sometimes, start in the wrong direction, but most \nof the time we pull ourselves back from the brink; we find a way to get \nit done. I hope and I certainly feel down deep we are going to find a \nway to not set this precedent and not defeat this qualified nominee \nwith a filibuster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to make a brief response to the \npoints made by our colleagues on the floor and in the press during the \npast week.\n  It is not true that majority rule is the only rule in our country. \nThe purpose of the great checks and balances under the Constitution is \nto protect the country from the tyranny of the majority. As far as \nshutting off debate in the Senate is concerned, majority rule has not \nbeen the rule since 1806. Even in our presidential elections, majority \nrule is not the rule, or we would have a different President today.\n  There is nothing even arguably unconstitutional about the Senate Rule \nproviding for unlimited debate unless and until 60 Senators vote to cut \noff debate. The same Constitution which gave the Senate the power of \nadvice and consent gave the Senate the power to adopt its own rules for \nthe exercise of all of its powers, including the rules for exercising \nour advice and consent power.\n  The Constitution does not say that judges shall be appointed by the \nPresident as he wishes. It says that they shall be appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate. We are not potted \nplants decorating one end of Pennsylvania Avenue. We play a very \nspecial role under the Constitution. The Founders gave us numerous \npowers to balance and moderate the powers of the President. They gave \nus longer terms than the President, and staggered our terms, so we \nwould be less subject to the passions of the time. Clearly, we have the \npower and the responsibility to oppose the President when he refuses to \nprovide us with the only documentation that can tell us what kind of \nperson he has nominated for a lifetime appointment on the Nation's \nsecond highest court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 36, which the \nclerk will report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3678-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3678-S3693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF JAY S. BYBEE, OF NEVADA, TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT \n                      JUDGE FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Jay S. Bybee, \nof Nevada, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 6 \nhours of debate equally divided in the usual form on the nomination.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Leahy, the manager of this side, \nrequested that I speak now.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that we will be moving forward on the \nnomination of Jay Bybee for U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit. This is an important job which Jay Bybee will have. It is the \nlargest circuit as far as the number of judges that we have.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is here. I would be happy to \nyield to the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. President, the Ninth Circuit is the largest circuit, with a full \ncomplement of 28 or 29 judges. It is a circuit that certainly is \nimportant to my State, the State of Nevada, and the entire western part \nof the United States. It is a controversial circuit. There have been \nefforts made in the past to change the makeup of the court and have \nStates divided so we could create another circuit. No one can take away \nfrom the importance of this circuit. The State of California alone, \nwith some 35 million people, is under the jurisdiction of the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  The last time I had a conversation with a member of the Bybee family \nwas on an airplane. Mrs. Bybee was on the plane. She is a lovely woman. \nCertainly Jay Bybee is a proud husband and father, as well he should \nbe. I commented to Mrs. Bybee, Why does he have to write so much? He \nhas written Law Review articles. He has written lots of articles on \nvery controversial subjects. But the good thing about Jay Bybee is that \nhe can explain why he wrote those articles. He is a person--while some \nmay disagree with the conclusions that he reached in his large \narticles--who has the intellectual capacity to explain his reasoning. \nHe has excellent legal qualifications, not only from an educational \nperspective but from an experience perspective.\n  He served as legal adviser during the first Bush administration. He \nhas helped to teach a generation of new lawyers as a former professor \nat the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Boyd School of Law, and he has \ntaught at other places. He is someone who will bring distinction to the \nNinth Circuit.\n  He was favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nFebruary 28. The swift pace of this nomination demonstrates how the \nprocess can work when both sides of the aisle work together, when the \nPresident works with Senators of the other party, and when the advise \nand consent clause of our Constitution is respected.\n  Senator John Ensign and I work closely on all issues that affect \nNevada, and on judges it is certainly no different. John Ensign is a \nclass act. The way he handles being in the majority is classic. We know \nthe difference, both having served in the majority. It would be \ncertainly easy for him just to submit a name and not run it past me. \nBut, of course, he didn't. When he came up with the name Bybee, I said \nof course.\n  I have a lot of reasons for supporting people named Bybee. One reason \nis--I don't know the lineage--because there are a lot of Bybees in Utah \nand Nevada. But when I was in college I fought for a man by the name of \n``Spike'' Bybee. He was a police officer in Cedar City, UT. But he \ndevoted long hours of his time training fighters. ``Spike'' moved to \nLas Vegas where he became a respected probation officer. But my fondest \nmemories of ``Spike'' Bybee were during the time he spent with me \ntaking me in Arizona, Utah, and Nevada as my manager. Anyway, just for \nno other reason than I traveled around the country with someone who \nhelped me through some difficult times--a fine man. He died at a young \nage from a very bad disease. I have the name Bybee in my mind from some \nof the times in my youth.\n\n  I indicated Senator Ensign and I consulted on Mr. Bybee's nomination \nwhen Senator Leahy chaired the Judiciary Committee for a short time. \nMr. Bybee was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in compliance \nwith the committee's rules when Senator Hatch was chairman.\n  The consultation and respect for the rules is why we are here today, \nmoving forward to fill the Ninth Circuit seat held by Proctor Hug, Jr. \nsince 1977.\n  I must say a few things about Proctor Hug. He is a fine man and a \ngreat athlete. He went to Sparks High School. He was an all-star \nathlete in football, track, and basketball. He ran track in college, \nwas State debate champion. He was student body president at Sparks High \nSchool. He met his\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\nfuture wife, Barbara Van Meter, at Sparks High School. He became \nstudent body president at the University of Nevada.\n  He served his country honorably in the Navy and then went to one of \nthe most prestigious law schools in the entire country, Stanford Law.\n  He was appointed by President Carter and became Chief Judge of the \nNinth Circuit in 1996. He was a good ``Chief,'' as the other judges \ncalled him. He came back here a lot of times lobbying as a judge for \nissues important to the Ninth Circuit and the Federal judiciary.\n  Judge Proctor Hug set a fine example of what it means not only to be \na judge but to serve your community and your country.\n  To show what great judgment Proctor Hug has, two of my sons were his \nlaw clerks, and one was his administrative assistant when he was chief \njudge. He signed up with Judge Hug for 2 years. He was a fine \nadministrative assistant.\n  I expect Jay Bybee will follow in the evenhanded and impartial path \nset by his predecessor, Judge Proctor Hug.\n  The point is that where there is consultation, the nominating process \nworks well. When consultation was the rule, where blue slips were \nissued and made public, the body swiftly confirmed 100 judges, as my \nfriends know.\n  Talking about the 100 judges, when we were in control of the Senate--\neven over here in the minority, 11 judges by the end of today will have \nbeen approved for the circuit court, the trial court, and the Court of \nInternational Trade. In the last 24 hours we will have approved five \njudges--a circuit court judge, two trial court judges yesterday, and \ntwo today. We are moving along quite well.\n  I am not going to get into we did this and they did that. The fact is \nwhoever did what, we are still filling a lot of judicial vacancies \naround the country.\n  I think it is important that we proceed to recognize we have a \nproblem with Mr. Estrada. I know my dear friend, the junior Senator \nfrom Mississippi, the majority and minority leader during my time here \nin the Senate, recognizes that if he is going to get Estrada done, \nsomething different has to be done than what we have been doing.\n  I read in today's New York Times where the junior Senator from \nMississippi said--I am paraphrasing, but he basically says: If we--\ntalking about the Republicans--want to get Estrada done, then we are \ngoing to have to do something different. And, obviously, what we want \ndone is to have supplied the records when he was in the Solicitor's \nOffice and reconvene the committee and have the hearing.\n\n  Now, there are people who may vote for Estrada, if we could get \nthrough that process--Democrats. I think there would be a number of \nthem. But until we get that information, and find out if something is \nbeing hidden--maybe there has been a perusal of all those documents, \nand maybe they can't be given to us. Maybe they can't be given to us \nbecause he has said things there. Maybe, as Paul Bender said, he is \nsuch an ideologue, and maybe he has written about all those things Paul \nBender said when he was in the Solicitor General's Office. I don't \nknow. But I would suggest that would be the best way to get over this \nhump.\n  The fact is, though, today we should not be dwelling on what we have \nnot been able to do, but we should be talking about what we have done.\n  Today, we are going to confirm a circuit court judge. We are going to \nmake a man--Uay Bybee--so happy; he was, on more than one occasion \nduring his short tenure at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas--a new \nlaw school just accredited--selected as the No. 1 professor, the best \nprofessor, at that law school. He was not selected by the other \nprofessors. He was selected by the students.\n  Jay Bybee has a great personality. He has an in-depth knowledge of \nthe law. He comes with a background from a wonderful family. I am so \nglad we are able today to confirm this man for a lifetime appointment \nto the Federal judiciary.\n  We keep talking about the DC Court of Appeals being right under the \nSupreme Court. So is the Ninth Circuit. It is the highest court you can \nserve on except for the Supreme Court.\n  Jay Bybee will serve with distinction and honor, and not only \nrepresent the State of Nevada well, and the students he taught at \nLouisiana and UNLV, but he will also represent the whole country, being \na credit to the bar and to the judiciary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield such time as he needs to the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Nevada, my \ncolleague, Mr. Reid, for all of the work he has done in helping us \nshepherd the nomination of Jay Bybee through this nomination process \nfor the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Without his help, with the way \nthings are around here, we know this would not be happening today. That \nwould be a shame because Jay Bybee is incredibly qualified. Everybody \nwho has ever been associated with him understands that.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak to my colleagues about a man of \nthe highest legal distinction, Mr. Jay Bybee. Mr. Bybee's experience \nand background, and his unquestioned dedication to the fair application \nof the law, make him an ideal nominee for the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  As many of you know, Mr. Bybee appeared before this body in 2001 as a \nnominee to serve as Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal \nCounsel at the Department of Justice. He was confirmed unanimously by \nthe Senate on October 23, 2001.\n  As head of the Office of Legal Counsel, Jay assists the Attorney \nGeneral in his role as legal advisor to the President and all the \nexecutive branch agencies. The Office is also responsible for providing \nlegal advice to the executive branch on all constitutional questions \nand reviewing pending legislation for constitutionality.\n  Though a native of the chairman's home State of Utah, Nevada is proud \nto claim Jay as one of its own. Before his confirmation in the Senate \nin 2001, Mr. Bybee joined the founding faculty and served as a \nProfessor of Law at the William Boyd School of Law at the University of \nNevada, Las Vegas. Mr. Bybee's scholarly interests have focused in the \nareas of constitutional and administrative law. His dedication to \nensuring that young law students learn the highest standards of legal \npractice resulted in his being named the Professor of the Year in 2000.\n  Mr. Bybee is known throughout the legal community as one of the \nforemost constitutional law scholars in the United States. He is \nregarded as extremely fair minded and adheres to the highest ethical \nand professional standards. He is admired throughout the legal \nprofession as both a leader and a gentleman. Most importantly, Jay \nunderstands the rule of law, and will consistently and carefully \nconsider the arguments on both sides of a legal question with an open \nmind. Because of Jay's combination of his legal skills along with his \ncommitment to fairness, I have no doubts that he will serve in the best \ntraditions of the federal judiciary.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Bybee's service will be an invaluable asset to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals. As you are aware, the Ninth Circuit is \nfacing an overwhelming caseload, and the seat that Mr. Bybee has been \nnominated is designated as a ``judicial emergency'' by the Judiciary \nConference of the United States.\n  Caseloads in the entire federal court system, including in the Ninth \nCircuit, continue to grow dramatically. Filings in the federal appeals \ncourt reached an all time high again last year. The Chief Justice \nrecently warned that the alarming number of vacancies, combined with \nthe rising number of caseloads, threatens the proper functioning of the \nfederal courts. The American Bar Association has called the situation \nan ``emergency.''\n  There are currently four vacancies in the 28-judge court of the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, with one more vacancy already announced \neffective in November 2003. The Judicial Conference has asked for two \nnew permanent and three temporary seats on the Ninth Circuit, just to \ncope with the caseload. That brings the total to 33 judges that are \nneeded just to handle the caseload on the Ninth Circuit. Today there \nare only 24 judges doing the job of 33. This situation has to change.\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\n  That is why it is extremely important that the Senate approve the \nnomination of Jay Bybee today, and that the Senate continue to consider \neach one of the President's judicial nominations as quickly as \npossible.\n  I would like to thank the chairman and the entire Judiciary Committee \nand their staff for their hard work in shepherding this nominee through \nthe process. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote in support of \nJay Bybee's appointment to the Ninth Circuit today.\n  Mr. President, I first met Jay Bybee a few years ago. I had \npreviously heard some great things from people in the community of \nsouthern Nevada about this legal scholar out at the new UNLV Boyd \nSchool of Law. I wanted to sit down and meet with him, to talk to him, \nand just pick his brain about the Constitution.\n  I am a veterinarian by profession, so I am not a lawyer and did not \nattend law school as many of our colleagues have. I thought, the more I \ncould learn from scholars such as Jay Bybee, the educated I would be \nand therefore the better Senator I would be.\n  We sat down for over an hour. I could have stayed there all day. He \nhas a fascinating mind. He has incredible knowledge of the \nConstitution, of this nation's history and of case law.\n  When I first was elected to the Senate, because President Bush had \nbeen elected I knew it would come upon me to recommend judges for the \nState of Nevada. I didn't have many ties in the legal community, so I \nhad to look to Nevadans on whom I could count on for advice. One of the \npeople I went to was Jay Bybee. He helped me tremendously in the \ninterview process.\n  I actually felt sorry for the people who were coming before us \nbecause of the difficulty and depth of the questions Jay Bybee would \nask them. It was because of that experience, when this process came \nforward, that I sent his name to the White House.\n  When the White House began to consider Jay Bybee, they realized \nimmediately what a talent he is. That is why the Attorney General's \nOffice took him away from the Boyd School of Law, to the position he is \nnow in, in the Attorney General's Office. He advises the Attorney \nGeneral on constitutional matters. That is how much they think of his \nconstitutional expertise.\n  At the Boyd School of Law, and in the legal community in Nevada, \nthere is nobody more highly thought of as a constitutional expert than \nJay Bybee--both liberals and conservatives. They understand his \nexpertise and the way he looks at law. Literally, I have talked to \nstudents from the far left end of the political spectrum to the far \nright end of the political spectrum, and they all talk about him with \nglowing remarks. It is truly amazing. I think it tells a lot to his \ncharacter and a lot to his intellect.\n  I think he has the right tools intellectually, the right temperament \nand the right character to serve on the 9th Circuit. He has all the \nqualifications we want for someone to be on the Ninth Circuit--and \nespecially the Ninth Circuit, the most controversial circuit we have in \nthe United States. As you know, this is the circuit that just ruled \nthat the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional, and this body voted \nunanimously to condemn that and say we do not agree with that \ninterpretation.\n  The Ninth Circuit needs help. We need qualified judges to give that \nhelp. Jay Bybee is exactly the kind of person we need to the 9th \nCircuit. There are currently four vacancies on the Ninth Circuit, and \nsoon to be a fifth. The Judicial Conference recently also requested two \nnew permanent judges and three temporary judges. They have a huge \ncrisis on the Ninth Circuit because there are so many backlogged cases. \nIt has been said on this floor: Justice delayed is justice denied. That \nis what is happening in the Ninth Circuit.\n  So it is important to approve Jay Bybee's nomination today, and to \nbegin our work to appoint other judges to fill those vacancies I \nmentioned. It is my hope that we can get the new judgeships approved \nthrough this body so the Ninth Circuit can catch up on their caseload.\n  So enthusiastically, Mr. President, I recommend that we vote to \nconfirm this outstanding nominee, Jay Bybee. He is a great family man. \nHe will make a great judge. And he will be there for a long time, God \nwilling, having a positive influence on the Ninth Circuit.\n  With that, I once again thank the senior Senator from Nevada. I also \nthank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his work in getting \nJay Bybee's nomination to the floor. We appreciate all the indulgences. \nI know the Chairman has to constantly answer to each individual \nSenator, and we can be kind of a pain sometimes, but we sure appreciate \nthe work done in getting Jay Bybee's nomination to this day when we can \nfinally get him confirmed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my two colleagues from Nevada. You \nvery seldom see two colleagues from different parties working so well \ntogether. They are both excellent people.\n  We all respect Senator Reid. He is one of the moderate voices around \nhere who tries to get things to work. And I personally appreciate it. \nAnd the distinguished junior Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign--I have \nnot seen a better Senator in years. He is certainly making a difference \non our side. And I believe, working with his colleague on the other \nside, he is getting a lot of things done for Nevada and for the \nIntermountain West, and it is terrific. So I pay tribute to both of \nthem.\n  I am pleased we are considering the nomination of Jay S. Bybee who \nhas been nominated by President Bush to serve on the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Professor Bybee has a sterling \nresume and a record of distinguished public service. I know him \npersonally. I am a personal friend. I know his quality. I know what a \ngood thinker he is. I know what a great teacher he has been. I know \nwhat a great job he has done down at Justice. He is a person everybody \nought to support because he is a truly wonderful, upright, good, hard-\nworking, intelligent individual.\n  Professor Bybee is currently on leave from the University of Nevada \nat Las Vegas William S. Boyd School of Law, where he has served as a \nprofessor since the law school's founding in 1999. Since October 2001, \nhe has served as Assistant Attorney General for the Department of \nJustice Office of Legal Counsel. Notably, this is a post formerly held \nby two current Supreme Court Justices. As head of the Office of Legal \nCounsel, Professor Bybee assists the Attorney General in his function \nas legal advisor to the President and all executive branch agencies. \nThe office also is responsible for providing legal advice to the \nexecutive branch on all constitutional questions and reviewing pending \nlegislation for constitutionality.\n  Professor Bybee, a California native, attended Brigham Young \nUniversity, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics, magna cum \nlaude, and a law degree, cum laude. While in law school, he was a \nmember of the BYU Law Review.\n  Following graduation, Professor Bybee served as a law clerk to Judge \nDonald Russell of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals before joining \nthe firm of Sidley & Austin--one of the great law firms. In 1984, he \naccepted a position with the Department of Justice, first joining the \nOffice of Legal Policy, and then working with the Appellate Staff of \nthe Civil Division. In that capacity, Professor Bybee prepared briefs \nand presented oral arguments in the U.S. Courts of Appeals. From 1989 \nto 1991, Professor Bybee served as Associate Counsel to President \nGeorge H.W. Bush.\n  Profeesor Bybee is a leading scholar in the areas of constitutional \nand administrative law. Before he joined the law faculty at UNLV, he \nestablished his scholarly credentials at the Paul M. Hebert Law Center \nat Louisiana State University, where he taught from 1991 to 1998. His \ncolleagues have described Professor Bybee as a first-rate teacher, a \ncareful and balanced scholar, and a hardworking and open-minded \nindividual with the type of broad legal experience the Federal bench \nneeds.\n  Professor Bybee comes highly recommended. One of his supporters is \nMr. William Marshall, a professor of law at the University of North \nCarolina. Mr. Marshall served in a number of high-level posts in the \nClinton administration including a stint as Deputy White House Counsel \nand, notably, as a counsel in the Office of Legal Policy at the\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\nDepartment of Justice, where he participated in the judicial selection \nprocess by screening prospective Clinton administrative nominees. In \nhis letter to the committee supporting Professor Bybee, Mr. Marshall \nsaid:\n\n       The combination of his analytic skills along with his \n     personal commitment to fairness and dispassion lead me to \n     conclude that he will serve in the best traditions of the \n     Federal judiciary. He understands the rule of law and he will \n     follow it completely.\n\n  Stuart Green, a law professor at Louisiana State University who \ndescribes himself as a ``liberal Democrat and active member of the \nACLU,'' said:\n\n       I have always found [Jay Bybee] to be an extremely fair-\n     minded and thoughtful person. Indeed, Jay truly has what can \n     best be described as a `judicious' temperament, and I would \n     fully expect him to be a force for reasonableness and \n     conciliation on a court that has been known for its \n     fractiousness.\n\n  This self-described liberal Democrat states that Professor Bybee will \nbring some balance to the Ninth Circuit. I remind my colleagues that in \nthis court 14 of the 24 active judges, including 14 of the last 15 \nconfirmed, were appointed by President Clinton.\n  This court was recently in the news with yet another controversial \ndecision. We are all familiar with the Ninth Circuit's recent ruling \nwhich held the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag as unconstitutional \nunder the Establishment Clause because the Pledge contains the phrase \n``under God.''\n  The Ninth Circuit's high reversal rate by the Supreme Court is well \ndocumented, but less well known is the Ninth Circuit's propensity for \nreversing death sentences, with some judges voting to do so almost as a \nmatter of course. No doubt the Ninth Circuit has some of the nation's \nmost intelligent judges, but some cannot seem to follow the law. Just \nthis term, the U.S. Supreme Court summarily reversed the Ninth Circuit \nthree times in one day and vacated an opinion 9-0.\n  With two judicial emergencies in the Ninth Circuit, Professor Bybee \nis the type of judge we need. He is committed to applying and upholding \nthe law. He will be a terrific judge. That circuit represents over 9 \nmillion people, the largest in the country. It has the most judges on a \ncircuit court of appeals in the Nation. They need him.\n  Additional letters in support of Professor Bybee illustrate his \nprofessional competence and personal characteristics which will serve \nhim well on the bench. Colleagues at UNLV deserve Professor Bybee as \n``widely and properly regarded as a leading constitutional law expert, \nand his expertise extends to many other areas of law as well.  . . . \nBybee is highly intelligent, industrious, diligent, and responsible. He \nhas outstanding judgment and is a rock of stability. . . . Perhaps \nabove all, he respects and works effectively with persons of diverse \nperspectives, temperaments, and ideology.''\n  Another colleague of Professor Bybee wrote, ``I should note that my \npersonal politics are quite different from Bybee's, but Jay's \ntremendous intelligence, work ethic and, above all, his integrity and \ndesire to complete each and every task not only to the best of his \nability, but also to do the right thing with it, convinces me that I \nwould rather have him be a federal judge than many or most who share \nmore closely my own politics.''\n\n  The committee has received similar letters in support of Professor \nBybee from law professors and administrators throughout the nation, \nincluding the Dean of The George Washington University Law School.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these supporting Professor Bybee's \nnomination be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. HATCH. The legal bar's wide regard for Professor Bybee is \nreflected in his evaluation by the American Bar Association. Based on \nhis professional qualifications, integrity, professional competence, \nand judicial temperament, the ABA has bestowed upon Professor Bybee a \nrating of Well Qualified.\n  This Senate has previously found Professor Bybee worthy of \nconfirmation for a position of high responsibility in the government, \nand I am confident it will do so again today.\n  Professor Bybee is providing the Nation with exceptional service in \nhis current position as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the \nOffice of Legal Counsel. This office assists the Attorney General in \nhis function as legal advisor to the President and all the executive \nbranch agencies.\n\n  The office drafts legal opinions of the Attorney General and also \nprovides its own written opinions and oral advice in response to \nrequests from the Counsel to the President, the various agencies of the \nexecutive branch, and offices within the department. Such requests \ntypically deal with legal issues of particular complexity and \nimportance or issues about which two or more agencies are in \ndisagreement.\n  The office also is responsible for providing legal advice to the \nexecutive branch on all constitutional questions and reviewing pending \nlegislation for constitutionality. All executive orders and \nproclamations proposed to be issued by the President are reviewed by \nthe Office of Legal Counsel for form and legality, as are various other \nmatters that require the President's formal approval.\n  In addition to serving as, in effect, outside counsel for the other \nagencies of the executive branch, the Office of Legal Counsel also \nfunctions as general counsel for the Department itself. It reviews all \nproposed orders of the Attorney General and all regulations requiring \nthe Attorney General's approval. It also performs a variety of special \nassignments referred by the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. In this position, Professor Bybee has performed in an \noutstanding manner. He has rendered great service to our Nation, he has \nearned bipartisan respect and support, and is fully prepared to be a \nFederal circuit court of appeals judge.\n\n  (Ms. MURKOWSKI assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am confident that as the Senate \nconfirms Professor Bybee, Democrats and Republicans can all share in \nthe pride of a job well done. This Senate will have properly exercised \nits proper constitutional role of advice and consent. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                      University of North Carolina\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                Chapel Hill, NC, January 27, 2003.\n     Re: Jay Bybee.\n\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: I am writing this on behalf of the \n     nomination of Jay Bybee to the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n       First let me introduce myself. I am currently the Kenan \n     Professor of Law at the University of North Carolina School \n     of Law and have taught law for almost 20 years. I also worked \n     in the Clinton Administration as the Deputy Counsel to the \n     President under Beth Nolan and previously as an Associate \n     Counsel to the President under Charles Ruff. In addition, I \n     served under Assistant Attorney General Eldie Acheson in the \n     Justice Department during the spring and summer of 1993 \n     during which my task was to begin the processes of judicial \n     selection for Clinton Administration appointments. I am \n     therefore well familiar with the judicial selection process.\n       I have come to know Jay Bybee in my work as a law professor \n     both through his writings and through the interactions we \n     have had at numerous legal conferences and academic events. \n     He is an extremely impressive person. To begin with, he is a \n     remarkable scholar. His ideas are creative, insightful, and \n     stimulating and his analysis is careful and precise. I \n     believe him to be one of the most learned and respected \n     constitutional law experts in the country.\n       He is also an individual with exceptional personal \n     qualities. I have always been struck by the balance that he \n     brings to his legal analysis and the sense of respect and \n     deference that he applies to everybody he encounters--\n     including those who may disagree with him. He is someone who \n     truly hears and considers opposing positions. Most \n     importantly he is a person who adheres to the highest of \n     ethical standards. I respect his integrity and trust his \n     judgement.\n       Needless to say, I believe that Jay Bybee's professional \n     and personal skills make him an outstanding candidate for a \n     federal judgeship. The combination of his analytic skills \n     along with his personal commitment to fairness and dispassion \n     lead me to conclude that he will serve in the best traditions \n     of the federal judiciary. He understands the rule of law and \n     he will follow it completely. He is an exceptional candidate \n     for the Ninth Circuit and I support his nomination without \n     reservation.\n       I hope these comments are helpful to you. Please feel free \n     to contact me if you have any further questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              William P. Marshall,\n                                           Kenan Professor of Law.\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                             University of Glasgow\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                              Glasgow, Scotland, January 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: I am delighted to have the opportunity \n     to recommend to you my former colleague, Jay Bybee, who has \n     been nominated to a seat on the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. I got to know Jay Bybee during the approximately \n     four years we served together on the Louisiana State \n     University law faculty, where I am a professor of law. \n     (During the 2002-03 academic year, I am on sabbatical, \n     serving as Fulbright Distinguished Scholar to the United \n     Kingdom, in residence at the University of Glasgow.)\n       Jay is a person of high intelligence, genuine decency, and \n     a strong work ethic. He was an always reliable and generous \n     colleague, a popular and effective teacher, and a creative \n     and insightful scholar. He must surely be regarded as one of \n     the leading constitutional law thinkers in the United States, \n     particularly with respect to questions of separation of \n     powers and the religion clauses of the First Amendment. I \n     have no doubt that he will quickly establish himself as a \n     leading member of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Jay and I differ on many issues of politics and law (unlike \n     Jay, I am a liberal Democrat and active member of the ACLU). \n     Yet I have always found him to be an extremely fairminded and \n     thoughtful person. Indeed, Jay truly has what can best be \n     described as a ``judicious'' temperament, and I would fully \n     expect him to be a force for reasonableness and conciliation \n     on a court that has been known for its fractiousness.\n       In short, I am pleased to recommend Jay Bybee \n     enthusiastically and without any reservation to be a judge of \n     the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stuart P. Green.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   University of Nevada Las Vegas,\n\n\n                                William S. Boyd School of Law,\n\n                                  Las Vegas, NV, January 29, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: I enthusiastically support the \n     nomination of Jay S. Bybee to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and I hope that you and your \n     colleagues will confirm his nomination. Professor Bybee is an \n     outstanding teacher, scholar, lawyer, public servant and \n     human being. He will become a splendid judge, exactly the \n     sort who ought to sit on the appellate courts of our country.\n       I have known Jay Bybee for about five years, since I began \n     to recruit him for a position on the founding faculty of our \n     new law school here at UNLV. We were very fortunate to \n     recruit a faculty member of Jay's quality--he is a superb \n     teacher, a very well-published scholar and a very productive \n     and collegial faculty member--and he, in turn, helped us to \n     hire other members of what has become an excellent faculty. \n     Moreover, in his years on our faculty, Professor Bybee helped \n     us to build an excellent law school, teaching important \n     courses, chairing key committees, producing excellent \n     scholarship, speaking widely in our community, and serving as \n     an example of an excellent public lawyer and scholar. We had \n     hoped that he would return to our faculty at the conclusion \n     of his service as Assistant Attorney General for the Office \n     of Legal Counsel, but those hopes have now been superceded by \n     the needs of our country, which has called him to the United \n     States Court of Appeals.\n       Professor Bybee will answer that call excellently. He is \n     very smart, very thorough and very knowledgeable about the \n     demanding legal issues that confront our country and our \n     courts. He is a creative thinker, but one whose creativity is \n     appropriately tempered by rigorous legal analysis. More \n     importantly, he is a compassionate and decent person who will \n     approach his work in humane and very reasonable ways.\n       While those of us on the Boyd Law School faculty come from \n     many backgrounds and hold a variety of views on important \n     societal issues, I think that we all agree on at least three \n     things: that Jay Bybee is a wonderful colleague who has \n     earned our high esteem; that his departure from our faculty \n     weakens our law school; and that his elevation to the federal \n     judiciary will improve our courts and our country. President \n     Bush has chosen well, and I hope that you will confirm his \n     choice.\n        Please let me know if you would like further information \n     or comment from me. Thank you for your service to our \n     country.\n       Best regards.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Richard J. Morgan,\n     Dean.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   University of Nevada Las Vegas,\n\n\n                                William S. Boyd School of Law,\n\n                                  Las Vegas, NV, January 30, 2003.\n     Hon.  Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to state my strong support for \n     Jay S. Bybee, who was renominated on January 7 by President \n     George W. Bush to be a judge of the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I have known Bybee since 2001 \n     when we both were members of the faculty of the William S. \n     Boyd School of Law of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n       I had the privilege of working directly and substantially \n     with Bybee on Law School committees, in faculty meetings, and \n     in a variety of informal contexts. I also have read much of \n     his published work and have discussed him and his work with \n     numerous other law professors, at the Boyd School of Law and \n     other law schools, and with numerous of his students.\n       Based on these contacts and associations, I strongly \n     commend Bybee to you. For three reasons, I am confident he \n     would be an outstanding federal appellate judge. First, Bybee \n     clearly has deep and extensive knowledge of the law. He is \n     widely and properly regarded as a leading constitutional law \n     expert, and his expertise extends to many other areas of law \n     as well. By virtue of his private practice, government \n     practice, and academic experience, he is well rounded and \n     superbly knowledgeable in the law.\n       Second, Bybee's ability to commmunicate and teach are \n     extraordinary. As a teacher, he is held in near legendary \n     status here. His skill as a teacher established a standard \n     that few other law professors can meet. The importance of \n     federal appellate decisions lies not only in correct outcomes \n     but also in the clarity and explanatory force of the opinions \n     that justify the outcomes reached. Bybee's skill as a \n     communicator and teacher will serve the nation well.\n       Third, Bybee's exemplary personal qualities will enhance \n     his value as a judge. Bybee is highly intelligent, \n     industrious, diligent, and responsible. He has oustanding \n     judgment and is a rock of stability when seas become stormy. \n     Perhaps above all, he respects and works effectively with \n     persons of diverse perspectives, temperaments, and ideology. \n     He is uniformly respected here by faculty, students, and \n     administrators whose views span the political spectrum.\n       In sum, I have every confidence that Bybee will be an \n     outstanding federal judge. He will contribute positively to \n     the sound application and development of the law and to the \n     wise administration of it. He is exceptionally able and well \n     qualified. I hope that your Committee will act rapidly and \n     positively on his nomination. Please contact me if you have \n     any questions. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Steve Johnson,\n     E.L. Wiegand Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   University of Nevada Las Vegas,\n\n\n                                William S. Boyd School of Law,\n\n                                  Las Vegas, NV, January 30, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to offer my strongest \n     recommendation that the Senate confirm the nomination of Jay \n     Bybee to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I \n     clerked for a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judge in 1979-\n     1980, so I have a pretty strong idea of what is involved in \n     holding this position. I have also known Mr. Bybee since 1987 \n     and have tremendous confidence that he is a person of great \n     legal knowledge and sound judgment. Without question he has \n     the ability and motivation to give cases the careful \n     attention and thought they deserve. I carefully reviewed \n     Jay's legal scholarship when he taught law at Louisiana State \n     University and recommended his promotion and tenure there. \n     His scholarship is very strong and analytical, and it is \n     clear that he brings a careful and thoughtful mind to bear in \n     addressing legal problems.\n       Jay is also a person of great integrity, and we can be \n     confident that he will represent the nation well in his \n     professional and personal endeavors. In the years I have \n     known Jay, I have felt great confidence that his word was his \n     bond. This is among the reasons why, when in 1999 I reported \n     to join the faculty here at Boyd School of Law at the \n     University of Nevada, Las Vegas, I invited Jay to co-author \n     with me a book on the Ninth and Tenth Amendments--a work we \n     are still working to complete. Jay's interests in legal \n     scholarship reflect the range of interests he has, and he \n     would bring to this position an awareness of the importance \n     of structural issues relating to government powers as well as \n     the fundamental importance of individual rights. Whether I \n     was a member of the executive branch or the legislative \n     branch of government, I would feel greatly reassured in \n     knowing the important issues relating the scope of \n     governmental powers would be addressed by one with Jay's \n     background, expertise, and judgment.\n       If I could be of any further assistance to the committee or \n     the Senate in deciding whether to confirm the nomination of \n     Mr. Bybee, I would be happy to do so. I have total confidence \n     that he would be a thoughtful, perhaps even brilliant judge.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas B. McAffee,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             The George Washington\n\n\n                                        University Law School,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 2003.\n     Re Nomination of the Honorable Jay S. Bybee to the U.S. Court \n         of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: I write in support of the nomination \n     of the Honorable Jay S.\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\n     Bybee to the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th \n     Circuit. I have known Jay in both his professional and \n     governmental capacities and I have little doubt he will be a \n     superb judge.\n       In the first place, Jay is, simply put, very smart, a \n     highly useful attribute for a judge, in my opinion. He \n     graduated with honors from both college and law school. But \n     even more to the point, that legal work with which I am \n     familiar is outstanding. He has a remarkable ability to \n     digest an extraordinary amount of material and then, sorting \n     the wheat from the chaff, produce a succinct, cogent analysis \n     of the problem at hand. His law review articles are of the \n     highest quality, thoroughly researched, impressively \n     documented, carefully analyzed and gracefully written, His \n     briefs exhibit a complete--and honest--explication of the \n     relevant authorities and a thoughtful marshaling of the \n     evidence in support of his position. They are all models of \n     legal craftsmanship. He will undoubtedly apply these hightly \n     honed analytical skills to the inescapably difficult problems \n     federal judges face.\n       Jay also seems to understand well the amount of energy and \n     efforts necessary to solve complex legal problems. He is a \n     tireless worker producing impressive amounts of work at a \n     very high level of quality. He will bear up well under the \n     extraordinary workload our federal judges face.\n       I am also impressed with the breadth of Jay's legal \n     experience. He has worked for a year on a court. He has \n     practiced in the private sector. He has worked at both a \n     staff and political level in the government. And he has spent \n     time as an academic, reflecting on the broader purposes of \n     the law. He has been exposed to the operation of the law in \n     almost every imaginable setting. All of this experience will \n     undoubtedly inform his judicial deliberations in highly \n     useful ways.\n       I have also always found Jay enormously balanced, and fair \n     in both his professional judgments and his personal dealings. \n     He has political views, to be sure, but he is no ideologue. I \n     have even seen him change his mind, something incredibly rare \n     in the academy. I think any petitioner will justifiably have \n     great confidence that his pleas will receive a fair, just and \n     sympathetic hearing.\n       I also think Jay has a happily well-developed sense of the \n     majesty and dignity of the law. He is well attuned to the \n     importance of the law in protecting our rights, redressing \n     our grievances, and protecting us from the pressure of both \n     our neighbors and, on occasions, the government. At the same \n     time, I think he understands--and understands well--the \n     limits of legal redress. The courts are not legislators and I \n     do not think Jay would ever confuse the two. In short, I \n     think he has a sophisticated and appropriate appreciation of \n     the role of the judge and the courts in our political and \n     legal system. Jay will prove a very good judge, someone we \n     will all be proud to claim, whatever our personal view of the \n     appropriate line between courts and legislators.\n       Finally, I would be remiss if I did not stress just how \n     extraordinarily decent Jay is. Even on first meeting, it is \n     clear he is a thoughtful, considerate, indeed, kind person. \n     But much more importantly, my every contact has also \n     convinced me he is a person of unshakable integrity. He is \n     clear and entirely transparent about his core values. And \n     they are absolutely the right ones. They revolve around \n     family, community and country. They bespeak a fidelity to law \n     as both a device to ensure that all have the opportunity to \n     reach their fullest capacity, as well as a shield against \n     man's least worthy impulses. He is honest, forthright and \n     entirely respectful of the dignity of everyone he meets.\n       I have gone on at perhaps too much length, but I strongly \n     support this nomination. Jay has all the professional and, \n     more importantly, in my judgment, personal attributes of a \n     great judge. I sincerely hope he will become one.\n       Thank you for allowing me to submit this letter in support \n     of Jay.\n       With best regards.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Michael K. Young,\n     Dean.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Boston College\n\n\n                                                   Law School,\n\n                                     Newton, MA, January 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am delighted that Jay Bybee has been \n     nominated for the 9th Circuit. I have known Mr. Bybee for \n     almost two decades. We both served in Washington in the \n     1980s, overlapping at the Justice Department in 1984. I have \n     had frequent contact with Mr. Bybee since then, because we \n     both have taught constitutional law, and written articles in \n     many of the same areas. Mr. Bybee is, among legal academics, \n     one of the best known and best respected writers on the \n     subjects of federalism and separation of powers. I have been \n     impressed with his calm and approachable demeanor, his \n     ability to explain difficult legal concepts in understandable \n     terms, and his fairness and open-mindedness in dealing with \n     those who have intellectual disagreements with him.\n       Mr. Bybee has also had a wealth of significant legal \n     experience since his graduation from law school twenty-three \n     years ago. As a private lawyer he has acquired expertise in \n     issues concerning transportation and communication. In the \n     Civil Division of the Justice Department for five years he \n     acquired a wealth of knowledge about the standard business of \n     the agencies of government. He has handled with considerable \n     skill more than three dozen appellate cases for the United \n     States. He served on the White House staff for two years as \n     associated counsel to the first President Bush. And I think \n     he has done a terrific job of running the Office of Legal \n     Counsel for the past few months. I think that he will be a \n     splendid addition to the 9th Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John H. Garvey,\n     Dean.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in spite of the intransigence of the White \nHouse and the overreaching of the Republican majority here in the \nSenate, I believe the Senate will, by the end of this week, have moved \nforward to confirm 111 of President Bush's judicial nominations since \nJuly 2001. That total would include 11 judges confirmed so far this \nyear and of those 7 would be confirmed this week. Consideration of this \ncontroversial nomination of Jay S. Bybee to the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is the 18th circuit nomination considered \nfor this President since July 2001. The 17 others were each confirmed, \nsome like Judge Shedd and Judge D. Brooks Smith with significant \nopposition. Nonetheless, Democrats have moved forward almost twice as \npromptly on this President's circuit nominees as the Republican \nmajority did on President Clinton's circuit nominees. The Republican \nmajority averaged 7 circuit judge confirmations a year over the 6\\1/2\\ \nyears it previously controlled this process. By contrast, the \nDemocratic majority confirmed 17 circuit judges in 17 months for \nPresident Bush, in addition to 83 district court judges.\n  In terms of percentages, which is what Republicans love to cite, the \npercentage of circuit nominees of President Clinton confirmed under the \nRepublican majority in the 107th Congress was 0; the percentage \nconfirmed in the 106th Congress was 44 percent; the percentage \nconfirmed in the 105th Congress was 66 percent; and the percentage \nconfirmed in the 104th Congress was 55 percent. In fact, despite the \npercentage for a full Congress, in four of their six full years, they \nconfirmed 33 percent or less of President Clinton's circuit court \nnominees. In less than a full Congress, after assuming the majority in \nthe summer of 2001 and in spite of the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax \nattacks and all the disruptions and priorities in those 17 months, the \nDemocratically-led Senate not only held hearings on 20 circuit \nnominees, the Judiciary Committee voted on 19 and the Senate confirmed \n17 for a 53 percent confirmation rate of the President's controversial \nslate of circuit nominees.\n  Those considering these matters might contrast the progress in which \nDemocrats are assisting with the start of the last Congress in which \nthe Republican majority in the Senate was delaying consideration of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees. In 1999, the first hearing on a \njudicial nominee was not until mid-June. The Senate did not reach 11 \nconfirmations until the end of July of that year whereas we will reach \nthat benchmark this year before St. Patrick's Day. Accordingly, the \nfacts show that Democratic Senators are being extraordinarily \ncooperative with a Senate majority and a White House that refuses to \ncooperate with us. We have made progress in spite of them.\n  Indeed, by close of business today, we will have reduced vacancies on \nthe Federal courts to under 55, which includes the 20 judgeships \nDemocrats newly authorized in the 21st Century Department of Justice \nAppropriations Authorization Act last year. That is an extremely low \nvacancy number based on recent history and well below the 67 vacancies \nthat Senator Hatch termed ``full employment'' on the federal bench \nduring the Clinton Administration.\n  Turning to the nomination now before the Senate, the nomination of \nJay S. Bybee for a lifetime appointment to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals is a difficult one for me. It is made all the more difficult by \nthe respect I have for the senior Senator from Nevada, who has \nsupported this nomination.\n  I think that Senator Biden made a compelling case against this \nnomination in his statement to the Judiciary Committee. I know that we \nintended to and did establish a separate Violence Against Women Office \nat the Department of Justice and a Director subject\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\nto Senate confirmation when we wrote the Department of Justice \nauthorization legislation and enacted it last year. How Mr. Bybee could \nmisinterpret that measure is beyond me.\n  Mr. Bybee appeared before the Judiciary Committee in 2001 when he was \nnominated to serve at the Department of Justice. During that \nconfirmation hearing, Mr. Bybee promised the Judiciary Committee that \nas Assistant Attorney General, he would ``not trample civil rights in \nthe pursuit of terrorism'' and that he would ``bring additional \nsensitivity to the rights of all Americans'' to his work at the Justice \nDepartment. Given the veil of secrecy imposed by the Administration, I \nhave serious concerns about how the Department of Justice has been \noperating.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Bybee's hearing for judicial office took place on \na particularly busy morning when many Senators had other committee \nobligations and during the Secretary of State's address to the United \nNations regarding Iraq. Many of us were unable to attend Mr. Bybee's \nhearing in person that day. At least five of us submitted detailed sets \nof written questions to ask about the Justice Department and some \ncontroversial views he has taken in his academic writings and speeches \nbefore the Federalist Society.\n  I have given a lot of thought to this nomination. I have concerns \nthat Mr. Bybee was chosen to be another in a long line of circuit court \nnominees from this President who will prove to be an ideologically \ndriven conservative activist if accorded lifetime tenure on the Court \nof Appeals.\n  However, Senator Reid knows Mr. Bybee and supports his confirmation. \nMr. Bybee is obviously conservative, but we've had a chance to review \nhis articles and speeches and no one has called into question his \nability and commitment to setting aside his views as a judge.\n  On the very day that Democrats cooperated in debating and voting on \nthe Bybee nomination in Committee, our cooperation was rewarded by the \nRepublican majority violating our rights. Republicans violated our \nlongstanding Judiciary Committee rules and unilaterally declared the \ntermination of debate on two other controversial circuit court \nnominations, John Roberts and Justice Deborah Cook that very morning.\n  Senator Daschle termed this unilateral action deeply troubling and a \n``reckless exercise of raw power by a Chairman,'' and he is right. He \nobserved that the work of this Senate has for over 200 years operated \non the principle of civil debate, which includes protection of the \nminority. When a chairman can on his own whim choose to ignore our \nrules that protect the minority, not only is that protection lost, but \nso is an irreplaceable piece of our integrity and credibility.\n  The Democratic leader noted that faithful adherence to longstanding \nrules is especially important for the Senate and for its Judiciary \nCommittee. He noted ``how ironic that in the Judiciary Committee, a \nCommittee which passes judgment on those who will interpret the rule of \nlaw,'' that it acted in conscious disregard of the rules that were \nestablished to govern its proceedings. If this is what those who \npontificate about ``strict construction'' mean by that term, it \ntranslates to winning by any means necessary. If this is how the judges \nof the judicial nominees act, how can we expect the nominees they \nsupport as ``strict constructionists'' to behave any better? Given this \naction in disrespect of the rights of the minority, how can we expect \nthe Judiciary Committee to place individuals on the bench that respect \nthe rule of law?\n  In my 29 years in the Senate and in my reading of Senate history, I \ncannot think of so clear a violation of Senators' rights.\n  As Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, as Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Foreign Operations of the Appropriations Committee and \nas Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I strove always to protect the \nrights of the minority. I did not always agree with what they were \nsaying or doing, I did not always find it convenient, but I protected \ntheir rights. It was not always as efficient as I might have liked, but \nI protected their rights. That is basic to this democracy and \nfundamental to the Senate of the United States. Senators respect other \nSenators' rights and hear them out.\n  There is no question that the Senate majority is in charge and \nresponsible for how we proceed. I understand that and always have--I \nwish Republicans had shared that view when I chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee last year. But in the Senate, the majority's power is \ncircumscribed by our rules and traditional practices. We protect and \nrespect the rights of the minority in this democratic institution for \nthe same reason we steadfastly adhere to the Bill of Rights.\n  I, too, am gravely concerned about this abuse of power and breach of \nour committee rules. When the Judiciary Committee cannot be counted \nupon to follow its own rules for handling important lifetime \nappointments to the Federal judiciary, everyone should be concerned. In \nviolation of the rules that have governed that committee's proceedings \nsince 1979, the chairman chose to ignore our longstanding committee \nrules and short-circuit committee consideration of the nominations of \nJohn Roberts and Justice Deborah Cook. Senator Daschle spoke to that \nmatter that day. Judiciary Committee members, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Durbin and Senator Feingold have also spoken \nto the Senate about this breach of our rules, as well as a number of \nother liberties that Republicans have been taking with the rules.\n  Since 1979, the Judiciary Committee has had this particular committee \nrule to bring debate on a matter to a close while protecting the rights \nof the minority. It may have been my first meeting as a Senator on the \nJudiciary Committee in 1979 that Chairman Kennedy, Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Dole, Senator Cochran and others discussed adding this rule to \nthose of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Thurmond, Senator Hatch and \nthe Republican minority at that time took a position against adding the \nrule and argued in favor of any individual Senator having a right to \nunlimited debate--so that even one Senator could filibuster a matter. \nSenator Hatch said that he would be ``personally upset'' if unlimited \ndebate were not allowed.\n  Senator Hatch explained:\n\n       There are not a lot of rights that each individual Senator \n     has, but at least two of them are that he can present any \n     amendments which he wants and receive a vote on it and number \n     two, he can talk as long as he wants to as long as he can \n     stand, as long as he feels strongly about an issue. I think \n     those rights are far superior to the right of this Committee \n     to rubber stamp legislation out on the floor.\n\n  It was Senator Dole who drew upon his Finance Committee experience to \nsuggest in 1979 that the Committee rule be that ``at least you could \nrequire the vote of one minority member to terminate debate.'' Senator \nCochran likewise supported having a ``requirement that there be an \nextraordinary majority to shut off debate in our Committee.''\n  The Judiciary Committee proceeded to refine its consideration of what \nbecame Rule IV, which was adopted in 1979 and has been maintained ever \nsince. It struck the balance that Republicans had suggested of at least \nhaving the agreement of one member of the minority before allowing the \nChairman to cut off debate.\n  That protection for the minority has been maintained by the Judiciary \nCommittee for the last 24 years under five different chairmen--Chairman \nKennedy, Chairman Thurmond, Chairman Biden, under Chairman Hatch \npreviously and during my tenure as chairman.\n  Rule IV of the Judiciary Committee provides the minority with a right \nnot to have debate terminated and not to be forced to a vote without at \nleast one member of the minority agreeing. That rule and practice had \nuntil last month always been observed by the committee, even as we have \ndealt with the most contentious social issues and nominations that come \nbefore the Senate.\n  Until last month, Democratic and Republican chairmen had always acted \nto protect the rights of the Senate minority. The rule has been the \ncommittee's equivalent to the Senate's cloture rule in Rule 22. It had \nbeen honored by all five Democratic and Republican chairman, including \nSenator Hatch--until last month.\n  It was rarely utilized but Rule IV set the ground rules and the \nbackdrop against which rank partisanship was\n\n[[Page S3685]]\n\nrequired to give way, in the best tradition of the Senate, to a measure \nof bipartisanship in order to make progress. That is the other \nimportant function of the rule.\n  Besides protecting minority rights, it enforced a certain level of \ncooperation between the majority and minority in order to get anything \naccomplished. That, too, has been lost as the level of partisanship on \nthe Judiciary Committee and within the Senate reached a new level when \nRepublicans chose to override our governing rules of conduct and \nproceed as if the Senate Judiciary Committee were a minor committee of \nthe House of Representatives.\n  The premature and unilateral termination of debate in committee last \nmonth was apparently a premeditated act. Senator Hatch indicated that \nhe had checked with the parliamentarians in advance, and he apparently \nconcluded that he had the raw power to ignore our committee rule and so \nlong as all Republicans on the committee stuck with him, he would do \nso. I understand that the parliamentarians advised Senator Hatch that \nthere is no enforcement mechanism for a violation of committee rules \nand that the parliamentarians view Senate Committees as ``autonomous''. \nI do not believe that they advised Senator Hatch that he should violate \nour Committee rules or that they interpreted our Committee rules.\n  I cannot remember a time when then-Chairman Kennedy or Chairman \nThurmond or Chairman Biden would have even considered violating their \nresponsibility to the Senate and to the committee and to our rules. \nAccordingly, we have never been faced with a need for an ``enforcement \nmechanism'' or penalty for violation of a fundamental committee rule.\n  In fact, on the only occasion I can recall when Senator Hatch was \nfaced with implementing Committee Rule IV, he did so. In 1997, \nDemocrats on the committee were seeking a Senate floor vote on \nPresident Clinton's nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the Assistant \nAttorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice.\n  Republicans were intent on killing the nomination in committee. The \ncommittee rule came into play when in response to an alternative \nproposal by Chairman Hatch, I outlined the tradition of our Committee. \nI said:\n\n       This committee has rules, which we have followed \n     assiduously in the past and I do not think we should change \n     them now. The rules also say that 10 Senators, provided one \n     of those 10 is from the minority, can vote to cut off debate. \n     We are also required to have a quorum for a vote.\n  I intend to insist that the rules be followed. A vote that is done \ncontrary to the rules is not a valid one.\n  Immediately after my comment, Chairman Hatch abandoned his earlier \nplan and said:\n\n       I think that is a fair statement. Rule IV of the Judiciary \n     Committee rules effectively establishes a committee \n     filibuster right, as the distinguished Senator said.\n\n  With respect to the nomination in 1997, Chairman Hatch acknowledged:\n\n       Absent the consent of a minority member of the Committee, a \n     matter may not be brought to a vote. However, Rule IV also \n     permits the chairman of the Committee to entertain a non-\n     debatable motion to bring any matter to a vote.\n       The rule also provides as follows: ``The Chairman shall \n     entertain a non-debatable motion to bring a matter before the \n     Committee to a vote. If there is objection to bring the \n     matter to a vote without further debate, a rollcall vote of \n     the Committee shall be taken, and debate shall be terminated \n     if the motion to bring the matter to a vote without further \n     debate passes with ten votes in the affirmative, one of which \n     must be cast by the Minority.''\n  Thereafter, given the objection, the committee proceeded to a roll \ncall vote whether to end the debate. That was consistent with our \nlongstanding rule. In that case, Chairman Hatch followed the rules of \nthe committee.\n  At the beginning of our executive business meeting on February 27, I \nreferenced the Committee's rules and during the course of the debate on \nnominations both Senator Kennedy and I sought to have the committee \nfollow them. We were overridden.\n  Last month, the bipartisan tradition and respect for the rights of \nthe minority ended when Chairman Hatch decided to override Rule IV \nrather than follow it. He did so expressly and intentionally, \ndeclaring: ``[Y]ou have no right to continue a filibuster in this \ncommittee.''\n  Chairman Hatch decided, unilaterally, to declare the debate over even \nthough all members of the minority were prepared to continue the debate \nand it was, in fact, terminated prematurely. I had yet to speak to any \nof the circuit nominees on the agenda and other Democratic Senators had \nmore to say.\n  Senator Hatch completely reversed his own position from the Bill Lann \nLee nomination and took a step unprecedented in the history of the \ncommittee. Contrast the statements of Senator Hatch in 1979 when he \nsupported unlimited debate for a single Senator--with Republicans in \nthe minority--with his action overriding the rights of the Democratic \nminority and his recent letter to Senator Daschle in which, now that \nRepublicans hold the Senate majority, he says that he ``does not \nbelieve the Committee filibuster should be allowed and [he] thinks it \nis a good and healthy thing for the Committee to have a rule that \nforces a vote.''\n  But our committee rule, while providing a mechanism for terminating \ndebate and reaching a vote on a matter, does so while providing a \nminimum of protection for the minority. Even this minimum protection \nwill no longer be respected by Chairman Hatch.\n  Contrast Senator Hatch's recognition in 1997 that Rule IV establishes \na Judiciary Committee ``filibuster right'' and that a ``[a]bsent the \nconsent of a minority member of the Committee, a matter may not be \nbrought to a vote,'' with his declaration last month that there is no \nright to filibuster in committee.\n  In his recent letter to Senator Daschle, Senator Hatch declares that \nhe ``does not believe that Committee filibusters should be allowed.'' \nIt is Senator Hatch who has ``turned Rule 4 on its head'' last month, \nafter 24 years of consistent interpretation and implementation by five \nchairmen. Never before his letter to Senator Daschle has anyone since \nthe adoption of the rule in 1979 ever suggested that its purpose was to \nbe narrowed and redirected to thwart ``an obstreperous Chairman who \nrefuses to allow a vote on an item on the Agenda.'' After all, as \nSenator Hatch recognizes in his letter, it is the chairman's \nprerogative to set the agenda for the mark-up.\n  This revisionist reading of the rule is not justified by its adoption \nor its prior use and appears to be nothing other than an after-the-fact \nattempt to justify the obvious breaches of the longstanding Committee \nrule and practice that occurred last month. It was not even articulated \ncontemporaneously at the business meeting.\n  I appreciate the frustrations that accompany chairing the Judiciary \nCommittee. I know the record we achieved during my 17 months of \nchairing that committee, when we proceeded with hearings on more than \n100 of President Bush's judicial nominees and scores of his executive \nnominees, including extremely controversial nominations, when we \nproceeded fairly and in accordance with our rules and committee \ntraditions and practices to achieve almost twice as many confirmation \nfor President Bush as the Republicans had allowed for President \nClinton, and know how that record was mischaracterized by partisans. \nThose 100 favorably reported nominations included Michael McConnell, \nDennis Shedd, D. Brooks Smith, John Rogers, Michael Melloy and many \nothers.\n  I know that sometimes a chairman must make difficult decisions about \nwhat to include on an agenda and what not to include, what hearings to \nhold and when. In my time as chairman I tried to maintain the integrity \nof the committee process and to be bipartisan. I noticed hearings at \nthe request of Republican Senators and allowed Republican Senators to \nchair hearings. I made sure the committee moved forward fairly on the \nPresident's nominees in spite of the Administration's unwillingness to \nwork with us to fill judicial vacancies with consensus nominees and \nthereby fill those vacancies more quickly.\n  But I cannot remember a time when Chairman Kennedy, Chairman \nThurmond, Chairman Biden, Chairman Hatch previously, or I, ever \noverrode by fiat the right of the minority to debate a matter in \naccordance with our longstanding committee rules and practices.\n\n[[Page S3686]]\n\n  The committee and the Senate have crossed a threshold of partisan \noverreaching that should never have been crossed. I urge the Republican \nleadership to recommit the nominations of Justice Deborah Cook and John \nRoberts to the Judiciary Committee so that they can be considered in \naccordance with the committee's rules. The action taken last month \nshould be vitiated and order restored to the Senate and to the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to rethink its missteps and urge the \nchairman and the committee to disavow the misinterpretation and \nviolations of Rule IV that occurred last month.\n  We have also worked hard to report a number of important executive \nand judicial nominees in spite of the continued partisanship by the \nWhite House and Senate Republicans. As Senator Feinstein recently \nnoted, we have cooperated by not insisting on our rights to seven days \nnotice or seven days holdover on various matters and we have not \ninsisted on three days' notice of items on the agenda. We have \nproceeded to debate with less than a quorum present and Democrats have \nbeen responsible for making quorum after quorum so that this committee \ncould conduct business. Ironically, we did so even last month while our \nrights were being violated. Order and comity need to be restored to the \nJudiciary Committee and to the Senate. An essential step in that \nprocess is the restoration of our rights under Rule IV and recognition \nof our rights thereunder.\n  There are continuing problems caused by the administration's refusal \nto work with Democratic Senators to select consensus judicial nominees \nwho could be confirmed relatively quickly by the Senate. Despite the \nPresident's lack of cooperation, the Senate in the 17 months I chaired \nthe Judiciary Committee was able to confirm 100 judges and vastly \nreduce the judicial vacancies that had built up and were prevented by \nthe Republican Senate majority from being filled by President Clinton.\n  Last year alone the Democratic-led Senate confirmed 72 judicial \nnominees, more than in any of the prior six years of Republican \ncontrol. Not once did the Republican-controlled committee consider that \nmany of President Clinton's district and circuit court nominees, even \nthough there were often more judicial nominees than that waiting for a \nhearing. In our efforts to turn the other cheek and treat this \nPresident's nominees better than his predecessor's had fared, we \nconfirmed 100 judges in 17 months. Yet, not a single elected Republican \nhas acknowledged this tremendous bipartisanship and fairness. When \nChief Justice Rehnquist thanked the committee for confirming 100 \njudicial nominees, this was the first time our remarkable record had \nbeen acknowledged by anyone from a Republican background.\n  Almost all of the 100 judges we confirmed last Congress are \nconservative, quite conservative. And with some, the Senate has taken a \nsignificant risk that they will be activist judges with lifetime \ntenure. We nonetheless moved fairly and expeditiously on as many as we \ncould. We cut the number of vacancies on the courts from 110 to 59, \ndespite an additional 50 new vacancies that arose during my tenure. I \nrecall that Senator Hatch took the position in September of 1997 that \n103 vacancies, during the Clinton Administration, did not constitute a \n``vacancy crisis.'' He also stated repeatedly that 67 vacancies meant \n``full employment'' on the federal courts.\n  Even with the vacancies that have arisen since we adjourned last \nyear, we remain below the ``full employment'' level that Senator Hatch \nused to draw for the federal courts with only 60 current vacancies on \nthe District Courts and Courts of Appeals. Unfortunately, the President \nhas not made nominations to almost two dozen of those seats, and on \nmore than one-half of the current vacancies he has missed his self-\nimposed deadline of a nomination within 180 days. Of course, several of \nthe nominations he has made are controversial.\n  Last Congress, we worked hard to keep a steady pace of hearings, even \nthough so many of this President's judicial picks proved to be quite \ndivisive and raised serious questions about their willingness to be \nfair to all parties. We held hearings for 90 percent of his nominees \neligible for hearings, a total of 103 nominees, including 20 circuit \ncourt nominees. We voted on 102 of them, two of whom were defeated \nafter fair hearings and lengthy debate. The President has taken this \nunprecedented action of re-nominating candidates voted down in \ncommittee in spite of the serious concerns expressed by fair-minded \nmembers of this committee.\n  This year the committee has had a rocky beginning with a hearing that \nhas caused a great many problems that could have been avoided. The \ncommittee proceeded to a vote on the Estrada nomination and to a vote \non the Sutton nomination and to votes on the Bybee and Tymkovich \nnominations--all controversial nominations to circuit courts.\n  The rushed processing of nominees in these past few weeks has led to \neditorial cartoons showing conveyor belts and assembly lines with \nSenators just rubber-stamping these important, lifetime appointments \nwithout sufficient inquiry or understanding. What we are ending up with \nis a pile-up of nominees at the end of this rapidly-moving conveyer \nbelt. There is no way that we can meaningfully keep up with our \nconstitutional duty to determine the fitness of these nominees at this \npace. The quality of our work must suffer, and slippage in the quality \nof justice will necessarily follow. I hope we will do all we can to \nprevent more of these ``I Love Lucy'' moments.\n  All of the Democratic Senators who serve on the Judiciary Committee \nhave asked the Chairman to reconvene the hearing with Justice Cook and \nMr. Roberts because of the circumstances under which it was held and \nnot satisfactorily completed. We have also taken the White House up on \nits offer to make the nominees available with a joint letter seeking an \nopportunity to make further inquiries of them. Regrettably, last \nWednesday the White House withdrew its offer and now refuses to \nproceed. That change of position by the White House, on top of the \ninadequate hearing on these important nominations, has created another \nimpasse and unnecessary complication.\n  That is why the minority, while prepared to debate and vote on the \nBybee nomination to the 9th Circuit and nine other presidential \nnominations on February 27, wished to continue the debate on the Cook \nand Roberts nominations.\n  Let me be specific: On January 29, the Judiciary Committee met in an \nextraordinary session to consider six important nominees for lifetime \nappointments to the federal bench, including three controversial \nnominees to circuit courts: Jeffrey Sutton, Justice Deborah Cook and \nJohn Roberts. Several Senators only officially learned the names of the \nnominees on the agenda for that hearing at 4:45 p.m. on January 28, the \nday before.\n  On learning that the chairman intended to include three controversial \ncircuit court nominees on one hearing, something virtually \nunprecedented in the history of the committee, and absolutely \nunprecedented in this chairman's tenure, Democrats on the committee \nwrote to the Chairman to protest. We explained that since 1985, when \nChairman Thurmond and Ranking Member Biden signed an agreement about \nthe pace of hearings and the number of controversial nominees per \nhearing, there has been a consensus on the committee that members ought \nto be given ample time to question nominees, and that controversial \nnominees in particular deserve more time.\n  We explained that we were surprised by the chairman's rush to \nconsider these three nominees at the same time, considering the pace at \nwhich President Clinton's nominees were scheduled for hearings. During \nthe time Republicans controlled the Senate and Bill Clinton was \npresident, there was never a hearing held to consider three circuit \ncourt nominees at once. Never.\n  Finally, we explained the importance of giving Senators sufficient \ntime to consider each nominee and properly exercise their \nconstitutional duty to give advice and consent to the President's \nlifetime appointments to the federal bench.\n  But our request went unanswered, and we were expected to question \nthree nominees in the space of a single day. That proved impossible, as \nwas evident throughout that long day. My colleagues and I asked several \nrounds of questions of Mr. Sutton, and were only\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\nable to ask very few questions of the other two nominees. We asked, \nduring the hearing itself, that the chairman reconsider and ask the \nother two nominees to return the next day or the next week, and to give \nthem the time they deserved in front of the committee, but he refused.\n  We asked the same thing after the hearing, and were told that indeed \nthe nominees would make themselves available to meet with each of us, \nso we wrote to accept those offers, although as we explained, we would \nhave preferred to meet with them altogether, and in a public session. \nBut again, we were rebuffed. I wonder, though, if they were available \nfor one sort of meeting, why were they not available for another. I \nregret that the White House refused our request to bring closure to \nthose matters.\n  During the last 4 years of the Clinton administration, his entire \nsecond term in office after being reelected by the American people, the \nJudiciary Committee refused to hold hearings and committee votes on his \nqualified nominees to the D.C. Circuit and the Sixth Circuit. Last \nmonth, in sharp contrast, this committee was required to proceed on two \ncontroversial nominations to those circuit courts in contravention of \nthe rules and practices of the committee. This can only be seen as part \nof a concerted and partisan effort to pack the courts and tilt them \nsharply out of balance.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales,\n     Counsel to the President, The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Gonzales: As you may know, Democratic Senators \n     on the Judiciary Committee have been offered the opportunity \n     to meet with Justice Deborah Cook and Mr. John Roberts in \n     order to ask questions and discuss issues relevant to their \n     nominations to lifetime appointments to United States Courts \n     of Appeals. We are writing to let you know that some of us \n     would like to accept those offers and meet with both of the \n     nominees together before voting on their nominations.\n       We are available to meet as early as Wednesday, February \n     26, 2003, but are amenable to another mutually convenient \n     time. For the purposes of review after the meeting, we will \n     arrange for a stenographer to attend the meeting and record \n     the exchanges with the nominees. We also anticipate that the \n     meeting will be open to the public.\n       We hope that you and the Department of Justice will work \n     with us to schedule this important meeting. Some of us \n     believe the January 29, 2003, Committee hearing did not \n     provide an adequate opportunity to ask the questions \n     necessary for Senators to effectively carry out their \n     Constitutional duty to advise and consent to judicial \n     nominees. Written questions are not a satisfactory substitute \n     for direct exchanges between Senators and the nominees.\n       Thank you for your assistance, and we look forward to the \n     meeting we have requested.\n           Sincerely,\n         Patrick J. Leahy; Edward M. Kennedy; Joseph R. Biden, \n           Jr.; Dianne Feinstein; Charles E. Schumer; John \n           Edwards; Herbert Kohl; Russell D. Feingold; Richard J. \n           Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am here in the Chamber this afternoon \nto speak to the nomination of Jay Bybee of Nevada to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt.\n  I call it the Ninth Circuit Court of Western States. I know the State \nof the Presiding Officer is part of the Ninth Circuit, as is my State \nof Idaho. It is a circuit that has caused us great frustration over the \nlast good number of years as many of its cases have been overturned. In \nfact, just this term, the Supreme Court in one day overturned three \ncases or reversed three cases of the Ninth Circuit.\n  Some call it the most dysfunctional court of the land. I believe it \nto be that. Idahoans are extremely frustrated when a San Francisco-\noriented judge makes a decision on an Idaho resource matter that is so \ntotally out of context with our State and the character of our State \nand her people that Idahoans grow angry. That is why it is not unusual \nthat I and others over the years have offered legislation to divide the \nNinth Circuit. That has been spoken to on more than one occasion in \nthis Chamber, and it will be again this year.\n  I and my colleagues from Idaho are supportive of that kind of \nlegislation, and it is that kind of legislation the Presiding Officer \nhas just introduced: to change the character of this court to be more \nreflective of the broad scope of its authority than just to have, if \nyou will, California judges making decisions for Idaho, Washington, \nOregon, Alaska, and other States.\n  It is the largest court in the land, and it is a court that clearly \nneeds our attention. It begs for our attention. The outcry in my State \nand in other States, such as Alaska, demands it. But today we have an \nopportunity to improve it, and that is to confirm Jay S. Bybee to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  I am confident the Senate will consent to the appointment of \nProfessor Bybee, who enjoys bipartisan support and, in these current \ntimes as we debate judges in this Chamber, bipartisan support is in \nitself unique. That must speak to the uniqueness of this individual.\n  A review of Professor Bybee's credentials demonstrates he is, as the \nAmerican Bar Association has concluded, a highly qualified person for \nthis position. Professor Bybee's education, his private legal career, \nhis work as a law professor, and his extensive Government service, have \nprepared him well to serve as a circuit judge. Let me briefly review \nhis background.\n  Professor Bybee received a BA magna cum laude and with highest honors \nin economics from Brigham Young University. He also attended the J. \nReuben Clark Law School at BYU, graduating cum laude. I also note he \nwas an editor of the BYU Law Review. Those are high credentials from a \nvery well-qualified, recognized law school.\n  Following his graduation from law school, Professor Bybee clerked for \nJudge Donald Russell of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit and then was engaged in private practice of law at the \ndistinguished firm of Sidley & Austin. There he handled regulatory and \nantitrust matters, including civil litigation in Federal courts and \nadministrative law matters before the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n  Professor Bybee began his career in public service first as an \nattorney in the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legal Policy, \nthen as an attorney on the appellate staff at the Civil Division. \nDuring this period, he worked on a variety of departmental issues and \njudicial selections, was the principal author of the Government's \nbriefs in more than 25 cases, and argued cases before a number of \nFederal circuits. Professor Bybee also served as an associate counsel, \nas the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, mentioned, \nto George H. W. Bush.\n\n  Professor Bybee has had an excellent career as a law professor, \nbeginning at the Paul M. Hebert Law Center at Louisiana State \nUniversity. He is a founding faculty member at the University of \nNevada, Las Vegas William S. Boyd School of Law. As an accomplished \nscholar in the areas of administrative and constitutional law, \nProfessor Bybee has taught courses in civil procedure, constitutional \nlaw, administrative law, and seminars on religious liberty and the \nseparation of powers.\n  My colleague from Nevada was talking about his phenomenal knowledge \nof the Constitution and its authority and responsibility and our \nresponsibility to it as we craft law.\n  He has a distinguished record in publications in a phenomenal variety \nof legal areas.\n  Professor Bybee presently serves as an Assistant Attorney General, \nheading the Office of Legal Counsel at the U.S. Department of Justice. \nSupervising a staff of attorneys, Professor Bybee has the principal \nresponsibility for providing legal advice to the Attorney General on \nconstitutional, statutory, and regulatory questions. In addition, the \noffice reviews orders to be issued by the President or the Attorney \nGeneral for form and legality. The Office of Legal Counsel also advises \nthe President and the executive branch\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\nagencies on constitutional and statutory matters.\n  It is clear from his educational record, his private practice, his \noutstanding credentials as a law professor, and his distinguished \ncareer in public service that Professor Bybee is well qualified to \nserve on the Ninth Circuit and will be an outstanding judge. In fact, I \nam quite confident he will lift the quality of that court in its \ndecisions substantially.\n  Professor Bybee comes highly recommended. As a result of that, \nclearly he brings distinguished service to an area that cries out for \nthe need of astute minds.\n  As Senator Hatch mentioned, one of his supporters is William \nMarshall, Professor of Law at the University of North Carolina. I note \nthat Professor Marshall worked in the Clinton administration as Deputy \nCounsel to the President and in the Justice Department reviewing \njudicial nominees.\n  In Professor Marshall's letter in support of Professor Bybee, he \nwrites:\n\n       He--\n\nmeaning Professor Bybee--\n\n     is an extremely impressive person. To begin with, he is a \n     remarkable scholar. . . .\n\n  I think what I have said and the record I have spoken to clearly \nexemplifies that.\n\n       I believe him to be one of the most learned and respected \n     constitutional law experts in the country. He is also an \n     individual with exceptional personal qualities. I have always \n     been struck by the balance that he brings to his legal \n     analysis and the sense of respect and deference that he \n     applies to everybody he encounters--including those who may \n     disagree with him. He is someone who truly hears and \n     considers opposing positions. Most importantly, he is a \n     person who adheres to the highest of ethical standards. I \n     respect his integrity and trust his judgment.\n\n  That is a quote from the letter of William Marshall, Professor of \nLaw, University of North Carolina.\n  That endorsement rings loud in these Halls as it speaks well to the \nperson who is before us today. Other letters of support from law \nprofessors with whom he worked and associates throughout the Nation \nspeak highly of Professor Bybee. They note his personal integrity, his \nprofessional ability, his clear and thoughtful scholarship, and his \nexemplary personal qualities. Even those who disagree with him \npolitically are impressed with Professor Bybee and strongly support his \nnomination.\n  That is the record. The record is clear. I am pleased that we see the \nkind of bipartisan support that most judicial nominees who come to this \nfloor deserve. I support his nomination. He brings integrity and \nquality of mind to decisionmaking and judgment to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt, a court of which my State of Idaho is a part. I strongly endorse \nProfessor Bybee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nstatement. I, too, will support Professor Bybee. I have no problem with \ndoing that at all.\n  May I say that Professor Bybee can be proud that Senator Larry Craig \nhas spoken on his behalf. Senator Craig is one of the most articulate \nSenators not only at this time in this body, but having been in this \nbody for more than 44 years now, I can say that I have seen a lot of \narticulate speakers but Senator Craig is one among the foremost of \nthose. I would treasure his support of my nomination if I were indeed a \nnominee for any position.\n  Madam President, has the Pastore rule run its course for today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it has.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I believe the Senate is in executive \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as if in \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is there any limitation on time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there is not.\n\n\n                         reconstruction of iraq\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I will speak perhaps, as I see it, 40 \nminutes or less, which is something worthy of commenting on in itself.\n  There is an axiom in military planning that countries tend to prepare \nto fight the last war, not the next one. Some historians blamed the \nincredible death toll of World War I on military commanders who failed \nto realize that the days of set-piece battles, as in the days of the \nAmerican Revolution or the Napoleonic Wars, were over. Some have also \npointed out that the countries that were overrun in the opening months \nof World War II were those that were best prepared to engage in trench \nwarfare.\n  As our own Republic continues to ready for war in Iraq, there has \nbeen the alarming tendency to see this next war as a replay of our 1991 \ncampaign to liberate Kuwait. Some have taken to calling the impending \nconflict ``gulf war II,'' as if we could win this conflict in 2003 by \nrewinding the tapes of smart bombs dropping on their targets in 1991. I \nfear that many have succumbed to an intellectual and moral laziness \nthat views the coming war through the lens of our victory in 1991.\n  This next war in Iraq will not be like the last. Twelve years ago, \nthere was a war in one act with an extensive list of players opposing \nan aggressive antagonist. Now, the curtain is about to rise on a war \nwith the same lead character, Saddam Hussein, but only one great power \nopposing him, that great power being the one superpower in the world \ntoday, the United States. Many countries that played supporting roles \nin the last war look as though they will, this time, serve more as \nextras, seen only in the crowd scenes without supporting roles. Most \nominously, we do not know how long this costly drama might last. It may \nlast a month. It may last 2 months. It may last a week. It may last 2 \ndays. Who knows? I do not know. But this conflict will be played out in \nmany acts.\n  As in the last war, the coming battles will draw heavily on U.S. air \npower, followed by the use of our ground troops to destroy the Iraqi \narmy. That is where the similarities between 1991 and 2003 begin and \nend. The ultimate goal in the coming war is not to roll back an \ninvasion of a small, oil-rich corner of desert that borders the Persian \nGulf. This time, the goal is to conquer the despotic government of \nSaddam Hussein.\n  In the 1991 gulf war, our victory was followed by an orderly \nwithdrawal of our troops, so that they may return to their hometowns to \nmarch in ticker-tape parades and be honored with twenty-one gun salutes \nto acknowledge a resounding American victory on the battlefield.\n  It may not be the same in 2003. Our forces do not have the \nstraightforward task of pushing the Iraqi military out of Kuwait. The \naim is to push Saddam and his associates from power. This could involve \nhouse-to-house fighting or laying siege to Baghdad and other urban \ncenters, where seven out of ten Iraqis live. The United States will \nhave to manage religious, ethnic, and tribal rifts that may seek to \ntear the country apart. According to a declassified CIA estimate, we \nmust contend with the increasing chance that Saddam Hussein will use \nweapons of mass destruction against our troops as they march toward \nBaghdad.\n  After all of this, more work awaits. A U.S. invasion of Iraq with \nonly token support from other countries will leave us with the burden \nof occupying and rebuilding Iraq. The United States will find itself \nthrust into the position of undertaking the most radical and ambitious \nreconstruction of a country since the occupation of Germany and Japan \nafter World War II.\n  The likely first step in a post-war occupation would be to establish \nsecurity. No rebuilding mission could possibly occur if the Iraqi army \nstill has fight left in it or if Iraq's cities are in chaos. \nEstablishing security could well prove to be more difficult than \ndefeating Iraq's military. Saddam Hussein could go on the lam, forcing \nour military into a wild goose chase. Surely Iraq could not be \nconsidered secure if its evil dictator were to be on the loose.\n  Creating a secure environment in Iraq also means dealing with \ndifficult situations. How will our military deal with hungry Iraqis \ntaking to the street in mobs? What are we going to do about civilians \nexacting revenge on those who had oppressed them for so long? How will \nwe prevent violence within and among Iraq's multitude of tribes, ethnic \ngroups, and religions?\n  I am not convinced that, right now, the Administration has any idea \nof how\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\nto deal with these scenarios, or the dozens of other contingencies that \nmight arise while the United States serves as caretaker to a Middle \nEastern country.\n  The United States will then be faced with the task of providing for \nthe humanitarian needs of 23 million Iraqis, 60 percent of whom are \nfully dependent on international food aid. The United State will have \nto make sure that roads and bridges are rebuilt so that humanitarian \nassistance can get through to where it will be needed. That would be \nlargely our responsibility. That would not be the case if we were being \nattacked, if the United States were being attacked by Iraq, if the \nUnited States were confronted with an imminent and direct threat from \nIraq. If that were the case, then we would not be so morally \nresponsible for cleaning up the mess, for reconstructing, for \nrebuilding that which we will have destroyed.\n\n  That is not the case. We will have to make sure that roads and \nbridges are rebuilt so humanitarian assistance can get through to where \nit will be needed. Electrical systems will have to be repaired. Who \nknows, some in this country may have to be repaired when that attack is \nlaunched. But we are talking about the morning after now, the postwar \nIraq.\n  Electrical systems will have to be repaired so that doctors can \noperate in their hospitals. Water systems must be maintained to provide \ndrinking water to the country as it enters the scorching summer months \nand to provide sanitation to prevent the spread of disease. Telephone \nsystems will also be needed to communicate with the distant parts of a \ncountry that is the size of France, or a country that is seven times \nthe size of West Virginia.\n  Protecting or rebuilding this critical infrastructure may become a \nhuge task in itself, as Saddam Hussein is apparently planning a \nscorched earth defense of his regime. Such a scorched earth defense \ncould involve setting oil fields ablaze. It could involve blowing up \ndams. It could involve the destruction of bridges over rivers, two of \nthe oldest rivers in the world, the Euphrates and the Tigris, in a \ncountry that when I was in school many years ago was referred to as \nMesopotamia, the land between the two great rivers. Such a strategy on \nthe part of Saddam Hussein could involve sabotaging water supplies or \ndestroying food sources. U.S. military officers are now reporting that \nIraqi troops dressed as U.S. soldiers may seek to attack innocent Iraqi \ncivilians in an effort to blame the West as being responsible for war \natrocities.\n  If we are successful in deposing Saddam Hussein--and I don't have any \ndoubt we will be successful in doing that; there is any number of \nscenarios by which Saddam may be deposed. He may be assassinated. \nAssassinations do occur, as we read today in the newspapers about an \nassassination. Saddam Hussein may turn tail and run. He may want to \nlive and fight another day. He may decide to fight to the death. He may \nbe willing to die himself while others die around him. Who knows. But \nthere is no doubt in my mind that he will be deposed, one way or \nanother.\n  But in any event if we are successful in deposing Saddam Hussein and \nlimiting the loss of life among our troops and those of Iraqi \ncivilians, the United States will have to reform the government of \nIraq. According to an article that appeared in the Washington Post on \nFebruary 21, the post-Saddam plan crafted by the administration calls \nfor the U.S. military to take complete, unilateral control of Iraq \nafter a war, followed by a transition to an interim administration by \nan American civilian. This interim administration would purge Iraq of \nSaddam Hussein's cronies and lay the groundwork for a representative \ngovernment. General Barry McCaffrey, who commanded ground troops during \nthe 1991 war, estimated in the article that the occupation would take 5 \nyears.\n\n  Let us remember that Iraq once had a colonial government under the \nflag of Great Britain from 1920 to 1932. Iraqis revolted against \nBritish troops, leading one of the great men of the 20th century, one \nof the great men of all time, Winston Churchill to refer to the country \nas ``these thankless deserts.''\n  Have you ever been in a sandstorm in the deserts of the Middle East? \nIt is quite an experience.\n  If the United States is to administer Iraq for a period of years, we \nwill run the risk of being viewed as a new colonial power, no matter \nhow pure our intentions. Those who may greet us as liberators in 2003 \nmay increasingly view us as interlopers in 2004, 2005, 2006, and \nbeyond.\n  The United States will also face the task of reforming Iraq's \nmilitary. Fearful that a weak Iraq could fuel the ambitions of other \nregional powers, the Department of Defense is now considering how to \ntake apart Iraq's million-man army and rebuild it into a smaller, more \nprofessional force. While details are still wrapped in secrecy, it \nappears that the United States will have a major hand in retraining and \nre-equipping the post-Saddam Iraqi army. We are already trying to build \nan Afghan national army of perhaps 70,000 troops, but a new military \nfor Iraq would have be several times that size. One thing is for sure, \nthe arms industries must be salivating at the profits that could be \nmade from building a new, modern Iraqi army from scratch.\n  These occupation and reconstruction missions are all difficult risks \nand difficult tasks. No wonder the ranking general in the British \nmilitary, Gen. Sir Mike Jackson, said in an interview published in a \nLondon newspaper on February 23:\n\n       In my view, the post-conflict situation will be more \n     demanding and challenging than the conflict itself.\n\n  We had better hear that. We had better take note of that. Let's hear \nagain what the British military general says. The British general, Sir \nMike Jackson--here is what he said in an interview published in a \nLondon newspaper on February 23 of this year:\n\n       In my view, the post-conflict situation will be more \n     demanding and challenging than the conflict itself.\n\n  In other words, the war we may soon face in the Persian Gulf will be \nan entirely different campaign than was the war in 1991.\n  Congress and the American people, the people in the galleries that \nextend from sea to shining sea, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian \nborder, the people, the American people, those out there who are \nlooking upon this Chamber through that electronic lens, those people, \nthe people need to know how long we can expect to occupy postwar Iraq.\n  Last month, Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman estimated that a \nmilitary occupation of Iraq would take 2 years. That estimate is hard \nto believe. Gen. Douglas MacArthur believed that the occupation of \nJapan after World War II would take no more than 3 years. It lasted 6 \nyears and 8 months. The first U.S. military governor in Germany, Gen. \nDwight Eisenhower, anticipated that the United States military would \n``provide a garrison, not a government, except for a few weeks.'' \nInstead, the first phase of the occupation of Germany lasted 4 years.\n  These types of missions have their own momentum. We have had United \nStates troops in Bosnia for 7 years and United States soldiers in \nKosovo for 3\\1/2\\ years. Let us not forget that Gov. George Bush, as a \nPresidential candidate in 2000, said he would work to find an end to \nthose peacekeeping missions. But the United States is now looking at a \npeacekeeping mission in Iraq that dwarfs our deployment to the Balkans \nin every respect.\n  I find it utterly confounding that a President so opposed to nation \nbuilding would then launch into military scenarios that so clearly \nculminate in that very outcome. I have to wonder--I have to wonder if \nthis President is simply so driven to act that he cannot see that \naction itself is not the goal. How far along was this administration in \nplanning military action in Afghanistan before the question of what \npostwar Afghanistan would look like even came up? There seems to be at \nleast some forethought about postwar Iraq, but how thoroughly has it \nbeen forethought? How thoroughly has it been thought about? How \nthoroughly has it been scrutinized?\n  The information given to Congress--that's that legislative branch up \nthere, the people's representatives. Why, those people down in the \nWhite House view the legislative branch with contempt, with disdain. \nWhy should they let those people up there know what they, the people on \nMt. Olympus, are thinking? The information given to Congress and to the \nAmerican people, who pay all of us in public office--we\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\nare the hired hands. I am one of the hired hands. So is the President \nof the United States. He is just one of the hired hands. Then why \nshould we view those people, who pay us, with such contempt that we \ndon't think we ought to let them in on these secrets?\n\n  Oh, we don't have to tell them. We don't have to tell the people's \nelected representatives in Congress. We don't have to tell them. We'll \nlet them know what we estimate the cost to be when we send up our bill, \nwhen we send up a supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Congress and the American people should also know how much it will \ncost to occupy Iraq. At least there must be some estimates that have \nbeen carefully wrought. The Army Chief of Staff, General Shinseki, is \nstanding by his estimates, given to the Armed Services Committee, that \n``several hundred thousand'' troops would be required to occupy Iraq. \nThere is an Army Chief of Staff who doesn't back down. There is an Army \nChief of Staff who doesn't break and run. He said this a few days ago. \nHis estimate was disputed by the Defense Department. But General \nShinseki didn't cower. He is standing by his estimate, given to the \nArmed Services Committee, that several hundred thousand troops would be \nrequired to occupy Iraq.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has provided estimates, based on an \noccupation force of 75,000 to 200,000 American troops, it would cost $1 \nbillion to $4 billion--from $1 billion to $4 billion--per month.\n  I said that right. The cost of occupying Iraq has been estimated to \nbe $1 billion to $4 billion per month. How much is that money to us \npeons? Under $4 billion. That is $1 to $4 for every minute since Jesus \nChrist was born. Perhaps that can give us hillbillies a little better \nfeel of what we are talking about; $1 billion to $4 billion per month. \nThat is $12 billion to $48 billion per year; $33 million to $130 \nmillion per day; $23,000 to $93,000 per minute. And these enormous \namounts do not include the cost of rebuilding Iraq.\n  One estimate by the United Nations Development Program says that at \nleast $30 billion will be needed for reconstruction in the first 3 \nyears after a war. The actual cost, of course, could be much higher.\n  If the United States initiates war against Iraq in the coming days, \nmaybe a week--I find it a little hard to think it will be 2 weeks, but \nit could be. If the United States initiates war against Iraq in the \ncoming days, we will be hard pressed to share these staggering costs \nwith our allies. We have foolishly engaged in a war of words with some \nof our most powerful European allies, countries which could have been \nvaluable partners in rebuilding Iraq if war were proven to be \ninevitable.\n  Instead, it looks like the American taxpayer--you out there looking \nin this Chamber--the American taxpayer will be alone, all by himself, \nin shelling out billions of dollars for new foreign aid spending.\n  Some have suggested that Iraqi oil might take care of the post-war \ncosts. According to the United Nations, if Iraq's oil production \nreached all-time highs, about $16 billion in revenue could be generated \neach year. Right now, Iraq's legitimate oil sales are supposed to buy \nfood and medicine for the starving and ill. After a war, however, those \nfunds could be subject to claims by Iraq's creditors, who are owed at \nleast $60 billion in commercial and official debt. There is also the \nissue of $170 billion in unpaid reparations to Kuwait.\n  Mr. President, the big, black, endless pit we will find in Iraq after \na war will not be filled with cheap oil for our gas-guzzling cars. The \npit--that bottomless pit--that we will find in Iraq will have to be fed \nwith enormous amounts of American dollars.--Courtesy of whom? Courtesy \nof Uncle Sam.\n  The irony of investing huge amounts of money to rebuild Iraq when we \nhave urgent needs here at home has not been lost on late-night \ncomedians. One talk-show host commented that if President Bush's plan \nto provide Iraqis with food, medicine, supplies, housing, and education \nproves to be a success, it could eventually be tried in the United \nStates, too.\n  The comedians are on their toes. They are not overlooking any bets.\n  If the United States leads the charge to war in the Persian Gulf, we \nmay be lucky and achieve a rapid victory. I hope we will be lucky. \nPerhaps the odds for being lucky are, I guess, 90 to 1. But we may not \nbe lucky. But even if we are lucky, we will then have to face a second \nwar--a war to win the peace in Iraq. That war will not be over in a \nday, or a week, or a month, or a year. That war will last several \nyears, perhaps many years, and will surely cost hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  In the light of this enormous task, it would be a great mistake to \nexpect that this will be a replay of the 1991 war. The stakes are much \nhigher in this conflict.\n  Despite all of these risks and costs, it seems the administration \ncontinues to move our country closer and closer and closer to war. It \nseems we have already lost patience. We have already lost patience. We \nhave stopped listening. This administration, this President, has \nstopped listening. The superhawks that surround him have stopped \nlistening, if they ever were listening. It seems we have already lost \npatience for a regime of arms inspections that might take months to \nplay out. But going to war will require our commitment to Iraq to last \nyears--years.\n  The problems with Iraq are not going to be solved when 700 cruise \nmissiles and 3,000 bombs land on that country in the opening days and \nthe opening nights of war. Assuming victory--and I assume victory--we \nwill be on the hook. You know what that means. We will be on the hook \nto rehabilitate Iraq. And I fear that the rebuilding of that ancient \ncountry with its ancient artifacts--a country that goes back to the \nmists of biblical years, of Abraham, and Issac, and Jacob, and Joseph--\na country, a land of Ur, and a land between the two great rivers--after \nthe rebuilding of that ancient country, there will have to be another \nact of U.S. unilateralism. There you are--another act of U.S. \nunilateralism for which the American people are ill prepared.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I first pay tribute to my very \ndistinguished colleague and senior Senator from West Virginia, whose \neloquence on this subject has been magnificent in the last months and \nwhose leadership in behalf of the wisdom of the Senate and the \ntradition of the Senate has been recognized by--I believe the Senator \nsaid over 20,000 telephone calls from fellow citizens came into his \noffice in response to his outspoken courage.\n  The Senator said he noticed in last Sunday's New York Times a reprint \nof one of his famous speeches which he gave here just a short while \nago.\n  I thank the Senator for his gracious leadership on behalf of our \ncountry and on behalf of the institution of this Senate. This Senator \nhas learned more about the Constitution and the traditions of this \ngreat institution from the Senator from West Virginia than from any \nother source. I am grateful for that education, which is actually the \nsubject I want to bring up today because in a few moments we will begin \nvoting once again on proceeding to a nomination to the second highest \ncourt.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, if the distinguished Senator will yield \nbriefly--\n  Mr. DAYTON. I yield to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, may I thank the distinguished Senator for \nhis overly charitable comments concerning this Senator. And I am indeed \ngrateful. I am grateful for the fact that he on several occasions here \nduring his short career thus far in the Senate--I predict that it will \nbe a long career, if he wishes to make it a long one--has stood with me \nwith regard to several important subjects--subjects that deal with the \nConstitution, deal with this institution, and that deal with war and \npeace.\n  I thank him for standing shoulder to shoulder and toe to toe. I thank \nhim likewise for what he brings to the Senate--vigor and fresh \ninsights, vision that is beyond today's 24 hours, a man whose kinsman \nserved in the Constitutional Convention from the State of New Jersey, \nand whose signature on that Constitution will be there until kingdom \ncome.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\nwould stand proudly with the Senator on any matter shoulder to \nshoulder. I believe I am 30-some years younger than the Senator. I wish \nI had the Senator's vigor and eloquence to carry forward. I thank the \nSenator for those kind words.\n  Taking what I have learned from the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, I note, with dismay, that while this body has spent over \n100 hours on the Senate floor debating this judicial nomination, I \ncompare that 100 hours on one judicial appointment with the number of \nhours this year this body has spent discussing and debating a \ndeclaration of war before commencing a war against Iraq.\n  And the answer is: Zero, not 1 hour, not 1 minute of formal debate in \nthe 108th session of the Senate on this profound matter of war and \npeace, life and death--even now, with this Nation poised on the brink \nof war, a war which the United States is instigating, without direct \nprovocation, without an immediate threat to our national security; the \nfirst war under the new doctrine of preemption, a claimed right to \nattack another country because they might become a future threat; the \nfirst war in which the United States is perceived in the eyes of much \nof the rest of the world as the provocateur, as a threat to world \npeace.\n  The Times of London recently surveyed the English people and asked: \nWho is the greatest threat to world peace today? Forty-five percent \nnamed Saddam Hussein, 45 percent named President Bush. In Dublin, \nIreland, the poll was 31 percent Saddam Hussein, 68 percent President \nBush. In the Arab world, the populations are overwhelmingly against a \nU.S. invasion of Iraq.\n  Osama bin Laden, with his most recent tape, is attempting to exploit \nthose emotions, exhorting the members of his al-Qaida terrorist \norganization and followers to rise up against the invader, the \ncrusader, the United States.\n  Those sentiments come as a great shock to us, as unwarranted and \nundeserved as they are. A few, unfortunately, in high levels in this \nadministration believe they don't matter, that they are irrelevant.\n  Eighteen months ago, we had the sympathy and support of the entire \nworld after the dastardly attacks of 9/11, support and sympathy which \nhas been needlessly squandered and which will not easily be regained.\n  Here at home our citizens receive color-coded warnings of greater or \nlesser unspecified threats. They are told to stockpile water, food, \nplastic sheets, and duct tape, or else they are told nothing at all.\n  The Secretary of Defense, testifying before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, on which I serve, said recently: We are entering what may \nprove to be the most dangerous security environment the world has \nknown.\n  In the midst of this ominous, dangerous, fateful time, the 108th \nsession of the Senate has devoted no time for debate or discussion. The \nlast 3 days the debate has been on a bill that purports to ban partial-\nbirth abortions, a matter of importance, a matter of great concern to \nsome, but not one that required the attention of the Senate at this \nmoment in time.\n  Now we move on to consider, once again, a judicial nomination, then \nanother judge; and before that there was another judge. Does it appear \nwe are avoiding something? Well, we are. We are avoiding our \nconstitutional responsibility, perhaps the most important \nresponsibility placed upon us by the U.S. Constitution: whether to \ndeclare war.\n\n  As I have learned from the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nthe Constitution says--simply, clearly, emphatically--Congress shall \ndeclare war, only Congress, no one else--not the President, not the \njudiciary, not the military--only Congress, only the 435 \nRepresentatives and 100 Senators elected by and acting for the people \nof the United States.\n  Last October, a majority of the Members of the 107th Congress--a \nmajority of the Members in the House and a majority of the Senate--\nvoted to transfer that authority to the President. Five months before \nhe even made his own final decision regarding war or peace, Congress \nwas asked to give him that authority that the Constitution assigns only \nto us. And Congress did so. It passed a resolution that said the \nPresident may use whatever means necessary, including the use of force, \nagainst Iraq.\n  Oh, we use such clever euphemisms in the Senate, words which disguise \nthe meaning of our intentions. Use ``whatever means necessary.'' And, \noh, by the way, lest you forget, it is OK with us if you use force--not \nthe lives of American men and women, not their bodies, their blood, \ntheir patriotism--use force--not the deadly, ear-splitting, Earth-\nshaking, people-maiming, death-dealing bombs, and other weapons of \ndestruction, the most devastating, overwhelming, terrifying, death-\ndealing force the world has ever known coming from us, the good guys, \nthe protectors, the preservers of world peace, the United States of \nAmerica.\n  What incredible foresight the Founders of this great Nation had in \nnot wanting a decision that enormous, that Earth-shaking or ear-\nshattering to be made by one person--not by this President, not by any \nPresident.\n  Instead, this President asked for--and the 107th Congress acquiesced \nand gave--complete, unrestricted, unrestrained authority, with no \nconditions, no restraints to make that decision. Don't tie my hands, \nthe President said.\n  Don't tie the President's hands? What did the Founders of the country \nthink of that? Thomas Jefferson wrote, in 1798:\n\n       In questions of power, then, let no more be heard of \n     confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the \n     chains of the Constitution.\n\n  ``Bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.''\n  Tie his hands? That was not enough. ``Chain him to the \nConstitution.''\n  We, in Congress, are supposed to be chained to the Constitution. We \ntook an oath. When we were sworn in, we promised to support and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic, bear true faith and allegiance to the same Constitution.\n  That was our oath and our allegiance written--not to the country, not \nto our State, not to our Government but to the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America.\n  The Founders of this Nation had other admonitions for the United \nStates regarding the Constitution: Follow it or change it, but don't \nignore it or evade it.\n  George Washington, in his Farewell Address, in 1796, said:\n\n       If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution of \n     constitutional powers be wrong, let it be corrected by \n     amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But \n     let there be no change by usurpation, for though this, in \n     one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the \n     customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed.\n\n  Finally, an admonition from another perspective, that of Edward \nGibbon, the author of the ``History of the Decline and Fall of the \nRoman Empire.'' He said:\n\n       The principles of a free constitution are irrevocably lost \n     when the legislative power is taken over by the executive.\n\n  In this sense, the legislative power was not taken over by the \nExecutive. We gave it away. Here, Mr. President, you decide. If you are \nright, we will try to share the credit. If you are wrong, you take the \nblame.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator yields.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield without losing his \nright to the floor?\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator yields without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota is making a great \nspeech. It is great because of the quotations the Senator from \nMinnesota has given to us today about that Constitution.\n  The Senator was one of the lonely 23 who voted not to give to this \nPresident, or any other President--not to attempt to hand over to this \nPresident or to any other President--the power to declare war, which is \nfound in the eighth section of article I of the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n\n  A nominee for a Federal judgeship came to me the other day. I said: \nWhere in the Constitution is the power to declare war lodged? He didn't \nremember. I said: Where in the Constitution is the vestment of the \npower to appropriate moneys? He knew it was there, but he didn't know \nin what section that was to be found. Of course, I\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\ndidn't have any problem in reminding him where both were to be found.\n  But the Senator from Minnesota today is referring to the Constitution \nof the United States, written in 1787, signed by 39 individuals, among \nwhom was one kinsman of the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Mark \nDayton, and his name is found in that illustrious roll of signers from \nthe State of New Jersey, William Livingston, David Brearley, William \nPaterson, Jonathan Dayton. The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Mark Dayton, \nvoted to uphold the Constitution, concerning which he has stood before \nthat desk of the Presiding Officer with his hand on the Bible and swore \nto support and defend that Constitution.\n  This Senator who sits in front of me, I now put my hand on his \nshoulder, Senator Kent Conrad, he was among the 23, yes. He was on that \nillustrious roll to which someone in ages hence will point. The Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Durbin, sits here on the floor today. He, too, was \none of the 23 who stood for the Constitution on that day, when a \nmajority of the Senate voted to shift the power to declare war to the \nPresident of the United States. But 23 Senators voted to leave that \nauthority where the Constitution puts it: namely, in Congress.\n  What would Jonathan Dayton have said could he have spoken on the day \nthat those 23 Members stood up for the Constitution--21 Democrats, one \nIndependent and one Republican--what would Jonathan Dayton of New \nJersey have said if he could have spoken to the Senate that day? What \nwould his advice to us have been?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I think he would have said it was a good thing we added \nWest Virginia to the United States of America so we could have the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia to give us the guidance he did \nthat day.\n  Since the hour is approaching for the vote under the rules, I will \nconclude my remarks.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator for his kind words.\n  I respectfully urge the majority leader and all of my colleagues to \nturn their attention to this fateful decision when we return next week. \nA decision whether or not to vote a declaration of war is one that \nwould be a very difficult vote, one that would be a career-shaping or \ncareer-shattering vote, but it would be one the Constitution requires \nof us, as do our fellow citizens who elected us. And it is one that \nonly we can and must do, to vote on whether or not to declare war.\n  I urge the Senate to turn its attention to that matter when it \nresumes next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will oppose the nomination of Jay \nBybee to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I was not able to attend \nthe hearing that was held on Mr. Bybee because of Secretary Powell's \npresentation that morning to the United Nations. So I submitted written \nquestions, as did a number of my colleagues. Unfortunately, I have to \nsay after reviewing Mr. Bybee's response to those questions that his \nunwillingness to provide information in response to our inquiries is \nstriking. On more than 20 occasions, Mr. Bybee refused to answer a \nquestion, claiming over and over again that as an attorney in the \nDepartment of Justice he could not comment on any advice that he gave \nat any time. This is unfortunately becoming a very familiar refrain of \nnominees before the Judiciary Committee.\n  I say unfortunate because it puts many of us in the position of \nhaving to oppose nominees because they have not been forthcoming. This \nwas not the approach taken by at least some Bush nominees in the last \nCongress. Michael McConnell, for example, was forthcoming in his \ntestimony and answers to written questions. He convinced me that he \nwould put aside his personal views if he were confirmed to the bench.\n  There is an extensive body of legal work both written by or at least \nsigned off on by this nominee, in this case unpublished Office of Legal \nCounsel opinions. The administration and the nominee are acting as if \nthey are irrelevant to the confirmation process. A nominee cannot \nsimply claim that he or she will follow Supreme Court precedent and ask \nus to take that assurance on faith, when there are written records that \nmay help us evaluate that pledge, but the nominee refuses to make those \nrecords available.\n  Only three OLC opinions had been made publicly available since Mr. \nBybee's confirmation to head that office. That is extraordinary, given \nthat 1,187 OLC opinions dating back to 1996 are publicly available. \nThis is a dramatic change in the Department's practice, a change that \ndid not occur until this nominee was confirmed to be Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the office. While there may be some justification for \nreleasing fewer opinions since 9/11, the wholesale refusal to share \nwith the public and Congress important OLC decisions affecting a wide \nrange of legal matters is, to say the least, troublesome.\n  But the failure to make OLC opinions available to the Judiciary \nCommittee during the consideration of a nominee for a seat on a circuit \ncourt is unacceptable. Even White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez, in a \nletter Mr. Bybee cites in his written responses, agrees that there is \nno universal bar to disclosure of OLC opinions. Gonzalez wrote that:\n\n       No bright-line rule historically has governed, or now \n     governs, responses to congressional requests for the general \n     category of Executive Branch ``deliberative documents.''\n\n  The administration should be able to agree to an acceptable procedure \nto allow the Judiciary Committee to review Mr. Bybee's OLC opinions. \nGiven the recent history of many OLC opinions being made public, it is \nhard to believe that there are no opinions authored by Mr. Bybee that \ncould be disclosed without damaging the deliberative process. Indeed, \nit is very hard to give credence to the idea that OLC's independence \nwould be compromised by the release of some selection of the opinions \nof interest to members of the Judiciary Committee or the Senate.\n  Without the OLC memos, important questions about the nominee's views \non how far the Government can go in the war on terrorism, enforcing the \nrights of women, enforcing the rights of gays and lesbians, and other \nimportant issues do not just remain unanswered, they apparently remain \noff-limits.\n  One of Mr. Bybee's responses may explain the reluctance to make any \nOLC materials available. In his response to a question from Senator \nBiden about why DOJ did not create an independent Violence Against \nWomen Office at DOJ as required by Congress in a bill passed last year, \nMr. Bybee left the impression that OLC may have either intentionally \nomitted or ignored the key portions of the legislative history in \ncrafting its opinion.\n  In a series of questions from Senator Biden about his involvement in \nDOJ's decision on the VAWO, Mr. Bybee was given the opportunity to \nclarify his view of the law and correct what appears to be a clearly \nerroneous interpretation of the legislative history. Instead he seems \nto try to downplay the importance of his office's legal analysis on the \ndecision. He states at one point:\n\n       The structure of the letter would thus indicate that \n     legislative history had no significant bearing on its \n     analysis or conclusion.\n\n  The members of the Judiciary Committee are entitled to better. How \ncan we be confident that Mr. Bybee will put aside his personal policy \nviews and fairly interpret and apply the law as passed by this body, \nwhen it seems that his office crafted a legal opinion designed to allow \nthe Department of Justice to willfully ignore clear legislative intent? \nPerhaps the legal opinion itself will shed some light on this question, \nbut we are not being permitted to see it.\n  Mr. Bybee also mischaracterized many of his own writings and speeches \nand failed to directly answer most of the questions put to him about \nthem, claiming he would simply follow existing Supreme Court precedent. \nAs we all know, the Supreme Court has not answered every legal \nquestion. It is our circuit court judges that are routinely in the \nposition of having to address novel legal issues, not the Supreme \nCourt.\n\n  For example, I asked Mr. Bybee about his views, published in a law \nreview article, that we should consider repealing the 17th Amendment \nwhich provides for the direct election of Senators. The nominee now \nsimply states that Senators should be popularly elected, almost \nclaiming he had never argued to the contrary in his article.\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\nHis answers to my questions about this article were evasive, not \nforthcoming.\n  Another telling example is his response to a series of questions from \nSenator Edwards about a 1982 article in which he criticized the IRS \ndecision to deny tax exempt status to Bob Jones University because of \nits racially discriminatory practices. The article is full of \nstatements revealing a disdain for anti-discrimination policies and \nwarned of a parade of horribles should the government continue to use \nits spending power to advance such policies.\n  Yet, in his written responses, Mr. Bybee seems to deny the very clear \nmeaning of his written words. He goes so far as to claim that he was \nonly commenting on the Government's change in position in the case and \nnot the very important public policy issue at the heart of the case. \nThat, it seems to me, is an adventurous reading of the article, at \nbest.\n  Based on Mr. Bybee's unwillingness to answer any question about his \nviews on a wide range of issues, his distortion of his own limited but \ntelling written record, and the failure of the administration to \nprovide any of his numerous OLC opinions to the Judiciary Committee for \nreview, I must vote no on his nomination to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nnomination of Jay Bybee for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. \nBybee recently passed out of the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 12 to \n6.\n  Mr. Bybee is a smart person and a talented attorney--there is no \nargument about that. But he is one of the most strident voices in the \ncountry in advocating states' rights over Federal rights.\n  For example--and I think members of the Senate here should take \nspecial note of this--he wrote a law review article arguing that the \n17th amendment was a bad idea. The 17th amendment, of course, is the \namendment that allowed for direct election of United States Senators.\n  Mr. Bybee believes that ratification of the 17th amendment has \nresulted in too much power for the Federal government, and too little \nfor the States. Here is what he said in his law review article:\n\n       If we are genuinely interested in federalism as a check on \n     the excesses of the national government and therefore, as a \n     means of protecting individuals, we should consider repealing \n     the 17th Amendment.\n\n  I, for one, disagree.\n  On behalf of a conservative foundation, Mr. Bybee wrote a successful \namicus brief in the 2000 case United States v. Morrison, in which the \nSupreme Court struck down part of the Violence Against Women Act. Mr. \nBybee wrote that Congress had no power under either the Commerce Clause \nor the 14th amendment to pass crucial provisions of this law. I thought \nthis was settled law 75 years ago. Mr. Bybee thinks it is time to \nrevisit this notion.\n  In addition, I am troubled by Mr. Bybee's positions regarding gay \nrights. He has been very critical of the Supreme Court's 1996 decision, \nRomer v. Evans, that struck down a Colorado constitutional amendment \nthat prohibited local governments from passing laws to protect gay \npeople. He called such laws that protect gay people from discrimination \n``preferences for homosexuals.''\n  In another gay rights case, he wrote a brief defending the Defense \nDepartment's policy of subjecting gay and lesbian defense contractors \nto heightened review before deciding whether to give them security \nclearances. He argued that this policy was not a violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause and argued that such reviews were justified, in part, \nbecause some gays and lesbians experienced ``emotional instability.''\n   I am also concerned that Mr. Bybee--as head of the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Legal Counsel--has been involved in shaping some \nof the most controversial policies of the Ashcroft Justice Department. \nFor example, he may have been involved in the new interpretation of the \nsecond amendment.\n  He may have been involved in the TIPS program, in which people in the \nUnited States are encouraged to spy on their neighbors and coworkers \nand report any conduct they find to be ``unusual.''\n  He may have been involved in the decision to declare the al Qaeda and \nTaliban detainees at Guantanamo Bay as prisoners of war under the \nGeneva Convention.\n  I say ``may have been involved'' because he refused to tell us. In \nwritten responses to 20 different questions we posed to him, he gave \nthe following answer:\n\n       As an attorney at the Department of Justice, I am obligated \n     to keep confidential the legal advice that I provide to \n     others in the executive branch. I cannot comment on whether \n     or not I have provided any such advice and, if so, the \n     substance of that advice.\n\n  Mr. Bybee is the most recent example of an appellate court nominee \nwho has stonewalled the Senate Judiciary Committee. I do not believe \nthat such conduct should be rewarded.\n  I oppose the nomination of Mr. Bybee to the Ninth Circuit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3693-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3693-S3694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF MIGUEL A.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business so as not to interrupt the debate on the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to speak for 3 minutes on the \nnominee. I can do it before or after my leader on the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I tell my friend from New York, I have allowed others to \ngo, but one more doesn't bother me, especially someone as good as the \nSenator from New York. I certainly have no objection.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. I will try to be brief and leave \nthe majority of the remaining time for him.\n  I rise in support of the nomination of Jay Bybee for the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I realize that my support--I was one of two \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee to be for Mr. Bybee--may surprise \nsome people, so I wanted to explain for a few moments why I will be \nvoting to confirm him.\n  As most of my colleagues know, I use three criteria to evaluate \njudicial nominees: Excellence, moderation, diversity.\n  Excellence, legal excellence, Mr. Bybee meets that criteria. \nDiversity, you can't judge that by one individual, but the Bush \nadministration has been pretty good, certainly not terrible, in terms \nof diversity.\n  It is moderation where I have had the greatest problem with some of \nthe President's nominees. I don't believe in judicial nominees too far \nleft or too far right because in each case, they tend to make law, not \ninterpret law, as the Founding Fathers said they should. I believe \nthere has to be balance, balance on the courts. And I have said this \nmany times, but there is nothing wrong with a Justice Scalia on the \ncourt if he is balanced by a Justice Marshall. I wouldn't want five \nScalias, but one might make a good and interesting and thoughtful court \nwith one Brennan. A Rehnquist should be balanced by a Marshall.\n  Jay Bybee, make no mistake about it, is a very conservative nominee. \nIt is fair to put him in a similar category with many of the more \nconservative nominees we have had. If Mr. Bybee were nominated to \nanother court that is hanging in the balance or where most of the \nnominees were conservative, I probably wouldn't vote for him. If he \nwere nominated for the Supreme Court, for example, there would be a \ndifferent calculus. But Mr. Bybee is nominated to the Ninth Circuit. \nThe Ninth Circuit is by far the most liberal court in the country. Most \nof the nominees are Democratic from Democratic Presidents. It is the \ncourt that gave us the Pledge of Allegiance case which is way out of \nthe mainstream on the left side. Therefore, I think Jay Bybee will \nprovide some balance.\n  Let me repeat, if he were nominated to another court, I might have \nevaluated this differently. But when it comes to nominations, I mean \nwhat I say and I say what I mean. There has to be balance. Standards \ncannot only apply when they help achieve the desired outcome.\n  I want to be as fair and honest as I can be in this process. I have \ndeveloped a set of criteria for evaluating nominees. I don't pretend to \nchange them when after applying those criteria the scales tip in favor \nof supporting a nominee many of my friends oppose.\n  I respect those who arrive at a different conclusion. I understand \ntheir reasoning. I intend to vote yes on Mr. Bybee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have moved the time up, I realize, in \nthe next 6 minutes for the first vote. That is something I have agreed \nto accommodate a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle who have \ncommitments. As a result, also as a result of yielding time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, who had one of the nominees and, of \ncourse, appropriately should be speaking, and others, I will not be \nable to say all the things I wanted to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 20 minutes after the \nconclusion of the final rollcall vote today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Obviously, as usual, should the leaders have other plans \nfor that, I will do my usual courtesy of yielding to them.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent on the nomination of Jay S. Bybee, of Nevada, to be United \nStates Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit?

STEELE, OF ALABAMA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n          DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of William H. Steele, of Alabama, to be the \nUnited States District Judge for the Southern District of Alabama?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Judge William \nSteele to the United States District Court for the Southern District of \nAlabama.\n  Judge's Steele's professional record indicates that he is eminently \nqualified for the federal trial bench. Upon graduation from the \nUniversity of Alabama School of Law, Judge Steele clerked for the \nTuscaloosa County district court. As an Assistant District Attorney in \nMobile, he handled hundreds of criminal matters, including more than 75 \njury trials. Upon being promoted to Chief Assistant District Attorney, \nhe was significantly involved in the creation of the Child Advocacy \nCenter for physically and sexually abused children. He then served as \nan Assistant United States Attorney prosecuting mail fraud, public \ncorruption, drug violations, firearms violations, and tax code \nviolations.\n  In addition to his broad federal and state criminal experience, Judge \nSteele has considerable civil experience. In the private sector, while \ncontinuing to maintain a viable state and federal criminal trial and \nappellate practice, he also handled domestic relations matters, civil \nlitigation in State and Federal court, representation of claimants in \nsocial security matters, and representation of the Alabama Department \nof Human Resources in child custody matters.\n  Since 1990, Judge Steele has served as a Federal magistrate judge. In \nthis capacity, he has handled a wide range of civil matters, \npreliminary criminal matters, prisoner cases, and social security \nappeals.\n  I know that Judge Steele will be a credit to the Federal bench and \nwill honorably serve the citizens of south Alabama. I thank my \ncolleagues for voting for his confirmation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to make some \nremarks in support of the nomination of Judge William H. Steele to be \nU.S. district judge for the Southern District of Alabama. He is one of \nAmerica's finest magistrate judges--a magistrate judge who does a lot \nof the kind of legal work that goes on in every Federal courthouse in \nAmerica. Magistrate judges are not title III Federal judges, but they \ndo much the same work day after day that Federal judges do.\n  During his time as a magistrate judge, Judge Steele has had firsthand \nexperience in the work, and he has won the respect of the bench and the \nbar in southern Alabama.\n  He has been in training now for 12 years for this position. In the \nSouthern District of Alabama the magistrates are used to an \nextraordinary degree by the Federal judges who allow the magistrates to \ndo as much work as possible. And they frequently preside over civil \ncases with the consent of the parties involved.\n  I have talked with other lawyers and judges in Alabama. They are very \nexcited about his nomination and look forward to his confirmation.\n  Some people talk about public service, but throughout his life, Bill \nSteele has done more than just talk. Judge Steele has dedicated the \nbetter part of his life to public service and has served both this \ncountry and the State of Alabama well. After graduating summa cum laude \nfrom the University of Southern Mississippi in 1972, Judge Steele \nserved in the U.S. Marine Corps as an officer, pilot, and instructor \npilot. During his service in the Marine Corps, Judge Steele \nparticipated in the operation to evacuate American citizens from \nLebanon in 1976. He also served in the Alabama National Guard as a \npilot and as commanding officer of an assault helicopter company.\n  After serving his country in the Marine Corps, Judge Steele attended \nthe University of Alabama School of Law. After law school, he was \nemployed as an assistant district attorney in Mobile, AL, and worked \nfor 6 years in the office of a Democrat district attorney.\n  I was U.S. attorney during that time. That is where I got to know \nBill. Our staff worked closely with the district attorney's office, and \nthey always came back with the most glowing opinions of Bill Steele and \nhis integrity, his judgment, and his fidelity to truth and justice.\n  Later, Judge Steele became chief assistant district attorney in \nMobile. I got to know him well during that time and developed great \nrespect for him. I think he tried 100 or more trials as an assistant \ndistrict attorney. Then, in 1987, given his reputation for excellence, \nI hired him as an assistant attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office. I \ncan say without reservation that during his service, while I was a U.S. \nAttorney in the Southern District of Alabama, Judge Steele did not \ndisappoint. Judge Steele tried a number of cases while he was in the \nU.S. Attorney's Office, which is the Federal system in which he will \nnow be a district court judge. He held that position for 2 years and\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\nthen went into private practice and did an excellent job there.\n  He was instrumental as a private practitioner and chief assistant \ndistrict attorney, in the establishment of the Child Advocacy Center, \nan agency devoted to identifying and providing assistance to child \nvictims of physical and sexual violence.\n  In 1990, the Federal court in the Southern District of Alabama \ncommenced its search process for a U.S. magistrate. They usually have \n60 or more applications. It is a very competitive process. The judges \nwant the very finest lawyer--someone who would make a superb judge \nbecause the better work that magistrate does, the more relief the \nFederal district judges get. After all that competition, he won and was \nhired.\n  For 13 years now he has served as a magistrate judge. He has done so \nmany different cases.\n  Bill Steele is one of Alabama's most outstanding magistrate judges, \nand I am confident that he will be an even better district court judge. \nI have followed Judge Steele's career since the time I worked with him \nat the U.S. Attorneys Office in the Southern district of Alabama, so I \nknow from firsthand experience what kind of individual Judge Steele is. \nThis statement will not do him justice. He is a nominee of the highest \norder, and it is an understatement when I say that I am pleased that \nPresident Bush has chosen to nominate Magistrate Judge William H. \nSteele for elevation to the Southern District of Alabama.\n  As a magistrate judge, Judge Steele has been training for a district \ncourt position for the last 12 years, and because the Southern District \nof Alabama utilizes magistrate judges to a greater extent than most \nother districts, he will be able to hit the ground running in his new \nposition. I have had conversations with the other judges in the \nSouthern district and I know that they are as excited about Judge \nSteele's nomination as I am, so I am glad that we can move forward with \nhis confirmation.\n  Some people talk about public service, but throughout his life, Judge \nSteele has done more than just talk. Judge Steele has dedicated the \nbetter part of his life to public service and has served both this \ncountry and the great state of Alabama well. After graduating summa cum \nlaude, from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1972, Judge \nSteele served in the United States Marine Corps as on officer, pilot, \nand instructor pilot. During his service in the Marine Corps, Judge \nSteele participated in the operation to evacuate American citizens from \nLebanon in 1976. Judge Steele also served in the Alabama National Guard \nas a pilot and as the commanding officer of an assault helicopter \ncompany.\n  After serving his country in the Marine Corps, Judge Steele attended \nthe University of Alabama School of Law, graduating in 1980. After law \nschool, Judge Steele was employed as an Assistant District Attorney in \nMobile, Alabama, and worked for six years for a democrat District \nAttorney. At the District Attorney's Office, Judge Steele distinguished \nhimself as an outstanding advocate, litigating close to, if not more, \nthan 100 jury trials. In recognition of his legal skills and leadership \nqualities in the District Attorney's Office, Judge Steele was appointed \nas Chief Assistant District Attorney in 1985. As the Chief Assistant, \nJudge Steele was instrumental in establishing, the Child Advocacy \nCenter, an agency devoted to identifying and providing assistance to, \nchild victims of physical and sexual violence.\n  In 1987, given his reputation in the community for excellent legal \nabilities and personal skills, I was proud to hire Judge Steele as an \nAssistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Alabama. I can say \nwithout reservation, that during his service, while I was the U.S. \nAttorney in that office, Judge Steele did not disappoint. I found him \nto be a first-rate lawyer who set the standard for integrity by \ntreating all parties with respect.\n  In 1990, Judge Steele was appointed to the position, which he \ncurrently holds, as a United States Magistrate Judge. He has served in \nthis position with distintion, handling a full array of criminal and \ncivil matters in federal court. The Southern District of Alabama has a \nheavy caseload, and the judges there depend on magistrate judges to go \nbeyond preliminary criminal matters and social security cases. The \nmagistrate judges in the Southern District are in rotation to receive \n25 percent of the civil docket, where the parties consent. So Judge \nSteele has been doing the job of a district judge, including presiding \nover civil jury trials in many instances. It is my understanding, from \ntalking to lawyers who practice in the Southern District, that Judge \nSteele has managed his docket well and the numbers show it. This is \nsimply an outstanding nominee.\n\n  Judge Steele has not only been a leader in the workforce, but has \nbeen a leader and a active participant in his community as well, \nserving on the board of the Child Advocacy Center that he helped \nestablish. And for the record, Judge Steele does not shy away from the \narts. Judge Steele often volunteers his time to support First Night \nMobile, a family-oriented, New Year's Eve, alcohol-free celebration of \nthe arts, and he regularly performs with the Mobile Symphonic Pops as a \nsaxophone player.\n  I acknowledge, that all of these accolades would be futile, if Judge \nSteele had not demonstrated commitment to the rule of law and to the \nConstitution, during his service as a magistrate judge. In my view, \nthis is the first and foremost requirement for a federal judge. This is \nwhat our democracy hinges upon, and I know that Judge Steele is \ncommitted to that requirement. Judge Steele has a reputation for being \neminently fair and impartial throughout the bar association. And having \nworked with him personally, I know that he is an individual with \nunquestioned integrity and the utmost character.\n  I will just say this: when it comes to serving with the distinction, \nit is the lawyers in the community who know a judge the best. Here is \nwhat Fred Gray, former counsel to the late Reverend Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., had to say about Judge Steele in a letter to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee supporting his confirmation:\n\n       I have practiced law in the State of Alabama and before all \n     the federal district courts . . . I realize that it is \n     important that all the judges who serve on the courts . . . \n     are one[s] who possess the necessary personal \n     characteristics, experience, practical knowledge, legal \n     skills and professional background, so they will administer \n     justice in a fair and impartial manner.\n       I have discussed [Judge Steele's] qualifications generally \n     and specifically with reference to intelligence, honesty, \n     morality, integrity, maturity, stability, demeanor and \n     temperament with members of the bar who know him and have \n     practiced before him and other judges who sit on some of the \n     courts in Mobile. Based upon their representations to me, \n     Judge Steele possess all the necessary qualities for a \n     [federal judgeship].\n       I have had the opportunity to meet with Judge Steele \n     personally . . . I believe he will be fair to all litigants \n     who appear before him . . . regardless of color or national \n     origin or the type of litigation. I believe he will \n     administer justice tempered with mercy.\n\n  I do not believe that you could receive a better endorsement than \nthis one.\n  The lawyers and individuals who know Judge Steele best, because they \nhave worked with him and practiced in front of him, have all voiced \nsupport. Since his nomination has been pending, Judge Steele has been \nendorsed by a number of individuals including the current President and \n16 former presidents of the Mobile Bar Association, several former \npresident of the Birmingham Bar, and several former presidents of the \nAlabama Bar Association.\n  The Vernon Z. Crawford Bay Area--African-American--Bar Association of \nMobile, AL gave its unanimous endorsement:\n\n       The . . . Association strongly recommends Magistrate Bill \n     Steele for this position because he recognizes and is \n     sensitive to the issues facing African American lawyers and \n     the African American community. . . . We give Magistrate \n     Steele our highest recommendation.\n\n  Major General Gary Cooper, USMC--Ret., former Ambassador to Jamaica, \npresident of a Commonwealth National Bank in Mobile, AL, and an African \nAmerican:\n\n       As an African American citizen of Mobile and as a retired \n     Marine, I appreciate what William Steele has done for his \n     community as a county and federal prosecutor and federal \n     magistrate, and what he has done for his country as a Marine \n     helicopter pilot. His record indicates that he will make a \n     fine . . . Judge.\n\n  Joy Williams, former law clerk to Magistrate Judge Steele and an \nAfrican American:\n\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\n\n       [W]hile I was the only person of color clerking on the \n     court at the time, I truly felt comfortable and accepted from \n     the moment I interviewed with Judge Steele. He has never \n     given me a reason to question the sincerity of his support of \n     me and my endeavors both professionally and personally.\n\n  Merceria Ludgood, Assistant County Attorney for Mobile County, former \nDirector of Program Services for Legal Services Corporation in \nWashington, D.C., and former Executive Director of Legal Services \nCorporation of Alabama:\n\n       Magistrate Judge Steele is one of the finest men I have \n     ever known. Never once have I believed his actions to be \n     motivated by politics or ambition. He simply wants to do the \n     right thing for the right reasons.\n\n  Robert D. Segall, attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in \nthe case opposing the display of the Ten Commandments in an Alabama \ncourtroom:\n\n       Judge Steele is an outstanding selection, is very highly \n     qualified, and I respectfully urge his prompt confirmation.\n\n  Carlos A. William, Southern District of Alabama Federal Defenders \nOrganization:\n\n       During the years I have practiced in [Judge Steele's] \n     court, I have come to know a jurist of integrity, \n     professionalism and compassion, and I have grown to respect \n     his judgement. . . . [I] note that every lawyer in my office, \n     Kristen Gartman Rogers, K. Lyn Hillman Campbell and \n     Christopher Knight, in unsolicited comments, have expressed \n     their support for Magistrate Steele's nomination. It is \n     therefore without hesitation that I send this letter in \n     support of Magistrate William Steele's nomination.\n\n  Larry C. Moorer, long time practitioner in Mobile, Alabama and an \nAfrican American:\n\n       Over the years, I have handled several legal matters before \n     Magistrate Judge Steele . . . He has shown over the years \n     that he is fair and impartial, and will rule according to the \n     law regardless of public opinion or possibly his own personal \n     feelings. . . . Magistrate Judge Steele provides a level \n     playing field . . . [and] he possesses the attributes for \n     being an outstanding appellate judge.\n\n  Larry Sims, President of the Mobile Bar Association and 16 former \npresidents.\n  Numerous officers and members of the Women of the Mobile Bar \nAssociation.\n  Hodge Alves, President of the Mobile Chapter of the Federal Bar \nAssociation.\n  Several former presidents of the Montgomery Bar Association.\n  Bruce Rogers, incoming president of the Birmingham Bar Association, \nand a number of former presidents.\n  Warren Lightfoot, former president of the Alabama Bar Association, \nand managing partner of one of the most respected litigation firms in \nBirmingham, AL.\n  Jim North, a prominent Democrat in Birmingham, former clerk for \nJustice Hugo Black, and former President of the Alabama Bar \nAssociation.\n  Rosemary Chambers, Circuit Judge of Mobile County.\n  Chris Galanos, a Democrat and former District Attorney of Mobile \nCounty who employed Steele as a prosecutor for several years.\n  Alex Bunin, Federal Public Defender, Districts of Northern New York \nand Vermont.\n  Greg Breedlove, on behalf of the unanimous firm of Cunningham, \nBounds, Yance, Crowder and Brown, L.L.C. in Mobile, Alabama--prominent \nDemocratic, plaintiffs' firm.\n  John Morrow, former president of the Birmingham Bar Association and \nlong-time practicing attorney with one of the largest firm's in \nBirmingham, AL.\n  Ed Allen, 38-year practitioner with one of the largest firms in \nBirmingham, Alabama, and former member of the Executive Committee of \nthe Birmingham Bar Association, and the Labor and Employment sections \nof the American Bar Association and the Alabama Bar Association.\n  Henry Brewster, Mobile, AL, Democrat plaintiff's lawyer whose \npractice focuses on employment discrimination cases.\n  Jerry McDowell, long-time practitioner from Mobile, AL.\n  This support, in my view, confirms that President Bush made the right \ndecision in nominating Judge Steele.\n  Judge Steele has the professional qualifications, integrity, \nprofessional competence and judicial temperament to serve on the \nfederal bench in the Southern District of Alabama. The ABA has \nacknowledged such, rating him unanimously qualified. As a magistrate \njudge in the Southern District of Alabama, he is practically already \ndoing the job. Judge Steele will make an excellent addition to the \nfederal bench, and deserves to be confirmed by this Senate. I look \nforward to supporting Judge Steele and to casting my vote in favor of \nhis confirmation. I urge my colleagues to support Judge Steele.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I want to say I don't know that I have met a finer individual, a more \ndedicated patriot than Judge Bill Steele. He is someone I admire and \nsomeone who is admired by people I admire. People who have good \njudgment of character think he is first rate.\n  The Bar Association in the Southern District of Alabama has \nunanimously told me time and again how much they appreciate him and how \nwell they think he will do as a Federal judge. And I am very pleased \nfor him.\n  He has received support from a large number of different sources. Of \ncourse, the established bar in the Southern District of Alabama speaks \nvery highly of him.\n  You ask what about others? What do they say about him? The President \nof the Alabama Bar Association for the State is Mr. Fred Gray. He was \nformer counsel for the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and has \ntried some of the most historic cases in the history of the United \nStates.\n  He was involved in New York Times v. Sullivan and Chameleon v. Light \nFoot and was the attorney on the Rosa Parks bus boycott case. He worked \ndirectly with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., at that time. He has written \nan excellent book describing the bus ride to justice.\n  He writes to me his strong support for Judge Steele. He realizes he \nsaid it is important that all judges who serve on the courts possess \nthe necessary personal character, experience, knowledge, legal skills, \nand professional background so they will administer justice in a fair \nand impartial way.\n  He went on to explain his meeting with Judge Steele--his knowledge of \nhim, and his support for him. Group after group has written on Judge \nSteele's behalf.\n  I believe this Senate will make a wise decision if Judge Steele is \nconfirmed. I have absolutely no doubt that this fine nominee will serve \nwith distinction. He will serve and treat every party before the court \nwith courtesy. He will control his court with firmness but fairness. He \nwill demonstrate integrity. And, most of all, every day that he goes to \nwork, Bill Steele will sit there and try to do what he can to produce \njustice.\n  I am delighted he has been able to move through the process. I thank \nmy colleagues in the Senate for their help. I saw Senator Leahy \nearlier. I congratulated him and thanked him for allowing this \nnomination to move forward.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his determination to move nominees, who are \nqualified, forward to confirmation.\n  As I said, I am confident in Judge Bill Steele. The courts of the \nUnited States will have a superstar who will do a superb job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3697-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3697-S3698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF J.

Mr. President, I am in strong support of Judge Daniel \nBreen to be United States District Judge for the Western District of \nTennessee.\n  For more than a decade Judge Breen has admirably served the state of \nTennessee's Western District as a United States Magistrate Judge. \nBefore assuming this position in the Jackson and Memphis area, he \npracticed law in most of the surrounding West Tennessee counties for \nsixteen years.\n  Judge Breen graduated first in his class from Spring Hill College and \nlater graduated from the University of Tennessee College of Law. His \nlist of bar-related and civic activities is long and distinguished: \nPresident of the Tennessee Bar Association, Subcommittee Chair in the \nAmerican Bar Association, Executive Committee member of the West \nTennessee Council Boy Scouts of America, and a Lifetime Board Member of \nthe West Tennessee Cerebral Palsy Center. As you can tell, his roots \nare deep with the people he serves.\n  In addition to an active civil trial docket, Judge Breen is also \nrecognized as an effective mediator, and an instructor and author on \nalternative dispute resolution. He has made a broad range of \ncontributions to the bar, as well as the State and Federal courts. This \nwork has earned him the respect of the local legal community. I have \nheard from many in the Tennessee bar praising Judge Breen's \nthoughtfulness and judicial temperament. Judge Breen is a dedicated, \nhard working and even-handed jurist.\n  Judge Breen's record has prepared him to be ready for this job \nbeginning on day one. I am honored to support his confirmation, and I \nknow he will serve the Western District of Tennessee as a U.S. District \nJudge with distinction. I thank my colleagues for voting for his \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support Judge John \nBreen, who has been nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Tennessee.\n  Judge Breen has served on both sides of the bench with distinction. \nUpon graduating from the University of Tennessee Law School in 1975, he \nentered private practice by joining the Jackson firm of Waldrop & Hall. \nHe is one of the few lawyers these days who spent his entire litigating \ncareer with a single firm. His area of expertise was general civil \nlitigation. In addition to representing insurance companies and self-\ninsured businesses, he also represented individual clients in real \nestate, commercial, corporate and estate planning matters.\n  Judge Breen has made a broad range of contributions to the bar. He \nserved as the President of the Tennessee Bar Association, which \nreflects the high esteem in which his colleagues hold him. He also \nserved on the Board of Directors for the Tennessee Bar Foundation. In \nthe course of his career, he has accepted many appointments to \nrepresent indigent criminal defendants in State and Federal court. \nJudge Breen also provided many hours of pro bono service for West \nTennessee Legal Services.\n  Since 1991, Judge Breen has served as a Federal magistrate judge, \nwhere he has handled a broad array of evidentiary hearings and issued \nmany reports and recommendations. In addition, Judge Breen is also \nrecognized as an effective mediator, as well as an instructor and \nauthor on alternative dispute resolution.\n  The American Bar Association rated Judge Breen unanimously well \nqualified, its highest rating. I am confident that he will serve on the \nbench with integrity, intelligence and fairness.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I support the nomination of John Daniel \nBreen to be a United States District Judge for the Western District of \nTennessee. I am pleased that the Senate has moved so expeditiously to \nconfirm this exceptional nominee.\n  Mr. Breen is currently a United States Judge in the Western District \nof Tennessee. Judge Breen was recommended last year by the current \nSenate Majority Leader, my colleague, Senator Frist, and former Senator \nThompson. I am pleased to add my voice in support of his nomination. As \nsomeone who, as Governor of Tennessee appointed some 50 judges, I am \nconfident that Judge Breen will continue to be an able Federal judge \nwhen he is confirmed as a United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Tennessee.\n  Judge Breen was born and raised in Jackson, TN. He was a summa cum \nlaude graduate of Spring Hill College in Mobile, AL in 1972, and was \nvaledictorian of his class. He received his Juris Doctorate from the \nUniversity of Tennessee College of Law in 1975, where he served as a \nmember of the law review.\n  After receiving his law degree, Judge Breen worked for sixteen years \nwith the law firm of Waldrop and Hall, P.A. in Jackson, TN. Judge Breen \nhas been a United States Judge for the Western District of Tennessee \nsince 1991 and has an excellent reputation in this position.\n  Judge Breen has vast litigation experience. As a practicing attorney, \nhe practiced general civil litigation primarily in the areas of tort \nlaw and workers' compensation. Judge Breen was involved in litigating \none of the premier lawsuits in Tennessee in the 1990's, which resulted \nin the adoption of comparative negligence.\n  Judge Breen has been actively involved and held leadership positions \nin local, State and national bar associations throughout his legal \ncareer. He has also been extremely active in his community by, among \nother things, providing pro bono legal services to disadvantaged \npersons and serving as a member on a variety of community \norganizations.\n  I am confident that Judge Breen will be a fine United States District \nJudge for the Western District of Tennessee, and I thank all my \ncolleagues who supported this nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3698-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3698-S3699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF MIGUEL A.

Mr. President, last Thursday, at his press conference, the \nPresident of the United States gave his reasons to justify the use of \nmilitary force to remove Saddam Hussein from power.\n  The President said again that he has not made up his mind to go to \nwar, but his own advisers are saying that even if Iraq fully complies \nwith U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441, Saddam Hussein must be \nremoved from power.\n  The President said his goal is protecting the American people from \nterrorism. That is a goal we all share. But he offered no evidence that \nIraq had anything to do with the September 11 attacks or any details of \nIraq's links to al-Qaida.\n  He offered no new information about the potential costs of a war, \neither in American and Iraqi lives, or in dollars. Both Republicans and \nDemocrats have urged the President to be more forthcoming with the \nAmerican people, to tell us what sacrifices may be involved--not to \nhave Cabinet members come to the Senate and the House, and when asked \nhow much they estimate a war and its aftermath may cost, say: We have \nno idea.\n  We know the administration has estimated the costs, yet the President \ndismissively says ``ask the spenders'' in Congress, knowing full well \nthat Congress appropriates funds, it is the President who spends them.\n  It is disingenuous, at best, to refuse to level with the American \npeople at a time of rapidly escalating deficits. We know it has already \ncost billions of dollars just to send our troops over there, but how \nmany more tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, may be added to the \ndeficit? The President is apparently ready to send hundreds of \nthousands of America's sons and daughters into battle without saying \nanything about the costs and risks.\n  The President repeatedly spoke of the danger of ``doing nothing,'' as \nif doing nothing is what those who urge patience and caution--with war \nonly as a last resort--are recommending. In fact, virtually no one is \nsaying we should do nothing about Saddam Hussein.\n  Even most of the millions of people who have joined protests and \ndemonstrations against the use of force without U.N. Security Council \nauthorization are not saying the world should ignore Saddam Hussein.\n  Yet that is the President's answer to those who oppose a preemptive \nU.S. invasion, and who, contrary to wanting to do nothing, want to give \nthe United Nations more time to try to solve this crisis without war.\n  The President also failed to address a key concern that divides \nAmericans, that divides us from many of our closest European allies, \nthat divides our allies from each other, and that divides the U.N. \nSecurity Council. That issue is not whether or not Saddam Hussein is a \ndeceptive, despicable, dangerous despot who should be disarmed. There \nis little, if any, disagreement about that.\n  Nor is it whether or not force should ever be used. Most people \naccept that the United States, like any country, has a right of self-\ndefense if it is faced with an imminent threat. If the U.N. inspectors \nfail to disarm Iraq, force may become the only option.\n\n  Most people also agree that a United States-led invasion would \nquickly overwhelm and defeat Iraq's ill-equipped, demoralized army.\n  Rather, the President said almost nothing about the concern shared by \nso many people, that by attacking Iraq to enforce Security Council \nResolution 1441 without the support of key allies on the U.N. Security \nCouncil, we risk weakening the Security Council's future effectiveness \nand our own ability to rally international support not only to prevent \nthis war and future wars, but to deal with other global threats like \nterrorism. This concern is exacerbated by the increasing resentment \nthroughout the world of the administration's domineering and simplistic \n``you are either with us or against us'' approach. It has damaged \nlongstanding relationships, relationships that have taken decades of \ntrust and diplomacy to build, both with our neighbors in this \nhemisphere and our friends across the Atlantic.\n\n[[Page S3700]]\n\n  The President says that if the Security Council does not support the \nuse of force today, it risks becoming irrelevant. The President has it \nbackward. The Security Council would not become irrelevant because it \nrefuses to obey the President of the United States. Rather, the \nSecurity Council's effectiveness is threatened if the United States \nignores the will of key allies on the Security Council regarding the \nenforcement of a Security Council resolution.\n  The President was also asked by several members of the press why \nthere is such fervent opposition to his policy among Americans and some \nof our oldest allies when only a year and a half ago, after the \nSeptember 11 attacks, the whole world was united in sympathy with the \nUnited States. He had no answer.\n  The President should heed the words of former National Security \nAdviser Brent Scowcroft, who was an architect of the 1991 Gulf War. \nGeneral Scowcroft has strongly criticized the administration's ad hoc \napproach based on a ``coalition of the willing'' which the general \ncalls ``fundamentally, fatally flawed.'' General Scowcroft said:\n\n       As we've seen in the debate about Iraq, it's already given \n     us an image of arrogance and unilateralism, and we're paying \n     a high price for that image. If we get to the point where \n     everyone secretly hopes the United States gets a black eye \n     because we're so obnoxious, then we'll be totally hamstrung \n     in the war on terror. We'll be like Gulliver with the \n     Lilliputians.\n\n  For 200 years, people around the world have looked up to the United \nStates because of our values, our integrity, our tolerance, and our \nrespect for others. These are the qualities that have set the United \nStates apart. Today, while most countries share our goal of disarming \nSaddam Hussein, we are being vilified for our arrogance, for our \ndisdain for international law, and our intolerance of opposing views.\n  A distinguished American career diplomat, John Brady Kiesling, echoed \nGeneral Scowcroft's concerns about the practical harm done to U.S. \ninterests and influence abroad. He recently wrote to Secretary of State \nColin Powell, proffering his resignation as an act of protest about the \nadministration's policy toward Iraq. I suspect Mr. Kiesling's eloquent \nand heartfelt explanation of how he reached the difficult decision to \ngive up his career expresses the feelings and concerns of some other \nAmerican diplomats who are representing the United States at our \nembassies and missions around the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Kiesling's letter to the Secretary \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. While I was disappointed by President Bush's remarks last \nweek, the Bush administration and the Pakistani Government should be \ncommended for the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, one of al-Qaida's \ntop leaders who was reportedly the mastermind of the September 11 \nattacks. Whether others within al-Qaida will quickly fill Mr. \nMohammed's shoes remains to be seen, but the fact that the U.S. \nGovernment and other governments are methodically tracking these people \ndown sends an important message and should give some comfort to the \nAmerican people. This is encouraging. Let's hope we can soon celebrate \nthe capture of Osama bin Laden, because capturing the leaders of al-\nQaida should be our highest priority.\n  But the world is increasingly apprehensive as the United States \nappears to be marching inexorably towards war with Iraq. Today, there \nare more than 250,000 American men and women in uniform in the Persian \nGulf preparing for the order to attack. We hear that the decision must \nbe made within a matter of days because it is too costly to keep so \nmany troops deployed overseas. In other words, now that we have spent \nbillions of dollars to ship all those soldiers over there, we need to \nuse them because we cannot back down now, as I have heard some people \nsay. Frankly, this is one of the worst reasons possible to rush into \nwar.\n  We should not back down. Saddam Hussein must be disarmed. Doing \nnothing--I agree with the President about this--would mean the United \nNations is unwilling to enforce its own resolutions concerning perhaps \nthe most serious threat the world faces today, the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. That would be unacceptable. The U.N. \nSecurity Council ordered Iraq to fully disclose its weapons of mass \ndestruction. Iraq has not yet done so.\n  I agree with those who say the only reason Saddam Hussein is even \ngrudgingly cooperating with the U.N. inspectors is the buildup of U.S. \ntroops on Iraq's border. I have commended the President for refocusing \nthe world's attention on Saddam Hussein's failure to disarm. I also \nrecognize the time may come when the use of force to enforce the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution is the only option. But are proposals to \ngive the U.N. inspectors more time unreasonable, when it could solidify \nsupport for the use of force if that becomes the only option?\n  Despite the President's assertion that Iraq poses an imminent threat \nto the United States, that assertion begs credulity when the U.N. \ninspectors are making some progress and a quarter of a million American \nsoldiers are poised on Iraq's border. Absent a credible, imminent \nthreat, a decision to enforce Resolution 1441 should only be made by \nthe Security Council--not by the United States or any other government \nalone.\n  The President says war is a last resort. If he feels that way, why do \nhe and his advisors want so desperately to short-circuit the inspection \nprocess?\n  Why is he so anxious to spend billions of dollars to buy the \ncooperation of other countries, other countries that do not yet believe \nwar is necessary?\n  Why is he so unconcerned about the predictably hostile reaction in \nthe Muslim world to the occupation of Iraq, perhaps for years, by the \nUnited States military?\n  Why is the President so determined to run roughshod over our \ntraditional alliances and partnerships which have served us well and \nwhose support we need both today and in the future?\n  I cannot pretend to understand the thinking of those in the \nadministration who for months or even longer have seemed possessed with \na kind of messianic zeal in favor of war. A preemptive, U.S. attack \nagainst Iraq without a declaration of war by Congress or the U.N. \nSecurity Council's support may be easy to win, but it could violate \ninternational law and cause lasting damage to our alliances and to our \nability to obtain the cooperation of other nations in meeting so many \nother global challenges.\n  Just recently, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge warned that a \nwar with Iraq could bring more threats and more terrorist attacks \nwithin the United States. The CIA Director has testified that Saddam \nHussein is more likely to use chemical or biological weapons if he is \nattacked. Yet we are marching ahead as though these warnings don't \nmatter.\n  I have said before, this war is not inevitable. I still believe it \ncan be avoided. But I fear that the President, despite opposition among \nthe American people, in the U.N., and around the world, is no longer \nlistening to anyone except those within his inner circle who are eager \nto fight.\n  The President says we must overthrow Saddam Hussein to protect the \nAmerican people. Saddam Hussein is a threat, but North Korea, on the \nverge of acquiring half a dozen nuclear weapons, poses a far more \nserious and immediate threat to the United States and the world. Yet \nthe administration is too preoccupied with Saddam Hussein to be \ndistracted by North Korea, even though North Korea has shown no qualms \nabout selling ballistic missiles and anything else that will earn them \nmoney. It makes no sense.\n  I hope the Iraqi government comes to its senses. I hope we do not \nwalk away from the U.N. I hope we don't decide that just because our \ntroops are there, we cannot afford to wait.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                February 27, 2003.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing you to submit my \n     resignation from the Foreign Service of the United States and \n     from my position as Political Counselor in U.S. Embassy \n     Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart.\n       The baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to \n     give something back to my country. Service as a U.S. diplomat \n     was a dream job. I was paid to understand foreign languages \n     and cultures, to seek out diplomats, politicians, scholars \n     and journalists, and to persuade them that U.S. interests and \n     theirs fundamentally coincided. My faith in my country and \n     its values was the most powerful weapon in my diplomatic \n     arsenal.\n       It is inevitable that during twenty years with the State \n     Department I would become\n\n[[Page S3701]]\n\n     more sophisticated and cynical about the narrow and selfish \n     bureaucratic motives that sometimes shaped our policies. \n     Human nature is what it is, and I was rewarded and promoted \n     for understanding human nature. But until this Administration \n     it had been possible to believe that by upholding the \n     policies of my president I was also upholding the interests \n     of the American people and the world. I believe it no longer.\n       The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible \n     not only with American values but also with American \n     interests. Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us \n     to squander the international legitimacy that has been \n     America's most potent weapon of both offense and defense \n     since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle \n     the largest and most effective web of international \n     relationships the world has ever known. Our current course \n     will bring instability and danger, not security.\n       The sacrifice of global interests to domestic politics and \n     to bureaucratic self-interest is nothing new, and it is \n     certainly not a uniquely American problem. Still, we have not \n     seen such systematic distortion of intelligence, such \n     systematic manipulation of American opinion, since the war in \n     Vietnam. The September 11 tragedy left us stronger than \n     before, rallying around us a vast international coalition to \n     cooperate for the first time in a systematic way against the \n     threat of terrorism. But rather than take credit for those \n     successes and build on them, this Administration has chosen \n     to make terrorism a domestic political tool, enlisting a \n     scattered and largely defeated Al Qaeda as its bureaucratic \n     ally. We spread disproportionate terror and confusion in the \n     public mind, arbitrarily linking the unrelated problems of \n     terrorism and Iraq. The result, and perhaps the motive, is to \n     justify a vast misallocation of shrinking public wealth to \n     the military and to weaken the safeguards that protect \n     American citizens from the heavy hand of government. \n     September 11 did not do as much damage to the fabric of \n     American society as we seem determined to do to ourselves. \n     Is the Russia of the late Romanovs really our model, a \n     selfish, superstitious empire thrashing toward self-\n     destruction in the name of a doomed status quo?\n       We should ask ourselves why we have failed to persuade more \n     of the world that a war with Iraq is necessary. We have over \n     the past two years done too much to asset to our world \n     partners that narrow and mercenary U.S. interests override \n     the cherished values of our partners. Even where our aims \n     were not in question, our consistency is at issue. The model \n     of Afghanistan is little comfort to allies wondering on what \n     basis we plan to rebuild the Middle East, and in whose image \n     and interests. Have we indeed become blind, as Russia is \n     blind in Chechnya, as Israel is blind in the Occupied \n     Territories, to our own advice, that overwhelming military \n     power is not the answer to terrorism? After the shambles of \n     post-war Iraq joins the shambles in Grozny and Ramallah, it \n     will be a brave foreigner who forms ranks with Micronesia to \n     follow where we lead.\n       We have a coalition still, a good one. The loyalty of many \n     of our friends is impressive, a tribute to American moral \n     capital built up over a century. But our closest allies are \n     persuaded less that was is justified than that it would be \n     perilous to allow the U.S. to drift into complete solipsism. \n     Loyalty should be reciprocal. Why does our President condone \n     the swaggering and contemptuous approach to our friends and \n     allies this Administration is fostering, including among its \n     most senior officials. Has oderint dum metuant [Ed. note: \n     Latin for ``Let them hate so long as they fear,'' thought to \n     be a favorite saying of Caligula] really become our motto?\n       I urge you to listen to America's friends around the world. \n     Even here in Greece, purported hotbed of European anti-\n     Americanism, we have more and closer friends than the \n     American newspaper reader can possibly imagine. Even when \n     they complain about American arrogance, Greeks know that the \n     world is a difficult and dangerous place, and they want a \n     strong international system, with the U.S. and EU in close \n     partnership. When our friends are afraid of us rather than \n     for us, it is time to worry. And now they are afraid. Who \n     will tell them convincingly that the United States is as it \n     was, a beacon of liberty, security and justice for the \n     planet?\n       Mr. Secretary, I have enormous respect for your character \n     and ability. You have preserved more international \n     credibility for us than our policy deserves, and salvaged \n     something positive from the excesses of an ideological and \n     self-serving Administration. But your loyalty to the \n     President goes too far. We are straining beyond its limits an \n     international system we built with such toil and treasure, a \n     web of laws, treaties, organizations and shared values that \n     sets limits on our foes far more effectively than it ever \n     constrained America's ability to defend its interests.\n       I am resigning because I have tried and failed to reconcile \n     my conscience with my ability to represent the current U.S. \n     Administration. I have confidence that our democratic process \n     if ultimately self-correcting, and hope that in a small way I \n     can contribute from outside to shaping policies that better \n     serve the security and prosperity of the American people and \n     the world we share.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3701-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3701-S3704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMERICAN VALUES AND WAR WITH IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the true greatness of America lies in \nthe values we share as a nation.\n  From America's beginning, we shared a passionate concern for the \nrights and the well-being of each individual--a concern stated \neloquently in our founding documents, the Declaration of Independence, \nthe Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  From our immigrant roots, we learned not only to tolerate others \nwhose appearance, religion, and culture are different from our own, but \nto respect and welcome them, and to recognize our diversity as a source \nof great strength.\n  From our religious faith and our sense of community, we gained an \nunderstanding of the importance of fairness and compassion for the less \nfortunate.\n  In the same way that parents try to build a better life for their \nchildren, each generation of Americans has tried to leave a more just \nsociety to the next. We all know that our history includes periods when \ngrave injustices were tolerated. Those dark periods in our national \nhistory teach us lessons we must never forget. But we have battled \nfiercely to overcome injustice, and we are a better nation for our \nwillingness to fight those battles.\n  Our most deeply held national values are rooted in our pursuit of \njustice for all. It urges us to ensure fair treatment for each person, \nto extend help to those in need, and to create opportunity for each \nindividual to advance. Those are among the most important yardsticks by \nwhich we measure our success in building ``a more perfect union.''\n  Now as we consider the prospect of war with Iraq, many of us have \nserious questions about whether current national policy reflects \nAmerica's values.\n  We owe it to the brave men and women of our armed forces to ensure \nthat we are embarked on a just war--that the sacrifice we ask of them \nis for a cause that reflects America's basic values.\n  Our men and women in uniform are working and training hard for the \nserious challenges before them. They are living in the desert, enduring \nharsh conditions, and contemplating the horrors of the approaching war.\n  Their families left behind are sacrificing, too, each and every day \nhere at home, wondering if their loved ones in uniform will return \nunharmed. Many--especially the families of our reservists--are \nstruggling to make ends meet as their spouses are called up for months \nof duty abroad. Wives are separated from husbands. Children are \nseparated from fathers and mother. Businesses and communities are \nstruggling to go forward without valued employees now serving in the \ngulf.\n  More than 150,000 National Guard and Reserve soldiers have been \nmobilized. Of these, 13,000 have been on active duty for at least a \nyear. Others return home from deployments, only to turn around and head \nback overseas for a new tour of duty. For many of these soldiers, ``the \nexpected one weekend a month, two weeks a year'' is merely a slogan, \nand does not reflect their new reality. In fact, today's reservists are \nspending thirteen times longer on active duty than they did a decade \nago.\n  A recall to active duty brings financial hardship as well. Many give \nup larger civilian salaries when they go on active duty. The law \nrequires employers to take back reservists after their deployments. But \nfor those who work in small firms or are self-employed, there are no \nsuch guarantees unless their firms are still in business.\n  The families of our men and women in uniform pay a price for this \ndeployment. During the Vietnam War, only 20 percent of all Army \nmilitary personnel were married. Today over 50 percent of the military \nare married, which means enormous strain on the families who are left \nbehind to worry and cope with the sudden new demands of running a \nhousehold alone, never knowing how long their loved ones will be away.\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\n  Among those on active duty, we are demanding more from our troops for \nlonger periods of time. One of our aircraft carriers, the USS Abraham \nLincoln, has been away from home port for 233 days. The crew expected \nto return for Christmas, and had made it half way home across the \nPacific Ocean when they were given orders to turn around and head for \nthe Persian Gulf. These men and women are forced to put their lives on \nhold, missing births, delaying weddings, and dealing with family crises \nby phone and e-mail.\n  These men and women are well-prepared to serve their country. But in \ncalling them up, we also pay the price here at home with increased \nvulnerability in our police and fire departments. A recent survey of \n8,500 fire departments by the International Association of Fire Chiefs \nshowed that nearly three-fourths of them have staff in the Reserves. A \nsimilar survey of more than 2,100 law enforcement agencies by the \nPolice Executive Research Forum found that 44 percent have lost \npersonnel to call ups.\n  These are Americans who love their country. They proudly wave the \nStars and Stripes on our national holidays. They honor and pray for \npast veterans on Memorial Day. Their children are in our schools. They \nattend our churches, our synagogues, and our mosques. We see them in \nthe grocery store or at PTA meetings. They are a part of our \ncommunities--and a part of us. And they are willing to give their lives \nfor their country. So we owe it to these men and women and their \nfamilies--these brave Americans--to get it right.\n  I am concerned that as we rush to war with Iraq, we are becoming more \ndivided at home and more isolated in the world community. Instead of \npersuading the dissenters at home and abroad, the Administration by its \nharsh rhetoric is driving the wedge deeper. Never before, even in the \nVietnam war, has America taken such bold military action with so little \ninternational support. It is far from clear that the United Nations \nSecurity Council will pass any new resolution that we can use as \nauthorization for military action in Iraq. Even some strategically \nimportant allies, such as Turkey, who were expected to be with us, have \nbacked away. The administration continues to turn a deaf ear to all of \nthese voices, and single-mindedly pursues its course to war.\n  Within the rising chorus of dissent have been the voices of much of \nthe organized religious community in this country--Christian, Jewish \nand Muslim. Within the Christian community, opposition to war against \nIraq includes the Roman Catholic Church, to which I belong, and many \nmainline Protestant and Orthodox churches. These are not pacifist \ngroups who oppose war under all circumstances. They are religious \nleaders who say the moral case has not been made for this war at this \ntime.\n  War is not just another means to achieving our goals. More than any \nother option, it is dangerous, it is deadly, it is irreversible. That \nis why, whenever we resort to force in the world, there is an urgent \nneed to ensure that we remain true to our values as Americans.\n  Saddam Hussein is one of the most brutal tyrants on the world stage \ntoday. He has murdered thousands of his own people--many with chemical \nand biological weapons. He has attempted to wipe out entire \ncommunities. He has attacked neighboring countries. He supports \nterrorism against innocent civilians throughout the Middle East. \nUndeniably, the world would be a better place without Saddam Hussein. \nThat fact, however, should not be the end of the inquiry, but only the \nbeginning.\n  From the perspective of our shared values, the fundamental question \nis whether this is a ``just war.'' That is not an easy question to \nanswer, because some elements of a just war are clearly present.\n  There are six principles that guide the determination of ``just \nwar.'' They were first developed by St. Augustine in the Fifth Century \nand expanded upon by St. Thomas Aquinas in the Thirteenth Century. To \nbe just a war must have a just cause, confronting a danger that is \nbeyond question; it must be declared by a legitimate authority acting \non behalf of the people; it must be driven by the right intention, not \nulterior, self-interested motives; it must be a last resort; it must be \nproportional, so that the harm inflicted does not outweigh the good \nachieved; and it must have a reasonable chance of success.\n  These are sound criteria by which to judge our impending war in Iraq.\n  First, does Iraq pose a danger to us that is beyond question?\n  Clearly, Iraq does pose a considerable danger, principally because of \nSaddam Hussein's biological and chemical weapons and his history of \nattempts to develop nuclear weapons. But it is not at all clear that \nthe only way to protect ourselves from that threat is war. In fact, \nmany of us are deeply concerned that initiating a war to remove Saddam \nHussein will actually increase the danger to the American people.\n  The biological and chemical weapons Saddam has are not new. He has \npossessed them for more than a decade. He did not use them against us \nin the gulf war and he did not use them against us in the years since \nthen, because he understands that any use of them would lead to his \ncertain destruction. As CIA Director George Tenet stated last year in \ntestimony before Congress, the greatest danger of their use occurs if \nSaddam knows he is about to be removed from power and therefore \nperceives he has nothing left to lose.\n  Iraq, to the best of our knowledge, has no nuclear weapon. If nuclear \nweapons in the hands of a rogue state are our principal concern, then \ncertainly North Korea poses a much more imminent threat. And Iran--not \nIraq--is close behind.\n  The President must explain why war with Iraq will not distract us \nfrom the more immediate and graver danger posed by North Korea. \nSomething is wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue if we rush to war with a \ncountry that poses no nuclear threat, but will not even talk to a \ncountry that brandishes its nuclear power right now. Any nuclear threat \nfrom Iraq, we are told, is probably 5 years into the future. But the \nthreat from North Korea exists today.\n  Desperate and strapped for cash, North Korea is the greatest current \nnuclear danger to the United States, and it is clearly taking advantage \nof the situation in Iraq. It is the country most likely to sell nuclear \nmaterial to terrorists. It may well have a long-range missile that can \nstrike our soil.\n  War with Iraq will clearly undermine our ability to deal with this \nrapidly escalating danger. But our options are not limited to invading \nIraq or ignoring Iraq. No responsible person suggests that we ignore \nthe Iraqi threat.\n  The presence of U.N. inspectors on the ground in Iraq, coupled with \nour own significant surveillance capacity, make it extremely unlikely \nthat Iraq can pursue any substantial weapons development program \nwithout detection. If we can effectively immobilize Saddam's activity, \nthe danger his regime poses can be minimized without war.\n  Above all, we cannot allow differences over Iraq to shatter the very \ncoalition we depend upon in order to effectively combat the far greater \nand more imminent threat posed by the al-Qaida terrorists. Close \ninternational cooperation is what led to the recent arrest in Pakistan \nof the planner of the 9/11 attack.\n  Second, has the war been declared by a legitimate authority acting on \nbehalf of the people?\n  When Congress voted last October, most Members believed that the use \nof force by America would have United Nations backing. Such backing is \nnow highly unlikely. Last October, no international inspectors had been \nin Iraq for 5 years. Now, U.N. inspectors are on the ground engaged in \ndisarming Saddam.\n  No war by America can be successfully waged if it lacks the strong \nsupport of our people. And America remains divided on an invasion of \nIraq without United Nations approval. The reason for that lack of \nsupport today is clear. The administration has not made a convincing \ncase that war is necessary, nor have they credibly answered crucial \nquestions about the cost of the war in lives and dollars, how long \nAmerican troops will remain in Iraq, and what type of Iraqi government \nwill replace Saddam.\n  In his address last week on a post-war Iraq, President Bush failed to \ngive adequate answers to the key questions on the minds of the American \npeople about the war and its aftermath. He painted a simplistic picture \nof the\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\nbrightest possible future--with democracy flourishing in Iraq, peace \nemerging among all nations in the Middle East, and the terrorists with \nno base of support there. In a dangerous world, the fundamental \ndecision on war or peace cannot be made on rosy and unrealistic \nscenarios.\n  Third, any war must be driven by the right intention.\n  I do not question the President's motive in pursuing this policy, but \nI seriously question his judgment.\n  The Bush administration was wrong to allow the anti-Iraq zealots in \nits ranks to exploit the 9/11 tragedy by using it to make war against \nIraq a higher priority than the war against terrorism.\n  Al-Qaida--not Iraq--is the most imminent threat to our national \nsecurity. Our citizens are asked to protect themselves from al-Qaida \nwith plastic sheeting and duct tape, while the administration prepares \nto send our armed forces to war against Iraq. Those priorities are \nwrong.\n  In a desperate effort to justify its focus on Iraq, the \nadministration has long asserted that there are ties between Osama and \nSaddam--a theory with no proof that is widely doubted by intelligence \nexperts. Two weeks after 9/11, Secretary Rumsfeld claimed that we had \n``bulletproof'' evidence of the link. But a year later, CIA Director \nTenet conceded in a letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee that \nthe Administration's understanding of the link was still ``evolving'' \nand was based on ``sources of varying reliability.'' In fact, the link \nis so widely doubted that intelligence experts have expressed their \nconcern that intelligence is being politicized to support the rush to \nwar.\n  Fourth, war must always be a last resort.\n  That is why all options must be pursued. Inspections still have a \nchance to work in Iraq. Progress is difficult. No one said it would be \neasy. But as long as inspectors are on the ground and making progress, \nwe must give peace a chance.\n  But before resorting to war, it is extremely important to reach \nagreement that there is no alternative. Nations that have been among \nour closest allies oppose us now because they do not believe that the \nalternatives to war have been exhausted. Many of them believe that an \ninvasion of Iraq could destabilize the entire Middle East.\n  Many of them believe that instead of subduing terrorism, war with \nIraq will increase support and sympathy in the Islamic world for \nterrorism against the West. We cannot cavalierly dismiss these concerns \nof our allies.\n  War with Iraq runs the very serious risk of inflaming the Middle East \nand provoking a massive new wave of anti-Americanism that may well \nstrengthen the terrorists, especially if we act without the support of \nthe world community.\n  A year ago, The Wall Street Journal quoted a dissident in Saudi \nArabia who has turned his focus from his own government to the U.S. \nGovernment. He said: [The main enemy of the Muslims and the Arabs is \nAmerica--and we don't want it to impose things on us. We would rather \ntolerate dictatorship in our countries than import reforms from \nAmerica.]\n  The war against al-Qaida is far from over, and the war against Iraq \nmay make it worse.\n  After 9/11 we witnessed an unprecedented rallying of the world \ncommunity to our side. That international unity was our strongest \nweapon against terrorism. It denied terrorists sanctuary, it led to a \nvital sharing of intelligence, and it helped to cut off the flow of \nfinancial resources to al-Qaida. We cannot allow that international \ncooperation to shatter over our differences on Iraq. We cannot be a \nbully in the world school yard and still expect friendship and support \nfrom the rest of the world.\n  Fifth, any war must be proportional, so that the harm inflicted does \nnot outweigh the good achieved.\n  If there is a war, we all pray that it will be brief, and that \ncasualties will be few. But there is no assurance of that. Certainly, \nwe have the military power to occupy Iraq. But that may only be the \nbeginning. Our troops may be confronted by urban guerilla warfare from \nforces still loyal to Saddam or simply anti-Western. The war may be far \nmore brutal than we anticipate.\n  In such a conflict, innocent civilian casualties could also be high. \nWe cannot let Saddam hide behind innocent human shields if there is a \nwar. But that large risk makes it all the more imperative for war to be \nonly a last resort.\n  We have been told that an attack on Iraq will begin with an enormous \ncruise missile assault to destroy their infrastructure, strike fear and \nawe in the hearts of the enemy, and undermine their will to resist. We \nknow that thousands of cruise missiles will be fired in the first 48 \nhours of the war, more than were launched in the entire 40 days of the \ngulf war. Such a massive assault will unavoidably produce a very \nsubstantial number of civilian casualties. That harsh reality adds \ngreatly to the burden that must be overcome by those who argue that war \nis the proper response now. It is a burden they have not met.\n  One of the highest and worst costs of war may be the humanitarian \ncosts. Sixty percent of Iraq's people rely on the United Nations' Oil-\nfor-Food Program for their daily survival. Food is distributed through \n46,000 government distributors supplied by a network of food storage \nbarns. A war with Iraq will disrupt this network. Many Iraqis, \nespecially poor families, have no other source of food. Women and \nchildren will be the most vulnerable victims. According to recent \nreports, 500,000 Iraqi children already suffer from malnutrition.\n  And what are the costs to America? We all know there is an increased \nrisk of another domestic terrorist attack. The war will make it a more \ndangerous time on the American homefront.\n  There will also be a very substantial financial cost to the war The \nshort-term cost is likely to exceed $100 billion. The long-term cost, \ndepending on how long our troops must remain in Iraq, will be far more. \nIf our national security were at stake, we would spare no expense to \nprotect American lives. But the administration owes the nation a more \nhonest discussion about the war costs we are about to face, especially \nif America has to remain in Iraq for many years, with little support \nfrom other nations.\n  The sixth element of a just war is that it must have a reasonable \nchance of success.\n  I have no doubt that we will prevail on the battlefield but what of \nthe consequences for our own national security and the peace and \nsecurity of the Middle East?\n  We know that a stable government will be essential in a post-war \nIraq. But the administration refuses to discuss in any real detail how \nit will be achieved and how long our troops will need to stay. \nPresident Bush assumes everything will go perfectly. But war and it's \nconsequences hold enormous risks and uncertainties.\n  As retired General Anthony Zinni has asked, will we do what we did in \nAfghanistan in the 1970s--drive the old Soviet Union out and let \nsomething arguably worse emerge in it's place?\n  The vast majority of the Iraqi people may well want the end of \nSaddam's rule, but they may not welcome the United States to create a \ngovernment in our own image. Regardless of their own internal \ndisagreements, the Iraqi people still feel a strong sense of national \nidentity, and could quickly reject an American occupation force that \ntramples on local cultures.\n  We must recognize that from the day we occupy Iraq, we shoulder the \nresponsibility to protect and care for its citizens. We are accountable \nunder the Geneva Conventions for public safety in neighborhoods, for \nschools, and for meeting the basic necessities of life for 23 million \nIraqi civilians.\n  This daunting challenge has received very little attention from the \nadministration. As the dust settles, the repressed tribal and religious \ndifferenced of the past may come to the fore--as they did in the brutal \ncivil wars in the former Yugoslavia, in Rwanda, and other countries. As \nour troops bypass Basra and other Iraqi cities on their way to Baghdad, \nhow will we prevent the revenge bloodletting that occurred after the \nlast Gulf War, in which thousands of civilians lost their lives?\n  What do we do if Kurds in northern Iraq proclaim an independent \nKurdistan? Or the Shia in southern Iraq move toward an alliance with \nIran, from which they have long drawn their inspiration?\n\n[[Page S3704]]\n\n  We have told the government of Turkey that we will not support an \nindependent Kurdistan, despite the fact that the Kurdish people in Iraq \nalready have a high degree of US-supported autonomy and have even \ncompleted work on their own constitution. Do we send in our troops \nagain to keep Iraq united?\n  Post-War Afghanistan is not exactly the best precedent for building \ndemocracy in Iraq. Sixteen months after the fall of the Taliban \ngovernment in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai is still referred to \nas ``the Mayor of Kabul''--because of the weak and fragile hold of his \ngovernment on the rest of the nation. Warlords are in control of much \nof the countryside. The Afghan-Pakistani border is an area of anarchy--\nand ominous al-Qaida cells.\n  The U.S. military is far from equipped to handle the challenge of \nmeeting the needs of a post-Saddam Iraq. Our government must have a \nplan in place to care for the population. Yet we have heard little from \nthe administration on how they intend to meet this obligation. To \nsucceed in winning the peace, we will need the help and support of the \ninternational community. That is afar less likely to happen if we do \nnot have the international community with us the start.\n  Before the President makes the final fateful decision to go to war in \nIraq, his administration must answer each of these just war questions \nmuch more convincingly than they have so far. The American people are \nwaiting for the answers. The entire world is waiting for the answers.\n  We are no at a major cross-road in our history. The 9/11 attrocities \nhas forced us all to think profoundly about what is great in America. \nAll through our shock and grief, the people's courage never failed. 9/\n11 was one of the Nation's saddest hours, but the response was one of \nour finest hours.\n  That hour must not be lost. It can mark the beginning of a new era of \ncommon purpose--a return to policies which truly reflect America's \nvalues, a return to the genuine pursuit of justice. The unselfishness \nwe saw in 2001 must not give way to selfishness in 2003. The noble \ncaring for one another that we celebrated then must not be succeeded \nnow by a retreat from our ideals.\n  Yes, our country is strong but it can be stronger--not just in the \npower we hold, but in the promise we fulfill of a nation that truly \ndoes make better the life of the world. If we rededicate ourselves to \nthat great goal, our achievements will reverberate around the globe, \nand America will be admired anew for what it must be now, in this new \ntime, more than ever--``the last, best hope of earth.''\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to the excellent \nwork of our intelligence services in capturing Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. \nThis is a major triumph in the war on terror. Our officers from the \nCentral Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \nNational Security Agency, and their counterparts in the Pakistani and \nintelligence services are to be highly commended.\n  Let there be no doubt, capturing Mohammed is a big deal. He has a \nlong and bloody history. He has been implicated in the 1993 bombing of \nthe Twin Towers. He played a major role in plans to hijack airliners in \nAsia and crash them into the sea. He may well have been a leader in the \nattack on the USS Cole, an attack that killed 17 United States sailors \nand wounded 39 others. He has been implicated in the attacks on the \nUnited States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which killed hundreds and \nwounded thousands. And he planned the attacks of September 11.\n  It is not just attacks against Americans. He is now wanted by our \nfriends, the Australians, for questioning in connection with the recent \nbombings in Bali which killed hundreds of those citizens. There has \neven been a warrant issued by our reluctant allies in France for his \nrole in the bombing of a synagogue that killed a French citizen.\n  Those are the horrible acts of his past that we know about. By \ncapturing Mohammed, what devastating plots have our intelligence \nservices prevented? Hopefully, as they start to learn more from \nMohammed, they will also be able to thwart future attacks.\n  Another possibility is that those who would engage in such acts will \nrealize their secrets may now be compromised and, hopefully, they will \nabandon their plans.\n  Not only did we get Mohammed, their operations planner, we also got \nHawsawi, their chief financier. The 9/11 terrorists sent their left-\nover money to Hawsawi. By taking him out of the al-Qaida operations, we \nhave damaged their ability to move money into terrorists' hands. This \nshould hamper their ability to launch any currently planned operations.\n  I want to thank our intelligence services for the work they do. Yes, \nthere have been mistakes in the past, and there will be human failures \nin the future. But when we learn of their victories, they should be \nthanked. That thanks comes with the knowledge that there must be many \nmore instances where we have been protected and there was no public \nacclaim for these servants of the public. Frankly, without the \npublicity surrounding this case, we might never have known all the \nagencies that contributed to the captures.\n  The Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation do not watch after us alone. We should be thankful for \nthe hard work of the men and women of the Defense Intelligence Agency, \nthe National Security Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office. \nThey and others are working around the clock to defend us in the war on \nterror.\n  It is not just our intelligence agencies that should be thanked. It \nwas our friends in Pakistan who discovered Mohammed, who arrested him, \nwho turned him over. President Musharraf has continued his strong \nsupport for the war on terror, and we must continue to work with allies \nsuch as Pakistan to eradicate terrorism.\n  Yes, this is a great win in the war on terror, but it was not a \nvictory. We may never actually realize when we have achieved victory; \nfor the men and women who make our intelligence system work will have \nto continue their vigilance, that quiet and all too often unheralded \nvigilance.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold her suggestion of \nthe absence of a quorum?\n  Mrs. DOLE. I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, there is an interesting turn of events. \nThose who were looking for a debate on the war in Iraq had best turn to \nC-SPAN and witness the question period in London before the British \nHouse of Commons. I have been watching it. It is a fascinating debate.\n  Tony Blair is defending his position in support of the United States. \nHis own party is divided. The conservatives support him. The \nquestioning is very tough. In the course of defending his position, \nsome important questions are being asked and answered in the British \nHouse of Commons.\n  If you would expect the same thing here in the U.S. Congress, you \nmight be surprised or disappointed to learn it is not taking place. \nWhat is taking place is speeches on the floor by individual Senators. \nToday, I have seen Senator Byrd of West Virginia, Senator Dayton of \nMinnesota, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts. Others have come to the \nfloor to speak about the war in Iraq. But there has literally been no \nactive debate on this issue on Capitol Hill, in the United States of \nAmerica, since last October.\n  The reason, of course, is that last October we enacted a use of force \nresolution which virtually gave to the President of the United States \nthe authority\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\nto declare war and execute it against Iraq at the time and place of his \nchoosing. I was one of 23 Senators who voted against that resolution, \nbelieving that there were better ways to achieve our goals, and that if \nCongress did that, we would be giving to this President the greatest \ndelegation of authority to wage war ever given to a President.\n  The time that has intervened since the passage of that resolution has \nproven me right. Congress has had no voice. Oh, we have had moments of \ncriticism, moments of comment, but we are not a serious part of this \nnational concern and national conversation over what will happen in \nIraq. That is indeed unfortunate.\n  There are several facts I think everyone concedes, virtually \neveryone, on either side of the issue. The first and most obvious is \nthat Saddam Hussein is a ruthless dictator. His continued domination \nover the nation of Iraq will continue to pose a threat to the region \nand a concern for peace-loving nations around the world. The sooner his \nregime changes, the better. The sooner we control his weapons of mass \ndestruction, the better for the region and for the whole world. No one \nargues that point, not even the nations in the U.N. Security Council \nthat are arguing with the United States about the best approach.\n  The second thing I think should be said at the outset is no one \nquestions the fact that the U.S. military, the men and women who make \nit the best military in the world, deserve our support and our praise. \nThey deserve our continued devotion to their success, whatever our \ndebate about the policy in the Middle East or even in Iraq. As far as \nthose 250,000 American servicemen now stationed around Iraq, and many \nothers on the way, whatever our position on the President's policy, \nthat is irrelevant. We are totally committed to their safety and their \nsafe return. That is exactly the way it should be.\n  Having said that, though, I think it is still important for us to \nstep back and ask how we have possibly reached this state that we are \nin today. The United States finds itself in a period of anti-\nAmericanism around the world that is almost unprecedented. I traveled \nabroad a few weeks ago. I was stunned to find in countries that have \ntraditionally been our friends and allies that, although they are \nsaying little, in private they are very critical of the United States \nand what we have done.\n  What happened between September 11, 2001, and March 13, 2003? \nRemember that date, after the September 11 tragedy, when nations all \naround the world, including some of our historic enemies, came forward \nand said they would stand with the United States in fighting the war on \nterrorism? It was an amazing moment in history. It is a moment we will \nnever forget as Americans.\n  For the first time since the British came into this building in the \nWar of 1812, the United States was invaded by an enemy. Of course, \nPearl Harbor was an attack on the territories as well, but that attack \non the continental United States on September 11, 2001, was one that \nstunned us, saddened us, shocked us as a nation, and we looked for \nfriends and we found them in every corner of the world. They joined us \nin a war on terrorism, sharing intelligence resources, working \ntogether, making real progress. It was a good feeling, a feeling that \nmany of these countries now understood how important a friendship with \nthe United States would be for their future and for the world.\n  Look where we are today. We are at a point now where we are trying to \nwin enough friends to show that we have a multilateral coalition that \nis going to wage this war against Iraq.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that \nwas published in Business Week. The edition was March 10, 2003.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Business Week, Mar. 10, 2003]\n\n                            Dollar Diplomacy\n\n       Money, it is often said, is the mother's milk of politics. \n     It's also turning out to be the nectar of superpower \n     diplomacy.\n       As George W. Bush approaches the diplomatic climax of his \n     arduous drive to win backing for war with Iraq, U.S. \n     diplomats increasingly find themselves tempted to brandish \n     Uncle Sam's checkbook--and with it, the suggestion that \n     sticking with America now might mean rewards later. Much of \n     this bid to win friends is playing out in the U.N. Security \n     Council, which is grappling with a U.S.-backed resolution \n     that could trigger military action against Saddam Hussein. \n     But in broader terms, pressure on the White House to dangle \n     inducements transcends the U.N. debate and goes to the heart \n     of Washington's current dilemma--America's poverty of \n     friendship.\n       For two years, Administration diplomacy has been marked by \n     a brash Texas swagger that Bush partisans consider a \n     refreshing exercise in plain-speaking--and which some \n     traditional allies consider arrogance. But the differences go \n     beyond style. In walking away from global treaties and \n     disdaining the views of traditional allies, Bush foreign \n     policy has also been marked by an in-your-face unilateralism \n     that has set much of the world on edge.\n       Now, with the Administration struggling to round up allies \n     and hosting the leaders of such nations as Latvia and \n     Bulgaria to demonstrate the depth of its coalition, the price \n     of that disdain is coming into focus. ``We've made it harder \n     than it had to be by taking a high-handed approach,'' says \n     Samuel R. Berger, National Security Adviser during the \n     Clinton Administration.\n       Indeed, the bill for the Administration's approach is just \n     starting to come due--and the bottom line is breathtaking. On \n     Feb. 25, Bush aides revealed that the cost of a military \n     campaign could top $95 billion. That's a far cry from what \n     happened during the first Gulf War, when coalition \n     partners paid some $70 billion of the $75 billion war tab. \n     ``Rebuilding Iraq will require a sustained commitment from \n     many nations including our own.'' Bush said in speech to \n     the American Enterprise Institute on Feb. 26. But the fact \n     is, the U.S. will likely find itself shouldering \n     peacekeeping duties and much of Iraq reconstruction on its \n     own--meaning beleaguered American taxpayers may bear the \n     brunt of the costs.\n       True, a broad coalition never in the cards. Unlike \n     Operation Desert Storm, which was a response to Iraq's \n     invasion of Kuwait, this showdown looms as a exercise in \n     preemptive action. Still, while Bush talks of a ``coalition \n     of the willing'' backing a U.S. invasion of Iraq, in reality \n     the America finds itself with precious few allies as the hour \n     of decision approaches. And buying allegiances one country at \n     a time is a far cry from building a cohesive group committed \n     to a common cause.\n       Another consequence of the Bush Administration's Iraq \n     policy is that it could unintentionally undermine the \n     President's broader goal of implanting the seeds of reform in \n     the region. If the intervention comes to be seen by Iraq's \n     neighbors as illegitimate, the result could be more \n     radicalism, not less. The Administration's lofty goals in the \n     Mideast could be much harder to achieve if ``Americans are \n     seen less as a partner than as a foreign power,'' says Jon B. \n     Alterman, who recently left the Bush State Department.\n       In a sense, the current bargaining round was heralded by \n     the September 11 terror strike on America. In the subsequent \n     war on the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the White House \n     decided it had to shore up friendship and showered largesse \n     on new allies ranging from Tajikistan to impoverished African \n     nations. None fared better than Pakistan, a desperately poor \n     country that was pivotal in the anti-terror war. President \n     Pervez Musharraf's regime suddenly found itself freed of \n     sanctions imposed for its nuclear testing and the beneficiary \n     of a $12.5 billion debt restructuring from the U.S. and other \n     nations. That helped lift Pakistan from a debtor nation to \n     one that now runs a modest current-account surplus.\n       Now, the Bush team faces a far more formidable chore in \n     mustering global support for disarming Iraq by force. With \n     skepticism rampant, France and a big bloc of nations fear the \n     consequences of the U.S. making preemptive attacks an \n     acceptable policy tool. Just as important, they fear that the \n     risks of a destabilized Mideast far outweigh the danger \n     Saddam poses. And in the region, where Saddam has been \n     weakened and contained since the 1991 war, resistance to a \n     U.S. invasion has led some countries to limit the American \n     military's rights to nearby bases.\n       With allies scarce, small wonder that the Bushies may be \n     tempted to float aid promises--or be hit with a raft of \n     ``impact payment'' requests from countries such as Egypt, \n     Israel, Turkey, and Jordan, who claim their economies will be \n     damaged by the fallout of any conflict. ``When somebody knows \n     they're necessary for your game plan, they raise the price,'' \n     says former top State Dept. official Chester A. Crocker.\n       The Bush Administration stoutly denies it's buying U.N. \n     support or military access. ``The President is not offering \n     quid pro quos,'' insists White House Press Secretary Ari \n     Fleischer. In fairness, the practice of cementing an entente \n     with aid is hardly limited to the Bushies. The Clintonites, \n     who currently assail Bush's need to reach for his wallet, \n     threw billions at North Korea to keep its nuclear program \n     shuttered. They also were forced to shrug when U.S. \n     contributions to the International Monetary Fund were \n     squandered by Russian kleptocrats. ``Checkbook diplomacy,'' \n     says former State Dept. official Helmut Sonnenfeldt, ``is as \n     old as checkbooks.''\n       The most naked example of haggling came in the U.S.-Turkey \n     base talks. With Turkish public opinion strongly antiwar and \n     an economy on the ropes, the Turks sought upwards of $35 \n     billion in U.S. assistance for the right\n\n[[Page S3706]]\n\n     to station American troops on Turkish soil for use in a \n     pincer move against Saddam. After bitter negotiations, Ankara \n     came away with a package that includes up to $20 billion in \n     cash and loans, some NATO military gear, and assurances that \n     Iraq's Kurdish nationalists will be kept in check. Says \n     Mehmet Simsek, A London-based analyst with Merrill Lynch & \n     Co.: ``The bottom line is, it will give Turkey some breathing \n     room.''\n       One reason the talks were so tough is Turkey's history with \n     Desert Storm. After that war, the U.S. backed out of promises \n     to compensate the country for the loss of trade with Iraq and \n     aid to refugees. Now the Turks want money up front.\n       Jordan may actually be the hardest hit of Iraq's neighbors \n     this time, so Washington is also receptive to Amman's calls \n     for help. ``Nearly a quarter of our GDP could be knocked out \n     as a result [of a new war],'' frets Fahed Fanek, a Jordanian \n     economist. The Administration is expected to ask Congress for \n     $150 million in aid on top of the $300 million a year Jordan \n     now receives. The U.S. already has started to deliver on a \n     deal for F-16 fighters and Patriot II missiles, likely at a \n     discount.\n       Other neighbors have their hands out, too. Israel wants $4 \n     billion in additional military aid and $8 billion in loan \n     guarantees. Egypt, which sees war losses of $1.6 billion to \n     its tourist-dependent economy, wants faster delivery of as \n     much as $415 million earmarked for Cairo.\n       Much of the dickering has been more subtle. Key swing votes \n     on the Security Council--Chile, Guinea, Cameroon, Angola, \n     Mexico, and Pakistan--have growing trade ties with the U.S. \n     that could be jeopardized by a vote against the U.S. \n     resolution. Both France and the U.S. are vying for those \n     votes, the U.S. by noting that the America drive to ease \n     agriculture subsidies among rich nations could open markets \n     to Third World farmers.\n       What will be most telling is how Pakistan votes. After all, \n     U.S.-backed debt restructuring allowed the country to adopt \n     reforms that have helped revive the economy. And President \n     Musharraf left Washington in late 2001 with a 15% increase in \n     clothing and textile exports to the U.S., worth $500 million \n     to Pakistani manufacturers. But Pakistani officials insist \n     money won't sway their vote. ``This is a matter of much \n     greater importance than just a question of incentives,'' says \n     Munir Akram, Pakistan's U.N. ambassador.\n       It's still far from clear whether dollar diplomacy will \n     give Uncle Sam a clearcut victory in the U.N. But even \n     without an affirmative vote, Bush seems intent on going ahead \n     with plans to attack Saddam by late March. Then the questions \n     become: What kind of alliance will Bush be heading, and how \n     durable will such a coalition of convenience be?\n       If all goes swimmingly on the battle-field, some of today's \n     qualms will surely fade--replaced by radiant TV images of \n     liberated Iraqis and new-wave technocrats who vow to build a \n     new nation. But if the intervention turns into the oft-\n     predicted miasma of Middle Eastern intrigue and dashed hopes, \n     America could find itself standing far more alone than it is \n     today. Fast friends may be hard to come by in the self-\n     centered world of diplomacy. Still, the kind you make because \n     of truly shared interests seem preferable to the kind you \n     rent.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me quote several lines from this article in Business \nWeek, not known as a liberal publication:\n\n       But in broader terms, pressure on the White House to dangle \n     inducements transcends the U.N. debate and goes to the heart \n     of Washington's current dilemma--America's poverty of \n     friendship.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       And buying allegiances one country at a time is a far cry \n     from building a cohesive group committed to a common cause. \n     Another consequence of the Bush Administration's Iraq Policy \n     is that it could unintentionally undermine the President's \n     broader goal of implanting the seeds of reform in the region. \n     If the intervention comes to be seen by Iraq's neighbors as \n     illegitimate, the result could be more radicalism, not less.\n       The Administration's lofty goals in the Mideast could be \n     much harder to achieve if ``Americans are seen less as a \n     partner than as a foreign power,'' says Jon B. Alterman, who \n     recently left the Bush State Dept.\n\n  What a dramatic turn of events, and from the spirit of international \ncooperation, fighting the war on terrorism, for the United States to be \nin a bidding war to try to bring the Turks into the position where they \nwill allow us to use their country, it is just such a change from where \nwe were. It reflects a sad decline in our diplomatic skills.\n  Consider at the same time what is happening in North Korea. Here we \nhave a country which has decided to test the United States. Why they \nhave decided is anyone's guess. But let me hazard one. They see what is \nhappening in Iraq. Iraq is waiting for the United Nations and others to \nprotect them from a United States invasion, and they are not being \nsuccessful. North Koreans decided to take a much different course. They \nare confronting the United States in the crudest and most dangerous \nway--suggesting that they are going to build nuclear weapons; they are \ngoing to fire missiles; they are going to harass our aircraft; and they \nare going to defy us. They believe that is the way to hold the United \nStates back. The process they are building up could potentially \nproliferate nuclear weapons around the world.\n  Our response there, unlike with Iraq where we are full bore with a \nquarter million troops and billions of dollars committed, is to not \neven speak to the North Koreans. I don't understand that level of \ndiplomacy. I don't understand how that will make this a safer world.\n  Let us reflect for a moment, though, on what is happening in the \nUnited Nations. I have read the critics from the right who basically \nsaid we should go right over the United Nations; we no longer need \nthem; we have the power; we don't need to wait around for small nations \nwith populations that are a fraction of the United States to decide \nwhether they will support us. In a way, in the world of realpolitik, \nthat is true. But the United States, in informing the United Nations, \nhad something else in mind. It is not just a matter of whether we have \nthe power and a show of more strength than the United Nations as a \nmember but whether the United States is stronger with collective \nsecurity engaging other countries around the world to join us in \nefforts such as containing Iraq and its danger.\n  I happen to believe that collective security is not old fashioned and \noutmoded. It is critically important for us to consider building \nalliances to achieve important goals for the United States and the \nworld because in building those alliances through the collective \nsecurity of the United Nations, we bring together common values, a \nconsensus on strategy, and a world vision that will serve all of us \nwell.\n  To walk away from the United Nations and say, once having engaged \nthem in a resolution, that we may not be able to pass a use-of-force \nresolution and that we will do it ourselves is to walk away from an \nimportant concept which has been fostered by the United States and \nsupported by the United States and which has been critically important \nto us as recently as our effort in the Persian Gulf and in Afghanistan.\n  But, by tomorrow, the decision may be made. If the United Nations \nSecurity Council does not support us, it is indeed possible that we \nwill have unilateral action by the United States, with the possible \nsupport of the British.\n  I asked the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Rumsfeld, several weeks \nago: Who are our allies in this coalition against Iraq? He said: \nCertainly the United States with about 250,000 troops, and the British \nwith about 26,000 troops, and others. I said: Of the others, who would \nrank third? At that point, he said: The Turks.\n\n  We know what is happening. Their Parliament will not allow us to use \ntheir country as a base of operation. That may change. But it shows, \nwhen it comes to this effort, that it is by and large a bilateral \neffort by the United States and the British against the Iraqis. I think \nthat is not the best approach. I think it is far better for us to \nacknowledge what I think is the real effective approach, and that is to \nengage our allies in the United Nations and in the Security Council to \nput meaningful deadlines on Saddam Hussein; for the inspectors to reach \ntheir goals; to let Saddam Hussein know that every step of the way, his \nfailure to cooperate could result in the United Nations taking action \nagainst him. That does not call for an invasion, but it puts him on a \ntight timetable that he has to live by.\n  To abandon the inspections, to abandon the role of the United \nNations, and to launch a unilateral invasion of this country is going \nto be something that I think we may regret. Will we be successful \nmilitarily? I believe we will. I can't tell you the cost in terms of \nAmerican lives or in terms of Iraqis killed. But I trust our military \nto succeed in this mission.\n  Having succeeded militarily, though, what will we then face? We will \nface, of course, the devastation in Iraq.\n  This week, we learned that the United States was now soliciting bids \nfrom companies in the United States for the reconstruction of Iraq \nbefore\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\nthe bombs have even fallen. That could be momentous in terms of cost. \nWe will face it.\n  As Tom Friedman of the New York Times has written, when we go into a \ngift shop and see the sign, ``If you break it, you own it,'' the fact \nis when we invade Iraq and remove its leadership and occupy that \ncountry, it is then our responsibility. Others may help us, but it is \nprimarily our responsibility.\n  The same thing is true in terms of the long-term vision of Iraq. This \nis a country with no history of self-government, this is a country with \nno history of democracy, and we want to bring certain values there. We \nhave to concede the fact that it will take some time before they arrive \nat that point. We will be there in an occupational way with others \nperhaps, but we will have the responsibility of making that \ntransformation a permanent or semipermanent presence of American troops \nin the Middle East and all that that entails.\n  At the same time, it is bound to enrage our enemies around the \nworld--those who think the United States is acting unilaterally and not \nacting in concert with other nations, peace-loving nations that would \nshare our ultimate goals. That, too, may complicate the war on \nterrorism. That has been conceded by intelligence agencies and others. \nOur efforts in Iraq may spread the seeds of terrorism on new ground, \nand maybe even here in the United States. We will have to work that \nmuch harder to protect ourselves.\n  I want to enter into the Record a letter sent to Secretary of State \nColin Powell from John Brady Kiesling, who is with the United States \nEmbassy in Athens, Greece.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Colin Powell,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing you to submit my \n     resignation from the Foreign Service of the United States and \n     from my position as Political Counselor in U.S. Embassy \n     Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart. The \n     baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to give \n     something back to my country. Service as a U.S. diplomat was \n     a dream job. I was paid to understand foreign languages and \n     cultures, to seek out diplomats, politicians, scholars and \n     journalists, and to persuade them that U.S. interests and \n     theirs fundamentally coincided. My faith in my country and \n     its values was the most powerful weapon in my diplomatic \n     arsenal.\n       It is inevitable that during twenty years with the State \n     Department I would become more sophisticated and cynical \n     about the narrow and selfish bureaucratic motives that \n     sometimes shaped our policies. Human nature is what it is, \n     and I was rewarded and promoted for understanding human \n     nature. But until this Administration it had been possible to \n     believe that by upholding the policies of my president I was \n     also upholding the interests of the American people and the \n     world. I believe it no longer.\n       The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible \n     not only with American values but also with American \n     interests. Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us \n     to squander the international legitimacy that has been \n     America's most potent weapon of both offense and defense \n     since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle \n     the largest and most effective web of international \n     relationships the world has ever known. Our current course \n     will being instability and danger, not security.\n       The sacrifice of global interests to domestic politics and \n     to bureaucratic self-interest is nothing new, and it is \n     certainly not a uniquely American problem. Still, we have not \n     seen such systematic distortion of intelligence, such \n     systematic manipulation of American opinion, since the war in \n     Vietnam. The September 11 tragedy left us stronger than \n     before, rallying around us a vast international coalition to \n     cooperate for the first time in a systematic way against the \n     threat of terrorism. But rather than take credit for those \n     successes and build on them, this Administration has \n     chosen to make terrorism a domestic political tool, \n     enlisting a scattered and largely defeated al Qaeda as its \n     bureaucratic ally. We spread disproportionate terror and \n     confusion in the public mind, arbitrarily linking the \n     unrelated problems of terrorism and Iraq. The result, and \n     perhaps the motive, is to justify a vast misallocation of \n     shrinking public wealth to the military and to weaken the \n     safeguards that protect American citizens from the heavy \n     hand of government. September 11 did not do as much damage \n     to the fabric of American society as we seem determined to \n     do to ourselves. Is the Russia of the late Romanovs really \n     our model, a selfish, superstitious empire thrashing \n     toward self-destruction in the name of a doomed status \n     quo?\n       We should ask ourselves why we have failed to persuade more \n     of the world that a war with Iraq is necessary. We have over \n     the past two years done too much to assert to our world \n     partners that narrow and mercenary U.S. interests override \n     the cherished values of our partners. Even where our aims \n     were not in question, our consistency is at issue. The model \n     of Afghanistan is little comfort to allies wondering on what \n     basis we plan to rebuild the Middle East, and in whose image \n     and interests. Have we indeed become blind, as Russia is \n     blind in Chechnya, as Israel is blind in the Occupied \n     Territories, to our own advice, that overwhelming military \n     power is not the answer to terrorism? After the shambles of \n     post-war Iraq joins the shambles in Grozny and Ramallah, it \n     will be a brave foreigner who forms ranks with Micronesia to \n     follow where we lead.\n       We have a coalition still, a good one. The loyalty of many \n     of our friends is impressive, a tribute to American moral \n     capital built up over a century. But our closest allies are \n     persuaded less that war is justified than that it would be \n     perilous to allow the U.S. to drift into complete solipsism. \n     Loyalty should be reciprocal. Why does our President condone \n     the swaggering and contemptuous approach to our friends and \n     allies this Administration is fostering, including among its \n     most senior officials. Has ``oderint dum metuant'' really \n     become our motto?\n       I urge you to listen to America's friends around the world. \n     Even here in Greece, purported hotbed of European anti-\n     Americanism, we have more and closer friends than the \n     American newspaper reader can possibly imagine. Even when \n     they complain about American arrogance, Greeks know that the \n     world is a difficult and dangerous place, and they want a \n     strong international system, with the U.S. and EU in close \n     partnership. When our friends are afraid of us rather than \n     for us, it is time to worry. And now they are afraid. Who \n     will tell them convincingly that the United States is as it \n     was, a beacon of liberty, security, and justice for the \n     planet?\n       Mr. Secretary, I have enormous respect for your character \n     and ability. You have preserved more international \n     credibility for us than our policy deserves, and salvaged \n     something positive from the excesses of an ideological and \n     self-serving Administration. But your loyalty to the \n     President goes too far. We are straining beyond its limits an \n     international system we built with such toil and treasure, a \n     web of laws, treaties, organizations, and shared values that \n     sets limits on our foes far more effectively than it ever \n     constrained America's ability to defend its interests.\n       I am resigning because I have tried and failed to reconcile \n     my conscience with my ability to represent the current U.S. \n     Administration. I have confidence that our democratic process \n     is ultimately self-correcting, and hope that in a small way I \n     can contribute from outside to shaping policies that better \n     serve the security and prosperity of the American people and \n     the world we share.\n       Sincerely,\n                                              John Brady Kiesling,\n                                              U.S. Embassy Athens.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this letter is a letter of resignation. \nMr. Kiesling, a career diplomat who has served in United States \nembassies around the world, resigned over our foreign policy in Iraq. I \nwill not read the entire letter. But this I will read. It is the letter \nfrom Mr. Kiesling to Secretary Powell:\n\n       The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible \n     not only with American values but also with American \n     interests. Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us \n     to squander the international legitimacy that has been \n     America's most potent weapon of both offense and defense \n     since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle \n     the largest and most effective web of international \n     relationships the world has ever known. Our current course \n     will bring instability and danger, not security.\n\n  Those are the words of a man who was a career diplomat serving the \nUnited States with principle and convictions and who resigned from the \ndiplomatic corps over our policy in Iraq. That is a sad commentary, but \nit is a reality.\n  The reality is that we are following a course of foreign policy that \nis a dramatic departure from what we have followed for almost 50 years. \nWe are making decisions relative to this war in Iraq which are changing \nthe rules the United States has not only lived by but preached for \ndecades. We are confronting the world that has most recently been our \nallies in the war on terrorism and telling them that, with or without \ntheir cooperation and approval, we are going forward with an invasion \nof Iraq. We are saying to the rest of the world that the United States \nhas the power and will to use it. It is certain that we have the power \nand the strength. The question is whether or not we have the wisdom--\nthe wisdom to understand that simply having the strength is not enough.\n  I would like to quote a few words from a statement made on this floor \non October 3 last year by a man who used\n\n[[Page S3708]]\n\nto sit directly behind me here, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. I miss him \nevery single day. I pulled out the statement he made relative to this \nuse of force resolution. I can recall now when he said some of these \nwords.\n  I quote from Senator Wellstone:\n\n       To act now on our own might be a sign of more power. Acting \n     sensibly and in a measured way in concert with our allies \n     with bipartisan congressional support would be a sign of our \n     strength.\n\n  It is still true today. It is true so many months later.\n  I think the President and this administration still have a chance to \ntake what could be a course of action that departs from a tradition in \nvalues which we have stood by and preached for so many decades, and \nreturn to those values in our efforts in Iraq.\n  And I hope we do it. I hope we do not discard the United Nations and \nall of our allies who are part of it. I hope we understand that when \nsome of our best friends around the world question whether we are \napproaching this sensibly, it does not demonstrate their weakness but \nreally calls into question whether we have the humility to step back \nand say: Can we do this more effectively for a more peaceful world for \ngenerations to come?\n  Madam President, I close by saying, I return now, in just a few \nmoments, to my home State of Illinois. As I walk the streets of \nSpringfield, of Chicago, and of other cities, people come up to me and \nsay: Why don't I hear a debate in the U.S. Congress about Iraq?\n  Well, the fact is, that debate was waged and decided last October. I \nwas one of 23 Members who voted against the use of force resolution \nbecause I believe there is a better way: a collective approach with the \nUnited Nations, that makes certain that the United States has a \ncoalition of nations behind it in suppressing the evil of Saddam \nHussein and his dangers to the region, rather than a coalition of \nnations united against us. That, sadly, is what we face today.\n  The vote in the United Nations tomorrow is historic. I hope we have \nthe support of that institution. I hope, if we do not, this \nadministration will pause before unleashing the furies of war and \nconsider whether there is a better, more measured and sensible approach \nto show not only our might but our strength and clarity of purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3708-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3708-S3710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my colleague from Illinois has been \ntalking about foreign policy and, more specifically, about Iraq and the \nuse of force. He touched on the issue of North Korea and terrorism.\n  We do need to have more debate, aggressive and thoughtful debate, \nabout all of these issues. There is no question that North Korea, in my \njudgment, and in the judgment of many in this country, is an urgent, \nserious threat to our country. They kicked out the inspectors. And they \ndo have nuclear weapons, at least according to our intelligence \nofficials. They believe North Korea does have nuclear weapons.\n  The threat of terrorism continues in this country. Homeland security \nis a top priority. And all of these issues are very important. But I \nwant to speak about an issue here at home; that is, domestic policy, \nespecially this country's economy.\n  We wake up every morning--for months in this country--hearing the \nlead story on the news being war with Iraq. It is the lead story every \nmorning, bar none. It is an important story, no question about that. \nBut there are a lot of folks who wake up in this country these days who \nare out of jobs. Some 8 million people--perhaps more than that, we are \ntold--do not have work.\n  Madam President, 308,000 additional people lost their jobs last month \nalone--308,000 people. Do you know who loses their jobs first? Oh, it \nis not Members of Congress and it is not people who drive big cars. It \nis the people who know the definition of ``secondhand,'' ``second \nshift,'' ``second jobs.'' It is the people who struggle at the bottom \nof the economic ladder. They are the last to be hired and the first to \ngo.\n\n  This economy of ours is in trouble. It is time to stop tiptoeing \naround and pretending about it. We have two Budget Committees meeting \nnow in this Congress. We have a budget submitted by this President that \nis completely, in my judgment, irresponsible. That is not a partisan \ncriticism, it is just a criticism of a budget that completely ignores \nwhat is happening in this country. It is a budget that pretends \neverything is just fine and all we need to do is keep doing what we \nhave been doing and this country will see its economy come out of the \ndoldrums. That is patently untrue, in my judgment. It is time for us to \nsay that.\n  Let me talk a bit about this plan and about where we are. There is \nnot a Democrat or Republican way to fix what is wrong with this ship of \nstate with respect to its economy. But there are right ways and wrong \nways to do it. And I know that the moment we dare criticize the \nadministration, we have all of these strident voices from the extreme \nof the political system who say: Well, how dare you criticize the \nadministration or the President.\n  Look, I think both parties have done plenty wrong in this country's \npast. But we face an intersection now that is unlike any intersection \nAmerica has come to in a long time. This intersection is one where we \nconfront both serious, urgent foreign policy problems--Iraq, North \nKorea, terrorism, and more--and, at the same time, confront very \nserious problems here at home--an economy that is languishing, without \ngrowth, an economy that, last month, saw 308,000 people lose their \njobs.\n  Now just think of one of those. I am not asking you to think about \n1,000, 10,000, 100,000 or 300,000--just one, who comes home and says to \nhis or her family: Something happened at work today. I lost my job. It \nwasn't my fault. I have done the best I could. I am a good worker, but \nI have lost my job because the economy is not working well. It's soft.\n  So what happens here in Washington, DC? Well, we act as if none of \nthis is going on. This is a cheering section, to say: Well, things are \ngoing to be better. This is not a problem. What are you complaining \nabout?\n  Let me talk, just a little, about where we are with this economy of \nours.\n  We have a $10 trillion economy in this country. This is the biggest, \nthe best economy in the world. None of us would want to live elsewhere. \nWe are lucky to be Americans, lucky to be Americans alive now. But our \nresponsibility, as Americans, is to nurture, protect, and foster the \ndevelopment of this great country of ours, and that means protecting \nthis economic engine that produces the jobs and the opportunities for \nthe American people.\n  Now, in May of 2001, we had an economy that economists told us would \nproduce budget surpluses at the Federal level as far as the eye could \nsee. They said: I tell you, we're walking in tall clover here. There \nare going to be budget surpluses for 10 years, so you all ought to get \nabout the business of providing big, big tax cuts.\n  President Bush came to town and said: My heavy lifting is to ask the \nAmerican people to accept big tax cuts. That is the easiest lift in \nAmerican politics, I guarantee you. I would like to see one politician \nwho works up a sweat asking people to accept tax cuts.\n  So the President said: $1.7 trillion in tax cuts; that's my plan. I \nstood at this desk then, and I said: I think we ought be a little \nconservative. What if something happens? What if we are giving away \nmoney we don't get? What if we don't have these surpluses? What if \nsomething that we can't predict at this point occurs and these \nsurpluses don't exist? What you are going to do is run into big \ndeficits and have our children shoulder the consequences of this \nmistake.\n\n  Well, I lost that debate. And so a $1.7 trillion tax cut proposed by \nthe President was pushed through this Congress. And guess what. In a \nmatter of months--just a matter of months--we discovered our economy \nwas in a recession. Months after that, September 11, the most \ndevastating terrorist attack against this country in its history; \nmonths after that, a series of corporate scandals unlike any we have \never seen in this country; during all of that time, the bursting of the \ntechnology bubble and the collapsing and pancaking of the stock market; \nand during all of that time, the prosecution of a war against \nterrorism.\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\n  You think about that, all of those consequences--a recession, the \nbursting of the technology bubble, the pancaking of the stock market, \ncorporate scandals, a war against terrorism. All of that combined to \ncreate a dramatic difference in this economy. We have far less revenue \ncoming in. And the result is, big deficits.\n  Here is what we found:\n  In May of 2001, Mr. Daniels, the head of OMB, said: We are going to \nhave a $5.6 trillion surplus. We had better get about the business of \nhaving big tax cuts, he and the President said.\n  Well, in 2 years, we went from a $5.6 trillion estimated surplus to a \n$2.1 trillion deficit. That is nearly an $8 trillion change in the \neconomic fortunes of this country. And yet we have people acting as if \nit is not happening. None of this is happening, according to them.\n  What is the antidote to this? What do we do? Well, let's ratchet up \nsome more tax cuts. Short of money? Well, then, reduce your revenue \nstream. So the President proposes more large tax cuts.\n  I suppose if you don't care about fiscal responsibility, about budget \ndeficits, then you can do that. But the fact is, we have seen this \ncalculation before. I come from a high school of nine. We didn't have \nhigher math, but there is only one way to add one and one that equals \ntwo. That is the math book I studied.\n  The fact is, this administration's budget does not add up. They say \nincrease defense spending, increase homeland security spending, have \nless revenue, and have a few budget cuts in domestic discretionary \nprograms, and it will all add up. It doesn't add up. They want to \npretend that it adds up. The American people know it doesn't add up.\n  On the domestic discretionary piece, they say let's increase these \ntwo big areas of spending: Defense, homeland security. Let's cut taxes. \nAnd incidentally, let's cut taxes on average for someone with $1 \nmillion a year in income, let's cut their taxes on average nearly \n$90,000 a year. We can afford that, they say. But, they say, what we \nwill do is take it out of domestic discretionary spending, nondefense. \nWhat does that mean? That means what we will do is cut back on title I \nspending. That is what they talked about in one of the budget \nresolutions today.\n  I toured a school about 2 weeks ago. At the library there was a third \ngrader, a young boy, great-looking young kid, looking at a book and \npictures. I met him and said hi to him. I came up behind him and tapped \nhim on the shoulder. The principal of the school, after we got out of \nearshot of the young boy, said: Do you know something about that boy? \nYou can't tell it right now, but that young boy almost died. He was \nsubject to the most severe abuse I have ever seen in a family. He was \nbeaten badly, taken away from his mother because of the beatings. You \nknow he is doing very well now. This little kid has kind of gotten \nthrough all of this. He is doing well. This kid is part of the program \nfor the school, the title I funds for disadvantaged kids. That is the \nkind of investment we make in these kids. And this little boy needed \nsome of that investment. That is what we do with title I, with Head \nStart. We give these tiny kids who don't have it so good an opportunity \nto get a head start in education.\n  With Pell grants, kids who couldn't go to college get an opportunity \nto go to college. I had a young Native American stand up in a meeting \nonce and say: Mr. Senator, I am an American Indian. I am the first in \nmy family ever to go to college. I am able to be here because I have \nPell grants, because we don't have any money. I will graduate from this \ncollege, and I will go back to teach school on the Indian reservation \nwhich I came from.\n  He did. That is the value of investing in some of these programs such \nas education programs for some of these kids. We can just talk about it \nas if it is some amorphous program that does not mean anything with no \nnames attached, but that is not the case. All of these investments in \nthe lives of young children make a difference. So when we talk about \nfiscal policy and plans and budgets, it is just too easy for some \npeople who don't understand that there is a constituency out there. \nThey don't have lobbyists in the hallway. There are no 5-year-olds or \n6-year-olds or 3-year-olds waiting as we leave the Chamber to say: \nPlease, Mr. Senator, will you help us. They don't have the voices here.\n  The fact is, just taking one example of what we do that makes a \ndifference in people's lives, in education of children, especially \nchildren who haven't had it so good, we have people who just blithely \nwalk around here these days and say: This is not a difficult \ncircumstance to get out of. Give the wealthy some very big tax cuts, \nspend $675 billion that we don't have, charge it to the kids, cut back \non education programs, and cut back on many of the other programs that \nhelp people who don't have it so good and call it a day. Have a good \nnight's sleep.\n\n  Those who can sleep with those priorities, in my judgment, have a \nmisplaced priority of public service. The priority in this country \nought to be, first of all, to have a fiscal plan that adds up so this \ncountry's economy has a chance to grow and provide opportunities and \njobs for people.\n  There is no social program we work on that is as important for \nworking people as a good job that pays well. So making this economy \nwork, giving it the opportunity to work, having it add up so people \nhave confidence in the future is critically important. And then at the \nsame time preserving the opportunity for some very important things, \nwhether it is helping family farmers during a disaster, helping young \nkids get a chance to start in school through the Head Start program--\nall of those are so important.\n  We are doing a shadow dance in this Chamber. Everybody here knows \nthis nonsense does not add up, and no one is willing to say it because \nthe minute you say it, people start screaming that you are somehow \ndisloyal to this administration.\n  I want this administration to succeed. I want this President to \nsucceed. I want him to succeed so this country does well. I want our \neconomy to grow. I want our foreign policy challenges with Iraq and \nNorth Korea and others to work out in the right way. I don't come here \nwanting us to fail. But if we don't stand up and point out the obvious, \nthat we are headed down a path toward deeper and deeper Federal budget \ndeficits with which we will saddle our children, if we don't change \ncourse, this country is not going to grow and will not provide \nopportunities.\n  I suppose there will be many who will continue this shadow dance that \ngoes on to pretend everything is just fine, but we know better than \nthat. If we were headed towards these deficits with the previous \nadministration, I guarantee you there would be 20 people in this \nChamber every night putting blue smoke out the Chamber; they would be \nso upset about it. But somehow in the shadow of 9/11, we have moved to \na circumstance where the most irresponsible fiscal policy I have ever \nseen proposed is judged to be a yawn by this Chamber.\n  We have the two Budget Committees meeting, and they are saying: We \ncan fit all this in. We can fit in big tax cuts. In fact, now they \nsay--those so-called conservatives--deficits don't even matter. It is \nnot a big thing to be worried about.\n  I don't understand what has happened with respect to the relative \npositions of politicians these days. Conservatives say deficits don't \nmatter? That is a different kind of conservative than I am familiar \nwith. Deficits, of course, matter. Someone has to repay them.\n  I don't mean to belabor this point, but on top of this fiscal policy \nthat has us now headed towards the largest deficits in the history of \nour country, take Social Security out of the calculation, and you \nshould. The Social Security surpluses should not be used to reduce the \nbudget deficit. They are trust funds. The President proposes taking all \nthe trust fund and using it, but they ought not. So if you take that \nout, you have a budget deficit this year of nearly $450 billion. But \nadd to that a trade deficit of over $460 billion this year alone--the \nhighest in human history. This economy is off course. We need to fix \nit.\n  We need to stand up for the economic interests of America in trade \nand begin reducing that trade deficit, because we have to pay that with \na lower standard of living in our future. That is not an option. That \ntrade deficit is owed to other countries. You can make an argument as \nan economist that the budget deficit we owe to ourselves. Nonetheless, \nwe will still have to bear that\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\nburden. But our children will likely bear the burden of a 10-year \ndeficit that is put on their shoulders by a fiscal policy that is \nirresponsible.\n  We will have a budget debate next week. I will offer amendments. My \ncolleagues will offer amendments. I don't have any interest in deciding \nthat Republicans have the wrong answer and Democrats have the right \nanswer. There are good answers that come from all parts of the Chamber. \nBut the construct of this fiscal policy is just fundamentally wrong and \neverybody in this Chamber who knows how to add and subtract ought to \nknow that. It is time for us to start speaking about it.\n  I am perfectly interested in providing tax cuts to the American \npeople when we have budget surpluses. But the tax cuts should be to \nworking families and should be distributed fairly. But at a time when \nwe have the highest deficits, to say let's ignore them and let's have a \npolitical construct that increases spending in the largest areas of \nspending in the Federal budget and decreases taxes with very large tax \ncuts and then pulls the rest out of it out of some very important \nthings that invest in people in this country, including veterans and \nIndian health and education, and a whole series of things, that is \nwrong.\n  We need to stand up and talk about it. I will speak about it at \ngreater length next week. I wish I could come to the floor and say this \nis a wonderful fiscal policy. I just cannot. I feel obligated to say \nthis is wrong; we are headed in the wrong direction. We need to fix it \nas a country. Our children's future depends on it.\n  I will make one final point. On September 11, when this country was \nattacked, we were one country. I was proud of President Bush, and one \nof the best speeches I ever heard he gave to a joint session of \nCongress. This country responded as one. But this country does not do a \nservice to its future by believing now--a year and a half following \nthat period of time--that voices still, because they don't want to \nengage in debate over issues that are important to our future, are \nsomehow disadvantageous to our country. We need a robust debate about \nthe right fiscal policy. We disserve our constituencies if we don't \nbring this debate to the floor in an aggressive way. What works? What \nwill restore economic health to the country? What do we do to improve \neconomic growth, to provide jobs, to get people back to work, and get \nthe economy moving again? Those are the questions we have to ask as we \nconstruct a budget and put this fiscal policy together.\n  I regret I come to say this fiscal policy makes no sense at all and \nmust be changed. I wish that were not the case, but it is. The result \nof that is I will be here with amendments, as will others, hoping we \ncan improve this fiscal policy for our country's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am glad to see an Alaskan in the \nchair as I make this statement. This morning, as it usually happens, \nwhen I turned on my computer, I found a series of e-mails from friends \nat home. I do not always have time to read them then, but I saw one \nfrom a very close friend, who has been a friend now for over 50 years--\nFrank Reed, a former neighbor, a person who has helped me in many ways \nin my life. He asked me to read this article he attached to his e-mail. \nI get a little disturbed when I see that the testament is a little \nlonger than the e-mail. But I found that he had sent me a verbatim \ntranscript of an article by Alistair Cooke entitled ``Peace For Our \nTime,'' that was on the BBC News on Monday, February 3 of this year. I \nwant to read that tonight because I think it reflects what I have been \ntrying to say on the floor of the Senate these past several weeks.\n  The following was written and spoken by Alistair Cooke. He said this:\n\n       . . . I promised to lay off topic A--Iraq--until the \n     Security Council makes a judgment on the inspectors' report \n     and I shall keep that promise.\n       But I must tell you that throughout the past fortnight I've \n     listened to everybody involved in or looking on to a \n     monotonous din of words, like a tide crashing and receding on \n     a beach--making a great noise and saying the same thing over \n     and over. And this ordeal triggered a nightmare--a day-mare, \n     if you like.\n       Through the ceaseless tide I heard a voice, a very English \n     voice of an old man--Prime Minister Chamberlain saying: ``I \n     believe it is peace for our time''--a sentence that prompted \n     a huge cheer, first from a listening street crowd and then \n     from the House of Commons and next day from every newspaper \n     in the land.\n       There was a move to urge that Mr. Chamberlain should \n     receive the Nobel Peace Prize. In Parliament there was one \n     unfamiliar old grumbler to growl out: ``I believe we have \n     suffered a total and unmitigated defeat.'' He was, in view of \n     the general sentiment, very properly booed down.\n       This scene concluded in the autumn of 1938 with the British \n     prime minister's effectual signing away of most of \n     Czechoslovakia to Hitler. The rest of it, within months, \n     Hitler walked in and conquered. ``Oh dear,'' said Mr. \n     Chamberlain, thunderstruck. ``He has betrayed my trust.''\n       During the last fortnight a simple but startling thought \n     occurred to me--every single official, diplomat, president, \n     prime minister involved in the Iraq debate was in 1938 a \n     toddler, most of them unborn. So the dreadful scene I've just \n     drawn will not have been remembered by most listeners.\n       Hitler had started betraying our trust not 12 years but \n     only two years before, when he broke the First World War \n     peace treaty by occupying the demilitarized zone of the \n     Rhineland. Only half his troops carried one reload of \n     ammunition because Hitler knew that French morale was too low \n     to confront any war just then and 10 million of 11 million \n     British voters had signed a so-called peace ballot.\n       It stated no conditions, elaborated no terms, it simply \n     counted the numbers of Britons who were ``for peace.''\n       The slogan of this movement was ``Against war and \n     fascism''--chanted at the time by every Labour man and \n     Liberal and many moderate Conservatives--a slogan that now \n     sounds as imbecilic as ``against hospitals and disease.'' In \n     blunter words a majority of Britons would do anything, \n     absolutely anything, to get rid of Hitler except fight him.\n       At that time the word pre-emptive had not been invented, \n     though today it's a catchword. After all the Rhineland was \n     what it said it was--part of Germany. So to march in and \n     throw Hitler out would have been pre-emptive--wouldn't it?\n       Nobody did anything and Hitler looked forward with \n     confidence to gobbling up the rest of Western Europe country \n     by country--``course by course'', as growler Churchill put \n     it.\n       I bring up Munich and the mid-30s because I was fully \n     grown, on the verge of 30, and knew we were indeed living in \n     the age of anxiety. And so many of the arguments mounted \n     against each other today, in the last fortnight, are exactly \n     what we heard in the House of Commons debates and read in the \n     French press.\n       The French especially urged, after every Hitler invasion, \n     ``negotiation, negotiation''. They negotiated so successfully \n     as to have their whole country defeated and occupied. But as \n     one famous French leftist said:\n       ``We did anyway manage to make them declare Paris an open \n     city--no bombs on us!''\n       In Britain the general response to every Hitler advance was \n     disarmament and collective security. Collective security \n     meant to leave every crisis to the League of Nations. it \n     would put down aggressors, even though, like the United \n     Nations, it had no army, navy or air force.\n       The League of Nations had its chance to prove itself when \n     Mussolini invaded and conquered Ethiopia (Abyssinia). The \n     League didn't have any shot to fire. But still the cry was \n     chanted in the House of Commons--the League and collective \n     security is the only true guarantee of peace.\n       But after the Rhineland the maverick Churchill decided \n     there was no collectivity in collective security and started \n     a highly unpopular campaign for rearmament by Britain, \n     warning against the general belief that Hitler had already \n     built an enormous mechanized army and superior air force.\n       But he's not used them, he's not used them--people \n     protested.\n       Still for two years before the outbreak of the Second War \n     you could read the debates in the House of Commons and now \n     shiver at the famous Labour men--Major Attlee was one of \n     them--who voted against rearmament and still went on pointing \n     to the League of Nations as the savior.\n       Now, this memory of mine may be totally irrelevant to the \n     present crisis. It haunts me. I have to say I have written \n     elsewhere with much conviction that most historical analogies \n     are false because, however strikingly similar a new situation \n     may be to an old one, there's usually one element that is \n     different and it turns out to be the crucial one. It may well \n     be so here.\n       All I know is that all the voices of the 30s are echoing \n     through 2003 . . .\n\n  Madam President, I was but 14, not 30. I remember the tension we all \nfelt at that time, as country after country became destroyed by Hitler. \nPreviously on the floor of the Senate, I mentioned Hitler and compared \nSaddam Hussein to Hitler. I was criticized even by the papers at home \nin Alaska.\n  I was delighted to read Alistair Cooke's article that Frank Reed sent \nto me this morning, and I commend it to the rest of the Senate.\n  This haunts me. It haunts those of us who lived through the thirties \nto know\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\nwe might go through the thirties again because too many people refuse \nto listen to the truth, refuse to listen to what some of us see in \nSaddam Hussein, as being another Hitler.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the introduction of S. 628 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3711-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3711-S3713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING GENERAL AL LENHARDT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, a little over 18 months ago, I came to \nthis floor to welcome MG Alfonso Lenhardt to the Senate on his first \nday as this body's Sergeant at Arms.\n  Tomorrow will be GEN Lenhardt's last day in the Senate.\n  It is with profound admiration, and more than a little sadness, that \nI rise today to thank him for his extraordinary service, and to wish \nhim much success and happiness in the years ahead.\n  Nominating Al Lenhardt to serve as the Senate's Sergeant at Arms was \none of the great honors of my time as majority leader. It was also, I \nthink, one of the best decisions I made in more than 30 years of public \nservice.\n  I did not know Al before we began the search for a Sergeant at Arms \nin the summer of 2001. He was recommended to me by our former Secretary \nof the Senate, Jeri Thomson.\n  Jeri had met Al more than a decade ago when they were both at the \nKennedy School of Government at Harvard. She was impressed by his \nintelligence, knowledge, steady demeanor and commitment to public \nservice, characteristics she correctly noted are highly desirable in a \nSenate Sergeant at Arms.\n  Twenty minutes after meeting Al, I knew Jeri had identified the right \nperson for this job.\n  I also knew, when I nominated Al, that he would make history in this \nSenate. What I did not realize is what a crucial role he would play, \nand what a difference he would make, in the history of this Senate.\n  Al Lenhardt is the first African American ever to serve as the \nSenate's top law enforcement and administrative officer. In fact, he is \nthe first African American to serve as an elected officer of the Senate \nor House--ever.\n  That seems hard to believe, but it is true. And after 212 years, I \nmust say, it was long overdue.\n  And he was the individual serving as the top law enforcement officer \nof the Senate when the unimaginable happened--terrorists struck a \ndevastating blow on American soil.\n  The September 11 attacks occurred less than a week after Al Lenhardt \nwas sworn in as Sergeant at Arms. I do not think he took a day off for \nover 5 months.\n  Five weeks after September 11, a letter containing a lethal dose of \nanthrax was opened in my office.\n  That incident remains the largest bioterrorism attack ever on U.S. \nsoil, and one of the most dangerous events in Congress' history.\n  Al Lenhardt's leadership ability, experience and demeanor were \ninstrumental in the Senate's entry into the post-September 11 world. I \nam not sure that before that terrible day any of us fully appreciated \nthe threat that America's enemies posed to our U.S. Capitol, a majestic \nand enduring symbol of our democracy.\n  Al Lenhardt rose to the challenge of protecting against further \nterrorist attacks on the Capitol complex and protecting the people who \nwork in and visit these buildings--without closing ``The People's \nHouse'' to the people themselves.\n  Al provided calm and steady leadership in the face of danger that \nreassured us all in an extraordinarily stressful and emotional time.\n  When deadly anthrax was released in the Hart Building, 50 Senators \nand their staffs, and 15 committees and their staffs, were displaced \nfor 96 days while the building was remediated.\n  Never before--not even when the British burned the Capitol in 1814, \nhad so may Senators been uprooted.\n  Relocating them and their staffs presented an unprecedented \nlogistical challenge. But Al Lenhardt and his staff, and the staffs of \nthe Rules Committee and the Secretary of the Senate, responded quickly \nand well. The business of democracy never stopped.\n  Al Lenhardt stood tall in the face of danger. And his steady hand \nassured that the Senate kept functioning.\n  Over the past 18 months, Al Lenhardt rose to the occasion, \ndemonstrating to me that he was indeed the right man, with the right \nskills and experience, in the right place, at the right time.\n  Al Lenhardt has had a remarkable public career.\n  He served in the United States Army for 32 years and as a combat \nveteran wears the Purple Heart earned in Vietnam.\n  He retired from the Army in 1997.\n  His last Army position was commanding general of the U.S. Army \nRecruiting Command at Ft. Knox, KY. From that post, he managed more \nthan 13,000 people in 1,800 separate locations.\n  Before that, he served as the senior military police officer for all \npolice operations and security matters throughout the Army's worldwide \nsphere of influence.\n  In the 1980s, he did counter-terrorism work in Germany against the \nBaader-Meinhof Gang and other terrorist groups.\n  He also was the former commander of the Army's Chemical and Military \nPolice Centers at Fort McClellan, AL, which trains the military police \nwho are guarding our bases overseas.\n  Al Lenhardt was born in Harlem 59 years ago.\n  He earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from the University \nof Nebraska, a master of arts degree in public administration from \nCentral Michigan University, and a masters of science degree in the \nadministration of justice from Wichita State University. He has also \ncompleted post-graduate studies at the Kennedy School of Government at \nHarvard, and the University of Michigan Executive Business School.\n  Between the Army and the Senate, he served for 4 years as executive \nvice president and chief operating officer of the Council on \nFoundations, where he worked to harness the power of philanthropy to \nmeet some of America's most urgent unmet needs.\n  He has been active in an array of organizations, from the Boy Scouts \nof America, to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Washington, DC, the National \nOffice of Philanthropy, and the Black Church Project.\n  He has been married for 38 years to Jackie Lenhardt, one of the few \npeople I have ever met who has a more commanding presence than Al. \nJackie and Al have three daughters--two lawyers and a doctor--and two \ngrandchildren, Olly, who is 4, and Maya, who was born 2 months ago.\n  The closest thing to a complaint I've ever heard from anyone who knew \nAl Lenhardt in the Army was from an officer who took a battalion six \nyears after Al had left it.\n  He said: ``It's tough to go into a unit after Al Lenhardt because he \nleaves such strong footprints. Six years later, his policies and \nprocedures still stood. He made a lasting impact on soldiers.''\n  The one consolation in saying goodbye to Al Lenhardt is knowing that \nthe policies and procedures he instituted here in the Senate will \ncontinue protecting us in the future.\n  Al's predecessor, Jim Ziglar, began the effort to modernize security \nand protect the Capitol in an age of terrorism. And he made a good \nstart.\n  But I think even Jim would acknowledge that it is Al Lenhardt who \ndeserves the lion's share of the credit for leading the Senate into the \nmodern age of security and law enforcement.\n  If Congress is ever forced to vacate this building, or even this \ncity, for any length of time, the Senate will be able to move and \nresume the work of democracy immediately in a new location under a \n``continuity of operations'' plan that Jim Ziglar started and Jeri \nThomson and Al Lenhardt completed.\n  While Al would be the first to state that more needs to be done, he \nhas ensured that the Senate will continue operations in the event of \nany emergency.\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\n  The physical security around the Capitol is much stronger and \nintelligence gathering, analysis and sharing is much better today than \nit was on September 11th--largely because of Al Lenhardt.\n  We are better prepared to prevent attacks--and to respond if attacks \nhappen--than we were before Al Lenhardt came here.\n  Because of Al Lenhardt, we know have an effective crisis \ncommunications network that uses state-of-the-art technology.\n  We have emergency evacuation plans and drills.\n  We've implemented state-of-the-art mail security to prevent another \nnightmare like the anthrax attack.\n  Capitol Police officers are getting new training to deal with the new \nthreats. We are also expanding the police force--so our officers can \nget some much-deserved rest.\n  Al Lenhardt has played a leadership role in building stronger working \nrelationships with security and intelligence experts at the departments \nof Homeland Security, Justice, Defense and other agencies.\n  That is another way Al Lenhardt made history.\n  The first Saturday morning after the anthrax letter was opened, Al \nwas at work in the Capitol, surrounded by scientists and investigators. \nHe had been at work until late the night before.\n  That morning, someone asked him: ``If you had to decide all over \nagain, would you still want this job?''\n  Al smiled his great, broad smile and--without a moment's hesitation--\nreplied: ``Absolutely. To be in a position to serve your country--what \nbetter job could there be?''\n  To that, Mr. President, I can only add: What better person could \nthere have been in the Senate Sergeant at Arms' position these last 18 \nmonths than General Alfonso Lenhardt?\n  Certainly no one I have ever met.\n  Al Lenhardt has earned the respect and gratitude of every member of \nthis Senate, and of this nation.\n  I am proud to have recommended him. I am proud to have served with \nhim. And I am even more proud to call him my friend.\n  Indeed the entire Senate community is grateful to Al Lenhardt for \nwhat he has contributed to us, and we will miss him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the majority leader leaves the floor, I ask to be \nassociated with the remarks he made about General Lenhardt. I add that \nin the years Senator Daschle has been the Democratic leader--he is \nstarting his eighth year--he has done a lot of very good things for the \nState of South Dakota, our country, and the Senate. But nothing he has \ndone has been more meaningful than selecting this professional, the \nfirst time in the history of our country, the Sergeant at Arms was a \nprofessional who had experience.\n  He was in charge of all the military police in the Army, a general in \nthe United States Army, and was called upon for duty by Senator \nDaschle. If there were ever anyone with a vision regarding the problems \nthis country faced and this Senate passed, Senator Daschle, in \nselecting General Lenhardt--because September 11 came during his \nhoneymoon period. He had just gotten here.\n  We were so well served and have been so well served. I want the \nRecord to reflect not only my great admiration and my friendship for \nGeneral Lenhardt, I want the record to reflect for all Senator Daschle \nhas done, nothing has been more important in the Senate than his \nselecting this good man for this most important job.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my dear friend, the Senator from Nevada, for his \nvery kind words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I walked over to the floor without \nrealizing we were giving a testament to General Lenhardt. But I could \nnot agree more with the words I heard from Senator Daschle, as well as \nthe words from Senator Reid of Nevada. It is true, as I reflect upon \nit, that I know of no man who contributed greater service for his \ncountry than Al Lenhardt. He is such a professional. He is such a \ngentleman. He is so good. We trust him so much. We are so lucky that he \nwas our Sergeant at Arms during the tragic times the Capitol family has \nbeen through the last couple of years.\n  I know we are all extremely proud of him and we will have very fond \nmemories of his service here. I say to General Lenhardt, you are a \ngreat man, and we appreciate your service.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pledge my support for our brave men \nand women who are on the front lines protecting America as we work to \neliminate terrorism. . . . To pledge my support for the United States \nand all that our country represents: democracy, freedom of speech and \nreligion, independence of thought. . . . And to pledge my support for \nour leaders and our free and open elections that allow democracy to \nthrive.\n  I also rise today to urge and insist that throughout the ongoing \nsituation with Iraq, we remember our underlying goal: To protect our \ncountry from weapons of mass destruction and terrorist threats and stop \nthose who provide assistance to terrorist operations. In order to fully \naccomplish these goals, we need the support and assistance of the \nbroadest possible worldwide coalition of our allies.\n  It's not in our Nation's interest to establish arbitrary deadlines to \nforce us to act without the support of others. This is not the time to \nisolate our country by moving into a unilateral war against Iraq.\n  A war that could result in massive casualties and long term \ndevastation. A war that has the likely potential of increasing \nterrorist threats against our Nation.\n  There is no question that the United States has the ability and the \nright to take necessary action to protect our country. But we should \nnot burn bridges--bridges that we will surely need down the road--in \nour rush to war with Iraq.\n  There is no debate that the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein must come \nto an end. He has a long history of attacking and murdering his own \npeople, employing chemical and biological weapons, and continually \ndefying the limits set forth by the UN. There have been reported links \nbetween Iraq and terrorist activity, although no link has been \nestablished between Iraq and the events of September 11. The Iraqi \npeople and the global community deserve to be free from a cruel \ndictator and the threat to safety that he represents. The credibility \nof the United Nations and of America is on the line.\n  We must take the time to fully weigh the risks and costs associated \nwith unilateral action against the results we will achieve. The threat \nIraq poses is not imminent, at least not so imminent that we can't \ncontinue with another week, or another month, of negotiations to garner \nthe support of members of the United Nations Security Council.\n  The clock is ticking, but the alarm has not yet rung. I encourage the \nadministration to continue inspections beyond their self-imposed March \n17 deadline. In these final critical minutes, we have the opportunity \nto lay out hard and fast, mutually agreed upon benchmarks for Hussein \nto meet--or not meet--to determine his fate. Britain laid out \ndefinitive steps yesterday, such as allowing Iraq scientists to be \ninterviewed abroad, destroying banned weapons and providing documentary \nevidence of any such destruction in the past.\n  While support for their resolution has not been overwhelming, it is \nimportant to continue along this path. Indeed, it is critical. We must \nboth provide assistance to Britain, our strongest ally, while employing \nevery resource at our command to garner Security Council support.\n  As the world's superpower, it is not only our responsibility, but it \nis in our best interest to lead. It's our responsibility to walk with \nand secure the support of our allies. The decisions we make in the \ncoming days will have global reverberations and I am hopeful we won't \nhave to endure the impacts alone.\n  In the case that unilateral military action is decided upon, the \nramifications, lengthy reconstruction process and costs involved must \nbe addressed. There are numerous reports that a war with Iraq will be a \nrelatively short operation. But what follows in a month, in 6 months, \nin a year?\n  If the United States chooses to go it alone in Iraq and forsakes the \nsupport of a majority of our allies, the hurdles\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\nand pitfalls will be numerous. And the likelihood of long term success \nand stability will be diminished. If we are successful in our mission \nto remove Saddam, a successor will need to be determined. The \nlikelihood of Iraq becoming a democracy in our lifetime is unlikely. \nEven with the ousting of Saddam, we must be prepared and accepting of a \nmoderate Arab government similar to others in the region.\n  The cost of rebuilding the country will be enormous, both in terms of \nmoney and manpower. From ensuring the Iraqi children can obtain clean \nwater to establishing a forum for a free and open government to thrive. \nAre we willing to take those costs solely upon ourselves?\n  We must also be ready to focus our resources on the stability of the \nentire Middle East region and Muslim world. We need a comprehensive \npolicy of economic engagement, one that includes expanded trade.\n  We should consider a trade benefits program similar to what we \ncurrently do for Africa, the Caribbean, and the Andean countries. In \norder to achieve long-term stability and reduce the terrorist threat, \nwe will need to engage the entire region. And we will need our allies \nto assist in this engagement.\n  It's time to face facts. Our country is facing a troubling economy, \nunemployment, low growth, large national debt. Interest rates can't go \nmuch lower.\n  If we continue to disregard the concerns of other Security Council \nmembers and move forward with only a small band of countries that \nsupport immediate military action, the lion's share of the costs and \nmilitary burden will fall on America's shoulders. Where will this money \ncome from. How long must our troops be away from their families--\nmonths, years, decades? We must be fully prepared for this scenario \nbefore we move forward.\n  We are all in agreement that Saddam Hussein is a bad man and the \nthreat he poses cannot be disregarded. While I unequivocally support \nremoving Hussein from power, knowing that he is a peril to the region \nand the world, I urge that we move forward with a strong coalition of \nsupport. The clock is running down, but there is still time to gather \nour allies. Our long term interests--on every front--will be best \nachieved by standing together, united behind our common goal of \neliminating terrorism and keeping our countries safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3713-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3713-S3715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to a period for morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest to my friend \nfrom Montana. While I had not prepared a response, I feel, nonetheless, \nmoved to make a response.\n  My colleague from Montana made the point that Saddam Hussein must be \nremoved and then suggested that we need more time and we should be \nwilling to grant more time. This is, indeed, the position of many \npeople in the United Nations. They keep saying just another week, just \nanother month if necessary. The Senator from Montana used that same \ntimeframe.\n  In my opinion, we do not have that option. In my opinion, we have two \noptions, not three. The two options are either to go ahead or to come \nhome. The option of staying in place and allowing the inspections to go \non for an indeterminate period of time is not a viable option.\n  The reason for that is that our troops are not where they are on \nanything like a permanent status. They are there at the indulgence of \nforeign governments that have allowed them to come in with the firm \nunderstanding that they will be there very briefly. In the countries \nwhere they are currently bivouacked, they are simply there, on the edge \nof moving forward.\n  If we now say to those countries, the host countries that are \nharboring our troops, we are going to leave them there for an \nindefinite period of time while the inspectors continue to poke around \nIraq, I expect that country after country will say: No. We did not \nbargain for American troops in these numbers on our territory for an \nindefinite period of time.\n  If you are not moving ahead into Iraq, withdraw your forces and go \nhome. And if we do withdraw our forces and go home, it is clear Saddam \nHussein will not be removed until he dies. And he may very well die in \nhis bed, because once the United States has sent the signal to the \nworld that we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to remove this \nbrutal dictator and then we back down and bring our troops home, we can \nnever put them back in those places again. No host government currently \nallowing American forces on its soil will say OK, now that Saddam \nHussein has nuclear weapons, you can come back and be on our soil and \nmake us a target for those nuclear weapons. No. We have two choices. We \ncan either move ahead or we can come home.\n  It is not the most sympathetic character in Shakespeare. A comment \nmade by Lady Macbeth becomes appropriate here. ``If it were done when \n'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.''\n  If we are going to remove Saddam Hussein, we must do it quickly. And \nif we are not, we should not leave our troops in their present posture \nfor an indefinite period of time while inspectors poke around on a \nscavenger hunt in Iraq.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, obviously, the major conversation today is \nabout how we might successfully disarm Saddam Hussein of the weapons of \nmass destruction, which many of us still believe are there in Iraq and \npose a serious threat, not only to ourselves but to allies and others.\n  I certainly do not minimize the importance of dealing with this \nissue. In fact, as my constituents know, I voted for the resolution \nlast fall authorizing the President to use force if that became \nnecessary. I still support that position.\n  I think the President ought to have that authority from Congress. I \nam grateful to him for coming to Congress and asking for that kind of \nbacking. When I voted to give him that authority, I did not mean, of \ncourse, necessarily that authority would be used regardless of other \ncircumstances. And certainly, over the past several months, we have \nseen a concerted effort to try to resolve the problem of Iraq short of \nusing military force.\n  In fact, the President's own words, deserve being repeated; that is, \nthat he did not welcome or look forward to the use of military force to \nsolve this problem. He hoped it would be resolved without using force. \nI applaud him for making those statements and hope he is still \ncommitted to that proposition.\n  I am concerned, still, as are many Americans, that we may see a \nmilitary conflict in the coming days, and that every effort to try to \nresolve this matter, diplomatically and politically, has not yet been \nexhausted. I know the administration is working on it.\n  As one Member of this body, I encourage them to continue doing so. I \ndo not mean indefinitely, obviously. There are obviously points at \nwhich you have to accept the fact that there is not going to be the \nkind of cooperation you would like to have. I certainly would not \nsuggest we ought to go on indefinitely here at all, but I do believe \nour allies and friends--principally Great Britain, which has been \nremarkably steadfast in their loyalty to the U.S. Government on this \nissue--need to be listened to, that their advice and counsel have value \nand weight. And if there are ways in which you can craft resolutions \nwhich would build support at the U.N. Security Council, then we ought \nto try to do that. That does not mean you go on weeks trying to sort \nthat out. But I hope every effort is being made to fashion just such an \narrangement that would allow us to deal with Saddam Hussein.\n  I happen to believe, in the absence of the threat of force, I don't \nthink diplomacy would work alone, nor do I necessarily believe the \nthreat of force, without some effort by diplomacy and politics, would \nnecessarily work as well as we would like.\n  It is a combination of the threat of force and the use of diplomacy \nthat I think has produced the significant, positive results we have \nseen in the last number of weeks. And the President deserves credit for \nthat, in my view.\n\n[[Page S3714]]\n\n  There is almost a sense of victory occurring here. He may be the most \ncritical voice regarding this progress that has been made, but, \nnonetheless, I think progress is being made.\n  Mr. President, I want to shift quickly, if I can, however, to the \ncost of reconstruction. I know the conversation is whether or not there \nwill be a war. Let's assume, for a second, that comes. As regrettable \nas it is--and we hope it will, obviously, be done at a minimal loss of \ninnocent lives and the lives of the men and women in uniform--I am \ndeeply troubled by the fact this administration has been unwilling to \ncome before Congress to share with us their best and worst-case \nscenarios in terms of the cost of reconstruction in Iraq.\n  Certainly, I do not expect, nor should anyone, that the \nadministration would be able to tell you with any great deal of \nspecificity exactly what those costs would be. But you are not going to \nconvince anybody in this Chamber, or most Americans, that the \nadministration has not projected some cost figures on what it is going \nto cost us to rebuild Iraq, either alone or with the cooperation of \nothers around the globe.\n  The reason I say that is because I noticed the other day that the \nadministration had solicited bids from four or five major U.S. \ncorporations to bid on an almost $1 billion contract for reconstruction \nor partial reconstruction in Iraq.\n  I am convinced that those firms had to have some knowledge of what \nthe bid was all about in order to make it. What concerns me is that \nthere may be people in those corporations who know far more about what \nthe costs may be than the representatives and taxpayers of this \ncountry, who will ultimately be asked to pay the bill.\n  I was stunned, when we had a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee just a few days ago on this very subject matter, at the cost \nof reconstruction, that the administration refused to send any \nwitnesses up to share with the committee, under the leadership of the \ndistinguished chairman of that committee, Senator Richard Lugar of \nIndiana--that the administration refused to even step forward and share \nwith the committee their general thoughts on what may be the costs.\n  How is it that four or five corporations can apparently have access \nto information and yet the Congress of the United States does not? The \nfour or five corporations were Bechtel, the Fluor Corporation, \nHalliburton, owned by Kellogg, Brown and Root, the Lewis Berger Group, \nthe Parson Group. Those, I believe, are the names of the corporations \ninvited to bid on the reconstruction contracts.\n  If you are telling these corporations about what the costs may be, \nand what may be involved, and yet you can't let Members of Congress \nknow--particularly the committee charged with the responsibility--\nultimately, I think that is a mistake.\n  There was a report conducted, I think by the Brookings Institution, \nwith such distinguished Americans as James Schlesinger and others, that \nmade an analysis of the post-cost figures on reconstruction. They all \nmade the similar recommendation. You have to step forward.\n  As our former colleague, John Glenn, used to say: If you want the \nAmerican public to be supportive of actions like this, they have to be \ninvolved in the takeoff as well as the landing.\n  I think his words, that I heard him repeat on numerous occasions, \nhave particular value in talking about this debate. This is not to \nsuggest that everyone is going to endorse the numbers. But you need to \nlet the American public know what they are in for, so that there is \nsome understanding of what this involvement is going to cost us. I \nthink you are going to do far better at winning support ultimately for \nthese figures if you share your ideas.\n  Again, no one is expecting you are going to have to be wedded to \nthese numbers. But you are not going to build the kind of domestic \nsupport you need for a number of years on the reconstruction of Iraq if \nyou do not begin to share with the American public what sort of cost \nfigures we are talking about.\n  It is estimated by some groups already that the cost could be at a \nlow figure of $20 billion a year. The cost of the war, of course, we \ncan't get any numbers on. We don't have any numbers on how many of our \nU.S. military personnel might have to be stationed in Iraq for how long \na period of time during the period of occupation.\n  Let me share with you from the Brookings report. Even assuming, they \nsaid, little war-related damage--we hope that is the case--the \nreconstruction requirements in Iraq will be very substantial. Estimates \nof the requirement vary considerably from as little as $25 billion over \na multiyear period to as much as $300 billion over 10 years. It is \nestimated that repairing and restoring Iraq's electrical power grid to \nits pre-1990 level would cost as much as $20 billion and that the \nshort-term repairs for the oil industry would cost about $5 billion. \nAdditional reconstruction requirements involve water, sanitation, \ntransportation, and other infrastructure.\n  I bring this up not because I am trying to persuade people they ought \nnot to be for using force, if that becomes necessary, but just to \nsuggest that if you don't involve people and share with them what the \nestimated cost of this may be, you will be in trouble.\n  Let me tell you what I suspect is really behind a lot of this. As I \nam speaking on the floor of this Chamber, the budget committees of the \nCongress are meeting. They are talking about the cost of Government \nover the next number of years--tax policy, spending policy, what they \nwill be. The estimates now for the deficit are hovering around $400 \nbillion a year. I don't find it merely coincidental that the \nadministration is refusing to share with us how much this war may cost, \nhow much the reconstruction may cost at a time we are also considering \nthe budget. Why is it they won't share these numbers? Is it because \nthey don't want the Budget Committee or this Chamber, which will vote \nnext week on the budget, to have before it some idea of what taxpayers \nwill be asked to shoulder as a result of this involvement? Again, you \nwill not convince me that those numbers don't exist. They do exist.\n  It is outrageous that the administration won't step forward and say: \nHere is our best estimate, worst case, best case. Regardless of how you \nfeel about this conflict, potential conflict--again, I voted with the \nPresident to support the use of force if necessary--where are the \nMembers of the Senate? Why don't they stand up for the Senate when it \ncomes to the budget--we are the ones being asked to vote on this--and \nbe as demanding as I am about sharing these numbers? I would think \nevery single Member of this body, regardless of how you feel about the \nwar, would want to know what the cost may be, so that when you cast a \nvote either in the Budget Committee or on the floor of the Senate next \nweek, you would have some idea of what the implications are going to \nbe. Without having that information, I don't know how you will vote for \nsome of these other matters, knowing that the cost could be billions \nand billions of dollars in the coming 5 or 10 years.\n  Maybe I am the only one who feels this way. I suspect I am not. I \nsuspect there is a tremendous concern growing that we are digging a \nvery deep hole for ourselves financially with these massive tax cuts \nand massive spending going on. I find it more than ironic that some of \nthe strongest advocates for this budget only a few short years ago were \nstanding here begging us to vote for a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget and, but for one vote, we would have written it into \nthe Constitution. Now they stand before us and tell us deficits don't \nmatter and that we don't even have to share with you the estimated \ncosts of our involvement in Iraq.\n  My hope is that in these coming days before the end of this week or \nthe first part of next week, the administration might share through \nsome vehicle, if not before a congressional committee then some other \nforum, what the costs are apt to be so that next week when we vote on \nthe budget, we can include those numbers in the estimated burden the \nAmerican taxpayer may be asked to shoulder.\n  I am deeply worried that we are digging a very deep hole for \nourselves, and we are not being honest and square with the American \npublic about what those implications will be.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3715]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3713-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3713-S3715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to a period for morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest to my friend \nfrom Montana. While I had not prepared a response, I feel, nonetheless, \nmoved to make a response.\n  My colleague from Montana made the point that Saddam Hussein must be \nremoved and then suggested that we need more time and we should be \nwilling to grant more time. This is, indeed, the position of many \npeople in the United Nations. They keep saying just another week, just \nanother month if necessary. The Senator from Montana used that same \ntimeframe.\n  In my opinion, we do not have that option. In my opinion, we have two \noptions, not three. The two options are either to go ahead or to come \nhome. The option of staying in place and allowing the inspections to go \non for an indeterminate period of time is not a viable option.\n  The reason for that is that our troops are not where they are on \nanything like a permanent status. They are there at the indulgence of \nforeign governments that have allowed them to come in with the firm \nunderstanding that they will be there very briefly. In the countries \nwhere they are currently bivouacked, they are simply there, on the edge \nof moving forward.\n  If we now say to those countries, the host countries that are \nharboring our troops, we are going to leave them there for an \nindefinite period of time while the inspectors continue to poke around \nIraq, I expect that country after country will say: No. We did not \nbargain for American troops in these numbers on our territory for an \nindefinite period of time.\n  If you are not moving ahead into Iraq, withdraw your forces and go \nhome. And if we do withdraw our forces and go home, it is clear Saddam \nHussein will not be removed until he dies. And he may very well die in \nhis bed, because once the United States has sent the signal to the \nworld that we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to remove this \nbrutal dictator and then we back down and bring our troops home, we can \nnever put them back in those places again. No host government currently \nallowing American forces on its soil will say OK, now that Saddam \nHussein has nuclear weapons, you can come back and be on our soil and \nmake us a target for those nuclear weapons. No. We have two choices. We \ncan either move ahead or we can come home.\n  It is not the most sympathetic character in Shakespeare. A comment \nmade by Lady Macbeth becomes appropriate here. ``If it were done when \n'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.''\n  If we are going to remove Saddam Hussein, we must do it quickly. And \nif we are not, we should not leave our troops in their present posture \nfor an indefinite period of time while inspectors poke around on a \nscavenger hunt in Iraq.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, obviously, the major conversation today is \nabout how we might successfully disarm Saddam Hussein of the weapons of \nmass destruction, which many of us still believe are there in Iraq and \npose a serious threat, not only to ourselves but to allies and others.\n  I certainly do not minimize the importance of dealing with this \nissue. In fact, as my constituents know, I voted for the resolution \nlast fall authorizing the President to use force if that became \nnecessary. I still support that position.\n  I think the President ought to have that authority from Congress. I \nam grateful to him for coming to Congress and asking for that kind of \nbacking. When I voted to give him that authority, I did not mean, of \ncourse, necessarily that authority would be used regardless of other \ncircumstances. And certainly, over the past several months, we have \nseen a concerted effort to try to resolve the problem of Iraq short of \nusing military force.\n  In fact, the President's own words, deserve being repeated; that is, \nthat he did not welcome or look forward to the use of military force to \nsolve this problem. He hoped it would be resolved without using force. \nI applaud him for making those statements and hope he is still \ncommitted to that proposition.\n  I am concerned, still, as are many Americans, that we may see a \nmilitary conflict in the coming days, and that every effort to try to \nresolve this matter, diplomatically and politically, has not yet been \nexhausted. I know the administration is working on it.\n  As one Member of this body, I encourage them to continue doing so. I \ndo not mean indefinitely, obviously. There are obviously points at \nwhich you have to accept the fact that there is not going to be the \nkind of cooperation you would like to have. I certainly would not \nsuggest we ought to go on indefinitely here at all, but I do believe \nour allies and friends--principally Great Britain, which has been \nremarkably steadfast in their loyalty to the U.S. Government on this \nissue--need to be listened to, that their advice and counsel have value \nand weight. And if there are ways in which you can craft resolutions \nwhich would build support at the U.N. Security Council, then we ought \nto try to do that. That does not mean you go on weeks trying to sort \nthat out. But I hope every effort is being made to fashion just such an \narrangement that would allow us to deal with Saddam Hussein.\n  I happen to believe, in the absence of the threat of force, I don't \nthink diplomacy would work alone, nor do I necessarily believe the \nthreat of force, without some effort by diplomacy and politics, would \nnecessarily work as well as we would like.\n  It is a combination of the threat of force and the use of diplomacy \nthat I think has produced the significant, positive results we have \nseen in the last number of weeks. And the President deserves credit for \nthat, in my view.\n\n[[Page S3714]]\n\n  There is almost a sense of victory occurring here.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment today to speak \nabout an issue that has been discussed in the press recently, which is \nthe use of torture to obtain information from persons who are suspected \nof being terrorists.\n  It is well-established that torture is a violation of international \nlaw, by which our country is bound. It is also a violation of our own \nlaws. Yet commentators have been quoted by the press saying that in \ncertain limited circumstances, when the threat is a possible terrorist \nattack, the use of torture is justified. Some have even suggested that \nsince torture is used, why not simply admit it and accept it as a fact \nof life?\n  These are not easy questions. Who does not want to do everything \npossible to save innocent lives? We all do. But the United States is a \nnation of laws, and I reject the view that torture, even in such \ncompelling circumstances, can be justified. I would hope all countries \nwould uphold their obligations under international law, but that is not \nthe case. It is the 21st century, and yet torture is used by government \nsecurity forces in some 150 countries.\n  We have often spoken about how important it is not to let the \nterrorists win. We try not to let ourselves be intimidated. We take \nprecautions, but we go about our daily lives.\n  The same holds true of the tactics terrorists use. If we don't \nprotect the civil liberties that distinguish us from terrorists, then \nthe terrorists have won.\n  Torture is among the most heinous crimes, and there is no \njustification for its use. One need only review history to understand \nwhy there can be no exception to torture. The torture of criminal \nsuspects flagrantly violates the presumption of innocence on which our \ncriminal jurisprudence is based, and confessions extracted as a result \nof torture are notoriously unreliable.\n  Also, history has shown that once an exception is made for torture, \nit is impossible to draw the line. If we can justify torture in the \nUnited States, then what is to prevent its use in China, Iraq, Chile, \nor anywhere else? If torture is justified to obtain information from a \nsuspected terrorist, then why not torture the terrorist's wife and \nchildren, or his friends and acquaintances who may know about his \nactivities or his whereabouts? In fact, that is what happens in many \ncountries.\n  There is also the issue of what constitutes torture versus \nacceptable, albeit harsh, treatment.\n  Torture is defined in the Convention Against Torture, which the \nUnited States ratified, as ``any act by which severe pain or suffering, \nwhether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted upon a person \nfor such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information \nor a confession . . .''.\n  A March 4 article in the New York Times described the treatment of \nAfghan prisoners at the Bagram air base. Two former prisoners, both of \nyoung age, recently died in U.S. military custody. Other prisoners \ndescribed being forced to stand naked in a cold room for 10 days \nwithout interruption, with their arms raised and chained to the ceiling \nand their swollen ankles shackled. They also said they were denied \nsleep for days and forced to wear hoods that cut off the supply of \noxygen.\n  I do not believe that prisoners of war, some of whom are suspected of \nhaving killed or attempted to kill Americans, should be rewarded with \ncomforts. Harsh treatment may, at times, be justified.\n  However, while I cannot say whether the treatment described by these \nAfghan prisoners amounts to torture under international law, it does \nsound cruel and inhumane. The inhumane treatment of prisoners, whoever \nthey are, is beneath a great nation. It is also illegal. That is the \nlaw whether U.S. military officers engage in such conduct themselves, \nor they turn over prisoners to the government agents of another country \nwhere torture is commonly used, in order to let others do the dirty \nwork.\n  Some of these Afghan prisoners may be guilty of war crimes. Some may \nbe members of al-Qaida but may have never fired a shot. Others may be \ncompletely innocent. But regardless, I was not proud when I read that \narticle, and when I think of how often I and other Members of Congress \nhave criticized other governments for treating prisoners that way. It \nundermines our reputation as a Nation of laws, it hurts our credibility \nwith other nations, and it invites others to use similar tactics.\n  I am encouraged that the Department of Defense is conducting a review \nof the deaths of the two Afghans at Bagram, both of which were ruled \nhomicides by an American pathologist. Those responsible for what \nhappened must be held accountable. But I also urge the Department to \nreview whether the interrogation techniques used there, and at other \nU.S. military facilities are fully consistent with international law. \nIt should not take a homicide to reveal that prisoners in U.S. custody \nare being mistreated.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3715-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WELCOMING THE PRIME MINISTER OF IRELAND\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to welcome the Prime \nMinister of Ireland, who is here today. You will notice, I have a green \ntie on today. I am fully aware, as most Americans are, that St. \nPatrick's Day is on the 17th day of March, not the 13th day of March. \nBut when the Prime Minister of Ireland arrives here to celebrate St. \nPatrick's Day a little earlier this year, those of us who are of Irish \ndescent--and even those who are not but wish they were--generally wear \na little green to celebrate this festive holiday.\n  Prime Minister Ahern was at a lunch a little while ago hosted by the \ndistinguished Speaker of the House, Denny Hastert. Vice President \nCheney was also in attendance representing the President, who normally \nwould be attending an event such as this today, but, obviously, events \nin the Middle East made it difficult for him to get away. All of us \nunderstand that. We regret he was not able to be with us, but we fully \nappreciate there are other matters that require his more immediate \nattention.\n  But we thank the Prime Minister, the Taoiseach of Ireland, for him \nnot only being here but for his tremendous work, along with Tony Blair \nand other political leaders in Northern Ireland, particularly Jerry \nAdams and David Trimble, in their efforts to try to resolve, once and \nfor all, the political disputes that have been so devastating on the \npeople of Northern Ireland over these last number of years. Based on \nconversations we have had, it would appear that we are getting very \nclose to, hopefully, a final resolution of those issues.\n  So I welcome the Prime Minister and other political leaders from \nIreland and Northern Ireland who have come, as they traditionally do, \nto celebrate St. Patrick's Day, but have made this a working holiday, \nif you will, to engage in further conversations on what we might do to \nhelp resolve the matters of Northern Ireland, as well as to listen to \ntheir sound advice and observations regarding the turmoil that is \nbrewing in the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3715-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3715-S3716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ELIZABETH SMART AND THE NATIONAL AMBER ALERT NETWORK ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, like all of America, was elated last \nnight when we heard the news that the young girl from Utah, Elizabeth \nSmart, who had been missing for more than 9 months, had been found and \nreunited with her family. Most of the time, the vast majority of these \nstories about these girls--mostly girls who are kidnapped, abducted, \nstolen--end in bad news. This ended in good news.\n  As a father and grandfather, I really don't know the emotion of a \nparent who has a child stolen. An abducted child must be the worst \nnightmare of a parent. But this nightmare ended as I have just related.\n  The Justice Department says the number of children taken by strangers \nannually is between 3,000 and 4,000--it varies but thousands of \nchildren. Every day children are stolen. These children and their \nparents deserve the assistance of the American people and the helping \nhand of the Federal Government.\n  We stand ready and willing to help. We all feel so helpless when a \nchild is kidnapped. What can we do to help? There is not very much \nbecause mostly these stories end, not like Elizabeth Smart's, they end \nin tragedy. For the past 2 years, Senators Leahy, Hatch, Hutchison, \nFeinstein, and others have\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\nintroduced the National Amber Alert Network Act to aid in the recovery \nof abducted children. Last year, Committee Chairman Leahy, 1 week after \nit was introduced, held a hearing on the AMBER plan, and then we passed \nthe bill by unanimous consent in both the Judiciary Committee and the \nfull Senate when it was under the Democrats' control. Such quick and \ndynamic action on legislation is unheard of around here, but that is \nproof positive of the overwhelming support that exists for what is \nreally a nonpartisan issue.\n  Unfortunately, the House of Representatives refused to pass a \nnational AMBER Alert network. They refused to pass this act because \nthey said they didn't like it as a stand-alone bill. They wanted it \npart of something else--part of something else being part of nothing. \nIt is unknown to me how many children's lives would have been saved if \nwe had had a national AMBER Alert. We know, with the situation we had \nin California, that it really works.\n  This year, the Senate again, under the leadership of Senator Hatch, \nrapidly passed unanimously this bipartisan legislation. But once again \nthe House of Representatives--the leadership of the House of \nRepresentatives, Republican leadership of the House of \nRepresentatives--is refusing to act quickly on this bipartisan AMBER \nAlert bill.\n  I served in the House of Representatives. They could pass this \nlegislation in a matter of hours--not days, hours. Ed Smart, \nElizabeth's father, has called upon the House of Representatives to \npass this noncontroversial Senate-passed AMBER Alert bill. I agree this \nis the proper course and the fastest way to protect our children from \ndanger.\n  In fact, I am confused as to exactly why the House Republican leaders \nrefuse to pass this bill since they agreed to include in the fiscal \nyear 2003 omnibus spending bill $2.5 million for AMBER Alert grants. \nThe House leadership still, however, chooses to ignore the bill that \nthe Senate has twice passed under the bipartisan leadership of Senators \nHatch and Leahy, once when Senator Leahy was chairman, once when \nSenator Hatch was chairman. To include AMBER legislation as a provision \nin an omnibus bill, standing alone, or in any other capacity, \nit doesn't matter to us.\n\n  I hope the successful recovery of Elizabeth Smart and her father's \ncall for passage of the Senate-passed bill today moves the House \nRepublican leadership to not play politics and promptly let this \nNational AMBER Alert Network Act pass as a stand-alone measure--next \nweek. They could do it tonight. I know how the House works.\n  The AMBER plan has been credited with the recovery of 49 children \nnationwide, 49 children who have been reunited happily with their \nparents. Mr. President, 38 States have a statewide plan. Officials in \nthose States that do not yet have AMBER plans are working toward \nestablishing the AMBER Alert system, and one of the aims of this bill \nis to help towns, counties, and States all over America to build and \nsupport systems to broadcast AMBER Alerts.\n  Our bipartisan legislation creates a national AMBER Alert coordinator \nat the Justice Department to work with States, broadcasters, and law \nenforcement agencies to set up AMBER Alert plans, to serve as a point \nof contact to supplement existing AMBER plans, and facilitate \nappropriate regional coordination of AMBER Alerts.\n  As I was eating dinner last night, watching Larry King, I was so \nimpressed with the enthusiasm, hope, and glee demonstrated by the \nfamily of Elizabeth Smart. Of course, we all recognize the father in \ntears, saying how happy he was, why haven't we passed this legislation. \nToday, when he has learned the real facts, he is saying: Why hasn't the \nHouse passed this legislation?\n  This legislation also directs the coordinator in the Justice \nDepartment to establish voluntary guidelines for minimum standards for \nAMBER Alerts and their dissemination. As a result, the bill helps \nkidnap victims while preserving flexibility for the States. Developing \nand enhancing the AMBER Alert system is a costly endeavor for States to \ntake on alone. So to share the burden, the bill establishes two Federal \ngrant programs managed by the Justice and Transportation Departments \nfor such activities as information dissemination on abducted children \nand suspected kidnappers, and for necessary AMBER Alert equipment.\n  Our Nation's children, parents, and grandparents deserve our help to \nstop the disturbing trend of children's abductions--to let everyone \nknow they are helping by their taxpayer dollars going to a national \nsystem. Everyone can then say, ``I have done my share.'' I think we \nhave a program here that really helps.\n  In the State of Israel, which every day faces terrorist threats and \nactivities, 90 percent of the terrorist activities are thwarted as a \nresult of citizens, people of good will, seeing something that doesn't \nlook right and calling law enforcement. If there is something going on \nnext-door, on the block, something in their city that they see, or in \ntheir neighborhood, they can complain to authorities, and it helps. \nThat is what happened here.\n  We had people in Salt Lake City--actually, Sandy, UT--who I am sure \nsaid: I don't know if I am doing the right thing, but I think this \ncould be Elizabeth. A little girl with a wig--a little girl? She is a \nteenager--she has been gone almost a year--with a wig and some kind of \nmask over her face, a veil, as they call it.\n  But these people of good will said: You know--I am sure I am thinking \nwhat they must have thought--this is going to be humiliating to me, if \nI stop these people. Maybe they are religious people, maybe this is \npart of their religious garb and costume. Maybe I'll embarrass them and \nme. But what if I let them go, walk by, and I haven't done anything \nabout that, and this is Elizabeth?\n  For whatever reason, they decided to become intervenors. She stepped \nforward, and said: I think this is Elizabeth. Sure enough, it was. The \nlittle girl had a wig on and a veil. She said: I am Elizabeth Smart. As \na result of that, she was reunited with her parents.\n\n  We don't know. We will never know what that girl has gone through. We \ndon't know all of it. I personally don't know if she was brainwashed, \nas was Patty Hearst. I don't know anything about it. But I know there \nare some happy people in Salt Lake City today. Not only the family, not \nonly the family, but all over Salt Lake City, the State of Utah, the \nneighboring State of Nevada, but the whole country is celebrating a \nsuccessful conclusion to a kidnapping, an event which doesn't happen \nthat much.\n  I hope the House of Representatives' conscience will be pricked and \nthey will reach out and do something quickly which they have the \ncapability of doing and allowing the national AMBER Alert program to \npass. It should pass not in this congressional session, not this month, \nbut next week, and early in the week. That is my desire. I hope we \nfollow through on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3716-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3716-S3717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE SAFE RETURN OF ELIZABETH SMART\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I express my deep-felt feelings about the \nanswer to all of our prayers in Utah. There has never been a State \nwhere virtually everybody got on their knees and prayed for the return \nof this young woman, Elizabeth Smart.\n  I have to tell you, we believe in miracles out there. We have seen \nthem time after time after time. But I have to admit, most people had \npretty much given up. They were thinking, well, that poor soul \nundoubtedly had to have been murdered. But her father and her mother \nnever gave up.\n  They were in my office just a short while ago saying: We are going to \nfind her. We believe she is alive--praying every day, fasting for their \ndaughter. People in Utah fast and pray in these situations.\n  I have to tell you, I was so thrilled last night to see they finally \nfound her.\n  I could hardly get to sleep.\n  I want to pay tribute to that wonderful family and her neighbors. \nJake Garn and Kathleen Garn are two of the neighbors. I have to tell \nyou, they both have been of tremendous help and bolsterers, as have all \nof the neighbors, to the Smart family. Jake has moved heaven and earth \nfor them. He has talked to me, worked with me, worked with others. His \nwife Kathleen is as good as it gets. She is a wonderful\n\n[[Page S3717]]\n\nhuman being. I know she was over there all the time, giving solace, \nsupport, comfort. It is typical of these two, who served in the Senate \nwith us for so many years and did such a great job, to continue to do a \ngreat job in our home State. That family really deserves a lot of \ncredit. Not only the immediate family but the extended family exercised \ntheir faith and prayers on behalf of this young woman.\n  I hope everything is OK with her. It is certainly OK compared to what \nshe has gone through. I hope everybody who knows her and knows that \nfamily will lend support and solace and comfort to help them to reunite \nin every way and help this young woman to overcome the terrible \nexperience she has had over the last 9 months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3717-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMERICA'S COMMITMENT TO INTERNATIONAL LAW\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, when future generations reflect on the \nfallout from the terrorist attack of 9/11/2001, I fear they will see \nour own commitment to international law as a casualty of that event. I \ndo.\n  For some time now, there has been a contest within the U.S. foreign \npolicy establishment between those who believe our greater security \nlies with the strengthening of international institutions and \nagreements, on the one hand, and, on the other, those who believe our \nsecurity is enhanced if we demonstrate the will and capacity to \nprevail; that is, to dominate the new world and shape it to our liking.\n  The election of President Bush and the attack of 9/11 have moved U.S. \npolicy to endorse this second vision--that of U.S. dominance of a world \nthat meets our standards of acceptable conduct.\n  The result of this shift in U.S. foreign policy is now evident in the \nstatements and actions of the President regarding Iraq. Unless I \nmisread those statements by the President and his foreign policy team, \nsometime within the next few days, the United States, and possibly \nBritish, troops will begin an invasion of Iraq. The mission, according \nto the President, will be to disarm Saddam Hussein, to capture and \ndestroy his weapons of mass destruction, to liberate the people of Iraq \nfrom his despotic rule, to install a new and democratic government, and \nto hold up Iraq as a model for freedom and democracy that can be \nemulated by other Middle Eastern countries.\n  These are noble objectives. My concern is not with the objectives but \nwith the apparent decision the President has made to proceed with an \ninvasion now while many Americans and many of our traditional allies \nbelieve that alternatives to war still exist.\n  In his State of the Union Address, the President spoke about a \ncircumstance where ``war is forced upon us.'' After the President \nspoke, I came to the Senate floor to make what I considered an obvious \npoint; that is, that war had not been forced upon us. It is still my \nview today that war with Iraq has not been forced upon us. Our allies \nwho are urging that the U.N. weapons inspectors be given more time to \ndo their work agree with that view.\n  In the report to the Security Council last Friday, Hans Blix and \nMohamed ElBaradai, the heads of the U.N. inspection teams, reported \nprogress toward the goal of ensuring that Iraq has been disarmed. They \npointed out that more cooperation by Iraq is needed, but they \nacknowledged that cooperation has increased.\n  President Bush and Secretary of State Powell have correctly pointed \nout that Iraq's increased level of cooperation does not constitute full \ncompliance with Security Council Resolution 1441, in that Iraq has not \nfully, completely, and immediately disarmed.\n  The question is whether this failure to fully comply with the U.N. \nresolution justifies an armed invasion of Iraq at this time. Many \nSecurity Council members believe it does not, and, in my view, it does \nnot.\n  Our Government's position appears to be that we will enforce the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution even though the Security Council itself \ndoes not support that action at this time. In other words, we will act \nin coordination with the views of the world community of nations as \nlong as those views agree with our own. When those views differ from \nour own, we will use our great military capability to impose our will \nby force.\n  I, for one, can support a policy of imposing our will by force, \nnotwithstanding the views of our allies, if there is an imminent threat \nto our own security and if all options, other than war, have been \nexhausted. But neither of those circumstances prevails today.\n  A decision to wage war at this time, absent the support of our \ntraditional allies, contradicts the foreign policy on which this Nation \nhas been grounded for many decades. It undermines the international \ninstitution that previous U.S. administrations worked to establish as \nan instrument for world peace. It clearly signals that even absent an \nimminent threat to our security, we consider ourselves the ultimate \narbiter of acceptable behavior by other governments and that we will \nact to ``change regimes'' when we determine the actions of other \ngovernments to be unacceptable.\n  Madam President, this is an unwise and dangerous precedent for us to \nestablish. Stripped of its niceties, it is essentially a foreign policy \npremised on the belief that ``might makes right.'' At this point in \nworld history, we have the might and, therefore, accommodating the \nviews of others seems a low priority. But the day will surely come when \nothers also have the might, and then we may wish we had shown restraint \nso that we can argue that others should as well.\n  There is a famous scene from ``A Man For All Seasons,'' the \nmagnificent play Robert Bolt wrote, about the conflict between Sir \nThomas More, a man of conscience and the law, and his sovereign, Henry \nVIII.\n  More and Roper, his son-in-law, are arguing about the law at this \npoint in the play. Their conversation is instructive. Roper, the son-\nin-law, exclaims: ``So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law!'' More \nreplies: ``Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to \nget after the Devil?'' Roper says: ``I'd cut down every law in England \nto do that,'' to which More responds: ``. . . And when the last law was \ndown, and the Devil turned round on you--where would you hide, Roper, \nthe laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws from \ncoast to coast . . . and if you cut them down--and you're just the man \nto do it--d'you really think you could stand upright in the winds that \nwould blow then?'' ``Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own \nsafety's sake.''\n  I submit that if the United States determines to circumvent the U.N. \nin this case, the Devil may well turn round on us, and we could reap \nthe whirlwind for years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3717-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3717-S3720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, after years of shortchanging our nation's \ncrime labs, the Administration has unveiled a proposal to spend more \nthan $1 billion over five years on forensic DNA programs. This proposal \nis overdue, but it is welcome, and it will make a difference.\n  For two years I have repeatedly urged the Administration and House \nRepublicans to fully fund existing programs aimed at eliminating the \nDNA backlog crisis and, in particular, the inexcusable backlog of \nuntested rape kits. Until now, the Justice Department has simply \nrefused to make this a high priority. In the meantime, untested \ncritical evidence has been piling up while rapists and killers remain \nat large, while victims continue to anguish, and while statutes of \nlimitation expire.\n  I am pleased that the Administration's new commitment to funding DNA \nprograms includes $5 million a year for post-conviction DNA tests that \ncan be used by inmates to prove their innocence. Post-conviction DNA \ntesting has already been used to exonerate more than 120 prisoners \nnationwide, including 12 awaiting execution. Last year the Justice \nDepartment cancelled plans to spend $750,000 on a post-conviction DNA \ntesting initiative, and diverted the money to another program. It is \nheartening that the Department at last has recognized the importance of \nensuring that the power of modern science, in the form of DNA testing, \nis available to help prosecutors and defendants alike establish the \ntruth about guilt and innocence.\n  Clearly, DNA testing is critical to the effective administration of \njustice\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\nin 21st Century America. But like every forensic tool, DNA testing is \nonly as accurate as the labs and technicians that process the evidence. \nWhen we shortchange our labs, we shortchange the whole criminal justice \nsystem. The appalling situation in Houston, Texas, is only the most \nrecent example.\n  Last December, a state audit conducted by a team of forensic \nscientists uncovered widespread problems at the Houston Police \nDepartment's crime laboratory. These problems included poorly trained \ntechnicians, shoddy recordkeeping, and holes in the roof that allowed \nrain to possibly contaminate samples. A Houston councilwoman who toured \nthe lab last June described trash buckets and water buckets throughout \nthe facility: ``They were having to move tables around, because some of \nthe leaks were near and sometimes above where the analysis was \noccurring.''\n  Elizabeth Johnson, a DNA expert familiar with the Houston police lab, \nhas pointed to serious problems beyond holes in the ceiling problems \nthat suggest widespread incompetence or even corruption. Dr. Johnson \nhas testified that lab technicians often vastly exaggerated the \nprobability of a defendant's guilt, while mischaracterizing evidence \nthat exonerated a defendant as ``inconclusive.'' In many cases, she \nfound, lab technicians' reports, which were used to make critical \ndecisions throughout the criminal justice system, asserted conclusions \nthat were entirely unsupported by their data: not technical errors; not \nmisjudgments; but flat-out fabrications.\n  I have spoken before about the disastrous consequences of sloppy lab \nwork. Two years ago, an FBI investigation found that a police chemist \nin Oklahoma City was routinely exaggerating her results. At least one \nman who was convicted on the basis of the chemist's so-called \n``expert'' testimony was later exonerated and released from prison. He \nhad already served 15 years of a 65-year sentence.\n  There are many other cases in which people have been wrongly \nconvicted because forensic specialists were incompetent, or because \nthey fabricated or overstated test results to support the prosecution's \ntheory of the case. In 1997, we learned about major problems at the \nFBI's crime labs, ranging from unqualified forensic scientists to \ncontamination of evidence and the doctoring of laboratory reports. \nBefore that, there were similar problems in various state crime labs. \nPolice in Baltimore are currently reviewing 480 cases worked on by a \nformer police chemist who testified at a 1983 rape trial against a \ndefendant who was later exonerated.\n  While the situation in Houston is not unprecedented, it is \nparticularly alarming. That is because Houston is in Harris County, the \nexecution capital of the United States. Harris County sends more people \nto death row in a year than many states do in a decade. More defendants \nfrom Harris County have been executed than from any other county in the \ncountry.\n  Harris County prosecutors are now busily reviewing their closed cases \nto determine whether they involved evidence processed by the Houston \npolice lab. They have already ordered new DNA testing in more than 20 \ncases, including 7 cases in which the defendant was sentenced to death. \nUltimately, several hundred cases will need to be retested.\n  Retesting has already cleared one man, Josiah Sutton. Sutton was only \na teenager when he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years for rape, \nbased largely on a bogus DNA match by the Houston police lab. It now \nappears that he spent the last 4\\1/2\\ years in prison for nothing.\n  How many Josiah Sutton's has Harris County wrongfully convicted? \nProbably quite a few. Hundreds of people have been convicted using DNA \nevidence processed by the Houston police lab. The fact that the very \nfirst batch of cases to be retested has exposed a wrongful conviction \nsuggests that Sutton may be just the tip of the iceberg.\n  How many more people will be cleared through retesting? That is a \ntrickier question. According to the state audit, the Houston police lab \nroutinely consumed most if not all of the evidence available for \ntesting, with little or no regard for the importance of conserving \nsamples. This practice will greatly limit the possibility for retesting \nin the hundreds of cases now under review.\n  DNA testing is an extraordinary tool for uncovering the truth, \nwhatever the truth may be. It can show us conclusively, even years \nafter a conviction, where mistakes have been made. But it cannot show \nus anything if there is no evidence to test. By needlessly consuming \nentire DNA samples, the Houston police lab may have destroyed the only \nkey to freedom for more than one wrongly convicted person.\n  The failure to preserve DNA evidence is a problem in many parts of \nthe country, but it seems to be an official policy in Harris County. In \n1997, DNA testing exonerated Harris County defendant Kevin Byrd only \nbecause, by pure luck, the 12-year rape kit had not been destroyed \npursuant to bureaucratic routine. The very week that Byrd was freed, \nhowever, Harris County officials systematically destroyed the rape kits \nfrom 50 other old cases, citing a lack of storage space.\n  No doubt many of the rape kits that Harris County destroyed that week \nand over the years were analyzed under the leaky ceilings of the \nHouston police lab. But even with the best of intentions, Harris County \nprosecutors will not be able to resurrect that evidence for retesting. \nThere may well have been another Josiah Sutton or two among those \ncases--defendants who were wrongfully convicted based on bad lab work--\nbut without the evidence to prove it, we will probably never know.\n  The essence of law enforcement is seeking the truth, not hiding from \nit or destroying evidence in a fit of pique or to save face. The \ndisdain for science, truth, and justice we have seen in Houston, at the \nheart of the nation's capital punishment system, is an utter disgrace.\n  All of which is to say that I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting the Administration's new DNA initiative. One billion dollars \nwill give States the help they desperately need to improve the quality \nand credibility of their crime labs, and to eliminate the backlog of \nuntested DNA evidence. Five million dollars a year will go a long way \ntoward ensuring that no deserving inmate is denied post-conviction DNA \ntesting because he or she cannot afford to pay for it.\n  In his remarks announcing the DNA Initiative, Attorney General \nAshcroft said he ``looked forward to working with the Chairmen of the \nHouse and Senate Judiciary Committees to develop legislation that \nprovides appropriate post-conviction DNA testing to federal inmates.''\n  I welcome that, but I have a better idea. With Chairman Hatch's \nagreement, I would like to issue a bipartisan invitation to Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft to come to talk to us in open committee about a \nlegislative proposal that is already written, has already been refined \nand debated, and has already received overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  I refer to the Innocence Protection Act, a modest and practical \npackage of reforms that aims at reducing the risk of error in capital \ncases. The reforms proposed by the IPA are designed to create a fairer \nsystem of justice, where the problems that have sent innocent people to \ndeath row would not occur, and where victims and their families could \nbe more certain of the accuracy, and finality, of the results.\n  More specifically, the Innocence Protection Act would ensure that \npost-conviction DNA testing is available in appropriate cases, where it \ncan help expose wrongful convictions, and that DNA evidence is \nadequately preserved throughout the country. The bill also addresses \none of the root causes of wrongful convictions--inadequate defense \nrepresentation at trial.\n  Last year, the IPA won the support of a bipartisan majority of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, and more than half the entire House of \nRepresentatives. Together with other lead sponsors--Senator Gordon \nSmith, Senator Susan Collins, Representative Bill Delahunt, and \nRepresentative Ray LaHood--I am committed to reintroducing the IPA this \nyear and getting it signed into law.\n  The path to prompt reform is through legislation that is already \nwritten and fine-tuned. The path to consensus is through legislation \nthat has already received broad bipartisan support. And the path to \naddressing the fundamental problems in our criminal\n\n[[Page S3719]]\n\njustice system is through legislation that addresses the most common \ncause of wrongful convictions--inadequate defense counsel--as well as \ntheir most conspicuous solution--DNA testing. The path, in each case, \nis the Innocence Protection Act.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to pass the Innocence Protection Act this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record 2 articles, one \nfrom the Washington Post, the other from the New York Times, which \ndescribe the ongoing investigation into the Houston police lab.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 11, 2003]\n\n               Review of DNA Clears Man Convicted of Rape\n\n                            (By Adam Liptak)\n\n       When Josiah Sutton went on trial for rape in 1999, \n     prosecutors in Houston had little to build a case on. The \n     victim was the only witness, and her recollection was faulty. \n     But they did have the rapist's DNA, and technicians from the \n     Houston police crime laboratory told the jury that it was a \n     solid match.\n       That was enough to persuade the jurors to convict Mr. \n     Sutton and send him to prison for 25 years.\n       But new testing has conclusively demonstrated that the DNA \n     was not Mr. Sutton's, the Houston Police Department said \n     yesterday.\n       The retesting is part of a review of the laboratory that \n     began after a scathing state audit of its work led to a \n     suspension of genetic testing in January. Mr. Sutton's \n     apparent exoneration is the first to result from the review.\n       Legal experts say the laboratory is the worst in the \n     country, but troubles there are also seen in other crime \n     laboratories. Standards are often lax or nonexistent, \n     technicians are poorly trained and defense lawyers often have \n     no money to hire their own experts. Questions about the work \n     of laboratories and their technicians in Oklahoma City, \n     Montana and Washington State and elsewhere have led to \n     similar reviews. But the possible problems in Houston are \n     much greater. More defendants from Harris County, of which \n     Houston is a part, have been executed than from any other \n     county in the country.\n       ``This is an earthquake,'' Mr. Sutton's lawyer, Bob Wicoff, \n     said. ``The ramifications of this for other cases, for death \n     penalty cases, is staggering. Thousands of cases were \n     prosecuted on the basis of this lab's work.\n       The audit of the Houston laboratory, completed in December, \n     found that technicians had misinterpreted data, were poorly \n     trained and kept shoddy records. In most cases, they used up \n     all available evidence, barring defense experts from refuting \n     or verifying their results. Even the laboratory's building \n     was a mess, with a leaky roof having contaminated evidence.\n       The police and prosecutors vowed to retest DNA evidence in \n     every case where it was used to obtain a conviction. But they \n     remained confident that the laboratory's problems were \n     primarily matters of documentation and testimony that was not \n     conservative enough.\n       The Sutton case has changed that.\n       ``It's a comedy of errors, except it's not funny,'' said \n     State Representative Kevin Bailey, a Houston Democrat who is \n     chairman of a committee of the Texas Legislature \n     investigating the laboratory. ``You don't need to be a \n     scientist to know that you have to wear surgical gloves. You \n     have to tag evidence. You need to not have a leaky roof \n     contaminating evidence.''\n       The Houston police have turned over some 525 case files \n     involving DNA testing to the Harris County district \n     attorney's office, which has said that at least 25 cases \n     warrant retesting, including those of seven people on death \n     row. Both numbers will grow significantly as more files are \n     collected and analyzed, Marie Munier, the assistant district \n     attorney supervising the project, said.\n       Mr. Bailey said he was troubled that the retesting was \n     being conducted under the supervision of Harris County \n     prosecutors.\n       ``I have lost confidence in the Police Department and the \n     district attorney's office to handle this,'' Mr. Bailey said. \n     ``I'm really bothered by the fact that the review is being \n     done by the same people who allowed the errors to go on and \n     prosecuted these cases and so have a stake in the outcomes of \n     the review.''\n       Joseph Owmby, who prosecuted Mr. Sutton, said his office \n     had not received a formal report from Identigene Inc. of \n     Houston, the outside laboratory his office hired to perform \n     the retesting.\n       ``If he has been exonerated,'' Mr. Owmby said, ``we also \n     have an eyewitness identification, and we will have to work \n     through that. If he was exonerated, it certainly doesn't make \n     me feel any better.''\n       Mr. Owmby said his confidence in the police laboratory's \n     work had been shattered. ``We're not scientists,'' he said. \n     ``We were presenting evidence that was presented to us. There \n     is a big problem. We are treating it as a big problem.''\n       Houston police officials issued a statement yesterday \n     confirming Mr. Sutton's exclusion, but noted that they had \n     not received a formal report from Identigene.\n       At a hearing on Thursday, Chief C. O. Bradford said his \n     department had shut down its DNA laboratory and begun an \n     internal affairs department investigation on whether there \n     was criminal or other wrongdoing. Chief Bradford added that \n     there should be a ``cease and desist'' on executions in the \n     relevant cases until the retesting is complete.\n       ``There certainly is a fear that people were wrongly \n     accused, wrongly convicted or received longer sentences than \n     they should have,'' he said last week in an interview in \n     Austin.\n       William C. Thompson, a professor of criminology at the \n     University of California at Irvine who has studied the \n     Houston police laboratory's work, said, ``The likelihood that \n     there are more innocent people convicted because of bad lab \n     work is almost certain.''\n       Elizabeth A. Johnson, a DNA expert retained by Mr. Sutton's \n     lawyers, has appeared as a defense witness in about 15 cases \n     involving the crime laboratory and is perhaps its most vocal \n     critic.\n       In one rape case, Dr. Johnson said, a technician testified \n     that a swab of the victim found semen, even though initial \n     laboratory reports said there was no semen present. In other \n     cases evidence that technicians said was inconclusive \n     actually exonerated the defendant. Often, she said, \n     technicians would vastly exaggerated the probability of a \n     defendant's guilt.\n       There was, she said, ``an overall lack of understanding of \n     how this work is done and what it means.''\n       She said the laboratory was particularly weak where the \n     sample involved a mixture of DNA from two people.\n       ``They can't do a sperm sample separation to save their \n     lives,'' Dr. Johnson said. ``If you put a gun to their heads \n     and said you have to do this or you will die, you'd just have \n     to kill them.''\n       There is plenty of blame to go around in the Sutton case, \n     legal experts said, and it suggests a need for an independent \n     investigation and systemic reform.\n       ``The criminal justice system in Houston is completely \n     dysfunctional,'' Professor Thompson said. He examined eight \n     DNA cases processed by the Houston police at the request of \n     KHOU-TV, the television station that first called attention \n     to the laboratory's problems in several reports in November.\n       In Mr. Sutton's case, there happened to be a small amount \n     of evidence available for retesting. That is seldom the case \n     in Houston, according to the state's audit.\n       Mr. Sutton's mother, Carol Batie, said her son's main \n     concern on hearing there would be retesting was that so \n     little evidence remained available.\n       ``We were concerned it would come back inconclusive,'' Mr. \n     Batie said.\n       Mr. Bailey, the state representative, said the Sutton case \n     should change the usual presumptions in cases where retesting \n     is impossible. ``Unless there is other strong corroborative \n     evidence,'' he said, ``those people at the very least deserve \n     retrials.''\n       The victim in the Sutton case identified him, but her \n     testimony has been questioned. She said she was raped by two \n     men. Both were around 5 feet 7 inches tall, she said; one \n     weighed 135 pounds, the other weighed 120.\n       Five days later, she saw several men on the street and \n     identified two of them as her attackers. DNA evidence \n     excluded one man at the time, meaning one of her two \n     identifications was demonstrably mistaken from the start. Mr. \n     Sutton, moreover, is 5 foot 10 and weighs more than 200 \n     pounds.\n       The Sutton case, said David Dow, a University of Houston \n     law professor who represents death row inmates in capital \n     appeals, ``is probably the tip of the iceberg.''\n       ``There were two different problems in the crime lab--\n     scientific incompetence and corruption,'' Professor Dow said. \n     ``That's a deadly combination. Once you have corruption, \n     there is no reason to think that this is limited to DNA cases \n     or cases where there is scientific evidence of any sort.''\n       ``If this were a death penalty case,'' he added, ``Sutton \n     may well have been executed by now.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 1, 2003]\n\n     Tex. Lawmakers Probe Lab Over Reports of Tainted DNA Evidence\n\n                          (By Karin Brulliard)\n\n       Austin, Feb. 28.--The Texas Legislature has launched an \n     inquiry into the operations of the Houston Police crime lab \n     after reports that the lab's shoddy facilities and faulty \n     practices may have led to contamination of DNA evidence in \n     hundreds of cases.\n       An independent audit by the state in December uncovered the \n     problems. In January, police officials suspended DNA testing \n     at the lab, and the Harris County District Attorney's office \n     began a review of all cases that involved evidence processed \n     there.\n       So far, the DNA from at least 14 convictions will be \n     retested because of information secured during the reviews, \n     said District Attorney Charles A. Rosenthal Jr. At least \n     three involve death row cases.\n       Houston is in Harris County, which has sent more people to \n     death row than any other county in Texas.\n       ``It's a serious, serious problem,'' said state Rep. Kevin \n     Bailey, a Democrat from Houston who is chairman of the House \n     General Investigating Committee, which will hold hearings on \n     the lab next week. ``The public has a right to expect a fair \n     and accurate analysis\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\n     by a metropolitan crime lab. When we find out that we've not \n     had that, it causes people to question the whole criminal \n     justice system.''\n       In the December audit, a team of forensic scientists \n     detailed problems that included inadequate recordkeeping, \n     poor maintenance of equipment and a leaky roof that it said \n     could lead to contamination of DNA samples.\n       City Councilwoman Carol Alvarado, who toured the facility \n     June 11 after receiving complaints from lab employees, said \n     the roof was in poor shape.\n       ``These were not just leaks; these were holes,'' she said. \n     ``There were trash buckets and water buckets throughout the \n     lab. They were having to move tables around, because some of \n     the leaks were near and sometimes above where the analysis \n     was occurring.''\n       Alvarado said she reported her findings to the council June \n     19, but funding issues prevented the council from awarding a \n     contract for roof repair until January.\n       Houston Police Department spokesman Robert Hurst refused to \n     comment on the lab.\n       Elizabeth Johnson, who directed the Harris County DNA lab \n     until 1996, said water from a leak could taint samples. But \n     she also said the city police lab's problems run deeper than \n     a leaky roof.\n       ``Every single case I ever reviewed of theirs had at least \n     one serious error and sometimes more than one error,'' she \n     said. ``I'm not talking about a typo. I'm talking about \n     things like controls being missing. Most common were that \n     their reports would say one thing, and their data didn't \n     support that at all.''\n       Rosenthal said any DNA retests that reveal errors will lead \n     to new trials.\n       Bailey said the use of DNA evidence from a flawed lab \n     reveals the ``win and get a conviction at all costs'' \n     attitude of the district attorney's office. He wants hearings \n     to determine whether an external review is necessary.\n       ``No innocent people should be convicted because of faulty \n     analysis,'' he said. ``At this point, I'm skeptical as to \n     whether the Houston lab can analyze their own mistakes.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 13, 2003]\n\n  Tex. Execution Stayed at Last Minute--Supreme Court Considers Review\n\n                           (By Charles Lane)\n\n       The Supreme Court granted a last-minute stay of execution \n     last night to a Texas death-row inmate who says he is \n     innocent of the murder of which he was convicted 23 years \n     ago, setting the stage for another high-profile debate at the \n     court over alleged flaws in the U.S. capital punishment \n     system.\n       In a brief order issued about 10 minutes before officials \n     were to administer a lethal injection to Delma Banks Jr., the \n     justices said that he should be kept alive at least long \n     enough for them to consider his request for a full-scale \n     hearing on claims that his 1980 trial in Bowie County, Tex., \n     was marred by prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective defense \n     counsel and racially discriminatory jury selection.\n       Banks, an African American, was convicted of killing a \n     white teenager by an all-white jury. If his execution had \n     proceeded last night, he would have been the 300th person put \n     to death in Texas since the state resumed executions in 1982.\n       It was unclear when the court might meet to consider Banks' \n     petition. Its next scheduled closed-door conference is March \n     21. However, the stay may be a favorable sign for Banks \n     because it required the votes of at least five justices, and \n     a decision to hear his case could be made with the assent of \n     just four justices.\n       Consistent with growing public concern over the possibility \n     of wrongful death sentences, the court has shown interest \n     recently in the issues raised by Banks' appeal, though its \n     rulings have not always come out the way death penalty \n     opponents would have liked.\n       The court ordered a lower court review of another Texas \n     man's death sentence last month, ruling that a case could be \n     made that jury selection at his trial was racially biased; \n     last year, it abolished capital punishment for the mentally \n     retarded. But also last year, the court rebuffed an effort to \n     seek abolition of the death penalty for juveniles and let \n     Virginia proceed with the execution of a murderer who had \n     been represented at trial by the murder victim's former \n     lawyer.\n       ``Delma Banks Jr., who has maintained his innocence from \n     the beginning, found justice in the courts today, and we are \n     hopeful that this delay will allow a meaningful review of the \n     serious claims in his case,'' Banks' lawyer, George Kendall \n     of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, said in a \n     prepared statement. ``The court's decision to stay the \n     execution in order to potentially hear the significant claims \n     put before it demonstrates that our tribunals will not turn a \n     blind eye to egregious miscarriages of justice.''\n       Bobby Lockhart, district attorney of Bowie County, said, \n     ``Factually, [Banks] was guilty, and legally the jury found \n     him guilty. As to the death penalty, that's up to the Supreme \n     Court. I think that the Supreme court will review the case \n     and find that he was guilty, and I think there's no way the \n     stay [of execution] will be extended beyond 30 days.''\n       Banks' case has attracted attention in part because of the \n     supporters who have rallied to his cause, including former \n     FBI director William S. Sessions and two former federal \n     appeals court judges.\n       In a brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of \n     Banks' request for a stay, Sessions and his colleagues said \n     that the Banks case is tainted by ``uncured constitutional \n     errors'' that are ``typical of those that have undermined \n     public confidence in the fairness of our capital punishment \n     system.''\n       Banks, then 21, was convicted in 1980 of shooting his co-\n     worker Richard Wayne Whitehead, 16, to death with a .25-\n     caliber handgun.\n       Banks' lawyers argue that prosecutors wrongfully suppressed \n     evidence that one of their key witnesses, who has since \n     recanted, lied on the stand. Banks' attorneys also argue that \n     his inexperienced defense lawyers offered little evidence to \n     counter prosecutors' claims that Banks deserved the death \n     penalty, even though he had no previous criminal record.\n       Prosecutors kept African Americans off the jury, they \n     contend, producing the all-white panel that convicted Banks \n     and sentenced him to death in the course of two days of legal \n     proceedings.\n       No physical evidence linked Banks to the crime. But Banks \n     was the last person seen with Whitehead, and prosecutors said \n     their case against him is strong. Last week, the New Orleans-\n     based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, reversing a \n     federal district judge's ruling in favor of Banks, permitted \n     his execution to proceed, on the grounds that the alleged \n     flaws in his trial were not substantial enough to have \n     changed the outcome.\n       The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals this week refused to \n     block Banks' execution, and the Texas Board of Pardons and \n     Paroles would not hear his plea because it was filed too \n     late.\n       Because of the prolonged appeals process in his case, Banks \n     has been on death row while Texas conducted 299 executions, \n     the most of any state since the Supreme Court permitted \n     states to resume capital punishment in 1976.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3720-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3720-S3721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleagues on the \nSenate Commerce Committee for unanimously passing the language of the \nArming Cargo Pilots Terrorism Act as an amendment to the Air Cargo \nSecurity Act.\n  As was made so terribly clear on September 11, 2001, we must be ready \nfor terrorist threats in places and times we never before thought we \nwould. Congress has acted deliberately to increase our security and \nmake it harder for terrorists to repeat the destruction of September \n11.\n  One step Congress took was to arm pilots of commercial aircraft who \nvolunteered for a rigorous training program. At the last minute, \ncommercial cargo pilots were left out of the program while their \ncounterparts flying for commercial passenger carriers were armed. That \nmakes no sense because cargo pilots fly the same planes with the same \nor larger fuel loads as the passenger aircraft that were hijacked on \nSeptember 11.\n  Last week, I introduced the Arming Cargo Pilots Against Terrorism Act \nto close that dangerous loophole. Today, Senator Boxer offered our bill \nas an amendment in the Commerce Committee and it passed unanimously. I \nthank her for all her hard work on this issue and I thank the Commerce \nCommittee for acting expeditiously.\n  I am hopeful this bill soon become law and the loophole will be \nclosed. We need to protect our cargo pilots and the general public from \nany possible threat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3721-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE ASSASSINATION OF SERBIAN PRIME MINISTER ZORAN DJINDJIC\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, when Zoran Djindjic was assassinated in \nBelgrade yesterday, Serbia and the world lost a champion of freedom who \ngave his life in service to it. We mourn his death and condemn his \nassassins' attempt to destroy democratic rule in a country that was \nonly recently liberated from Slobodan Milosevic's tyranny, but had \nalready come so far.\n  I first heard about Zoran Djindjic in 1996 when he took to the \nstreets of Belgrade with hundreds of thousands of Serbs to force \nMilosevic to accept local election results. He was victorious in that \nbattle. It took him four more years of hard and dangerous work to \ndefeat Milosevic at the polls and in the streets.\n  The Serbian revolution of 2000 showed the world that democracy can \nsucceed, in the Balkans as elsewhere, if leaders are wise, persistent, \nand courageous. The Milosevic government was the last Balkan \ndictatorship to fall. Zoran Djindjic was the person pushing hardest at \nthe pillars of the authoritarian state. Once he became Prime Minister, \nhe made the tough decisions to transform Serbia from dictatorship to \ndemocratic republic. He sent Milosevic to The Hague, despite fierce \ninternal opposition; he implemented critical economic and political \nreforms; and recently he had begun to aggressively fight organized \ncrime. It was one battle too many.\n  Those who would corrupt and destroy democracy in Serbia presumably \nhope by their actions to extinguish the Serbian people's aspirations to \nlive under rule of law and in liberty as part of a secure and \nprosperous Europe. They have failed. Killing one man will not stop \nreform or diminish the passion of Serbs to be part of the European \nfamily of free nations. I hope it will only invigorate Zoran Djindjic's \nmany followers to carry on the struggle they began together in the dark \ndays of Milosevic's rule.\n  Our prayers are with the Djindjic family, his colleagues in the \nDemocratic Opposition of Serbia, and the Serbian nation. To the people \nof Serbia, we say: Please continue to fight for those principles your \nPrime Minister represented with honor, skill, and courage. He will be \nwritten into the history of a very difficult time. His name will be \nknown for the freedom he helped bring to a long-suffering people. \nAmerica salutes a fallen hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3721-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3721-S3722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JACKSON-VANIK\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, nearly three decades ago, a small provision \nwas included in the Trade Act of 1974. While relatively small in number \nof words, this provision, known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment, helped \nopen up an entire society.\n  Three decades ago, during the height of the Soviet Union's power, \nSenator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson and Representative Charles Vanik \nintroduced legislation that exposed the repressive tactics of the \nSoviet Union. By focusing attention on the emigration restrictions that \nthe Soviet Union placed on its Jewish citizens, the Jackson-Vanik \namendment reiterated American concern about the wide-scale human rights \nabuses occurring in the Soviet Union. In the process, the Jackson-Vanik \namendment played a vital role in changing Soviet society.\n  Now, as the cold war recedes further into the past, it is time for \nRussia to be ``graduated'' from Jackson-Vanik. Because of the \npersistence of the Jackson-Vanik requirements, the administration must \nreport semi-annually on the Russian Federation's compliance with the \nfreedom of emigration requirements. This reporting requirement is a \nsource of much frustration and embarrassment to our Russian friends, a \nfact that is made clear to me whenever I meet with individuals or \ngroups from Russia.\n  Russia has made great progress in reforming itself. Since 1994, \nconsecutive administrations have noted that the Russian Federation has \nbeen found to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration \nrequirements under Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974. In this time, the \nUnited States has signed a bilateral trade agreement with Russia, and \nthe Bush Administration according to its website ``has begun \nconsultations with Congress and interested groups on the possibility of \ngraduating Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union from \nthe provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.'' Graduating Russia from \nJackson-Vanik at this time will improve our relations with Russia while \nenabling us to reflect upon the courage of Soviet Jewry and the success \nof this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Mr. \nLeonid Nevzlin, former President of the Russian Jewish Congress and a \ncurrent member of the Russian Senate, be printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n[[Page S3722]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. This letter states that ``there should be no doubt that \nthe Jewish community believes the Jackson-Vanik requirements have been \nmet in terms of immigration and freedom of movement in today's \nRussia.''\n  This bill, which Senator Baucus is introducing and which I am pleased \nto co-sponsor, would enhance relations between the United States and \nRussia. While recognizing the advances made by Russia, the legislation \nalso ensures that Congress can continue to play a meaningful role in \naddressing trade disputes with Russia and in setting the terms of World \nTrade Organization, WTO, accession for Russia.\n  While this legislation grants Permanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR, \nto the Russian Federation, it does not abrogate the rights of Congress \nto comment on Russia's accession to the WTO nor does it remain silent \nabout the need for continued progress by the Russian Federation with \nregard to human rights matters.\n  The Jackson-Vanik amendment was but one part of the Trade Act of 1974 \nthat addressed trade with nonmarket economies. Recognizing the trade \npolicy aspects of ``graduating'' a country from Jackson-Vanik, Congress \nhas traditionally granted PNTR to a country subject to Jackson-Vanik \nonly at the time of its accession to the WTO. This practice has given \nCongress the ability to voice its approval for the terms by which a \nnation accedes to the WTO. The terms for Russia's WTO accession are \nstill being discussed, and even though this legislation would provide \nPNTR for Russia before those terms are final it also provides Congress \nwith the means to comment on those terms and voice its approval or \ndisapproval for them.\n  This legislation addresses the concerns of the Jackson-Vanik \nAmendment while preserving Congress' ability to play a key role in \ndiscussions about Russia's accession to the WTO. In a piece encouraging \nthe ending of Jackson-Vanik's applicability for Russia, the Israel \nPolicy Forum stated that: ``things change. Old empires disappear. Old \nenemies become new friends. History's challenge is to anticipate its \ndirection and move along with it.''\n  This legislation recognizes the profound changes wrought by the \nJackson-Vanik Amendment while acknowledging our need to move forward as \nwe continue to engage with Russia on matters of human rights and trade.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    June 27, 2002.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am pleased we had an opportunity to \n     meet when I was in Washington, DC last week. Your long-\n     standing interest to promoting closer working relationships \n     between the U.S. Senate and the Russian parliament is much \n     appreciated.\n       As promised, I am sending a copy of my letter, as president \n     of the Russian Jewish Congress, to Presidents Bush and Putin \n     expressing support for repeal of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. \n     I prepared the letter some time ago and it is surprising that \n     more people in the U.S. Senate were unaware that it had been \n     sent. There should be no doubt that the Jewish community \n     believes the Jackson-Vanik requirements have been met in \n     terms of immigration and freedom of movement in today's \n     Russia.\n       I have also taken note of your concerns about the sale of \n     dual use technology to Iran and Iraq. In this regard, as you \n     recall I proposed in our meeting that our two chambers \n     establish a framework to assess how we can both develop \n     greater cooperation on matters of mutual concern. I am very \n     pleased that both you and Chairman Biden encouraged me to \n     develop such a framework and look forward to working with \n     both of you to see that this is accomplished.\n       On another matter, I know of your interest in reducing \n     America's dependence on oil shipments from Middle East \n     countries and though you would like to know that Russian oil \n     company YUKOS, will be delivering the first load of Russian \n     oil to Houston, Texas soon. I am confident that Russia could \n     be a reliable supplier and would welcome the opportunity to \n     work with you and others in Congress on initiatives that \n     would encourage this development.\n       It is my hope to build a closer working relationship with \n     select members of the U.S. Senate in order to take a fresh \n     approach to a new set of challenges that beset both our \n     countries.\n       In recognition of the upcoming celebration of America's \n     Independence Day on July 4, I extend my best wishes to you, \n     as representative of the people, for your country's \n     remarkable achievement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Leonid Nevzlin,\n            Senator, Deputy Chairman of the Committee for Foreign \n     Affairs, Council of Federation of Russian Parliament.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3722-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3722-S3723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COVER THE UNINSURED WEEK\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, this week is \nCover the Uninsured Week in America. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation \nand a host of other organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the AFL-CIO, and AARP, have come together, recognizing that \nwe can delay no longer in addressing this critical issue. Like them, I \nbelieve that Congress should seize this opportunity to reaffirm its \ncommitment to bringing high quality, affordable, and stable health \ncoverage within reach of the 41 million Americans who now go without.\n  Health insurance coverage is the best predictor of access to health \ncare in America today; yet, despite its importance, more than 41 \nmillion Americans remain uninsured, and 75 million Americans under 65 \nyears of age--three out of every 10--were uninsured at some point \nduring the past two years. Experts estimate that this number will \nincrease by 1 to 3 million people this year as the economic downturn \ncontinues. In our state alone, 436,000 people sought Oregon Health Plan \ncoverage last year--a 14 percent increase since 2000.\n  I know we can reverse this trend because we have done it in the past. \nDuring my first year in the U.S. Senate, I helped create the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. That program provides \ncoverage for needy children who do not qualify for the Oregon Health \nPlan. Today, all 50 States have SCHIP programs providing for 4.6 \nmillion children. And in 2001, Oregon's SCHIP program provided health \ncoverage to over 41,000 needy children.\n  While we in Congress debate the ways in which legislators can help \ntackle this difficult problem, people all over the country are acting \non their own to help bring health services and a better quality of life \nto countless vulnerable Americans. During Cover the Uninsured Week I \nwould like to tell you about one person from my own state of Oregon \nwhom I consider to be a true ``Health Care Hero.'' Mr. Ian Timm is a \nman who has truly made a difference to the lives and health of many \nOregonians.\n  Mr. Timm is well known as an effective advocate bringing health \nservices to Oregon's needy. Whether serving on the Oregon Rural Health \nAssociation board, chairing the Oregon Statewide Health Coordinating \nCouncil, or providing leadership as a Linn County Commissioner, Mr. \nTimm has dedicated his professional life to making a difference in the \nlives of others. He is well known for providing both vision and \nstructure to Oregon's efforts to provide quality health services for \nchildren and families. Because of his work, young children receive \nimmunizations, mothers have quality pre-natal care, and seniors have \nthe attention of physicians, all regardless of their financial status.\n  In Oregon, we have a tradition of taking care of those who cannot \ntake care of themselves--Mr. Timm has been a leader in making this \nvalue a reality. For instance, Mr. Timm's vision led to the development \nof Care Oregon, which provides health coverage for thousands of \nOregonians as the largest insurer of clients within the Oregon Health \nPlan. He serves on the Oregon Partnership to Immunize Children, \nensuring that Oregon kids receive the preventive care they need. \nThrough his work at the Oregon Primary Care Association, Mr. Timm has \nincreased access to health care by bringing resources to community \nbased health centers. These centers are one of the most effective ways \nto provide health care to those who often drop through the cracks, \npreventing disease and saving lives.\n  But Mr. Timm's service is not limited to our borders. Driven by his \nfaith and concern for others, he has shared his time and talents \noverseas in the Sudan and in Thailand. During the Ethopian refugee \ncrisis, he supervised the construction of camps and provided medical \nand sanitation services for 105,000 refugees. In Thailand, he created \nsanitation programs for 14 refugee camps, and supervised two outpatient \nclinics, public and school health programs, and the Khmer Health \nTraining Center. Few of us are willing to forsake the comforts of home, \nyet Mr. Timm\n\n[[Page S3723]]\n\nvolunteered to bring hope and life to those in the most desperate \ncorners of the globe.\n  Mr. Timm has built both a local and national reputation as an \neffective advocate and distinguished public servant who is a true \nfriend to the poor and vulnerable. This year, Mr. Timm will retire from \nprofessional service, ending his distinguished career as the Executive \nDirector of the Oregon Primary Care Association. He will be sorely \nmissed. But given his record of valuable service, I'm confident he will \ncontinue to make a difference for Oregonians.\n  I salute Ian Timm for his record of accomplishment and tremendous \nlegacy of healthy Oregon children and families. He is the definition of \na Health Care Hero and an example of compassionate service for all of \nus here in Congress and across America.\n  We in the U.S. Senate have a moral obligation to follow Ian Timm's \nexample. In so doing, the 108th Congress can leave its own legacy of \nhealthy children and families. Cover the Uninsured week lasts only 7 \ndays, but I urge my colleagues to continue their personal commitment to \nthis issue throughout their time in public office and beyond. Only with \nthis type of dedication can we truly keep America healthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3723-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UH-60 BLACKHAWK CRASH AT FORT DRUM, NEW YORK\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the loss of 11 brave \nsoldiers killed in a UH-60 Blackhawk crash on the afternoon of Tuesday, \nMarch 11, at Fort Drum, New York. This tragic accident occurred as the \nunit was conducting a routine training exercise. One of the young men \non board, Pfc. Stryder O. Stoutenburg, was from Missoula, MT. He was \nonly 18 and was assigned to Charlie Company, 4th Battalion, 31st \nInfantry Regiment.\n  The other 10 young men killed are: Cpt. Christopher E.

Mejia, both from Charlie Company, 4th Battalion, 31st \nInfantry Regiment.\n  Each and every one of these young men was a patriot and served their \ncountry bravely. My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of \nthese boys. While the cause of the accident remains under \ninvestigation, I have asked to be kept informed of any and all \ndevelopments and am confident that a thorough examination will be \nconducted.\n  Our brave military men and women fully know the risk they take in \ndoing their duty and they meet this risk head on, to ensure that the \nrest of us continue to live with freedom. Tragic accidents such as this \none truly remind us all of the high price of freedom.\n  I will continue working with my colleagues to make sure our troops \nhave the best equipment, instruction, and supplies to ensure their \nsafety not only on the battlefield, but in training exercises as well. \nMay God bless the young soldiers who died training to defend the values \nof this great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3723-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3723-S3724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE PANTHERS' WELL-PRACTICED TRADITION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I want to bring to the Senate's \nattention a group of student athletes in Vermont who have an unusual \nand admirable tradition. For the past 42 years, Middlebury College \nfreshman have helped a Middlebury man with a disability make it to \nfootball and basketball games like clockwork. It is another example \nwhere students' education extends far beyond the walls of a college \nclassroom.\n  In the March 10, 2003, issue of Sports Illustrated, well-known sports \ncolumnist Rick Reilly took a moment to explain the tradition to his \nreaders. Middlebury College has long been recognized as one of the \nNation's finest institutions of higher education. The quality of its \nfaculty, the rigors of coursework, stunning facilities, and the success \nof its athletic programs are the foundation for Middlebury's storied \nhistory and academic reputation. Yet it also is what goes unnoticed \nthat makes this truly a special place--like a tradition that takes \nplace right before the start of every football and basketball game. It \nis a tradition that has come to exemplify what it means to be a \nMiddlebury College Panther, a Vermonter, and a person in full.\n  For the past 42 years, the freshman members of the Middlebury College \nfootball and basketball teams have been going to Butch Varno's house \nbefore the start of the game and literally giving him a lift. Mr. \nVarno, who from infancy has contended with cerebral palsy, is confined \nto a wheelchair and does not drive. On game day, he anticipates the \narrival of a small band of Panthers for a ride to the game, which \nincludes lifting Mr. Varno out of bed and getting him to the bleachers.\n  We in Vermont are proud of the student athletes who make this happen \nbefore each game. Whether they know it or not, they represent the very \nbest of our Nation's college students. They are learning, playing hard \nand, most importantly, caring for others in their community.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of Rick Reilly's column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Sports Illustrated, Mar. 10, 2003]\n\n                              Extra Credit\n\n                            (By Rick Reilly)\n\n       The best college tradition is not dotting the i at Ohio \n     State. It's not stealing the goat from Navy. Or waving the \n     wheat at Kansas.\n       It's Picking Up Butch at Middlebury (Vt.) College.\n       For 42 years Middlebury freshman athletes have been Picking \n     Up Butch for football and basketball games. It's a sign-up \n     sheet thing. Carry the ball bags. Gather all the towels. Pick \n     Up Butch.\n       Basketball players, men and women, do it during football \n     season. Football players do it during basketball season. Two \n     hours before each home game, two freshmen grab whatever car \n     they can get and drive a mile off campus to the tiny house \n     where 54-year-old Butch Varno lives with his 73-year-old \n     mother, Helen, who never got her driver's license. And they \n     literally Pick Up Butch, 5'3'' and 170 pounds, right off his \n     bed.\n       They put him in his wheelchair and push him out of the \n     house, or one guy hauls him in a fireman's carry. They pile \n     him into the car, cram the wheelchair into the trunk, take \n     him to the game and roll him to his spot in the mezzanine for \n     football games or at the end of the bench for basketball.\n       Butch always smiles and says the same thing from the bottom \n     of his heart: ``CP just sucks.'' Cerebral palsy. While his \n     fondest dream has always been to play basketball, it'll never \n     happen. There is little that he can physically do for \n     himself.\n       ``At first, you're a little nervous; you're like, I don't \n     know,'' says freshman wide receiver Ryan Armstrong. ``But the \n     older guys say, `We did it when we were freshmen. Now you go \n     get him. It's tradition.' So me and my buddy got him the \n     first week. He's pretty heavy. We bumped his head a couple of \n     times getting him into the car. He's like, `Hey! Be careful!' \n     But he loves getting out so much that afterward you feel \n     good. It's fun to put a smile like that on somebody's face.''\n       And the kids don't just Pick Up Butch. They also Keep Butch \n     Company. Take Butch to the Bathroom. Feed Butch. ``He always \n     likes a hot dog and a Coke,'' says 6'8'' Clark Read, 19, a \n     power forward. ``It's kind of weird at first, sticking a hot \n     dog in his mouth. The trick is to throw out the last bite so \n     he doesn't get your fingers.''\n       Thanks to 42 years of freshmen, Butch hardly ever misses a \n     Middlebury game. Not that he hasn't been late.\n       ``One day this year, the two guys were calling me on their \n     cell,'' says Armstrong, ``and\n\n[[Page S3724]]\n\n     they're going, `We can't find Butch!' And I'm like, `You lost \n     Butch? How can you lose Butch?' Turns out they just couldn't \n     find his house.''\n       Nobody at Middlebury remembers quite how Picking Up Butch \n     got started, but Butch does. It was 1961. He was 13, and his \n     grandmother, a housekeeper at the dorms, wheeled him to a \n     football game. It started snowing halfway through, and \n     afterward she couldn't push him all the way back home. A \n     student named Roger Ralph asked them if they needed a ride. \n     Ever since then, Butch has been buried in the middle of \n     Middlebury sports.\n       Sometimes he gives the basketball team a pregame speech, \n     which is usually, ``I love you guys.'' He holds the game ball \n     during warmups and at halftime until the refs need it. He is \n     held upright for the national anthem. Once in a while, just \n     before tip-off, they put him in the middle of the players' \n     huddle, where they all touch his head and holler, ``One, two, \n     three, together!'' When the action gets tense, the freshmen \n     hold his hands to keep them from flailing. After the games \n     some of the players come back to the court and help him \n     shuffle a few steps for exercise, until he collapses back in \n     his chair, exhausted. Then it's home again, Butch chirping \n     all the way.\n       And it's not just the athletes at Middlebury who attend to \n     him. Butch is a campus project. Students come by the house \n     and help him nearly every day. Over the years they taught him \n     to read, and then last year they helped him get his GED. \n     Somebody got him a graduation cap and gown to wear at the \n     party they threw in his honor. During his thank-you speech, \n     Butch wept.\n       ``These kids care what happens to me,'' Butch says. ``They \n     don't have to, but they do. I don't know where I'd be without \n     them. Probably in an institution.''\n       But that's not the question. The question is, Where would \n     they be without Butch?\n       ``It makes you think,'' says Armstrong. ``We're all young \n     athletes. Going to a game or playing in a game, we take it \n     for granted. But then you go Pick Up Butch, and I don't know, \n     it makes you feel blessed.''\n       Now comes the worst time of the year--the months between \n     the end of the basketball season, last week, and the start of \n     football in August. ``It stinks,'' Butch says. He sits at \n     home lonely day after day, watching nothing but Boston Red \n     Sox games on TV, waiting for the calendar pages to turn to \n     the days when he can be one, two, three, together again with \n     the students he loves.\n       On that day the door will swing open, and standing there, \n     young and strong, will be two freshmen.

Shaw.\n  Dr. Shaw is retiring this year as president of Shaw University after \na groundbreaking 15 years in which he helped this noble institution \nregain its footing and once again become a beacon of knowledge, \nopportunity and service for the people of North Carolina and beyond.\n  Dr. Shaw was born in Jamaica, the ninth of 10 children. He served as \na minister in Jamaica and the Bahamas before moving to the U.S. in the \n1950s. After earning his master's degree and doctorate in ethics from \nthe University of Chicago, Dr. Shaw taught religion and ethics for 10 \nyears before becoming interim dean of the Howard University Divinity \nSchool in Washington D.C. He then served as dean of arts and sciences \nat Morgan State University for 11 years.\n  Dr. Shaw left his comfortable position at Morgan to heed an urgent \ncall from Shaw University, the oldest historically black university in \nthe South. The University had fallen on hard times and was in dire \nfinancial trouble. The school had no endowment, there was not enough \nmoney to pay day-to-day expenses. Enrollment was down. No one would \nhave blamed him if he had passed up this challenge. But he didn't pass \nit up--he took it on.\n  Rallying students, faculty, and the community with his slogan \n``Strides to Excellence: Why Not the Best,'' Dr. Shaw worked tirelessly \nto turn around the school's fortunes. And thanks to his leadership, \nShaw University is once again a shining light. Enrollment is up, debts \nare paid and the endowment is now $15 million. Seventy percent of the \nfaculty have Ph.Ds. Because of his belief that ``education of the heart \nis just as important as the education of the heads and hands,'' he has \nincorporated values and ethics into the Shaw curriculum. Thanks to the \nefforts of Dr. Shaw and his outstanding faculty and staff, Shaw \nstudents are receiving an education second to none.\n  Dr. Shaw has also found time to contribute to the community. Among \nother things, he serves on the board of the Wade Edwards Learning \nLaboratory, an after-school program that my wife and I started and has \noffered invaluable service to the young people we serve.\n  We are sorry to see Dr. Shaw leave but we in North Carolina wish him \nand his wife, Marlene, many, many years of happiness and health as they \ntake on future challenges together.\n  In striving for excellence, Dr. Shaw asked, ``why not the best?'' \nFortunately, that's just what he gave us. Thank you, Dr. Shaw, for a \njob well done. You are an inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3724-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3724-S3725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMENDING THE HUMANITARIAN WORK OF JOHN VAN HENGEL\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great \nAmerican, a man whose tireless efforts on behalf of needy people \neverywhere are an inspiration to us all. February 21 of this year \nmarked the 80th birthday of my constituent, John van Hengel, who has \nbecome known as the ``Father of Food Banking.'' His vision for feeding \nthe hungry and his work making that vision a reality has made a \ntremendous difference in the lives of millions of people.\n  John van Hengel's work is a testament to the ability of one person to \nchange the world for the better. In 1965, John was a businessman who \nvolunteered some of his spare time to the St. Vincent de Paul Society \nin Phoenix, AZ. In the course of his volunteer work, John saw there was \na need for additional food for the Society's soup kitchen. In the \ncourse of his work, John met a woman who had to collect food from \ngrocery store garbage bins to feed her 10 children. That needy mother \ntold John that there should be a place where surplus food could be \nstored and available to people who needed it, instead of being thrown \nout and wasted. As he looked around for ways to better serve the needy \npeople he met, John noticed that fruit was being left unpicked on \nsuburban backyard trees around Phoenix. John recruited volunteers to \ngather fruit that remained in area fields after harvesting. He then \ndelivered these much needed fruits and vegetables to various local \nchurches. With John's leadership, one of the Nation's first \n``gleaning'' projects became a reality.\n  John recruited the local grocery stores and asked them to donate \nsurplus food. John also approached his local church, and the church \nresponded by loaning John $3,000 and an abandoned building. In 1967, \nJohn van Hengel founded the world's first food bank, named St. Mary's \nin honor of the church that housed it. Thus was born the first food \nbank and the concept of food banking--a central source for food \ndonations and distribution to a wide range of local charitable agencies \nthat feed the hungry.\n  After the creation of the St. Mary's Food Bank, John founded Second \nHarvest in 1976. With the help of private donations and State and \nFederal grants, John helped to set up and develop Second Harvest food \nbanks in other nearby communities in Arizona, California, and other \nStates. The success of these new food banks led to Second Harvest \nbecoming formally incorporated in 1979. Today, it is known as America's \nSecond Harvest, the Nation's largest hunger relief charity and a \nnationwide network of more than 200 regional food banks and good rescue \norganizations that provide food and other services to more than 50,000 \nlocal charitable agencies.\n  In 1982, John van Hengel stepped down from his full-time role at \nSecond Harvest to pursue his work of spreading food banking \ninternationally. In 1984, John van Hengel founded Food Banking, Inc., a \nnonprofit food bank consulting organization. John helped spread the \nnotion of food banking and volunteerism in an international capacity, \nfirst in Canada through the creation of the Canadian Association of \nFood Banks, then to France, and to Belgium. Today, the Federation of \nEuropean Food Banks meets regularly to discuss experiences and ways to \nexpand the work of its members. Recently, the idea of food banking has \nspread to Brazil, Israel, Mexico, and Japan. John van Hengel's vision, \nfirst articulated\n\n[[Page S3725]]\n\nand acted upon in Phoenix in 1967, is the first link in an \ninternational chain of food banks and compassion for the neediest among \nus.\n  John van Hengel's food banking idea is simple, but like all truly \ngreat ideas, it took the efforts of one man working for a lifetime to \nreach fruition. Because John van Hengel was the need to help hungry \npeople, he created a concept to address that need. Dozens of countries \nand millions of people now have a powerful weapon against hunger.\n  In the wake of his 80th birthday, it is a privilege in honor John van \nHengel for his noble dedication to feeding the hungry. His vision and \nleadership continue to greatly impact the lives of millions throughout \nthe United States and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3725-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO CRAIG STALKER-TROOPER OF THE YEAR IN SOUTHERN REGION\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in the Senate to \nhonor and pay tribute to Kentucky State Police Trooper Craig Stalker \nfor being named the Southern Region Trooper of the Year.\n  This honor was bestowed upon Trooper Stalker by the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police. Trooper Stalker was nominated for this \nprestigious award after he rescued several people from two burning cars \nin Johnson County, KY, while off duty. After receiving this distinction \nhe was presented with a 35-pound eagle trophy.\n  The citizens of eastern Kentucky are fortunate to have Trooper \nStalker protecting their communities. His example of leadership, hard \nwork, and compassion should be an inspiration to all throughout the \nCommonwealth.\n  Congratulations, Trooper Stalker for receiving this award. Trooper \nStalker is just one of the many Kentucky State Police officers which \nput others before themselves by vowing to protect and serve \nKentuckians. They have earned our admiration and respect, and for this \nwe will always be grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3725-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF DR. LLOYD OGILVIE\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, since 1995 Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie has \nprovided exceptional spiritual leadership to the Senate family. Serving \nas chaplain for 8 years, Dr. Ogilvie daily guided and counseled Members \nand staff with encouragement, support, and wisdom.\n  I will miss Dr. Ogilvie. Lloyd Ogilvie has led the Senate family and \nNation through difficult situations, including the shooting deaths of \nCapitol Hill police officers J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson; \nthe impeachment of our President; the deaths of three Senate Members, \nPaul Wellstone, John Chafee, and Paul Coverdell; the tragic terrorist \nattack on 9/11; the attack of anthrax on the Senate; and the current \npossibility of war.\n  His leadership and counsel have stayed Senate Members, spouses, and \nstaff. I thank Dr. Ogilvie for his daily prayers. He offered us \nspiritual leadership through his weekly Bible study for Senators, and \nalways made himself available--at any time of the day--as a source of \nprayer and counsel. Chaplain Ogilvie also hosted a weekly Bible study \nfor Senate spouses.\n  Chaplain Ogilvie also made himself available to staff. He welcomed \nstaff to his office, responded to electronic mail from staff, and \ntaught an inspirational study every Friday for Senate staff. Dr. \nOgilvie also made an effort to stimulate relationship with the \nWashington community. He made information available to staff about \nopportunities to serve Washington-based charities, and he made the \nSenate aware of Senate and community groups to help Senate staff \nstrengthen their lives morally and spiritually. Dr. Ogilvie also \noffered himself to minister and speak to the local Washington \ncommunity.\n  While serving in the Senate, I have been encouraged and blessed by \nChaplain Ogilvie and I am pleased the Senate chose him as our Chaplain. \nHis friendship and counsel have served the Senate well and Washington \nwill miss his presence.\n  My wife Joan and I give you and Mary Jane our warmest thoughts and \nour prayers as you return home to California. We will continue to pray \nfor you and your family. We thank you for your service and ministry to \nus and wish you and your family God's best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3725-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred October 20, \n2001 in San Diego, CA. An Afghani taxicab driver was attacked by one of \nhis passengers. According to police, after getting in the cab, the \npassenger asked the cab driver for his nationality. After the driver \nanswered, a heated argument ensued. When the cab stopped, the passenger \ngot out and put his hands around the driver's throat and struck him \nwith his fist.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3725-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REAUTHORIZING THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in 1994 President Clinton signed \ninto law a ban on the production of certain semiautomatic assault \nweapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. The 1994 law banned a \nlist of 19 specific weapons as well as a number of other weapons \nincorporating certain design characteristics. This law is scheduled to \nsunset on September 13, 2004.\n  Last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General \nJohn Ashcroft indicated the Bush administration's support for the \ncurrent ban on assault weapons, but refused to support reauthorization \nof the ban. I believe we should not only reauthorize this bill, but \nstrengthen it. I hope the Bush Administration will support \nreauthorization.\n  According to National Institute for Justice statistics cited by the \nBrady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the assault weapons ban has \nsuccessfully reduced the use of assault weapons in crime. According to \nthe report, crime gun traces for assault weapons declined by 20 percent \nthe first year after the ban took effect from 4,077 in 1994 to 3,268 in \n1995. Comparatively, trace requests on all crime guns decreased by only \n11 percent over the same period of time.\n  Even with the success of the ban, assault weapons still pose a threat \nto community safety. In 1994, every major national law enforcement \norganization, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National \nSheriff's Association, and the Major City Police Chiefs Association, \nsupported the Federal assault weapons ban. I expect that law \nenforcement will again support this important piece of gun and \ncommunity safety legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the President to support the \nreauthorization of this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3725-5", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3725-S3726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO KENT KRESA\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize an outstanding leader of American industry, \nKent Kresa, upon his retirement. For the past 13 years, Mr. Kresa has \npresided over Northrop Grumman Corporation as its chairman and CEO.\n  Under his guidance, Northrop Grumman grew from a mid-sized defense \ncompany known primarily for aircraft building to a full-spectrum major \ndefense firm. The Northrop Grumman that Mr. Kresa refashioned is home \nto 120,000 employees located in all 50 States and has operations in 25 \nforeign countries.\n  It is my privilege to commend Mr. Kresa for a career that helped \nmodernize our defense industrial base and that significantly bolstered \nour national security.\n  Mr. Kresa was born in New York City and raised on Long Island. He \nreceived his education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, \nearning a bachelor's degree in 1959 and post-graduate degrees in 1961 \nand 1966, all in aeronautics and astronautics.\n\n[[Page S3726]]\n\n  Before joining Northrop Grumman, Mr. Kresa served with the Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency, where he was responsible for applied \nresearch and development programs in the tactical and strategic defense \narena. From 1961-68 he was associated with the Lincoln Laboratory at \nM.I.T., where he worked on ballistic missile defense research and re-\nentry technology.\n  During his distinguished career, Mr. Kresa received many of \nindustry's and the government's most prestigious honors. In January, \nForbes Magazine featured him on their cover and named Northrop Grumman \nthe Company of the Year. In 2002, Mr. Kresa was awarded the Ellis \nIsland Medal of Honor for his significant contributions to our nation's \nheritage. He received the Navy League's Admiral Chester W. Nimitz Award \nfor outstanding support of the U.S. Navy.\n  Also last year, he was named president for a 1-year term of the \nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. And he was \npresented the California Institute of Technology's Management \nAssociation's Excellence in Management Award for demonstrating \nextraordinary vision and leadership.\n  In 2001, BusinessWeek magazine selected Mr. Kresa as one of the \nNation's Top 25 managers. That same year he received the Private Sector \nCouncil's Leadership Award for his commitment to improving governmental \nefficiency. In May 2000, the Aerospace Historical Society presented Mr. \nKresa with the International von Krmn Wings award for \nhis contributions to the industry. And in March of 2000, the California \nManufacturers and Technology Association named Mr. Kresa and Northrop \nGrumman a Manufacturer of the Century.\n  Other honors include Honorary Fellow by the American Institute of \nAeronautics and Astronautics in 1998; California Industrialist of the \nYear in 1996, by the California Museum of Science and Industry and the \nCalifornia Museum Foundation; the Navy League of New York's Admiral \nJohn J. Bergen Leadership Award in 1995; and the Air Force \nAssociation's John R. Alison Award for Industrial Leadership in 1994.\n  During Mr. Kresa's tenure at DARPA, he received the Arthur D. \nFlemming Award as one of the top 10 people in the U.S. Government in \n1975; the Navy's Meritorious Public Service Citation the same year; and \nSecretary of Defense Meritorious Civilian Service Medal in 1974.\n  While impressive, this partial list of honors only begins to tell the \nstory of Mr. Kresa's contributions to the defense industry and this \ncountry.\n  After joining Northrop in 1975, he was responsible for innovations in \nstealth and surveillance aircraft, such as the revolutionary B-2 \nstealth bomber. He was named president of the company in 1987, and CEO \nand chairman of the board in 1990.\n  Within the next few years, he embarked upon a decade-long effort that \nwould not only transform Northrop Grumman but also make the company a \nmajor force in changing the nature of the defense business.\n  He and his staff foresaw that a post-cold war defense establishment \nwould require a very different array of products and services, that \nAmerica's military of the future would rely on systems and integrated \nnetworks to tremendously enhance the capabilities of its platforms. He \nworked tirelessly to help the Department of Defense achieve this vision \nof interconnected platforms working together to greatly increase the \nsituational awareness and speed of engagement of our military forces.\n  To build a company that could better support the new direction of the \nDepartment of Defense, Mr. Kresa and his staff acquired 16 other major \nfirms, many of them legends in their own right. These included Grumman, \nWestinghouse, Logicon, Litton Industries, Newport News Shipbuilding, \nand, most recently, TRW.\n  ``This Amalgamation of great companies,'' to quote Mr. Kresa, created \na corporate structure that has led to new efficiencies and much \ncreative collaboration. Today, for instance, Navy ships can be built \nfrom top to bottom as well as networked with other platforms simply \nthrough the joint efforts of Northrop Grumman experts in information \ntechnology, avionics, satellite communications and other areas.\n  Mr. Kresa and was also instrumental in developing and gaining \nCongressional approval for several key platforms that will help form \nthe backbone of our 21st century military. These include the Joint \nStrike Fighter, the DDX family of destroyers, cruisers and littoral \ncombat ships, and the new generation of Coast Guard ships and aircraft \nknown as the Deepwater project.\n  As Mr. Kresa moves on to exciting new challenges I wish him, his wife \nJoyce, and their daughter Kiren, every success and happiness.\n  For more than 42 years, Mr. Kresa has worked relentlessly in pushing \nfor greater innovation, efficiency and readiness within our great \nNation's defense establishment. My office will remember Mr. Kresa for \nhis loyalty, dedicated service, and accomplishments--and we thank \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3726-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OUTSTANDING RHODE ISLANDER\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Rhode Islander, Jimmy McDonnell, who is celebrating his \nretirement from the Biltmore Hotel after 45 years of dedicated service.\n  Since his earnest beginnings in 1948 as a busboy in the Town Room \nRestaurant, Jimmy McDonnell has exemplified great professionalism, \nboundless enthusiasm, and is today an institution in Rhode Island's \nhospitality industry. Jimmy McDonnell is synonymous with the Biltmore \nHotel, located in the heart of the capital city of Providence.\n  As a waiter, manager, and director of catering service at the \nBiltmore Hotel for over five decades, he has become a hallmark of one \nof Rhode Island's finest institutions. Over his long and industrious \ncareer Jimmy McDonnell has attended to the needs of people from all \nwalks of life--from Presidents and foreign heads of state, to CEOs and \npoliticians, to television and movie celebrities and even to rock \nstars. Jimmy has been in the center of the Rhode Island restaurant and \nhotel industry and is well known to our community's most distinguished \nresidents and visitors. Synonymous with the finest in service, Jimmy \nhas, through his professionalism, skills and graciousness, always put \nRhode Island's best foot forward and illuminated the kindness and \ngenerosity of our great State.\n  In addition to celebrities, he has touched the lives of virtually \nhundreds of Rhode Islanders and their families. He oversaw countless \nsocial events and charitable endeavors and he was ``the person'' to \nwhom you entrusted the details of your son's bar mitzvah or who made \nsure your daughter's wedding went according to plan. He helped make \ncherished memories for so many, and his good heart and hard work \nfootnoted many special events in our State and in our lives.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the Iran emergency is to continue in \neffect beyond March 15, 2003, to the Federal Register for publication. \nThe most recent notice continuing this emergency was published in the \nFederal Register on March 14, 2002 (67 FR 11553).\n  The crisis between the United States and Iran constituted by the \nactions and policies of the Government of Iran, including its support \nfor international terrorism, efforts to undermine Middle East peace, \nand acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to \ndelivery them, that led to the declaration of a national emergency on \nMarch 15, 1995, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are \ncontrary to the interests of the United States in the region and pose a \ncontinuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, I \nhave determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency \ndeclared with respect to Iran and maintain in force comprehensive \nsanctions against Iran to respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \ngold, silver, and platinum, in either coin or bar form, in the same \nmanner as stocks and bonds for purposes of the maximum capital gains \nrate for individuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last Congress, I introduced the Fair \nTreatment for Precious Metals Investors Act to correct a flawed capital \ngains tax definition, which includes precious metals investments as \n``collectibles.'' This simple flaw in the tax code has discouraged \ninvestments in gold and other precious metals for nearly fifteen years. \nI rise today to reintroduce the Fair Treatment for Precious Metals \nInvestors Act to correct this problem.\n  My State, Nevada, is the third largest producer of gold in the world \nbehind Australia and South Africa. Largely because of Nevada's exports, \nAmerica enjoys a good trade surplus of more than $1 billion. U.S. gold \nis purchased around the world in financial markets from London to \nZurich to Hong Kong.\n  Historically, precious metals investments derived their value from \ntheir rarity. Today, however, precious metals coins and bars are \nspecifically designed and produced by governments to be used as an \ninvestment vehicle for those commodities similar to stocks and bonds. \nMy legislation will correct the outdated tax classification of precious \nmetal bullion and apply to precious metals holdings the same capital \ngains tax treatment as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.\n  In 1997 and 1998, The Taxpayer Relief Act and the Internal Revenue \nService Restructuring and Reform Act set two basic types of capital \ngains tax rates: short-term capital gains, which are taxed at between \n15 and 39.6 percent, and long-term capital gains which are taxed at a \nmaximum rate of 20 percent. Long-term capital gains attributable to \ninvestments defined as ``collectibles'', (vintage wines, rare coins, \nand the like), however, are taxed at a maximum rate of 28 percent. \nAlthough precious metal bullion coins are intended to be used as \ninvestments in the precious metals they contain, they are still \nclassified as ``collectibles'', and are taxed at the 28 percent maximum \nrate. The Taxpayer Relief Act allowed precious metal bullion coins held \nin IRA accounts to be taxed at the same rate as stocks and other \ncapital assets. The bill I introduce today would treat all precious \nmetal investments with the same tax equity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 611\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Treatment for Precious \n     Metals Investors Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GOLD, SILVER, AND PLATINUM TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER \n                   AS STOCKS AND BONDS FOR MAXIMUM CAPITAL GAINS \n                   RATE FOR INDIVIDUALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 1(h)(6) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to definition of \n     collectibles gain and loss) is amended by striking ``without \n     regard to paragraph (3) thereof'' and inserting ``without \n     regard to so much of paragraph (3) thereof as relates to \n     palladium and the bullion requirement for physical possession \n     by a trustee''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2002.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 612. A bill to revise the boundary of the Glen Canyon National \nRecreation Area in the States of Utah and Arizona; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Glen \nCanyon National Recreation Area Boundary Revision Act.''\n  This legislation will revise the total acreage within the National \nRecreation Area's, NRA, boundary to reflect the actual acreage within \nthe NRA, and it will also do much to protect the scenic view of Lake \nPowell as seen by those traveling along U.S. Highway Route 89.\n  As enacted into law, the enabling legislation for the Glen Canyon \nNational Recreation Area, inaccurately reflected the acreage within the \nNRA boundary. This legislation would correct the acreage ceiling by \nestimating the acreage within the NRA to be 1,256,000 instead of \n1,236,880.\n  Secondly, this bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior, to \nexchange 320 NRA acres for 152 acres of privately owned land in Kane \nCounty, UT. Currently, Page One L.L.C. owns 152 acres between U.S. \nHighway 89 and the southwestern shore of Lake Powell. This private land \nprovides a breathtaking view of Lake Powell from Highway 89, which is \nthe main viewshed corridor between the highway and the lake. This land \nalso encompasses three highway access rights-of-way and a developed \nculinary water well. In an effort to protect this viewshed and better \nmanage its boundaries along its most visited entrance, the National \nPark\n\n[[Page S3733]]\n\nService, NPS, has been negotiating with Page One to exchange 370 acres \nof NRA lands for these 152 acres. The approximate value of the NRA \nlands is $480,000 whereas the private land's appraised value is \n$856,000. Page One has agreed to donate the balance of appraised value \nto the NPS.\n  By authorizing this land exchange, this bill will allow the NPS to \npreserve and better manage the corridor between the park and Highway \n89, which affords such a scenic view of Lake Powell. This boundary \nchange would not add any facilities, increase operating costs, or \nrequire additional staff and as such, it will not add to the NPS \nmaintenance backlog.\n  Because of the common interest in preserving this scenic corridor \nfrom development, this legislation has garnered the support of the \nadministration, the Kane County Planning and Zoning Commission, the \nNational Parks Conservation Association, and the Southern Utah Planning \nAdvisory Council. In light of the benefits provided by and community \nsupport for this proposal, I look forward to working with my Senate \ncolleagues and the administration to pass this legislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 613. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nconstruct, lease, or modify major medical facilities at the site of the \nformer Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, Aurora, Colorado; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nfacilitate the move of the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center, \nDVAMC, from its present site in Denver to the former Fitzsimons Army \nMedical Center in Aurora, Colorado. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by my friend and colleague Senator Allard as an original co-\nsponsor.\n  The bill would authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nconstruct, lease or modify major medical facilities at the site of the \nformer Fitzsimons Army Medical Center. It instructs the Secretary to \nwork with the Department of Defense in planning a joint Federal project \nthat would serve the health care needs of active duty Air Force and the \nVA. It would also require the Secretary to submit a report to the \nCommittees on Appropriations and the Committees on Veterans Affairs of \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives. This report would detail \nthe options selected by the Secretary and any information on further \nplanning needed to carry out the move.\n  The relocation of the DVAMC to the former Fitzsimons site offers a \nunique opportunity to provide the highest quality medical care for our \nveterans and certain members of our military. The University of \nColorado Health Sciences Center, UCHSC, is moving its facilities from \nits overcrowded location near downtown Denver to the Fitzsimons site, a \ndecommissioned Army base. The UCHSC and the DVAMC have long operated on \nadjacent campuses and have shared faculty, medical residents, and \naccess to equipment. A DVAMC move to the new location in conjunction \nwith the DOD would allow such cost-effective cooperation to continue, \nfor the benefit of our veterans, active duty Air Force members and all \ntaxpayers.\n  The need to move is pressing. A recent VA study concludes that the \nColorado State veterans' population will experience one of the highest \npercent increases nationally in veterans age 65 and over between 1990 \nand 2020. The present VA hospital was built in the 1950's. While still \nable to provide service, the core facilities are approaching the end of \ntheir useful lives and many of the patient care units have fallen \nhorribly out of date. Studies indicate that co-location with the \nUniversity on a state-of-the-art medical campus would be a cost \neffective way to give veterans and active duty Air Force members in the \nregion the highest quality of care. The move would also provide a \ntremendous opportunity to showcase a nationwide model of cooperation \nbetween the University, the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, and the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  The VA needs to move quickly. Assisting our veterans with their \nmedical needs is a promise we, as a country, made long ago.\n  The savings we can realize by approving the timely transfer of our \nveterans' medical treatment facilities in the Denver region compels me \nto urge my colleagues to act quickly on this bill. We must not miss out \non this opportunity to serve America's veterans and their families by \nensuring that they receive the excellent medical care they deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 613\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to reduce the \nquantity of mercury in the environment by limiting the use of mercury \nfever thermometers and improving the collection and proper management \nof mercury, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mercury \nReduction Act of 2003. I am pleased that my colleagues, Senators \nJeffords,\n\n[[Page S3734]]\n\nChafee, Kerry, Hutchison, Reed, Lieberman, Voinovich, Dorgan, and Leahy \nhave joined me in this initiative. Our legislation addresses the very \nserious problems of mercury in the environment and mercury disposal. It \ntakes special aim at one of the most common and widely distributed \nsources of mercury mercury fever thermometers while also for the first \ntime creating a nationwide policy for dealing with surplus mercury.\n  Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that is widespread in the environment \nand particularly harmful to developing children. In fact, according to \na draft report recently released by the EPA, approximately 5 million \nAmerican women of childbearing age have mercury levels in their \nbloodstream above safe levels. Tragically, the children of these women \nwill have an elevated risk of birth defects.\n  When mercury enters the environment, it takes on a highly toxic \norganic form known as methylmercury. Methylmercury is almost completely \nabsorbed into the blood and distributed to all tissues including the \nbrain. This organic mercury can accumulate in the food chain and become \nconcentrated in some species of fish, posing a health threat to some \npeople who consume them. For this reason, 40 States have issued \nfreshwater fish advisories that warn certain individuals to restrict or \navoid consuming fish from affected bodies of water.\n  One prevalent source of mercury in the environment is from mercury \nfever thermometers. Many of us know from personal experience that they \nare easily broken. In fact, in 1998 the American Poison Control Center \nreceived 18,000 phone calls from consumers who had broken mercury \nthermometers.\n  One mercury thermometer contains a little under one gram of mercury. \nDespite its small size, the mercury in one thermometer, if it were \nreleased annually into the environment, is enough to contaminate all \nthe fish in a 20-acre lake.\n  The bill we are introducing today calls for a nationwide ban on the \nsale of mercury fever thermometers. It would also provide grants for \nswap programs to help consumers exchange mercury thermometers for \ndigital or other alternatives.\n  Our legislation would allow millions of consumers across the Nation \nto receive free digital thermometers in exchange for their mercury \nthermometers. By bringing mercury thermometers in for proper disposal, \nconsumers will ensure the mercury from their thermometers does not end \nup polluting our lakes and threatening our health. It will also reduce \nthe risk of breakage and contamination inside the home.\n  An important component of our bill is the safe disposal of the \nmercury collected from thermometer exchange programs, which are \nincreasingly popular in communities throughout our country. I want to \nmake sure that we are actually removing surplus mercury from the \nenvironment and from commerce, rather than simply recycling it. It \nobviously does little good to collect all this mercury from thermometer \nexchange programs if it is going to be recycled into new products and \nput back into commerce and eventually into our environment. This bill \ndirects the EPA to ensure that the mercury is properly collected and \nstored in order to keep it out of the environment and out of \ncommerce. Once the mercury is collected, my intention is it will never \nagain be able to pose a threat to the health of our children.\n\n  The mercury collected from thermometer exchange programs is only part \nof the problem. There is a bigger problem, and that is the global \ncirculation of mercury. Let me give an example. When the HoltraChem \nmanufacturing plant in Orrington, ME, shut down a few years ago, the \nplant was left with over 100 tons of unwanted mercury and no known way \nto permanently and safely dispose of it. In total, about 3,000 tons of \nmercury is held at similar plants across the country.\n  Yet despite this surplus mercury, large amounts of mercury are still \nbeing mined around the world. In addition, the Department of Defense \ncurrently has a stockpile of over 4,000 tons of surplus mercury it does \nnot know what to do with and for which it does not have any use.\n  In view of these facts, why are Algeria and other countries still \nmining huge amounts of an element that is a known neurotoxin, when the \nUnited States and other countries are doing their best to remove this \nextremely toxic element from the environment? How will the United \nStates dispose of the huge amounts of mercury at chlor-alkali plants \nand other sources that no longer are understood?\n  Our bill would create an interchange task force to address these very \nquestions. The task force would be chaired by the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and would be comprised of members from \nother Federal agencies involved with mercury. Our legislation directs \nthis task force to find ways to reduce the mercury threat to humans and \nto our environment, to identify long-term means of disposing of mercury \nsafely and properly, and to address the excess mercury problems from \nmines as well as industrial sources. This task force would also be \ndirected to identify comprehensive solutions to the global mercury \nproblem. One year from the creation of this task force, it would be \nrequired to submit its recommendations to the Congress for permanently \ndisposing of mercury and for reducing the amount of new mercury mined \nevery year.\n  In the meantime, this legislation would make significant progress \ntoward reducing one of the most widespread sources of mercury \ncontamination in the environment, a source that is found in many of our \nhomes; that is, the mercury thermometer. Perhaps even more important, \nthis legislation would, for the first time ever, establish a national \npolicy, which is what we need to deal with surplus mercury in order to \nprotect our environment in the long term, as well as our health, and \nparticularly the health of developing children, from this highly toxic \nelement.\n  I hope many more of my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation and that it will be signed into law this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Durbin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Ms. \n        Landrieu, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 617. A bill to provide for full voting representation in Congress \nfor the citizens of the District of Columbia, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the No \nTaxation Without Representation Act of 2003 legislation that will right \nan ongoing injustice experienced by 600,000 American citizens--the \ncitizens of the District of Columbia--who have historically been denied \nvoting representation in Congress.\n  This injustice is felt directly by District residents, but it is also \na stain on the fabric of our democracy for the Nation as a whole. By \nnow, we should all understand that the vote is a civic entitlement of \nevery American citizen. It is democracy's most essential right, our \nmost useful tool.\n  I am proud to be the chief Senate sponsor of this bill, which \nCongresswoman Norton is also today introducing in the House. I am \ndelighted that Senator Feingold, who has worked with me for two years \non this legislation, is joining me again as an original sponsor, as are \nSenators Daschle, Durbin, Mikulski, Schumer, Kennedy, Dodd, Landrieu \nand Kerry. The aim of the legislation is simple: It would provide full \nvoting representation in Congress--through two senators and a member of \nthe House--to citizens of the District, providing to them the same \nrights to participate in our democracy as citizens in the 50 States. \nDespite this bill's title, it would not exempt residents of the \nDistrict from paying income taxes.\n  Last year, the Governmental Affairs Committee, which I then chaired, \nheld a hearing on this issue in May. It was the first time since 1994 \nthat Congress had held a hearing on the issue. Five months later, in \nOctober, the Committee reported out legislation identical to the bill \nwe introduce today. I am proud that we progressed as far as we did last \nyear. Unfortunately it was not far enough.\n  Today, I think it is particularly ironic--though painfully so--that \nwe are introducing this legislation as the Nation stands on the brink \nof a decision\n\n[[Page S3735]]\n\nabout war with Iraq to protect our national security. If war does come, \ncitizens of Washington D.C. will serve their fellow Americans with \npride, as they have in every previous war. In fact, the District \nsuffered more casualties in Vietnam than the citizens of 10 states. \nFurthermore, over 1,000 Army and Air National Guardsmen and women from \nthe District have already been called upon to help in the war on \nterrorism. Yet--to our shame--D.C. citizens cannot choose \nrepresentatives to the legislature that governs them. There is \nsomething wrong with this picture.\n  The people of this city have also been the direct target of \nterrorists, and yet citizens of the District have no one who can cast a \nvote in Congress on policies to protect their homeland security. \nCitizens of Washington, D.C., pay income taxes just like everyone else. \nActually, they pay more. Per capita, District residents have the second \nhighest Federal tax obligation. And yet they have no say in how high \nthose taxes will be or how their tax dollars will be spent.\n  They fight and die and pay for our democracy, but they cannot \nparticipate fully in it. How can we countenance this? How can we \npromote democracy abroad effectively while denying it to hundreds of \nthousands of citizens in our Nation's Capital?\n  The citizens who live in our Nation's Capital deserve more than a \nnonvoting delegate\n  in the House. Notwithstanding the strong service of the Honorable \nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and her ability to vote in \ncommittee, a representative without the power to vote on the floor of \nthe House simply isn't good enough.\n  Prior to the District's establishment in 1790, residents of the area \nwho were eligible to vote had full representation in Congress. When the \nframers of the Constitution placed our Capital under the jurisdiction \nof the Congress, they placed with Congress the responsibility of \nensuring that D.C. citizens' rights would be protected in the future, \njust as Congress should protect the rights of all citizens throughout \nthe land. For more than 200 years, Congress has failed to meet this \nobligation. And I, for one, am not prepared to make D.C. citizens wait \nanother 200 years.\n  Today, no other democratic nation denies the residents of its capital \nrepresentation in the national legislature. What must visitors from \naround the world think when they come to see our beautiful landmarks, \nour monuments, and our Capitol dome--proud symbols of the world's \nleading democracy--only to learn that the citizens of this city have no \nvoice in Congress? What would we do if the residents of Boston, \nNashville, Denver, Seattle, or El Paso had no voting rights? All those \ncities are roughly the same size as Washington, D.C.--and I know we as \na Nation wouldn't let their citizens go voiceless in the Congress.\n  Incredibly, the vast majority of Americans already believe that D.C. \nresidents have voting representation in the Congress. When they are \ninformed that they don't, 80 percent of Americans, according to one \npoll, say that they should. That is overwhelming support and by \nrighting this wrong, we will be following the will of the American \npeople.\n  The people of the District of Columbia have been without this key \nright for far too long. I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 618. A bill to provide for the use and distribution of the funds \nawarded to the Western Shoshone identifiable group under Indian Claims \nCommission Docket Numbers 326-A-1, 326-A-3, 326-K, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senator Ensign \nto reintroduce the Western Shoshone Claims Distribution Act. Last year \nthe Senate unanimously passed this bill, which will at last release \nfunds the United States has held in trust for the Western Shoshone \npeople for over 24 years. Unfortunately the House was unable to \ncomplete its consideration of the bill before the last Congress \nadjourned.\n  Historically, the Western Shoshone people have resided on land within \nthe central portion of Nevada and parts of California, Idaho, and Utah. \nFor more than a hundred years, the Western Shoshone have not received a \nfair compensation for the loss of their tribal land and resources. In \n1946 the Indian Claims Commission was established to compensate Indians \nfor lands and resources taken from them by the United States. In 1962 \nthe commission determined that the Western Shoshone land had been taken \nthrough ``gradual encroachment.'' In 1977 the commission awarded the \ntribe in excess of $26 million dollars. The United States Supreme Court \nhas upheld the commission's award. It was not until 1979 that the \nUnited States appropriated over $26 million dollars to reimburse the \ndescendents of these tribes for their loss.\n  The Western Shoshone are not a wealthy people. A third of the tribal \nmembers are unemployed; for many of those who do have jobs, it is a \nstruggle to live from paycheck to the next. Wood stoves often provide \nthe only source of heat in their aging homes. Like other American \nIndians, the Western Shoshone continue to be disproportionately \naffected by poverty and low educational attainment. The high school \ncompletion rate for Indian people between the ages of 20 and 24 is \ndismally low. American Indians have a drop-out rate that is 12.5 \npercent higher than the rest of the National. For the Western Shoshone, \nthe money contained in the settlement funds could lead to drastic \nlifestyle improvements.\n  After 24 years the judgment funds still remain in the United States \nTreasury. The Western Shoshone have not received a single penny of this \nmoney which is rightfully theirs. In those twenty-four years, the \noriginal trust fund has grown to well over $121 million dollars. It is \nthe past time that this money should be delivered into the hands of its \nowners. The Western Shoshone Steering Committee has officially \nrequested that Congress enact legislation to affect this distribution. \nIt has become increasingly apparent in recent years that the vast \nmajority of those who qualify to receive these funds support an \nimmediate distribution of their money.\n  This Act will provide payments to eligible Western Shoshone tribal \nmembers and ensure that future generations of Western Shoshone will be \nable to enjoy the benefit of the distribution in perpetuity. Through \nthe establishment of a tribally controlled grant trust fund, individual \nmembers of the Western Shoshone will be able to apply for money for \neducation and other needs within limits set by a self-appointed \ncommittee of tribal members. I will continue my ongoing work with the \nmembers of the Western Shoshone and the Department of Interior to help \nresolve any current land issues.\n  It is clear that the Western Shoshone want the funds from their claim \ndistributed without further delay. They have already voted twice to \nfirmly and decisively voice their interests. Members of the Western \nShoshone gathered in Fallon and Elko, NV in May of 1998. They cast a \nvote overwhelmingly in favor of distributing the funds. 1,230 supported \nthe distribution in the statewide vote; only 53 were opposed. Again on \nJune 2002 they cast a vote overwhelmingly in support of the \ndistribution of the judgment funds at a rate of 100 percent per capita. \n1,647 Western Shoshone voted in favor of the distribution of the funds; \nonly 156 opposed. I rise today in support and recognition of their \ndecision. The final distribution of this fund has lingered for more \nthan twenty years. During the 107th Congress, the Indian Affairs \nCommittee approved and the full Senate unanimously passed this bill. It \nis clear that the best interests of the Tribe will not be served by \nprolonging their wait. Twenty-four years has been more than long \nenough. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 618\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title VII of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \nto provide for fire sprinkler systems, or other fire suppression or \nprevention technologies, in public and private college and university \nhousing and dormitories, including fraternity and sorority housing and \ndormitories; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues Mr. \nLautenburg and Mr. Levin to re-introduce the College Fire Prevention \nAct. This measure would provide Federal matching grants for the \ninstallation of fire sprinkler systems in college and university \ndormitories and fraternity and sorority houses. I believe the time is \nnow to address the sad situation of deadly fires that occur in our \nchildren's college living facilities.\n  The tragic fire that occurred at Seton Hall University on Wednesday, \nJanuary 19th, 2000, will not be forgotten. Three freshmen, all 18 years \nold, died. Fifty-four students, two South Orange firefighters and two \nSouth Orange police officers were injured. The dormitory, Boland Hall, \nwas a six-story, 350-room structure built in 1952 that housed \napproximately 600 students. Astonishingly, the fire was contained to \nthe third floor lounge of Boland Hall. This dormitory was equipped with \nsmoke alarms but no sprinkler system.\n  Unfortunately, the Boland Hall fire was not the first of its kind. \nAnd it reminded many people in North Carolina of their own tragic \nexperience with dorm fires. In 1996, on Mother's Day and Graduation \nDay, a fire in the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house at the University \nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill killed five college juniors and \ninjured three others. The three-story fraternity house was 70 years \nold. The National Fire Protection Association identified several \nfactors that contributed to the tragic fire, including the lack of fire \nsprinkler protection.\n  Sadly, dorm fires are not rare. On December 9, 1997, a student died \nin a dormitory fire at Greenville College in Greenville, IL. The \ndormitory, Kinney Hall, was built in the 1960s and had no fire \nsprinkler system. On January 10, 1997, a student died at the University \nof Tennessee at Martin. The dormitory, Ellington Hall, had no fire \nsprinkler system. On January 3, 1997, a student died in a dormitory \nfire at Central Missouri State University in Warrensburg, MO. On \nOctober 21, 1994, five students died in a fraternity house fire in \nBloomsburg, PA. The list goes on and on. In a typical year between 1980 \nand 1998, the National Fire Protection Association estimates there were \nan average of 1,800 fires at dormitories, fraternities, and sororities, \ninvolving one death, 70 injuries, and $8 million in property damage.\n  So now we must ask, what can be done? What can we do to curtail these \ntragic fires from taking the lives of our children, our young adults? \nWe should focus our attention on the lack of fire sprinklers in college \ndormitories and fraternity and sorority houses. Sprinklers save lives.\n  Despite the clear benefits of sprinklers, many college dorms do not \nhave them. New dormitories are generally required to have advanced \nsafety systems such as fire sprinklers. But such requirements are \nrarely imposed retroactively on existing buildings. In 1998, 93 percent \nof the campus building fires reported to fire departments occurred in \nbuildings where there were smoke alarms present. However, only 34 \npercent of them had fire sprinklers present.\n  At my State's flagship university at Chapel Hill, for example, only \n14 of the 33 residence halls have sprinklers. Only 3 of 9 dorms at \nNorth Carolina Central University are equipped with the life-saving \ndevices, and there are sprinklers in 4 of the 18 dorms at the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Greensboro.\n  The legislation I introduce today authorizes the Secretary of \nEducation, in consultation with the United States Fire Administration, \nto award grants to States, private or public colleges or universities, \nfraternities, or sororities to assist them in providing fire sprinkler \nsystems for their student housing and dormitories. These entities would \nbe required to produce matching funds equal to one-half of the cost of \nthe project. This legislation authorizes $80 million for fiscal years \n2004 through 2008.\n  In North Carolina, we decided to initiate a drive to install \nsprinklers in our public college and university dorms. The overall cost \nis estimated at $57.5 million. Given how much it is going to cost North \nCarolina's public colleges and universities to install sprinklers, I \nthink it's clear that the $100 million that this measure authorizes is \njust a drop in the bucket. But my hope is that by providing this small \nincentive we can encourage more colleges to institute a comprehensive \nreview of their dorm's fire safety and to install sprinklers. All they \nneed is a helping hand. With this modest measure of prevention, we can \nhelp prevent the needless and tragic loss of young lives.\n  Parents should not have to worry about their children living in fire \ntraps. When we send our children away to college, we are sending them \nto a home away from home where hundreds of other students eat, sleep, \nburn candles, use electric appliances and smoke. We must not compromise \non their safety. As the Fire Chief from Chapel Hill wrote me: ``Every \nyear, parents send their children off to college seeking an education \nunaware that one of the greatest dangers facing their children is the \nfire hazards associated with dormitories, fraternity and sorority \nhouses and other forms of student housing .  .  . The only complete \nanswer to making student-housing safe is to install fire sprinkler \nsystems.'' In short, the best way to ensure the protection of our \ncollege students is to install fire sprinklers in our college \ndormitories and fraternity and sorority houses. My proposal has been \nendorsed by the National Fire Protection Association. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. Thank \nyou.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation and the \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    March 4, 2003.\n     Hon. John Edwards,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Edwards: On behalf of the National Fire Prevention \n     Association (NFPA) and our 70,000 members, I want to thank \n     you for introducing the College Fire Prevention Act. We are \n     pleased to support your legislative efforts to provide \n     federal assistance for the installation of fire sprinkler \n     systems in college and university housing and dormitories.\n       Each year, an estimated 1,800 fires occur in dormitories \n     and fraternity and sorority houses. These fires are \n     responsible for an average of one death, seventy injuries and \n     over $8 million in property damage. Of these fires, only 35% \n     had fire sprinkler systems present.\n\n[[Page S3738]]\n\n     As you know, in your home state of North Carolina, a tragic \n     fire on Mother's Day in 1996 killed five students in a \n     fraternity house.\n       Our statistics show that properly installed and maintained \n     fire sprinkler systems have a proven track records of \n     protecting lives and property in all types of occupancies. In \n     particular, the retrofitting of fire sprinkler systems in \n     college and university housing will greatly improve the \n     safety of these public and private institutions.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this crucial issue. NFPA \n     is ready to assist in any way to see this legislation passed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John C. Biechman,\n     Vice-President, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n     Chapel Hill Fire Department, Chapel Hill, NC, March 12, 2003.\n     Senator John Edwards,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Edwards: One of the most under addressed fire \n     safety problems in America today is university and college \n     student housing. Every year, parents send their children off \n     to college seeking an education unaware that one of the \n     greatest dangers facing their children is the fire hazards \n     associated with dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses \n     and other forms of student housing. We in Chapel Hill \n     experienced a worst-case scenario, when in 1996 a fire in a \n     fraternity house on Mother's Day/Graduation Day claimed five \n     young lives and injured three more. We recognized the only \n     complete answer to making student-housing safe is to install \n     fire sprinkler systems.\n       I had the privilege of reading a draft copy of your \n     proposed legislation amending the Higher Education Act of \n     1965 to create a matching grants program supporting the \n     lifesaving step of installing fire sprinkler systems in \n     student housing. I strongly urge you to introduce this \n     legislation and I pledge to assist you in promoting this \n     important Bill. Your proposed legislation is the only real \n     solution to the fire threat in student housing. Higher \n     education cannot prepare our young people to contribure to \n     society if they do not survive the experience.\n       After thirteen years of being responsible for fire \n     protection at the University of North Carolina--Chapel Hill, \n     I am convinced that where students reside, alarms systems are \n     not enough, clear exit ways are not enough, quick fire \n     department response is not enough and educational programs \n     are not enough. The only way you can insure fire safety for \n     college student housing is to place a fire sprinkler system \n     over them. Thank you for recognizing the magnitude of this \n     threat and for proposing a solution to it.\n       Tell me how we can help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Daniel Jones,\n                                                       Fire Chief.\n\n                                 S. 620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to allow \nqualifying States to use allotments under the State children's health \ninsurance program for expenditures under the Medicaid program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senators Jeffords, Murray, Leahy, and Cantwell entitled the \n``Children's Health Equity Act of 2003.'' This bill addresses an \ninequity that was created during the establishment of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, that unfairly penalized \ncertain States that had done the right thing and had expanded Medicaid \ncoverage to children prior to the enactment of the bill.\n  While the Congress recognized this fact for some States and \n``grandfathered'' in their expansions so those States could use the new \nCHIP funding for the children of their respective States, the \nlegislation failed to do so for others, including New Mexico, Vermont, \nand Washington, among others. This had the effect of penalizing a \ncertain group of States for having done the right thing.\n  The ``Children's Health Equity Act of 2003'' addresses this inequity \nby allowing those States, which had expanded coverage to children up to \n185 percent of poverty by April 15, 1997, before the enactment of CHIP, \nto be allowed to also utilize their CHIP allotments for coverage of \nthose children covered by Medicaid above 133 percent of poverty--\nputting them on a more level field with all other States in the \ncountry.\n  As you know, in 1997 Congress and President Clinton agreed to \nestablish the State Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, and \nprovide $48 billion over ten years as an incentive to States to provide \nhealth care coverage to uninsured, low-income children up 200 percent \nof poverty or beyond.\n  During the negotiations of the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997, \nCongress and the Administration properly recognized that certain States \nwere already undertaking Medicaid or separate State-run expansions of \ncoverage to children up to 185 percent of poverty or above and that \nthey would be allowed to use the new CHIP funding for those purposes. \nThe final bill specifically allowed the States of Florida, New York, \nand Pennsylvania to convert their separate State-run programs into CHIP \nexpansions and States that had expanded coverage to children through \nMedicaid after March 31, 1997, were also allowed to use CHIP funding \nfor their expansions.\n\n[[Page S3739]]\n\n  Unfortunately, New Mexico and other States that had enacted similar \nexpansions prior to March 1997 were denied the use of CHIP funding for \ntheir expansions. This created an inequity among the States where some \nwere allowed to have their prior programs ``grandfathered'' into CHIP \nand others were denied. Therefore, our bill addresses this inequity.\n  New Mexico has a strong record of attempting to expand coverage to \nchildren through the Medicaid program. In 1995, prior to the enactment \nof CHIP, New Mexico expanded coverage to for all children through age \n18 through the Medicaid program up to 185 percent of poverty. After \nCHIP was passed, New Mexico further expanded its coverage up to 235 \npercent of poverty--above the level of the vast majority of states \nacross the country.\n  Due to the inequity caused by CHIP, New Mexico has been allocated \n$266 million from CHIP between fiscal years 1998 and 2002, and yet, has \nonly been able to spend slightly over $26 million as of the end of last \nfiscal year. In other words, New Mexico has been allowed to spend less \nthan 10 percent of its federal CHIP allocations.\n  New Mexico is unable to spend its funding because it had enacted its \nexpansion of coverage to children up to 185 percent of poverty prior to \nthe enactment of CHIP and our State was not ``grandfathered'' into CHIP \nas other comparable states were.\n  The consequences for the children of New Mexico are enormous. \nAccording to the Census Bureau, New Mexico has an estimated 114,000 \nuninsured children. In other words, almost 21 percent of all the \nchildren in New Mexico are uninsured, despite the fact the State has \nexpanded coverage up to 235 percent of poverty. This is the second \nhighest rate of uninsured children in the country.\n  This is a result of the fact that an estimated 80 percent of the \nuninsured children in New Mexico are below 200 percent of poverty. \nThese children are, consequently, often eligible for Medicaid but \ncurrently unenrolled. With the exception of those few children between \n185 and 200 percent of poverty who are eligible for CHIP funding, all \nof the remaining uninsured children below 185 percent of poverty in New \nMexico are denied CHIP funding despite their need.\n  Exacerbating this inequity is the fact that many States are accessing \ntheir CHIP allotments to cover kids at poverty levels far below New \nMexico's current or past eligibility levels. The children in those \nStates are certainly no more worthy of health insurance coverage than \nthe children of New Mexico.\n  As the health policy statement by the National Governors' Association \nreads, ``The Governors believe that it is critical that innovative \nstates not be penalized for having expanded coverage to children before \nthe enactment of S-CHIP, which provides enhanced funding to meet these \ngoals. To this end, the Governors support providing additional funding \nflexibility to states that had already significantly expanded coverage \nto the majority of uninsured children in their states.''\n  Consequently, the bill I am introducing today corrects this inequity. \nThe bill reflects a carefully-crated response to the unintended \nconsequences of CHIP and brings much needed assistance to children \ncurrently uninsured in my State and other similarly situated States, \nincluding Washington and Vermont.\n  Rather than simply changing the effective date included in the BBA \nthat helped a smaller subset of States, this initiative includes strong \nmaintenance of effort language as well as incentives for our State to \nconduct outreach and enrollment efforts and program simplification to \nfind and enroll uninsured kids because we feel strongly that they must \nreceive the health coverage for which they are eligible.\n  The bill does not take money from other States' CHIP allotments. It \nsimply allows our States to spend our States' specific CHIP allotments \nfrom the Federal Government on our uninsured children--just as other \nstates across the country are doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 621\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide families of disabled children with the opportunity to purchase \ncoverage under the medicaid program for such children, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy and I are happy to \nannounce the introduction of the Family Opportunity Act of 2003, a bill \nto promote family, work, and opportunity. Every day, across the \ncountry, thousands of families struggle to obtain affordable and \nappropriate health care coverage for children with special health care \nneeds, including children with conditions such as autism, mental \nretardation, cerebral palsy, developmental delays, or mental illness.\n  Low and middle income parents who have employer sponsored family \nhealth care coverage often find that their private insurance doesn't \nadequately cover the array of services that are critical to their \nchild's well-being, such as mental health services, personal care \nservices, durable medical equipment, special nutritional supplements, \nand respite care. Because Medicaid, our nation's health care program \nfor low-income individuals, offers the type of comprehensive care that \nbest meets the needs of children with disabilities, it can become a \nlifeline on which many parents depend.\n  Yet, Medicaid is a safety net program and one must be impoverished in \norder to be eligible. This presents a terrible choice for many low and \nmiddle income families who have a child with special health care needs: \nthey must choose between work or impoverishment. Or, in the worst \ncases, parents consider the devastating choice of relinquishing custody \nfor an out-of-home placement so their child can obtain services they so \ndesperately need. Truly, there is nothing more heartbreaking for a \nparent than to be unable to provide for a child in need.\n  Consider the following example: Mr. and Mrs. Jones have two \ndaughters, Heather and Hannah. Hannah was born with cerebral palsy. The \nfamily earns $29,000 a year and is insured through employer sponsored \nhealth insurance. Mr. Jones recently lost his job because of down-\nsizing. Last year, even with insurance, the family spent nearly $9,000 \non out-of-pocket medical expenses. Mr. Jones has found a new job; \nunfortunately, the family's insurance premium has risen to $200 a month \nand does not cover essential occupational and physical therapy. The \nfamily dipped into their 401K when Hannah was born. The family's \nearnings minus the health care premiums, minus out of pocket expenses \nputs this family at an annual income of $17,600. The federal poverty \nlevel for a family of four is $18,400. This hard-working family is \nbeing impoverished because of their commitment to care for their \ndisabled child.\n  Over the past three years, I have worked with Senator Kennedy and \nRepresentative Pete Sessions to advance this important legislation on \nbehalf of thousands of families who need our help. Each year, more than \n70 Senators have signed on as co-sponsors of the legislation. I \nunderstand the many pressing challenges facing our nation's health care \nsystem, but I urge the Senate to show its support for helping these \nfamilies and pass the Family Opportunity Act this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 622\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleague \nSenator Grassley today in re-introducing the Family Opportunity Act \nof--so that once and for all, we can remove the health care barriers \nfor children with disabilities that so often prevent families from \nstaying together and staying employed, and that so often prevent their \nchildren from growing up to live independent lives and become fully \ncontributing members of their communities.\n  More than 9 percent of children in this country have significant \ndisabilities, many of whom do not have access to the basic health \nservices they need to maintain their health status, let alone prevent \nits continuing deterioration. To obtain theses health services for \ntheir children, families are being forced to become poor, stay poor, \nput their children in institutions or ever give up custody of their \nchildren--all so that their children can qualify for the health \ncoverage available under Medicaid.\n  In a recent survey of 20 States, families of special needs children \nreport they are turning down jobs, turning down raises, turning down \novertime, and unable even to save money for the future of their \nchildren and family--all so that their child can stay eligible for \nMedicaid through the Social Security Income Program. The lack of \nadequate health care in our country today continues to force these \nfamilies into poverty in order to obtain the care they need for their \ndisabled children.\n  The legislation we are reintroducing will close the health care gap \nfor the nation's most vulnerable population, and enable families of \ndisabled children to be equal partners in the American dream.\n  In the words of President George Bush in his ``New Freedom \nInitiative,'' ``To many Americans with disabilities remain trapped in \nbureaucracies of dependence, and are denied the access\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\nnecessary for success--and we need to tear down these barriers.\n  The Family Opportunity. Act will do just that. It will tear down the \nunfair barriers to needed health care that so many disabled and special \nneeds children are denied. It will make health insurance coverage more \nwidely available for children with significant disabilities, through \nopportunities to buy-in to Medicaid at an affordable rate. States will \nhave greater flexibility to enable children with metal health \ndisabilities to obtain the health services they need in order to live \nat home and in their communities. It will establish Family to Family \nInformation Centers in each state to assist families with special needs \nchildren.\n  The passage of Work Incentives Improvement Act in 1999 demonstrated \nthe nation's commitment to give adults with disabilities the right to \nlead independent and productive lives without giving up their health \ncare. It is time for Congress to show the same commitment to children \nwith disabilities.\n  We came very close to passing the Family Opportunity Act in the last \nCongress. I look forward to working members of this new Congress to \nenact this important legislation, and give disabled children and their \nfamilies their rightful opportunity to fulfill their dreams and \nparticipate fully in the life of our nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 623. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nFederal civilian and military retirees to pay health insurance premiums \non a pretax basis and to allow a deduction for TRICARE supplemental \npremiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide some relief for our Nation's retired Federal employees from the \nsevere increases in Federal Employee Health Benefit, FEHB, program \npremiums. This measure extends premium conversion to federal and \nmilitary retirees, allowing them to pay their health insurance premiums \nwith pre-tax dollars.\n  Over 9 million Federal employees, retirees and their families are \ncovered under FEHBP. In 2003 premiums are expected to rise an average \nof 11 percent, the third year in a row the average increase has \nexceeded 10 percent.\n  The increasing cost of health care is a critical issue, especially to \nretirees living on a fixed income. The 2003 Cost of Living Adjustment, \nCOLA, for Federal civil service annuitants is only 1.4 percent, the \nlowest since a 1.3 percent increase in 1999. The modest COLA is \ncompletely diminished by increased health care costs.\n  In the fall of 2000 premium conversion became available to current \nfederal employees who participate in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program. It is a benefit already available to many private \nsector employees. While premium conversion does not directly affect the \namount of the FEHBP premium, it helps to offset some of the increase by \nreducing an individual's federal tax liability.\n  Extending this benefit to federal retirees requires a change in the \ntax law, specifically Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. This \nlegislation makes the necessary change in the tax code.\n  Under the legislation, the benefit is concurrently afforded to our \nNation's military retirees as well to assist with increasing health \ncare costs.\n  A number of organizations representing Federal and military retirees \nare strongly behind this initiative, including the National Association \nof Retired Federal Employees, the Military Coalition, the Fleet Reserve \nAssociation, and the Association of the U.S. Army.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this critical legislation and \nshow their support for our Nation's dedicated Federal civilian and \nmilitary retirees. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of the \nRussian Federation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the U.S.-Russia \nTrade Act of 2003.\n  This legislation would grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations to \nRussia. However--and I want to be very clear about this point--this \nlegislation would also ensure that Congress retains proper oversight of \nnegotiations to bring Russia into the World Trade Organization.\n  Congress typically grants PNTR to a Jackson-Vanik country only when \nthat country is about to join the WTO. This is, for example, exactly \nwhat Congress did when China joined the WTO.\n  The Administration and some of my colleagues have suggested that \nCongress should grant PNTR to Russia\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\nprior to their joining the WTO. If we are going to do down this path, \nwe must ensure that there is adequate Congressional oversight.\n  This legislation would ensure Congressional involvement in the \nfollowing way: after negotiations are completed, Congress would be \nguaranteed a vote on a resolution to disapprove of Russia's joining the \nWTO, if such a resolution is introduced.\n  Congress has a key role to play in negotiating an agreement on \nRussia's entering the WTO. China's WTO accession demonstrates this. The \nAdministration was able to obtain a better deal with China because of \nCongressional involvement.\n  And there are some real concerns with Russia. The Russian government \nhas announced that it plans to add additional restrictions on imports \nof U.S. agricultural products, including poultry, pork, and beef. \nThat's unacceptable, and it is behavior that should not be rewarded.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that Congress \ncontinues to have an important role in Russia's accession to the WTO.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 624\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce the amount of paperwork for special \neducation teachers, to make mediation mandatory for all legal disputes \nrelated to individualized education programs, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce, along \nwith my colleague Senator Miller, the bipartisan Teacher Paperwork \nReduction Act of 2003. During the 107th Congress, we were successful in \nlegislating sweeping reforms in education with the passage of the No \nChild Left Behind Act. This year we hope to complete reauthorization of \nanother important federal education initiative--the reauthorization of \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, this year. As we \nconsider this legislation, our greatest responsibility is to improve \nthe quality of the education that students with special needs receive.\n  One of the problems fostered by the current system, which stands in \ndirect contrast to our purpose, is the excessive paperwork burden \nimposed on our special education teachers. This burden takes valuable \ntime away from classroom instruction and is a source of ongoing \nfrustration for the special education teachers working on the \nfrontlines. As a result, this undermines the goal of providing the best \nquality education possible to all children. The Teacher Paperwork \nReduction Act addresses this problem and seeks to offer solutions that \nwill benefit special education teachers and most importantly the \nchildren they instruct.\n  This bipartisan legislation includes four main provisions to correct \nthe problem of burdensome paperwork. First, the Department of \nEducation, in cooperation with state and local educational agencies, \nwould be required to reduce the amount of paperwork by 50 percent \nwithin 18 months of enactment of the legislation and would be \nencouraged to make additional reductions. Second, the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, would conduct a study to determine how much of \nthe paperwork burden is caused by Federal regulations compared to State \nand local regulations; the number of mediations that have been \nconducted since mediations were required to be made available under the \n1997 IDEA amendments; the use of technology in reducing the paperwork \nburden; and GAO would make recommendations on steps that Congress, the \nU.S. Department of Education, and the States and local districts can \ntake to reduce this burden within six months of the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Third, mediation would be mandatory for all legal disputes related to \nIndividual Education Programs, IEPs, to better empower parents and \nschools to focus resources on a quality education for children rather \nthan unnecessary litigation within one year of enactment of this \nlegislation. Fourth, the Department of Education is directed to conduct \nresearch to determine best practices for successful mediation, \nincluding training practices, that can help contribute to the effort to \nreduce paperwork, improve student outcomes, and free up teacher \nresources for teaching. The Department would also provide mediation \ntraining support services to support state and local efforts. The \nresources to fund these requirements would come from money appropriated \nthrough Part D of IDEA.\n  The Council for Exceptional Children, CEO, states, ``No barrier is so \nirksome to special educators as the paperwork that keeps them from \nteaching.'' According to a CEC report, concerns about paperwork ranked \nthird among special education teachers, out of a list of 10 issues. The \nCEC also reports that special education teachers are leaving the \nprofession at almost twice the rate of general educators. Statistics \nconcerning the amount of time special education teachers spend \ncompleting paperwork are telling. 53 percent of special education \nteachers report that routine duties and paperwork interfere with their \njob to a great extent. They spend an average of five hours per week on \npaperwork, compared to general education teachers who spend an average \nof two hours per week. More than 60 percent of special education \nteachers spend a half to one and a half days a week completing \npaperwork. One of the biggest sources of paperwork, the individualized \neducation program, IEP, averages between 8 and 16 pages long, and 83 \npercent of special education teachers report spending from a half to \none and a half days each week in IEP-relating meetings.\n  One special education teacher expressed her frustration with \nexcessive paperwork to me. ``I began my professional career as a \nlawyer, but found that I had a passion for interacting with and helping \nstudents and became a teacher. However, I decided last year that I \ncould no longer work with special education students from my district. \nI came this decision reluctantly and solely on the basis of the \nincreasing and burdensome amount of paperwork required for special \neducation summer services. As a teacher, your job is to interact, \nteach, and participate in a student's learning experience, in \nparticular that of a student of special needs. As a result of the \npaperwork and fear of lawsuits by school districts, I am no longer able \nto interact with my students.''\n  There are three primary factors associated with burdensome paperwork. \nThe first factor is federal regulations. The 1997 IDEA regulations set \nforth the necessary components of the IEP and require teachers to \ncomplete an array of paperwork in addition to the IEP. According to the \nNational School Boards Association, NSBA, ``These requirements result \nin consuming substantial hours per child and cumulatively are having a \nnegative impact on special educators and their function.'' Second, \nthere are misconceptions at the state and local levels regarding \nFederal regulations that result in additional requirements imposed by \nthe States and local school districts. The U.S. Department of Education \ncompiled a sample IEP with all the necessary components, and it is five \npages long. However, most IEPs are much longer. The third factor is \nlitigation and the threat of litigation. In order to be prepared for \ndue process hearings and court proceedings, school district officials \noften require extensive documentation so that they are able to prove \nthat a free appropriate public education, FAPE, was provided to the \nspecial education student.\n  A key provision of the bill makes mediation mandatory for all legal \ndisputes related to IEPs. There are several benefits to using mediation \nas an\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\nalternative to due process hearings and court proceedings. According to \nthe Consortium for Appropriate Dispute Resolution in Special Education, \nCADRE, mediation is a constructive option for children, parents, and \nteachers and allows families to maintain a positive relationship with \nteachers and service providers. Parents have the benefit of working \ntogether with educator and service providers as partners instead of as \nadversaries. If an agreement cannot be reached as a result of \nmediation, parties to the dispute would retain existing due process and \nlegal options.\n  Mediation is also a much less costly, less time consuming alternative \nfor all parties concerned. Parents do not have to pay for mediation \nsessions, because under the 1997 IDEA amendments, States are required \nto bear the cost for mediation. States and local districts save a lot \nof money as well. According to the Michigan Special Education Mediation \nProgram, MSEMP, the average hearing cost to the state is $40,000; it \npays approximately $700 per mediation session. The NSBA reports that \nattorney fees for school districts average between $10,000 to $25,000. \nIn contrast, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Education says that it pays \nmediators $250 per session. The cost effectiveness of mediation is \napparent. Not only does mediation save money, it saves time as well. \nAccording to the Washington State Department of Education, a mediation \nsession may generally be scheduled within 14 days of a parental \nrequest, whereas it may take up to a year to secure a court date.\n  Most importantly, mediation is a successful alternative to due \nprocess hearings. At least some form of agreement is reached in 80 \npercent of sessions nationwide. In Pennsylvania, 85 percent of \nvoluntary special education mediations end in agreement in which both \nparties are satisfied. According to the New York State Dispute \nResolution Association, mediation ending in resolution of the conflict \noccurs for 75 percent of referrals, and in Wisconsin, approximately 84 \npercent of those who chose mediation would use it again.\n  The Teacher Paperwork Reduction Act is meant to alleviate a serious \nproblem that causes frustration and discouragement among dedicated \nspecial education teachers who expend energy and countless hours in \norder to give students with disabilities an equal opportunity to learn. \nIt is only fair and right to find ways to reduce paperwork in order to \ngive teachers more time to spend educating our students and changing \ntheir lives, and less time wading through stacks of paper. I would \ninvite my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this legislation to \nhelp teachers, schools, and parents provide a better education for all \nstudents so that no child is left behind.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Shelby, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 627.

A bill to require the construction at Arlington National \nCemetery of a memorial to the crew of the Columbia Orbiter; ordered \nheld at the desk.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, on February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle \nColumbia was lost during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. We all mourn \nthat tragic loss. But although our hearts have been filled with sorrow, \nwe have also taken comfort in the knowledge that there was so much \nabout these heroic astronauts for us to be grateful for.\n  They were, indeed, remarkable people for they truly represented the \nbest of the human spirit. As such, it is only fitting that we endeavor \nto remember them for their outstanding contributions.\n  Today, along with Senators Bond and Mikulski, I introduce legislation \nto construct a memorial to the crew of the Columbia  Orbiter at \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  This memorial would be located in close proximity to the memorial to \nthe crew of the Challenger Orbiter at Arlington Cemetery and that the \ndesign\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\nof the Columbia Memorial is intended to be consistent with the artistic \nsensibilities of the Challenger Memorial.\n  This legislation would authorize the Secretary of the Army, in \nconsultation with NASA, to place the Columbia Memorial at Arlington and \nwould make available $500,000 from funds already appropriated in the \nFiscal Year 2003 DOD Appropriations Act for the Memorial.\n  The bill also authorizes NASA to collect gifts and donations for the \nColumbia Memorial at Arlington Cemetery or for another appropriate \nmemorial or monument. This authority to collect donations and gifts \nexpires after 5 years.\n  We will never forget the wonderful legacy of the Columbia  \nastronauts. They have been an inspiration to us all.\n  Lastly, I take this opportunity to invite any Senator to join with me \nin cosponsoring this legislation to establish this memorial to these \noutstanding individuals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be held at the desk until the \nclose of business Wednesday, March 19, so that such Senators will be \nshown as original cosponsors of this legislation. It is my further hope \nthat this bill will be speedily cleared on each side of the aisle so \nthat it may be sent to the House next week, if at all possible. I send \nthe bill to the desk, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The bill \nwill be held at the desk until the close of business, Wednesday, March \n19.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S.J.

Mr. President, today I introduce a Senate companion to \na joint resolution already introduced in the House by Congressman \nSherrod Brown of Ohio.\n  This resolution is quite simple. It requires the President to report \nto Congress on the potential costs and consequences of military action \nin Iraq before ordering the United States Armed Forces to war in Iraq. \nThis is a resolution that simply requires that this country know what \nit is we are getting into before, not after, war breaks out.\n  Of course, it is my hope, and I very much believe the President when \nhe asserts that it is his hope, that there will be no war. But judging \nfrom the administration's statements and Iraq's behavior, with each \npassing day it becomes more and more likely that the United States will \nengage in a major military operation in Iraq. It is entirely possible \nthat we will undertake this operation without a great deal of \ninternational support. And while I have no doubt in my mind that our \nadmirable men and women in uniform will be successful in any military \nengagement, I do have doubts about whether or not the American people \ntruly understand the magnitude of the task the country is setting for \nitself--not only with regard to the military engagement itself, but \nwith regard to occupation and reconstruction.\n  I do not believe that Americans have been told much about what the \nfuture holds beyond the most optimistic of scenarios, and frankly I do \nnot believe that Congress has heard much about the full range of \npotential scenarios either.\n  This resolution would require that the President provide that \ninformation before ordering our men and women in uniform to war in \nIraq.\n  The resolution asks for a full accounting of the implications for \nhomeland security of initiating military action against Iraq. It asks \nfor an accounting of the implications for the fight against terrorism. \nIt asks for an accounting of the implications for regional stability in \nthe Middle East, and for an accounting of the implications of war in \nIraq for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  This resolution recognizes that there may be positive and negative \nimplications to consider. It does not pre-judge these issues. But it \ndoes acknowledge that Members of Congress, the elected representatives \nof the people, should be privy to the thinking of our experts and \nleaders in the executive branch about the effect of war in Iraq on all \nof these issues. It is our responsibility to weigh these questions, to \nweigh the consequences of starting a war.\n  And, while I do not doubt for a moment the skills and competence of \nour brave service men and women, I do know that their efforts alone are \nnot enough to ensure a lasting victory. It is crucial to the ultimate \nsuccess of U.S. policy, that the American people understand the \npotential risks and the potential rewards of this national undertaking. \nWe are considering the American military occupation of a major Middle \nEastern country, and we are considering this in a very dangerous time. \nThis country must have its eyes open before we move forward.\n  This resolution also requires that the administration explain to \nCongress the steps that the United States and our allies will take to \nensure that any and all weapons of mass destruction will be safeguarded \nfrom dispersal to other rogue states or international terrorist \norganizations. If the goal is disarmament, then defeating Saddam \nHussein's forces is not going to accomplish the mission at hand. Do we \nknow where the WMD sites are? One would assume that we would share that \ninformation with the inspectors if we had it. But if we do not, how \nwill we ensure that WMD and the means to make them are not dispersed \nacross Iraq's borders, or sold off to the highest bidder, in the event \nof invasion. Saddam Huessein's order is despicable and dangerous. But \ndisorder is dangerous too. Again, we need to understand the risks, and \nwe need to understand the plan.\n\n  This resolution requires the Administration to explain the plan for \nstabilization and reconstruction. Earlier this week the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee held a hearing on reconstruction in Iraq. We had \nhoped to get answers to some of the basic questions that senior \nofficials from the State and Defense Departments were utterly unable to \nrespond to as recently as February. But the Administration canceled the \nappearance of General Jay Garner, the director for the Pentagon's \nOffice of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, who was slated to \ncome before the committee. And so the Foreign Relations Committee of \nthe United States Senate is left scanning the newspapers to get a sense \nof Administration plans, extrapolating from tidbits in the press to \nunderstand potential costs, and quizzing very capable experts--but \nexperts not privy to Administration planning--about the universe of \npossibilities. This is simply unacceptable.\n  This resolution calls for the Administration to clearly report to \nCongress on the nature and extent of the international support for \nmilitary action against Iraq and the impact of military action against \nIraq on allied support for the broader war on terrorism. I believe that \nthis is the single most important issue before us. I know that I \ndisagree with some of my colleagues on the wisdom of the \nAdministration's policy in Iraq. But I am certain that none of us \ndisagree on the proposition that the first priority of all of us in \ngovernment must be the fight against terrorism. And we all know that we \ncannot fight terrorism alone. But I have heard directly from foreign \nofficials who are telling me that it will be more difficult for them to \nbe strong supporters of the fight against terrorism if the U.S. acts in \nIraq without the United Nations' approval.\n  This resolution calls on the Administration to explain clearly the \nsteps that it will take to protect United States soldiers, allied \nforces, and Iraqi civilians from any known or suspected environmental \nhazards resulting from military operations. Everyone in this body has \nheard from veterans of the Gulf War who suffer and struggle even today, \nlong after their period of sacrifice for their country should have \nended. Based on what we know from these veterans, it is entirely \nreasonable to demand a plan now, not after the fact.\n  The resolution also calls for the Administration to provide estimates \nof the American and allied military casualties, Iraqi military \ncasualties, and Iraqi civilian casualties resulting from military \naction against Iraq, and measures that will be taken to prevent \ncivilian casualties and adhere to international humanitarian law. I \nknow that America is a resilient society and a resolute society. But I \nam not at all\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\nsure that Americans have been prepared for anything but the best-case \nscenario, and that is a disservice to the American people and a \ndisservice to our military.\n  This resolution calls for an estimate of the full costs associated \nwith military action against Iraq, including, but not limited to, \nproviding humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people and to neighboring \nnations in light of possible refugee flows, reconstructing Iraq with or \nwithout allied support, and securing long-term political stability in \nIraq and the region insofar as it is affected by such military action. \nI can tell you that right now in the Budget committee, we are flying \nblind, trying to make fiscally responsible decisions for the future \nwhile the Administration remains unwilling to provide an honest \naccounting of what this war will cost, or what it will cost to meet the \nhumanitarian needs of Iraq, or what the long process of reconstruction \nwill cost. We know that these are not small figures. And unfortunately, \nit looks as though we will be proceeding without a great deal of \ninternational support, meaning less burden-sharing and more shouldering \nof this cost on our own. And that is why this resolution also calls for \nan accounting of the anticipated short and long term effects of \nmilitary action on the United States economy and the Federal budget.\n\n  I feel strongly that we should have demanded this information long \nago. But we continue to ask, because Congress continues to have \nconstitutional responsibilities. And I continue to hear from a \ntremendous number of my constituents who are deeply concerned about the \nprospect of a war with Iraq. The sources of their concern and their \nviews on the issue vary, but in virtually all cases, they want to \nunderstand the range of options before us, and they are demanding more \ninformation about the costs and commitments they will incur as a result \nof decisions that we make here. They are right to insist on that \ninformation, to insist that we exercise some foresight here and wrestle \nhonestly with the consequences that may follow from taking military \naction. Without such a discussion, we cannot hope to answer the most \nimportant question before us--will a given course of action make the \nU.S. more or less secure in the end.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and to insist that \nthe Administration provide this information before war breaks out. I \nvoted against the resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq last \nfall, because I was uncomfortable with the Administration's shifting \njustifications for war, dissatisfied with the vague answers available \nat the time relating to our plans for dealing with weapons of mass \ndestruction and reconstruction in Iraq, and most of all, because I was \nconcerned that this action would actually alienate key allies in the \nfight against terrorism. But even those who voted differently surely \nmust believe that we have a responsibility to anwser these questions \nnow, and to share the answers with our constituents, so that this great \ncountry is operating not on wishful thinking or simple ignorance, but \nwith an understanding of the facts before us, and the awesome task \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3749-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 83--COMMENDING THE SERVICE OF DR.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Zuni Indian Tribe Water \n     Rights Settlement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States, in keeping with \n     its trust responsibility to Indian tribes, to promote Indian \n     self-determination, religious freedom, political and cultural \n     integrity, and economic self-sufficiency, and to settle, \n     wherever possible, the water rights claims of Indian tribes \n     without lengthy and costly litigation.\n       (2) Quantification of rights to water and development of \n     facilities needed to use tribal water supplies effectively is \n     essential to the development of viable Indian reservation \n     communities, particularly in arid western States.\n       (3) On August 28, 1984, and by actions subsequent thereto, \n     the United States established a reservation for the Zuni \n     Indian Tribe in Apache County, Arizona upstream from the \n     confluence of the Little Colorado and Zuni Rivers for long-\n     standing religious and sustenance activities.\n       (4) The water rights of all water users in the Little \n     Colorado River basin in Arizona have been in litigation since \n     1979, in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and \n     for the County of Apache in Civil No. 6417, In re The General \n     Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the Little \n     Colorado River System and Source.\n       (5) Recognizing that the final resolution of the Zuni \n     Indian Tribe's water claims through litigation will take many \n     years and entail great expense to all parties, continue to \n     limit the Tribe's access to water with economic, social, and \n     cultural consequences to the Tribe, prolong uncertainty as to \n     the availability of water supplies, and seriously impair the \n     long-term economic planning and development of all parties, \n     the Tribe and neighboring non-Indians have sought to settle \n     their disputes to water and reduce the burdens of litigation.\n       (6) After more than 4 years of negotiations, which included \n     participation by representatives of the United States, the \n     Zuni Indian Tribe, the State of Arizona, and neighboring non-\n     Indian communities in the Little Colorado River basin, the \n     parties have entered into a Settlement Agreement to resolve \n     all of the Zuni Indian Tribe's water rights claims and to \n     assist the Tribe in acquiring surface water rights, to \n     provide for the Tribe's use of groundwater, and to provide \n     for the wetland restoration of the Tribe's lands in Arizona.\n       (7) To facilitate the wetland restoration project \n     contemplated under the Settlement Agreement, the Zuni Indian \n     Tribe acquired certain lands along the Little Colorado River \n     near or adjacent to its Reservation that are important for \n     the success of the project and will likely acquire a small \n     amount of similarly situated additional lands. The parties \n     have agreed not to object to the United States taking title \n     to certain of these lands into trust status; other lands \n     shall remain in tribal fee status. The parties have worked \n     extensively to resolve various governmental concerns \n     regarding use of and control over those lands, and to provide \n     a successful model for these types of situations, the State, \n     local, and tribal governments intend to enter into an \n     Intergovernmental Agreement that addresses the parties' \n     governmental concerns.\n       (8) Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the neighboring \n     non-Indian entities will assist in the Tribe's acquisition of \n     surface water rights and development of groundwater, store \n     surface water supplies for the Zuni Indian Tribe, and make \n     substantial additional contributions to carry out the \n     Settlement Agreement's provisions.\n       (9) To advance the goals of Federal Indian policy and \n     consistent with the trust responsibility of the United States \n     to the Tribe, it is appropriate that the United States \n     participate in the implementation of the Settlement Agreement \n     and contribute funds for the rehabilitation of religious \n     riparian areas and other purposes to enable the Tribe to use \n     its water entitlement in developing its Reservation.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to approve, ratify, and confirm the Settlement \n     Agreement entered into by the Tribe and neighboring non-\n     Indians;\n       (2) to authorize and direct the Secretary of the Interior \n     to execute and perform the Settlement Agreement and related \n     waivers;\n       (3) to authorize and direct the United States to take legal \n     title and hold such title to certain lands in trust for the \n     benefit of the Zuni Indian Tribe; and\n       (4) to authorize the actions, agreements, and \n     appropriations as provided for in the Settlement Agreement \n     and this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 85, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 85) expressing the \n     sense of the Congress with regard to the need for improved \n     fire safety in nonresidential buildings in the aftermath of \n     the tragic fire on February 20, 2003, at a nightclub in West \n     Warwick, Rhode Island.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, yesterday the House passed H. Con. Res.85, a \nresolution paying respect to the victims of the tragic nightclub fire \non February 20, 2003 in West Warwick, RI, and expressing the sense of \nCongress regarding the need for improved fire safety in buildings used \nby the public. I thank my colleagues for expediting consideration of \nthis important resolution in the Senate today.\n  The West Warwick fire is a devastating loss that has affected the \nlives of thousands of Rhode Islanders. Mr. President, 99 people have \ndied, and nearly 190 people were injured, many of whom are still in \nhospitals in critical condition.\n  In the first minutes and hours of this tragedy, our firefighters, \npolice, and emergency medical personnel performed heroically under \nhorrific circumstances, as did many of the patrons who were at the \nscene and helped to save others.\n  I want to express my heartfelt condolences to the many families of \nthose who perished in the West Warwick fire, and to let them know that \nour thoughts and prayers are with them and with the survivors who will \nstruggle with the physical and mental toll of this horrible event for \nthe rest of their lives.\n  This was a catastrophe brought on by a series of bad decisions. Fault \nwill be sorted out in time, but there are already lessons learned.\n  State and local officials across the country are, and should be, \nreexamining their fire and building codes and stepping up enforcement \nof safety practices in public buildings to make sure that a tragedy \nlike this does not happen again. Congress should do everything it can \nto support this effort and to encourage both state and local \ngovernments and federal agencies to adopt and strictly enforce the most \ncurrent fire and building consensus codes.\n  In addition, as our nation continues to fight the war on terror, the \nresponse to the West Warwick fire provides a good illustration of how \nfar we've come--and how far we have to go--in improving our emergency \nmanagement capabilities. Local first responders were on the scene \nwithin minutes to help rescue victims, treat the injured, and fight the \ntremendous blaze that consumed the Station nightclub. As casualties \ncontinued to mount, the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency \ncoordinated the massive rescue and recovery efforts by state and local \nagencies from Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. Several \nhospitals in Rhode Island and Massachusetts received scores of victims \nsuffering from severe burns and smoke inhalation, many of whom remain \nin critical condition today.\n  There is no question that the response to the West Warwick fire was \nbetter than it would have been before September 11, 2001, thanks to our \nstate's efforts over the past 18 months to strengthen emergency \npreparedness. Federal assistance in this regard has helped, including \nequipment and training grants from the Department of Justice's Office \nof Domestic Preparedness, FIRE Grants from the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, and bioterror preparedness grants from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, which included funding to \ncreate regional hospital plans to respond to terrorism.\n  But we can do better. As tragic as the West Warwick fire was, it was \na localized event involving deaths and injuries in the hundreds rather \nthan thousands, yet it overwhelmed our state's emergency response \nsystems and hospital emergency room capacity. Assistance from \nsurrounding states and Federal agencies was required to manage the \nimmense tasks of emergency response, medical care, and identifying \nscores of bodies.\n  Rhode Island and other states, with the support of the Federal \nGovernment, will continue our efforts to strengthen the security of our \nhomeland, and we will apply the hard lessons learned in West Warwick \nabout safety in public buildings.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for supporting this important \nresolution to urge state and local officials and owners of \nentertainment facilities to examine their safety practices, fire codes, \nand enforcement capabilities to ensure that such a tragedy never \nbefalls any community again.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, 3 weeks ago--on a cold winter evening--\nseveral hundred people gathered at the Station nightclub, a popular \nvenue for live bands in West Warwick, RI. They had come to spend time \nwith friends and to listen to music. Too quickly, this festive occasion \nturned to horror.\n  A local television cameraman--who ironically was there to shoot \nfootage for a news story on nightclub safety--captured the scene in an \nextraordinary piece of video that will haunt Rhode Islanders for many \nyears. A pyrotechnic display on stage ignited nearby soundproofing \nmaterial, and the flames spread through the nightclub with shocking \nspeed. By most estimates, it took only 2 minutes--2 minutes--from the \nmoment that soundproofing caught fire, until the building was engulfed \nin flames and filled with superheated, toxic, black smoke.\n  As this disaster unfolded, heroic emergency personnel rushed to the \nrescue, placing their own lives in jeopardy. Eyewitness accounts \ndescribed amazing acts of bravery at the scene. Firefighters saved \ndozens of men and women, whom they pulled from the doorways and windows \nof the burning building. Meanwhile, EMTs did their best to stabilize \nthose who were gravely injured and worked with the police to help bring \norder to the prevailing chaos.\n  Rhode Island is blessed with a network of fine hospitals, several of \nwhich have received national recognition for the quality of their care. \nOn that night, medical teams provided the best treatment for the \ninjured, many of whom have a long recovery ahead. At Rhode Island \nHospital--which received 65 fire victims, nearly all at once--an entire \nfloor was converted into a burn unit overnight. Surgeons, nurses, \ntechnicians and other support staff must have been overwhelmed by the \ntrauma, but they persevered.\n  Rhode Island's new Governor, Don Carcieri has been brilliant in \nmanaging the State's response to this crisis. Less than 2 months after \ntaking office, Governor Carcieri has demonstrated remarkable leadership \nabilities in the aftermath of the fire. His efforts came at a critical \ntime and helped ensure that every public official delivered a \nconsistent, productive message.\n  Whether speaking to all Rhode Islanders at a televised press \nconference or visiting quietly with grieving families, Governor \nCarcieri has emerged as a strong, reassuring presence during a very \ndifficult time for Rhode Island. He has expressed our anger at what \nwhen wrong, and our compassion for the victims and their loved ones.\n  Federal agencies also responded immediately to this enormous tragedy. \nI am grateful for all of the assistance that Rhode Island has received \nthus far: from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  My family and I extend our heartfelt sympathy to the families at this \ntime of great sadness. I hope they will take some comfort in knowing \nthat even with a population of more than 1 million people, Rhode Island \nis small enough that its citizens consider one another as neighbors. \nThat sense of closeness--developed over decades of shared experiences, \nboth joyful and sorrowful--binds us together and is part of what makes \nRhode Island unique among the States.\n  Those connections are especially strongly felt in small towns and \nvillages, such as Potowomut, where my\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n\nfamily has made its home for many years. Potowomut is a close-knit \ncommunity, somewhat isolated from the rest of the city of Warwick and \nRhode Island--on a peninsula that juts out into Narragansett Bay. \nSadly, a fellow Potowomut resident, Tracy King, was among those who \nperished in the fire.\n  Tracy was working at the Station nightclub on the night of the fire, \nand as least initially, managed to escape the blaze. Once outside, \nhowever, he rushed back into the building to help others scramble to \nsafety. Tracy was a tall, powerful man--always bursting with energy--\nand I am certain that he helped save some lives. I share in the \nheartbreak that all of Tracy's friends feel, knowing that he did not \nmake it back out in time.\n  In recent years, Tracy had achieved a measure of fame in Rhode \nIsland, as he had an unusual talent for balancing large, heavy objects \non his chin--Christmas trees, ladders, desks--even a refrigerator--all \nbalanced perfectly on his chin.\n  In 1993, he appeared on ``The Late Show with David Letterman,'' and \nbalanced a 17-foot canoe. Imagine that--a 17-foot canoe, straight up in \nthe air! Tracy was a wonderful entertainer, and he especially enjoyed \nperforming for groups of children. He generously shared his talent at \nlocal festivals, schools, and hospitals--everyone delighted in seeing \nhim in action.\n  Tracy King leaves behind his wife, Evelyn, and three sons--Joshua, \nJacob, and Jordan. I ask my colleagues to remember the King family in \ntheir prayers.\n  We also remember that there are many other families in Rhode Island, \nand across the State line in Massachusetts, that are still coping with \nthis sudden, traumatic loss. In the days following the fire, survivors \nand family members of those who had died or been injured gathered \ntogether to mourn, to ask questions, and to share their stories. May \nthey continue to draw strength from one another, and be sustained by \nthe enduring support of their community.\n  The Senate is considering this concurrent resolution recently \napproved in the House, cosponsored by my colleagues in the Rhode Island \ndelegation, expressing the importance of improved fire safety in \nnonresidential buildings in the aftermath of this tragic fire. I urge \nadoption of the resolution.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action \nor debate, and that any statements relating to this measure be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 85) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/13/senate-section/article/S3761-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 87, introduced \nearlier today by Senator Nelson of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 87) commemorating the Centennial \n     Anniversary of the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. 100 years ago tomorrow, President Theodore \nRoosevelt ordered that a small island in Florida's Indian River be \nforever protected as a ``preserve and breeding ground for native \nbirds.'' With this simple promise of wildlife protection, the National \nWildlife Refuge System was born. A century later, the refuge system has \ngrown to include more that 530 refuges on more than 94 million acres \nwith locations in every state.\n  Florida's National Wildlife Refuges have been fulfilling the promise \nof protecting wildlife for a full century. Pelican Island, the first \nrefuge, is being restored to its original size so that birds may be \nable to find refuge there for the next hundred years. Archie Carr \nNational Wildlife Refuge in Titusville protects endangered sea turtles \nso they have an undisturbed place to lay their eggs. And, Florida \nPanther National Wildlife Refuge in Naples is protecting our state \nanimal, the Florida Panther, which is on the brink of extinction.\n  The National Wildlife Refuges in Florida have been protecting more \nthan just animals. As part of the greater Everglades ecosystem, Ten \nThousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge and the Arthur R. Marshall \nLoxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge are protecting both the wildlife \nand habitats that make up part of America's Everglades.\n  Florida is a destination for sportsmen and nature lovers throughout \nthe world. Be they avid hunters or fishermen or tourists traveling to \nvisit our unsurpassed beaches or the pristine beauty of Florida's \ninterior, the National Wildlife Refuge System is part of the allure, \nwith facilities and locations to cater to any person who wants to visit \nnature.\n  Nationwide, more than 35 million people visit national wildlife \nrefuges to see some of the world's most amazing wildlife spectacles, or \nto fish, hunt, photograph nature, and learn about our natural and \ncultural history.\n  The centennial anniversary of the National Wildlife Refuge System is \na time to celebrate these natural treasures and recognize their value \nto our society. Today there is a celebration of Pelican Island to \ncommemorate this historic day. Throughout the year, there will be other \ncelebrations in honor of 100 years of successful preservation. Because \nNational Wildlife Refuges have been such an important part of the \necological preservation of our nation, I joined with my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Nelson, in sponsoring a resolution that would reaffirm \nthe strong support that the National Wildlife Refuge System enjoys in \nthis body.\n\n[[Page S3762]]\n\n  National Wildlife Refuges are a key component of our nation's \nconservation network. Because of the establishment of the Refuge \nSystem, wildlife of all types have a safe place to live and human \nbeings have a place to interact with the wildlife and nature in an \necologically responsible way. The National Wildlife Refuge System has \nhad a successful 100 years and I hope we can continue to support the \nsystem so it prospers for the next 100 years.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues from Florida in \ncommemorating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the National \nWildlife Refuge System. One hundred years ago, President Teddy \nRoosevelt established the first wildlife refuge, Florida's 3-acre \nPelican Island. This small beginning has given rise to more than 500 \nNational Wildlife Refuges throughout our country, demonstrating that \nAmericans want unique places for wildlife to flourish and allow for \nrecreation.\n  While Florida is home to the first refuge, my state of Vermont home \nto two refuges, the Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge and the Silvio \nO. Conte National Wildlife Refuge.\n  The Missisquoi Refuge, founded in 1943, was established to provide a \nresting feeding area for migratory waterfowl, and as a general wildlife \nrefuge. It spans 6,592 acres on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain. It \nis a mix of hardwood forests and open fields and home to the largest \nheron rookery in Vermont. More than 200,000 ducks converge on the \nrefuge each fall and most of Vermont's black terns nest on the refuge. \nOsprey nest on the refuge and Missisquoi River and the shoreline of \nLake Champlain provide outstanding fishing opportunities.\n  Our Silvio O. Conte Refuge, founded in 1997, is shared with New \nHampshire and Massachusetts. It was established to protect the \nabundance and diversity of native species throughout the 7.2 million-\nacre Connecticut River watershed. In addition to protecting rare \nspecies, native plants and animals and their habitat, managers of this \nrefuge are working with partners throughout New England to help control \ninvasive species.\n  The wildlife and recreation opportunities provided by our refugees \nare made possible by the dedication of the Fish and Wildlife Service \nemployees, who I could like to congratulate today. Without their \nexpertise and dedication to providing visitors with hunting, fishing, \nwildlife observation, photography, interpretation and environmental \neducation opportunities, our refuge system would not be enjoying the \nsuccess we are celebrating today. They provided this public service to \nmore than 55,000 annual visitors at our 2 refugees and I hope that \nthese classrooms of natural continue to provide children and adult \nalike a unique educational experience.\n  In addition, I would like to acknowledge the thousands of volunteers \nnationwide who give their time and expertise to making the National \nWildlife Refuge experience a memorable one for all of us.\n  Congratulations to all involved in the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem.\n  Mr. BENNETT.
