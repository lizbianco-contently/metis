Mr. President, in a moment we will proceed to the \nconference report to accompany the FSC/ETI, or JOBS bill. It is my \nunderstanding that we would be unable to reach a time agreement on the \nconference report, and therefore I will file a cloture motion on it \nthis morning.\n  Immediately after filing of that cloture, we will begin the vote on \ninvoking cloture on the McConnell-Reid substitute amendment to the \nintelligence reform and homeland security resolution. The managers made \nsubstantial progress over the course of yesterday and last night. At \nthis juncture, we are down to only a handful of amendments.\n  Senators who do have amendments remaining should stay close to the \nChamber this morning as we hope to move quickly on the underlying \nresolution. If Members are not timely in coming to offer their \namendments, we will be moving to adoption of the resolution.\n  At this juncture, we really should have no delay. Every hour that we \ndelay over the course of today means an hour later before we adjourn, \nwhether that is later tonight or tomorrow or the next day. We need to \nmove on to complete the remaining legislative items before our \nadjournment. As we all know, the clock is working against us.\n  We will finish the pending intelligence reform resolution. We will \nfinish the FSC/ETI conference report. We will finish the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations conference report. Finally, we also expect to \nfinish the Department of Defense authorization conference report.\n  Obviously, from those four items you can see we have a lot to do, a \nfull plate of business before our adjournment. Yet all of these can be \nhandled expeditiously, but it is going to take the cooperation of each \nand every one of our Members. Individual Members are going to be able \nto determine whether we have to continue to work through the weekend, \nincluding Saturday and Sunday, to complete our business.\n\n  I don't believe, if you look at it and you look at where each of \nthese four items is, that it is necessary for it to take that long. We \ncan very efficiently work through these items, but every Senator is \ngoing to have to cooperate. If not, it will be necessary to continue \nlate tonight, Saturday, and possibly Sunday with these four items we \nmust complete before adjourning.\n  We will be voting throughout today and, if necessary, tomorrow and \ninto Sunday. I believe we could finish all of this even late today if \nSenators focus on it and work together. Again, we need to finish all \nfour items before we adjourn.\n  I will be happy to yield for a moment to the Democratic leader before \nproceeding to the FSC conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10763-6", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond).

I have been wanting to give these \nSenate remarks as in morning business ever since yesterday.\n\n\n                       Medicare Modernization Act\n\n  Mr. President, over the past few weeks several of our colleagues on \nthe\n\n[[Page S10765]]\n\nother side of the aisle have given rousing statements on health care.\n  There is no question that health care is of paramount importance on \nAmerican families. On that we can all agree.\n  I am sure it will come as no surprise that I disagree with a number \nof points my colleagues have raised. In fact, some of their allegations \nare just plain wrong, particularly with respect to the Medicare \nprescription drug law which I helped to negotiate.\n  I was a member of the tripartisan group that came up with a bill that \nI think would have been supported by the 20 Democrats at the time. I \nhave been working on this ever since and was on the conference \ncommittee, sat in for days, weeks, and months on that conference \ncommittee to negotiate this bill.\n  It is mind-boggling some Senators seem willing to sacrifice the \nhealth and well-being of beneficiaries by spreading mistruths about the \nlaw. These mistruths could cause a beneficiary to forego learning more \nabout provisions in the law that could really help, such as the \nMedicare-approved discount card program which study after study shows \nis delivering real savings, or the voluntary Part D benefits that begin \nin 2006.\n  This continued misinformation and set of damaging attacks are a \ntremendous disservice to Medicare beneficiaries. So I wanted to take \nthis opportunity to set the record straight.\n  Opponents have characterized the Medicare law as a failure for \nbeneficiaries. What poppycock. To me, we would have failed had we not \npassed the Medicare Modernization Act, had we not given \nbeneficiaries what they need, meaningful prescription drug coverage and \na stronger Medicare Program.\n\n  Let me highlight a few areas in which we need to set the record \nstraight. The first is the cost estimates of the MMA. I will refer to \nthis bill, the Medicare Modernization Act, from here on in as the MMA. \nThat means the Medicare Modernization Act.\n  Let me talk about cost estimates. The central theme echoed by those \nwho seek to discredit the new Medicare law is the allegation that the \nadministration hid the true cost of the Medicare law from the Congress \nbefore the final vote.\n  This is simply political election year hyperbole.\n  The opponents of the drug benefit have made this claim because the \ncomplete and final cost estimate from the CMS Office of the Actuary was \nnot finished before the vote took place.\n  Let's be clear, the administration's cost estimate was not withheld \nfrom Congress because there was not a final cost estimate from CMS to \nwithhold. The CMS cost estimate was not even completed until December \n23, 2003--long after the House and Senate vote, long after the bill was \nsigned into law. So let's get rid of that argument right off the bat \nbecause it is a false, fallacious argument.\n  Rick Foster, the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services confirmed these facts to us earlier this year in a \nFinance Committee briefing and we all know that. Even after that \nbriefing, however, some chose to continue this erroneous attack, \nperhaps because they did not take the time to attend the briefing. To \nme, this is but another indication of election year hyperbole.\n  Let me also be clear that we did have the official cost estimate on \nthe Medicare bill before the vote. That estimate, as my colleagues are \nwell aware, is the one from the Congressional Budget Office, not CMS. \nThat is what binds us. That cost estimate, our official cost estimate, \nby the entity we rely on in Congress, was available to every Member of \nCongress before the measure was presented to either the House or the \nSenate.\n  No one should doubt that we had the true cost estimate for the \nprescription drug bill last year, and everyone in this body and the \nother body had access to it before the vote.\n  There also have been claims that the administration changes its cost \nestimate. Again, that is not the case. The President's mid-session \nreview did update the estimates of Medicare outlays, but it did not \nchange the estimate of the Medicare Modernization Act, the MMA.\n  In fact, Rick Foster, the CMS actuary, has said you simply cannot add \nthe change in estimated outlays to the MMA estimate and declare you \nhave a new estimate.\n  Apparently, Mr. Foster's words, the words of a trained actuary, don't \nmatter to some of these so-called critics. If opponents of the Medicare \nbill value his opinion of cost estimates so highly, why do they ignore \nhim now? That is amazing to me. They will quote part of what he said--\nbut ignore the other part of what he said. Mr. Foster has said that the \nMMA estimate has not changed; but despite that, opponents of the MMA \nhave wrongly claimed that it did.\n\n  Again, it is just political hyperbole. We had--and have--the true \ncost estimates from CBO. Case closed. That is what we have to rely on \nin the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Now let me address the accusations that the bill prohibits Medicare \nfrom negotiations with drug companies. This is another one of the \nfallacious things that enemies of the bill have been spewing forth.\n  Those who make this charge imply, wrongly, that the price charged to \nbeneficiaries is not subject to negotiation. That could not be further \nfrom the truth. The truth is, Medicare prescription drug plans will be \nnegotiating with drug makers. These negotiations are the very heart of \nthe new Medicare drug benefit.\n  The absurd claim that the Government will not be negotiating with \ndrug makers comes from a non-interference clause in the Medicare law.\n  This noninterference clause does not prohibit Medicare from \nnegotiating with drug makers. It prohibits CMS from interfering in \nthose negotiations. That is a far cry from some of the fallacious \nstatements that have been made on this floor.\n  Let me be clear, the non-interference clause is at the heart of the \nbill's structure for delivering prescription drug benefits. This clause \nensures those savings will result from market competition, rather than \nthrough price fixing by the CMS bureaucracy. That is what was behind \nthis. Let's not distort these provisions.\n  What is ironic about the minority charges on this provision--some in \nthe minority; not all in the minority would agree with some of these \nfallacious charges--but what is ironic about these minority charges by \nsome on this provision is that the same non-interference clause was in \nthe Daschle-Kennedy-Rockefeller bill and the Gephardt-Dingell-Stark \nbills in the year 2000.\n  I hate to say this, but if my memory serves me correctly, these are \nleading Democrats in the Senate and in the House. They are not \nRepublicans. It is the same provision that is being condemned by some \nin this body through hyperbole, political hyperbole. In fact, I want to \nread this to you:\n\n       In administering the prescription drug benefit program \n     established under this part, the Secretary may not--(1) \n     require a particular formulary or institute a price structure \n     for benefits; (2) interfere in any way with negotiations \n     between private entities and drug manufacturers, or \n     wholesalers; or (3) otherwise interfere with the competitive \n     nature of providing a prescription drug benefit through \n     private entities.\n\n  Now, what is the source of that language? It is from S. 2541, the \nMedicare Expansion for Needed Drugs, or MEND, Act, introduced in 2000 \nby Senator Daschle and cosponsored by 33 Democrats, including Senator \nKerry. Think about it, some of the very people who are criticizing the \nMMA, that passed overwhelmingly in both Houses of Congress.\n  I find it curious that this approach, which is mislabeled as \n``preventing Medicare from negotiating,'' was fine in the year 2000 \nwhen the Democrats were putting forth a bill, but not fine when enacted \ninto law by a Republican President and a Republican Congress in 2003.\n  I must remind my colleagues that Senator Daschle, the distinguished \nSenator from South Dakota, once said:\n\n       Our plan gives seniors the bargaining power that comes with \n     numbers. . . . Our plan mirrors the best practices used in \n     the private sector. For beneficiaries in traditional \n     Medicare, prescription drug coverage would be delivered by \n     private entities that negotiate prices with drug \n     manufacturers. This is the same mechanism used by private \n     insurers.\n\n  Think about that. I think those who advance these arguments that you \ncannot have competitive work with regard to drug pricing ought to be \nashamed of\n\n[[Page S10766]]\n\nthemselves and ought to quit playing politics with a bill that is so \nimportant for senior citizens all over this country.\n  A related charge I heard one minority Senator make was that this so-\ncalled non-interference language contributed to next year's Part B \npremium increase. Again, this is plain wrong.\n  The Part B premium reflects the costs of Part B benefits. These \ninclude physician services and other outpatient services.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that when Medicare was first \ncreated, the Government paid 50 percent of the premiums and \nbeneficiaries paid 50 percent of the premiums. That was when Medicare \nwas instituted. Today, the Government pays 75 percent of the premiums \nand beneficiaries pay only 25 percent of the premiums because we in the \nCongress were trying to help limit beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs.\n  Those who suggest this non-interference language will drive up the \ncost of implementing the law simply do not have the facts or the \nlegislation on their side.\n  This is what the CBO said about eliminating the non-interference \nclause in a letter earlier this year:\n\n       [T]he Secretary would not be able to negotiate prices that \n     further reduce federal spending to a significant degree.\n\n  The CBO in that letter went on to say:\n\n       CBO estimates that substantial savings will be obtained by \n     the private plans.\n\n  Now, let us be clear: Direct Government negotiation is not the \nanswer. The Government does not negotiate drug prices. That would be \nprice control, and it would, I think, inevitably cause prices to rise \nas companies would not be able to do business in this country as they \nhave in the past.\n  The bill's entire approach is to get Medicare beneficiaries the best \ndeal through vigorous market competition, not price controls.\n  Again, it might be illustrative to quote from the distinguished \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, when he outlined the principles for \nthe MEND Act. Now remember, the MEND Act was a Democrat-sponsored act. \nThis is what Senator Daschle said:\n\n       [W]e should take a lesson from the best private insurance \n     companies: Cost-savings should be achieved through \n     competition, not regulation or price controls.\n\n  Now, keep in mind, they had the same provision in their bill that \nthey are criticizing now in the MMA.\n  This year, even the Washington Post, in a February 17 editorial, \nstated that:\n\n       Governments are notoriously bad at setting prices, and the \n     U.S. government is notoriously bad at setting prices in the \n     medical realm.\n\n  There is proof of that.\n  In an August 2000 report, the Government Accountability Office, the \nGAO, found that drug manufacturers could respond to a mandate that they \nextend Federal prices to a larger share of purchasers by adjusting \ntheir prices to others. The larger the group that would be newly \nentitled to receive a Federal price, the greater the incentive for drug \nmanufacturers to raise that price.\n  The GAO stated that with the Medicaid rebate experience, \nspecifically, that following enactment of the rebate program, discounts \nfor outpatient drugs decreased significantly because manufacturers \nraised the prices they charged large private purchasers. Now, this \nshows how Federal and non-Federal drug price discounts could change if \nMedicare beneficiaries had access to the same price discounts available \nto Federal purchasers.\n  It is common sense that expanding access to the Medicaid rebate means \nweaker discounts for everyone. If almost everyone can get the Medicaid \n``best price,'' then no one gets a discount.\n  Another charge we hear frequently is that Congress should give \nMedicare beneficiaries access to the Veterans' Administration approach. \nWell, what these critics do not tell beneficiaries about the VA model \nis that it is a very restrictive formulary and that the drugs are \navailable only through a limited number of VA pharmacies.\n  The VA has lower prices in part because it has a very restrictive \nformulary. Now, this puzzles me because many proponents of the VA \nsystem also have expressed the concern of ensuring beneficiaries' \naccess to drugs.\n  In calling for the VA system, Families USA spotlighted 15 drugs \ncommonly taken by Medicare beneficiaries. In fact, of the 15 drugs \nmentioned by Families USA, only nine are even on the VA formulary. The \nrest are not even covered.\n  Sixty-one percent of the drugs on the VA formulary are generic drugs. \nIf a Medicare beneficiary needed a brand-name drug--and the vast \nmajority either do or will--the beneficiary would have to meet a narrow \nset of exceptions to get that brand-name drug under the VA system.\n  The drugs are only dispensed at VA facilities. Such a closed system \nwould limit Medicare beneficiaries' access to their neighborhood \npharmacy. I am not for limiting beneficiaries' access to their \nneighborhood pharmacies. And I don't think any of my colleagues are \neither, in spite of some of the comments that have been made on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  So while proposing the VA system might make for a good sound bite or \nadvantageous sound bite, they might think, there are some important \nfacts they are not sharing that could do more harm than good. And those \nfacts were taken into consideration when we wrote this bill.\n  We did not rely on CMS price fixing, but instead created a new drug \nbenefit that relies on strong market competition and an approach in \nkeeping with the principles of the MEND Act, the Democratic act, as \nintroduced by Senator Daschle and cosponsored by 33 Democrats, \nincluding their candidate for President, Senator John Kerry. But that \nwas then, I guess this is now. All of a sudden, this provision they \nadopted, that they were articulating, that they were pushing, is now \nsuddenly a bad provision for senior citizens.\n  Moving along, I want to talk about the Part B premium increase. There \nhas been a good deal of criticism on the increase of the Part B \npremium, and that was understandable as many of us were shocked at so \nhigh a jump. Many of us were concerned about the impact this could have \non beneficiaries, especially those living on fixed incomes.\n  But it might be helpful to look at why this increase occurred rather \nthan demagogue about it.\n  The vast majority of the premium increase resulted from physician \npayment changes made in a previous year and by those in the Medicare \nModernization Act that were needed to ensure beneficiaries' access to \ncare. I can't relate how many letters I have received over the past few \nyears from beneficiaries and providers alike who were concerned about \nthe negative impact of reductions in physician reimbursement. \nPreventing those cuts was not a partisan issue. Indeed, Republicans and \nDemocrats worked to prevent payment cuts to physicians so access to \ntheir services would be protected.\n  In fact, some of today's most vocal critics of the administration \njoined with 71 Democrat and Republican Senators to sign a letter to the \nadministration calling for immediate action to prevent payment cuts to \nphysicians. We all knew that had to be done if we were going to be fair \nto those on Medicare. Virtually all of us hailed the ensuing action to \nprevent the physician pay cuts.\n  Yet today many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ncriticize the Part B premium increase, four-fifths of which is directly \nattributable to the actions they requested to prevent the decrease in \nphysician payments. Is that right? I don't think so.\n  Let's look at another reason the Part B premium increased so much \nthis year.\n  Congress increased payments made on behalf of beneficiaries who \nchoose a Medicare Advantage plan. The higher payments, like the \nphysician payments, were necessary to preserve access to Medicare \nAdvantage plans and were supported by both Democrats and Republicans.\n  In a letter to Medicare conferees, several prominent Democratic \nSenators expressed support for including these higher payments in the \nfinal Medicare bill. Senator Kerry, by the way, was a lead cosponsor of \nan amendment to increase Medicare Advantage funding.\n  In his floor statement last June, he said:\n\n       The Schumer-Santorum-Kerry amendment focuses on protecting \n     this important option for seniors who have nowhere else to \n     turn for the quality health care coverage they need.\n\n\n[[Page S10767]]\n\n\n  Senator Kerry went on to state:\n\n       I urge my colleagues to support the additional funding that \n     is urgently needed to strengthen the Medicare+Choice program \n     for seniors. This should be among our highest priorities in \n     this year's Medicare debate.\n\n  ``Among the highest priorities''--that is their nominee for President \nof the United States. These are the reasons the Medicare premiums went \nup. It wasn't because of the new Medicare bill. I find it so \ndisingenuous for some of my colleagues to question the premium increase \nwhen they, in fact, supported the changes that led to the premium \nincrease. Better medical care and more widespread medical care is being \ngiven as a result of the bipartisan work that we did.\n  There were also six amendments to the Medicare bill introduced by \nDemocratic Senators that, if approved, would have increased the Part B \npremium even more--six amendments by Democrats that would have \nincreased the Part B premium even more. Yet we hear the persistent \nminority drumbeat trying to say that this increase was caused by the \nnew Medicare reform bill.\n  That is pure bunk. The amazing thing is, I guess they don't fully \nrealize it. So I am making this speech to make sure they do realize it \nand that they understand it. When we hear charges that the new Medicare \nbill drove up the Part B premium--which as I have noted are largely \nfalse--we must also keep in mind the fact that the premium increase \nwill not affect low-income beneficiaries, whose premiums are paid for \nby the Government.\n  We must also bear in mind the important fact that the premium also \nreflects new Medicare coverage for important preventive benefits.\n  Practically every other American with private health coverage has a \nwider array of preventive benefits. But Medicare beneficiaries, who \ncould possibly benefit the most from the value of prevention, did not \nhave the benefit of coverage for many of these basic preventive \nservices prior to enactment of the Medicare reform bill.\n  That didn't make sense. Now Medicare will cover important screenings \nfor cholesterol and diabetes, as well as the initial physical.\n  Finally, the MMA can save beneficiaries money. Reforms and \noverpayments for drugs, combined with the new preventive benefits, will \nlower beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs by $270 million in 2005.\n  Beneficiaries deserve to know the facts, not to be fed lines that \namount to nothing more than political year potshots. They deserve to \nknow how the new benefit will work, not to be given misleading \ninformation that may cause them to forgo learning more about the \nprescription drug benefit. Quite frankly, I am surprised and dismayed \nthat some who claim to care about seniors and the disabled have \nunfairly distorted the new law and have spread falsehoods about what it \ndoes. To me, their actions are irresponsible and wrong and should be \ncondemned as election year politicking at its very worst.\n  Beneficiaries deserve much better. I hope my colleagues will think \ntwice about frightening beneficiaries with untruths and distortions. \nThe new Medicare law is a solid attempt to improve some glaring \ndeficits in the Medicare program and should be heralded as what it is: \na bipartisan effort to help seniors and the disabled, and not hurt them \nas some so irresponsibly have charged.\n  How anybody can say that this new Medicare bill will not help seniors \nwhen we are going to spend an additional $400 billion plus over the \nnext number of years that would never have been there without this bill \nis beyond me. I don't see how anybody can stand up with a straight face \nand make some of the comments and charges that have been made. In all \nhonesty, it is hard to believe some of these charges. And in the \nprocess, we have taken care of more of the poor than was even \ncontemplated by the prior attempts to reform Medicare. The poor are \nvery much helped by that bill. Frankly, virtually everybody is very \nmuch helped by that bill. I personally think it is despicable to come \non the floor or to speak in public and try to scare our seniors so they \ndon't know what to do. Seniors can have confidence in CMS and have some \nconfidence in the Medicare bill which will be for their benefit.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about four fine judicial \nnominees that deserve votes before we adjourn this Congress. Three of \nthese four nominees received the ABA's highest rating, unanimously \n``well-qualified.'' The Judiciary Committee has thoroughly reviewed \ntheir background and qualifications and determined that they would all \nmake fine Federal judges. All four were reported favorably by the \ncommittee, three of the four by unanimous vote. They have put forward \ntheir good names for the Senate's evaluation, and they deserve our \nattention before we adjourn. We owe them no less.\n  Susan Neilson has been waiting a long time for a vote. She was \nnominated to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, for a seat that has \nbeen classified as a judicial emergency, on November 8, 2001. That is \nnearly 3 years that she has been waiting for this body to consider her \nnomination. Mr. President, it is time.\n  Judge Neilson is an outstanding candidate for this post. She received \na unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar \nAssociation. She graduated with high distinction from the University of \nMichigan Honors College in 1977 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. \nJudge Neilson received her law degree, cum laude, from Wayne State \nUniversity School of Law in 1980 and was a member of its law review. \nFollowing her graduation, Judge Neilson began her legal career as an \nassociate at the Detroit law firm of Dickinson Wright, one of the \noldest and most prestigious law firms in Michigan. She became a partner \nin the firm in 1986 and continued to practice there until 1991. While \nin private practice, Judge Neilson appeared in court on a regular basis \nand handled hundreds of cases at both the trial and appellate levels.\n  In 1991, Governor John M. Engler appointed her to the 3rd Judicial \nCircuit Court of Michigan, the largest trial court in the State. She \nwas reelected to that post in 1992, 1996, and 2002. She currently is \nassigned to the criminal division of the court.\n  Despite her busy schedule, Judge Neilson makes it a priority to give \nback to the community. She is active in many service organizations \nincluding the Catholic Lawyers Society and the Worship Commission of \nher church. She served as President of her local chapter of Soroptimist \nInternational, a worldwide organization working to promote human rights \nand the status of women.\n  Judge Neilson is also a prolific writer. She has written numerous \narticles and was co-editor and author of Michigan Civil Procedure, a \ntwo-volume treatise on all areas of Michigan civil practice. This \ntreatise was selected by the Michigan Judicial Institute for purchase \non behalf of every trial court judge in the State of Michigan and \nreceived the ``Plain English Award'' from the State Bar of Michigan. I \nalso understand that she is currently working on a new book.\n  Judge Neilson is imminently qualified for the Sixth Circuit. I \ncommend her to my colleagues and urge them to vote for her \nconfirmation.\n  Micaela Alvarez, nominated to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of Texas, is an experienced attorney and trial judge. \nShe began her legal career in 1989 as an Associate Litigation Attorney \nat the law firm of Atlas & Hall, in McAllen, TX. Her practice focused \nprimarily on insurance defense, employment defense, and wrongful \ndischarge defense. Judge Alvarez later joined the Law Offices of Ronald \nG. Hole where she expanded her practice to include medical malpractice \ndefense and products liability. In 1995, she was appointed to the 139th \nJudicial District Court in Hidalgo County, TX, where she served as \npresiding judge.\n  Judge Alvarez brings a wealth of experience to the Federal bench, and \nshe will make an excellent addition to the Southern District of Texas.\n  Keith Starrett, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Mississippi, is an exceptional nominee with a long and \ndistinguished record both as an attorney and judge. He is a graduate of \nMississippi State University and the University of Mississippi School \nof Law. He is an experienced litigator who has represented plaintiffs, \ndefendants, debtors, creditors, and criminal defendants in both\n\n[[Page S10768]]\n\nState and Federal courts. While in private practice he litigated over \n400 cases. In 1992 he was appointed to the Fourteenth Circuit Court of \nMississippi where he presently serves. The American Bar Association \nunanimously gave him its highest rating of ``well qualified.'' The \nMississippi Bar Association awarded him with the Judicial Excellence \nAward in 2003. Undoubtedly, he will be a wonderful addition to the \nFederal bench.\n  Christopher Boyko has been nominated to the United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of Ohio. Judge Boyko brings 25 years of \nlegal experience and sterling credentials to the Federal bench. He has \nserved as a judge for the Court of Common Pleas in Cuyahoga County for \n8 years. He also served on the Parma Municipal Court before joining the \nCourt of Common Pleas.\n  Prior to his appointment to the bench, Judge Boyko built a successful \nlaw practice, which he coupled with his duties as assistant prosecutor, \nprosecutor, and director of law, for the city of Parma. He also served \nas the legal adviser to the local police department's S.W.A.T. team, as \na statutory legal counsel for the Parma School District, and as chief \nlegal counsel for the Southwest Enforcement Bureau.\n\n  The ABA has recognized this seasoned nominee with a unanimously \n``Well Qualified'' rating. In addition, he has received Martindale-\nHubbell's highest rating of ``AV.'' He has the distinction of having \nbeen elected to ``Who's Who in American Law,'' and the Judicial \nCandidates Rating Coalition, in Cleveland, unanimously gave him an \n``excellent'' rating for 2004.\n  Mr. President, I think that you will agree that these four fine \nnominees possess the credentials, reputation, and experience to be \nFederal judges. I am convinced that each of them would serve with \ndistinction.\n  Now, let me take a minute to dispense with the old canard that judges \naren't confirmed late in an election year. When Senator Thurmond \nchaired this committee, during a Presidential election year, the Senate \nconfirmed six Circuit Judges after August 1--one in August and five in \nOctober. In addition, 12 district judges were confirmed in September \nand October of that year. So I will follow that Thurmond rule and \ncontinue to bring the President's nominees to the committee for action \nand to the Senate for consideration.\n  I am only too well aware of the unprecedented and constitutionally \nsuspect tactics my colleagues across the aisle have used to filibuster \ncircuit court judges. So I am under no illusion that Judge Neilson will \nbe given the up-or-down vote that the Constitution requires. Certainly \nthis is unlikely to occur in the closing days of this session. Be that \nas it may, I hope that the devious tactic of filibustering circuit \njudges will in no way prevent the Senate from confirming three superbly \nqualified district judges. I hope they will be included in the final \nExecutive Calendar package along with four commissioners for the \nSentencing Commission and four U.S. Attorneys.\n  I understand time is precious. We are in the waning hours of this \nCongress, and still much is left to be done. We should not, however, in \nour haste to adjourn, neglect consideration of all these outstanding \nnominees. They deserve our attention. They deserve our time. I call on \nthe leadership on both sides of the aisle to move these nominations and \nurge my colleagues to vote for the confirmation of all these \ndistinguished nominees.\n  Mr. President, in accordance with the unanimous consent request \nagreed to earlier, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 1 hour and when my time is yielded that the quorum \nbe questioned.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I object for the moment, but I will come \nback to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will address some of the issues just \ndebated on the floor of the Senate. The Senator from Utah is my friend. \nWe have worked together, and he chairs the Judiciary Committee. We are \nmiles and worlds apart on many issues but have found common ground many \ntimes and I am sure we will in the future. He has done an excellent job \nfor his President as chairman of the committee.\n  It is my understanding that, as of today, President Bush has \nsuccessfully nominated over 200 Federal judges to fill vacancies, \nthanks to the work of Senator Hatch and many others in the Senate. \nThose nominees have been approved. At this point, it is my \nunderstanding that we have one of the lowest vacancy rates in the \nFederal judiciary in recent memory and that we have responded \nparticularly in the areas of our country where there have been \nshortages of judges and an abundance of cases to be considered. It is \nmy understanding that the scoreboard on President Bush's nominees who \nhave been proposed and accepted and approved by the Senate is 201; \nsomewhere in the range of 6 or 8 have not been approved. That is quite \na good average by any standard for any President. It is certainly \ndramatically better than the approval given to judges under the \nprevious President, President Clinton.\n  There have been a lot of complaints and concern expressed about the \nsix or eight judges who have not been approved, and while all of that \nargument has gone on, 201 of President Bush's nominees have been \napproved.\n  Now we have a suggestion that in the closing days of this session, we \nshould approve even more judges. It is a troubling suggestion only in \nthis regard: Not reflecting on any single judicial nominee or that \nperson's qualifications, it has been a practice and tradition in the \nSenate that in a Presidential election year, we suspend the approval of \nFederal judges after the first nominating convention of a major party. \nIt is known as the Thurmond rule because Senator Strom Thurmond of \nSouth Carolina, chairing this same committee, established it and said \nonce we get that close to a Presidential election, with the outcome \nuncertain, that we will not be approving judges. We will wait and see \nwhat the verdict of the American people will be as to whether the \nPresident, in this case, is reelected or a new President takes office \nand fills those same vacancies.\n  The Senator from Utah has asked us to look beyond this time-honored \nThurmond rule. In my State of Illinois and many other States, we have \nwithheld pursuing nominees because we understood the process was closed \ndown, that there would not be any further judicial nominees considered. \nI am sure this will be discussed at length. So the record will reflect \nthat has been the tradition. It is the situation that has applied to \nPresident after President, and most of us believe, in fairness, it \nshould apply in this situation.\n  I listened carefully as the Senator from Utah talked about a number \nof issues, all of which are relevant, many of which will be discussed \ntonight in the second Presidential debate at Washington University in \nSt. Louis between President Bush and Senator Kerry.\n  One of the issues which he spoke to with some force was the issue of \nwhether we are doing enough to help seniors and other American families \npay for their health care. He noted that we passed a Medicare \nprescription drug bill. It is true that a bill passed with that name. \nFor a person like myself who has supported throughout his congressional \ncareer the idea of assistance to senior citizens to pay for \nprescription drugs, it was painful to vote against a bill called the \nMedicare prescription drug bill. But I did vote against it, and the \nreason I voted against it is the same reason that most seniors across \nAmerica are not only skeptical of this proposal by the Bush \nadministration and the Republican leaders in Congress but have flatly \nrejected it, because if you take a close look at the proposal which the \nBush White House put before us and was approved by this Republican \nCongress, you will see it is only a Medicare prescription drug bill in \nname. In fact, it is not, and the reason is obvious. There\n\n[[Page S10769]]\n\nis no authority in the bill for Medicare as an agency to bargain with \nthe pharmaceutical companies to get the best price for seniors and \nfamilies across America. The pharmaceutical industry is the most \npowerful industry on Capitol Hill. Bill after bill, vote after vote, \namendment after amendment, the pharmaceutical industry rarely loses. \nWhy? Because they are a powerful force in our economy, the most \nprofitable economic sector in America, and a powerful political force. \nThey are involved in the campaigns, primarily with Republicans but some \nDemocrats, too. They make contributions to those who believe in their \napproach, and they are rewarded many times with votes that come out \ntheir way. This is what happened with the Medicare prescription drug \nbill.\n  This bill expressly prohibits the Medicare agency from bargaining \nwith pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of prescription drugs, \nand what it means is that seniors, even with this bill, will continue \nto see the cost of medication going up 10, 15, and 20 percent a year. \nThere is no end in sight. It will continue to grow at a pace that will \noutstrip the money we put in this bill, at a pace that will outstrip \nthe resources of most seniors and, frankly, will do it in a hurry.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a question from the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend from Illinois. We \nhad the Senator from Utah talking about how wonderful everything is \nwith that prescription drug plan the Senator from Illinois and I voted \nagainst and Senator Kerry does not support either. The reason we voted \nagainst it is it does not do much for our seniors. It is very costly \nfor them when they need it. It is not there because after a certain \namount of expenditure, the benefit stops. We call it benefit shutdown, \ndonut hole--different names. Lots of us are trying to fix it.\n  One of the main problems is what my friend described--a prohibition \non the Medicare agency from negotiating with these giant drug companies \nfor lower prices. This is where I want to ask my friend a question.\n  If someone from the Government came up to one of our constituents who \nwas looking for a new bike for their son and said, You cannot shop \naround, you have to take whatever that store on the corner says you \nhave to pay, I do not think that would be very popular for the \nGovernment to do. I am sure my friend would agree.\n  Essentially, that is what we are doing here. We are essentially \ntaking the leverage away from Medicare to help our seniors get lower \nprices by telling them, even though there are 40 million Americans--\nthat is my understanding--on Medicare, they cannot use that power and \nthat leverage to sit across from Pfizer or any of the big companies and \nsay: If you want to get on our formulary, you have to lower this price.\n  It seems stunning to me that Senator Hatch would come to the floor \nand say it is not true. He said: We do not stop Medicare, we just stop \nthe agency that runs Medicare. Talk about flimflam. Talk about \nmisleading the seniors. Is that what the Senator from Illinois heard \nthe Senator say?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from \nCalifornia, I did not hear that exact quote, but it is clear for anyone \nwho reads the bill that Medicare, as an agency, does not have the \nauthority to bargain for lower drug prices or to create its own drug \nbenefit program.\n  The Republican leadership in the White House and Congress insisted \nthat this be done through private sector insurance companies. In fact, \nthey expressly prohibited seniors from buying Medicare gap policies to \ncover this overwhelming cost of prescription drugs.\n  The most telling fact that I think should be part of this debate is \nthe Bush administration insisted that this so-called Medicare \nprescription drug benefit plan would not go into effect until after \nthis election. They know, the Senator from California knows, I know, \nthat when seniors see the situation close up and all the details, they \nare going to feel even worse about what Congress has done. Congress has \nleft them vulnerable on prescription drug costs, and they are not the \nonly ones.\n\n  We are finding companies across America and families across America \nwrestling with the high cost of health care. What has the Bush \nadministration done to help small businesses provide health insurance, \nto help families afford health insurance, to come to the rescue of \n100,000 American retirees who have lost their health care benefits \nbecause of a bankruptcy court? What have they done to help these people \nin such dire straits? Nothing. Why? Because the companies that are \nprofiting from these high costs of insurance and pharmaceuticals are \ncompanies that are the political favorites of the Bush administration \nand the Republican leadership in Congress.\n  So when any Senator comes to the floor and talks with some pride \nabout what has happened over the last 4 years on health care, go ask \nthe families of America what is happening. The honest answer is no \nrelief, no help, and they find themselves with increasing costs for \nhealth care and the cost of health insurance.\n  Businesses identify this as the No. 1 problem facing American \nbusiness today, that health care premiums are going up 25 percent and \nmore each year. They say to us: How can we provide coverage for our \nemployees, how can we be competitive in the world if we face that \noverhead cost?\n  Labor unions say exactly the same thing. They say: We try to get more \nmoney per hour for our workers so they can have a better life, but \nevery penny of it goes for health insurance, and this year's coverage \nis less than last year's coverage. They are frustrated. Business, \nlabor, families, individuals, and retirees are being left out in the \ncold.\n  What has the Bush administration and the Republican Congress done for \nthese groups? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend continue to yield to me?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Again, I want to thank my friend for moving to the bigger \nissue of all of our citizens, leading off with the issues that are \nfacing our seniors. But I want to get back to our seniors.\n  My friend said it is interesting that the date of the prescription \ndrug benefit is after the election because it is such a bad benefit and \nthey do not want people to see there is really not very much there. \nThey thought they could run on this as an issue, but I say to my \ncolleague seniors are smart.\n  We say this is the greatest generation. This is the generation that \nhas kept us free, and they are smart. I am sure my friend has seen what \nI have seen. As I go around my State, seniors are saying, please fix \nthis thing, allow Medicare to negotiate for lower prices. Do not have \nthe benefit that shuts down just when we need it the most. It is too \nexpensive. Allow importation of pharmaceutical products through Canada. \nI am sure my friend is having that same experience.\n  The thing they did not count on, President Bush and our friends on \nthe other side, is that the seniors see this on the horizon. They get \nit. They are used to reading the small print, and I believe they are \nletting us know that they are quite unhappy.\n  I want to ask my friend this: One would think, after looking at what \nthe Veterans' Administration does for its people, when they sit down, \nknowing they have millions of veterans behind them, and negotiate with \na drug company and get those prices down, perhaps a third less, maybe \neven a half lower than what they sell for normally on the market, one \nwould think that would have been the perfect model for this group that \nwrote this bill to emulate what the Veterans' Administration does for \nits veterans.\n  Oh, no, no. Was not my friend surprised when it turned out that \ninstead of taking the model that has been developed for veterans on \npharmaceutical prices, where the Veterans' Administration sits across \nthe table from the big drug companies, essentially, and bargains for \nlower companies, that instead of taking that model they are reversing \nthat model and prohibiting Medicare to negotiate?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from California, I am sure, has met with \nveterans, as I have in Illinois. Veterans are fortunate when they reach \nan age that they can go to a Veterans Hospital\n\n[[Page S10770]]\n\nand get their prescriptions filled for a modest amount each month. That \nis because the Veterans' Administration bargains for the prices of \ndrugs, brings them down to a lower cost than a senior on Medicare is \ngoing to pay.\n  There has been a lot of talk about reimportation of drugs from \nCanada. I just want to say for the record, many of us believe that a \npromise had been made on the Senate floor that we would vote on this \nissue of reimportation of drugs from Canada before we went home this \nyear. In fact, there is ample evidence in the Congressional Record, a \ncolloquy between Senator Dorgan of North Dakota and the majority leader \nof the Senate, which led us all to believe that we would finally get a \nchance to reimport drugs that have been made in the United States \nsafely and can be bought at a fraction of the cost in Canada and other \nplaces.\n\n  The decision was made, no, we do not have time. We cannot do it. \nWell, that decision was made as the decision was made to stop Medicare \nfrom asking for lower prices for drugs, at the request of the \npharmaceutical companies. These companies are making the greatest \nprofit of any sector of the American economy, and they have asked for \nCongress to protect their profits. This is a decision driven by greed. \nIt is a decision where the pharmaceutical companies have said, despite \nthe hardship on seniors, despite the hardship on families and \nbusinesses, we will not reduce the prices of our drugs.\n  A phony argument has been raised, and that is that we cannot reimport \ndrugs from Canada without compromising the safety of the drugs that are \nbrought in. Let me remind everyone that the overwhelming majority of \nthe drugs we are talking about are the product of research in the \nUnited States. They are the product of American pharmaceutical \ncompanies. They are in packages and under names in Canada exactly as \nthey are in the United States. We are only asking that these drugs be \nbrought back in so that seniors can get some relief from high drug \nprices, relief that is not forthcoming in the Medicare prescription \ndrug bill.\n  Let me say something about the safety issue. Do not trust me. I am \njust an elected official. Trust instead Dr. Peter Rost, who is vice \npresident of marketing at Pfizer. Let us see what he had to say about \nthe safety issue:\n\n       During my time responsible for a region in northern Europe, \n     I never once--not once--heard the drug industry, regulatory \n     agencies, the government, or anyone else saying that this \n     practice was unsafe. And personally, I think it is outright \n     derogatory to claim that Americans would not be able to \n     handle reimportation of drugs, when the rest of the educated \n     world can do this.\n\n  It is a phony issue. Safety of drugs is a phony issue. We can put \nsafeguards in place. We have proposals before the Senate to do it. In \nmy home State of Illinois, Governor Blagojevich has been a leader on \nthe reimportation issue. He has established what I consider to be \nrational and very thoroughly thought out standards for the \nreimportation of drugs. Resistance comes from the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and that resistance is inspired by the pharmaceutical \ncompanies that do not want to see cheaper drugs coming into the United \nStates to help seniors and families meet the overwhelming cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  Tonight, during the course of this debate between President Bush and \nSenator Kerry, I am sure that health care will be an issue. I am \nguessing that someone, in 90 minutes, in the Washington University \naudience is going to say to both candidates: What are you going to do \nto reduce the cost of health care for families across America?\n  What the President will say is, We have done it with the Medicare \nprescription drug bill. And the obvious answer to that is, Well, then \nwhy did you postpone it until after the election? Why is it so hard to \nunderstand? Why the gaps in coverage? Why can't Medicare bargain for a \nlower price?\n  The answer on the other side from Senator Kerry is obviously, this \nadministration, in the thrall and under the control of the \npharmaceutical industry, is not prepared to confront them on behalf of \nAmerican families and businesses which are struggling to pay for \nprescription drugs.\n\n  I think that is a clear choice, as there will be a clear choice on so \nmany issues.\n  Take a look at this issue as well. On the issue of health care, what \nhas happened under the Bush administration? Under President Bush's 4 \nyears, fewer jobs in America provide health insurance. We know from the \nreports, the President, during his administration, has lost more jobs \nin America than any President in the last 70 years of either political \nparty. Even today's report about a few new jobs in America still leaves \nthe President somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000 net jobs lost \nduring his Presidency. Even his father, facing a recession and a war, \nwas able to see much more employment created than this President.\n  As a result of the lost jobs, and as a result of businesses \nstruggling with the Bush economic policies, fewer companies offer \nhealth insurance.\n  In the year 2000, when President Bush took office, 63.6 percent of \ncompanies offered employer-provided health insurance. Today, it is 60.4 \npercent. That means 3.8 million Americans have lost health insurance \ncoverage at their job.\n  Now, what does one do when they have lost their health insurance at \ntheir job? Well, for many of these Americans, it means no protection \nwhatsoever. It means that they pray each morning that someone does not \ndevelop a serious illness or get involved in an accident.\n  So how is this making America a better place? How is it strengthening \nfamilies? How is it removing fears and worries from families who are \njust trying to get by each day and maybe make life a little better for \ntheir children? I cannot imagine in my family, if we did not have \nhealth insurance, what it would be like, fearful that at any given \nmoment the savings that we have could evaporate paying for health \ncosts.\n  Under President Bush, 3.8 million Americans have lost health \ninsurance. That is a fact. That will come up tonight during the course \nof this debate.\n  Look at the jobs that have been lost under President Bush as well. \nThe Clinton administration saw an increase of 20.7 million jobs in the \n8 years of his Presidency; under President Bush, a loss of 1.6 million \njobs. The President says his economic policies are working. The \nunemployed people of America are a living testimony to the fact that \nthey have failed because the President's economic policy is very simply \nstated. If we give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America, \nsurely everybody else will be better off.\n\n  It has not worked. It is not going to work. The helping hand should \nbe given to businesses to create jobs. A helping hand should be given \nto working families to try to keep up with increased costs for health \ncare and college tuition and gasoline. These are the basics of life. \nThis administration has ignored it. By ignoring it they have created an \neconomic climate that has destroyed jobs instead of creating them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would you keep the chart up. This is a shocking chart. \nThis is not about politics or rhetoric. This is a fact. The fact is, we \ncame off of the Clinton administration where 20.7 million new jobs were \ncreated, and we are at the end of the Bush administration and a loss of \n1.6 million jobs. They will make every excuse in the book for it. The \nfact is, we have that kind of record, even though we are in raging \ndeficit spending.\n  I am an economics major. Granted, it was a long time ago that I went \nto college and I got my degree in economics, but one of the things they \ntaught us in economics 101 was that when you wanted to rejuvenate the \neconomy--deficit spending. So here we have a President who is deficit \nspending, who has stolen every penny from the Social Security trust \nfund to pay for his tax cuts, throwing hundreds of billions--let's be \nexact, between $120 billion and $200 billion at Iraq with no end in \nsight to bear the burden of that war, let alone the human loss of life, \nand with all of this deficit spending we see a loss of 1.6 million \njobs. It is shocking to see this type of record.\n  The President goes around with the music blaring, saying how great \nhis economic program is, as my colleague pointed out, and all of these \ngreat new jobs that are being created. I want to ask my friend, for the \njobs that are being created--and there are some, although it is very \nanemic--isn't it true that the average pay of those jobs is \napproximately $9,000 less a year than\n\n[[Page S10771]]\n\nthe pay of the jobs that have been lost? If my friend, in answering \nthat question, could talk about what that means to families who have to \npay the higher costs of health care, college tuition, gas prices, and \nall the things we need to pay for, it would be helpful.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to respond to that question. I would say \nif you listen carefully, the President's regular response when asked \nabout whether there is enough employment in America is: This \nadministration will not rest until every American has a job.\n  The President better plan on staying up late at night, all through \nthe night, for the next 3 weeks-plus of this campaign, because \nAmericans are having difficulty finding jobs.\n  The point the Senator made is an important one. I have met with some \nof these unemployed people, many of whom worked for years, even \ndecades, in good-paying jobs. They live in nice houses, their kids go \nto good schools, they had savings accounts, a car in the driveway--\nmaybe two or three, vacations were planned. Then all of a sudden the \nbottom fell out. They lost the job. I met with them and listened to \nthem about their desperate efforts to find another job. They are in a \nsituation where they will take a lot less money for a job just to go \nback to work. The potential employer says: ``Wait a minute, you are \noverqualified. Because you are overqualified we are not going to hire \nyou because we know you'll take something better that comes along,'' so \nthey can't get employed. But if they luck out and get one of the lower \npaying jobs, what will they have to sacrifice? Will it be their \nsavings? Will it be the college education of their child? Will it be \nthe home they live in? You can't tell what it means.\n\n  But if this President says he won't rest until every American has a \njob, he better stay up at night for a long, long time because we have \nlost more jobs under his Presidency than any President's since Herbert \nHoover. For those who are not students of history, he was the President \nduring the Great Depression, a depression which our parents lived \nthrough and will remember as the toughest time in their lives.\n  This President has created a climate in this country where the number \nof jobs is not growing. It did not have to be that way. Take a look at \nwhat happened under the Clinton administration. The Clinton \nadministration was creating 2.6 million jobs a year. The Bush \nadministration has been losing about 200,000 jobs a year.\n  You say to yourself, What was the difference? The difference was the \nClinton administration put together a sound fiscal policy for America. \nIt was not easy. In fact, it passed the House and the Senate--I served \nin the House at the time--by one vote in each Chamber. Vice President \nGore cast the deciding vote. President Clinton did say that in his \nadministration we are going to take deficits seriously. I know the \nother party, the Republicans, say they are fiscal conservatives but we \nbelieve that getting the deficit under control is critically important \nif we are going to rejuvenate this economy and bring down interest \nrates and have more capital investment.\n  We did it. It was painful. Many Members of the House and Senate lost \ntheir seats because they voted for this plan. But it worked. As a \nconsequence, under the Clinton administration jobs were created.\n  Now take a look at what this President has done. Claiming to be a \nfiscal conservative, this President now has us in a position where we \nhave the largest deficit in the history of the United States. How can \nthis be? The President will say, Don't blame me for 9/11. Don't blame \nme for the recession that was inevitable. Don't blame me for the war in \nIraq. But the honest answer is he has to accept the blame for an \neconomic policy that called for tax cuts during this same period, tax \ncuts primarily focused on the wealthiest people in America. That is \nwhat has been driving deficit numbers to a great extent. That is \nsomething for which you can blame the Bush administration.\n  Many of us believe a tax policy that would have helped smaller \nbusinesses, family farmers, and individuals struggling to pay the bills \nfor their families could have put real juice in this economy, as the \nSenator from California suggested, rejuvenating it at the right level \nat a lower cost.\n  To give to a person making over $200,000 a year another $5,000 or \n$10,000 or $20,000 is gilding the lily. Their life is pretty \ncomfortable. To give them $20,000 more means more stocks purchased, \nmore money invested. But it is not the same kind of expenditure as when \nyou give $5,000 to a working family which turns around and says now we \ncan consider the downpayment on a car, we can get the washer and dryer, \na little remodel job on the kitchen, we can put the money away for our \nson and daughter for a college education, we can make sure we are \nplanning for a brighter future for our family. It is the difference \nbetween night and day.\n\n  There was a moment in a movie, which was controversial, called \n``Fahrenheit 9/11.'' President Bush was speaking to a group. I don't \nknow where it was located. He was on film. He was in his tuxedo and the \npeople all around him were in tuxedos, and he said something along \nthese lines: Some people say you are the upper last class. They call \nyou the wealthy. They call you the upper level. But I call you my base.\n  It was supposed to be a humorous line, but there was more truth than \nhumor. The President has served his base well with his economic \npolicies. He has said to those people who are well off: You are my \nfirst priority. His economic policies have been directed to help them, \ntime and again, at the expense of working families, at the expense of \nthe worst deficit in our history.\n  So we have a choice. We have a choice to make on November 2. More of \nthe same? Continuation of this policy, risking more jobs lost, putting \nmore burdens on working families?\n  Take a look at the long-term unemployment in this country. The long-\nterm unemployment in 2000 was 649,000 people. Now it is almost three \ntimes that amount, 1.7 million people. Long-term unemployed, meaning \nthey have tried and tried and cannot get back to work.\n  Take a look at who is better off because of the policies of the Bush \nadministration. These charts tell you what happens here. The household \nincome in America is down, under the Bush administration. If you think \nyou are pedalling faster and not going any farther, this chart tells \nyou why. You may be making a few more dollars, but the cost of living \nfor working families has gone up.\n  How have the CEOs at the major corporations done under the Bush tax \npolicy, the people making dramatically more money than the people \nworking in the office and factory? The CEO compensation went up 20 \npercent. Take a look at the HMOs, the insurance companies that have \nbeen protected by this administration. Their profits have been up 84 \npercent.\n  Do you think you are paying more for gasoline today than you were 4 \nyears ago? This is the chart: $1.47 was the average price of gas in \n2001. The average price of a gallon of gas in 2004 is $1.92. And when \nwe hear the price of a barrel of oil is over $50, it may be a good \nthing for the oil companies, but it is bad news for American families \nand a lot of businesses.\n  Why are these airlines going into bankruptcy one after the other? I \nwas on a plane the other day--United. At the end of the flight, as we \nlanded, the flight attendant came on and said: Thank you for flying \nUnited. I know you had a choice of many companies that are in \nbankruptcy or near bankruptcy. That is what he announced to the \npassengers. Everybody kind of laughed, but it is a sad reality.\n  The cost of fuel, the cost of oil, and our dependence on foreign oil \ninstead of an energy bill that moves us toward independence have left \nus vulnerable as an economy and left American families vulnerable \npaying for the bills.\n  Where is the leadership? Do we really need 4 more years of wrong \ndecisions like these, decisions that would not challenge the Saudis and \ntheir oil supplies and instead say America is going to move forward to \nenergy independence so we can't be held captive by OPEC and the Saudi \nArabian oil cartel? That is the difference. That is the case.\n  We are suggesting there ought to be a better vision for America, and \nmove us away from dependence on Mideast oil, move us toward an economic \npolicy to give working families a fighting chance. You haven't seen it \nfor 4 years.\n  Tonight, this administration through the President is going to try to \njustify some of the harsh realities.\n\n[[Page S10772]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reid \nbe granted the hour which will come to me postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. We object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that it be yielded to Senator \nDaschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator has the right to give it to Senator Daschle under the \nrule.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I make that point.\n  As I listened to my friend in his usual way of kind of tying together \nthe pieces and as we get ready to watch our Presidential candidate \ntonight, I am wondering if my friend is beginning to see a pattern by \nthis administration which is kind of just coming in.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  As manager of the bill, am I not entitled to be given by the Senator \nfrom California 1 hour of time? As manager of the bill, as I understand \nit, I have the right to be yielded 1 hour of time by any Member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct and the Chair was in \nerror, not realizing that Senator Reid was the manager of the bill on \nthis side of the aisle. The Chair apologizes to the Senator from \nCalifornia. She has a matter of right to give the hour either to \nSenator Reid or Senator Daschle.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I might say that I am going to give my \nhour to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sorry for the interruption.\n  As I hear the Senator from Illinois talk--and I think back to the \nfirst debate where I believe all of America now knows there was no plan \nfor Iraq following the stunning military victory. There was no plan for \nafter that military victory, and we are paying a heavy price. I have \ncome to this floor and eulogized those being lost.\n  There is no plan for Iraq.\n  By the way, that was pointed out not only by Democrats such as \nSenator Kerry, Senator Biden, and Senator Dodd, who sit on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, but also by Senators Lugar, Chafee, and Hagel, who \nalso sit on that committee. There was no plan.\n  I am asking my friend, as we look at the disastrous factual \nstatistics on this economy, whether he believes there really was a plan \nas to how we were going to continue the Clinton administration record \non job creation, stem the loss of manufacturing jobs, and stem the loss \nof outsourcing jobs, which, shockingly, people in this administration \nsay is good for our economy. Was there a plan? Was there a plan to make \nsure that health care premiums would be affordable for our people? Was \nthere a plan to lower prescription drug prices for our people through \nimportation? Was there a plan for gas prices? My God. My friend put up \na chart--$1.81 average. People in California would be thrilled at $1.92 \na gallon. We are looking at $2.30, $2.40, $2.20, $2.50 a gallon. When \nthe Senate voted in a bipartisan way to beg this administration to stop \nfilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so we could put downward \npressure on the prices, nothing has really happened.\n  To conclude my question, I am beginning to see a pattern of kind of a \n``flying by the seat of your pants'' administration where there is no \nplan to make life better for people, whether it is our men and women in \nuniform in Iraq, whether it is our consumers, our middle-class \nfamilies, working families, and all of our families in regard to health \ncare and gas prices.\n  Could my friend comment on that bigger picture?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to respond to the question.\n  First, Mr. President, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 21\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator from California \nthat she has really come to the heart of the problem. The President \nsaid in his first debate that being President was hard work. He said \nthat over and over again. This is hard work. This is hard stuff. These \nare hard things to do. I don't doubt it. Being President of the United \nStates may be the toughest job in the world. But sadly, the President, \ndespite the hard work he has experienced, doesn't understand the hard \nwork families have to go through just to make ends meet. If he were a \nlittle more in touch with these families and their own struggles, he \nwould understand why we need a man or a person in the White House \nstanding up for them and understanding the challenges families face \nevery single day. And it hasn't happened.\n  The Senator from California mentions outsourcing. It is true. The \nhead of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Bush administration \nsent a report to Congress saying that the outsourcing of jobs was a \npositive, a good result; sending jobs overseas was good. He explained \nthat that would mean more competition and lower costs, completely \noverlooking the obvious. When a good-paying job leaves America, it is \nnot likely the person who lost it is going to get another good-paying \njob, or get it soon. It is likely that that follow job is not going to \nhave the same level of benefits for the person who just saw their job \noutsourced.\n  This administration plays by a strange economic textbook. That \neconomic textbook calls for total free market forces despite the \nconsequences. Even under this administration, the President has seen \nwhat the free market unbridled can lead to.\n  I put as exhibit A Enron. If you do not have a government through its \nPresident and regulatory agencies keeping an eye on some corporate \nactivity as we keep an eye on individual activity, terrible things can \noccur--and they did occur in Enron, a business that defrauded a lot of \ninnocent people out of their life savings, not to mention \nmisrepresentations made in terms of the status of that business and the \nimpact it had on so many other businesses. But this President steps \nback every time someone suggests that he needs to stand up to free \nmarket forces that are not serving America. He will not stand up to \npharmaceutical companies that are overcharging Americans. He wouldn't \nlet the Medicare agency bargain for lower prices. No. Let the free \nmarket work its will. The free market is working its will at the \nexpense of a lot of senior citizens and families who can't afford their \nprescription drugs.\n  Did the President get on the phone as he promised as a candidate and \ncall the OPEC cartel when they were holding oil off the market and \ndriving up prices in America? No. Let the free market work its will. \nYou know what happened. Gasoline prices have gone through the roof, \nairline fuel prices have gone through the roof, and America's economy \nhas suffered. More jobs are being lost, more airline employees are \nbeing laid off, and we see businesses dependent on fuel struggling \nacross America.\n  When it came to a tax break, did this President take into \nconsideration that the cost of a college education is going up more \nthan 20 percent a year in many institutions and that families with \nbright students who want the best chance in life just can't imagine \ntheir son or daughter graduating with $100,000 in debt and a diploma? \nDid the President think about that when he decided to look at the Tax \nCode to help families? No. No, there was no provision in there for the \ndeductibility of college education expenses. The President said to let \nthe market work its will at the expense of many of these families.\n\n  Langston Hughes once referred to the group of people that I am \ntalking about. He called them ``people for whom life ain't been no \ncrystal stair.'' He was a person who understood that people get up \nevery morning and struggle--struggle to keep their family together, \nstruggle to make ends meet, struggle to try to believe that their kids \nwill be better off than they are. These families would like to believe \nthere is somebody someplace in Washington who cares, someone who \nunderstands we are headed in the wrong direction in this country in so \nmany instances.\n  We are losing jobs. We are seeing important jobs outsourced. We are \nseeing our deficit at record levels. These are the harsh realities.\n  The Senator from California says it does not appear that this \nadministration has a plan. In many instances, it\n\n[[Page S10773]]\n\ndoes not appear this administration has a clue. It is as if the \nPresident, with those auditoriums filled with thousands of fans, does \nnot take the time to step outside the auditorium and talk to an average \nfamily about what they are going through as their cost of health \ninsurance goes up and the cost of living goes up as well.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  I will use my remaining time of morning business to speak to the \nother issue brought up by the Senator from California. That, of course, \nis the situation in Iraq.\n  We had a report through the Senate Intelligence Committee and Senate \nArmed Services Committee this week from Mr. Duelfer who went back to \nIraq and for the second time spent months and millions of dollars to \nlook for weapons of mass destruction. He came back and told us they are \nnot there. We cannot find them.\n  Think about that. Think of how often President Bush, Vice President \nCheney, Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary Powell, and others told us we \nwere in imminent danger from an attack from Saddam Hussein because of \narsenals of chemical and biological weapons and the rebuilding of the \nnuclear weapons in Iraq. That was the justification. That is why we had \nto invade. That is why we could not wait. And it was all wrong. Totally \nwrong.\n  Now comes the administration saying, no, it was not really about \nweapons of mass destruction, despite the fact they said that then over \nand over again. It was the fact that Saddam Hussein could not be \ntrusted and was an evil man. It was about the fact he may have had the \ndesire--the new word, ``desire''--to build weapons of mass destruction \nand it really was about the Oil for Food Program in Iraq.\n  Really? Go back and check the tape on statements made by the \nPresident as to why we had to send our Armed Forces into harm's way. \nThe statements made by the President do not quibble: weapons of mass \ndestruction, yellow cake, uranium coming into Iraq, linkage between al-\nQaida and those who were responsible for September 11, al-Qaida and \nSaddam Hussein.\n  Now, today, that evidence, that case, has evaporated. It is gone \nafter millions of dollars have been spent desperately trying to find \nevidence of one weapon of mass destruction.\n  Trust me, those who are following this debate, had \nthis administration found a tiny shred of evidence of weapons of mass \ndestruction, it would have been front page news around the world. They \ncould not find a thing.\n\n  The intelligence was bad. The reasons for going to war, given to us \nby the President, was just plain wrong.\n  Where are we today? Mr. President, 140,000 of our best and brightest, \nour soldiers, marines, our airmen, those in the U.S. Navy, our \nguardsmen and reservists, got up this morning in Iraq and went to do \ntheir duty and risk their lives for America. Over a year and a half \nafter our invasion of Iraq, there is no end in sight. They say we hope \nsomeday soon to have elections. We are not quite sure how much of Iraq \nwill be safe to vote. We hope to have an election and we hope to have \nthe Iraqis take over. Those are two good goals. I hope we can reach \nthem.\n  But we have to acknowledge the obvious. This administration was not \nprepared for the war in Iraq. They were prepared for the invasion. Our \ntroops did a masterful job in a very short period of time. But this \nadministration was not ready for what followed. Isn't that the most \nbasic thing to ask of a Commander in Chief? Don't send my son or your \nson into battle unless you are prepared to give that soldier everything \nthey need to be safe, to win, and to come home. This administration was \nnot prepared.\n  I know that because for the last few months I have spent time on \nbehalf of Illinois soldiers, demanding they have body armor to protect \nthemselves in Iraq, one of the most basic things one would think we \nwould provide, demanding we have armor plating on Humvee vehicles so as \nthey travel across Iraq they do not fall prey to the homemade bombs and \nrocket-propelled grenades, demanding we put the necessary defensive \nequipment on helicopters so we will not have Guard and Reserve and \nRegular Army helicopters shot out of the sky because they were not \nproperly equipped.\n  Why would I be doing this, a year and a half after the invasion, \nafter giving the Bush administration every single penny they asked for \nto execute this war? I am doing it, and many others in the Senate and \nCongress are doing it, we are doing it because this administration was \nnot prepared for the war in Iraq.\n  The losers are over 1,000 American soldiers who have lost their \nlives, and the 7,000 bravely wounded. I have met many going to a \nveterans hospital, Jefferson Barracks, right outside of St. Louis, \nmeeting a young soldier, quadriplegic as a result of injuries sustained \nin Iraq; going to Walter Reed Hospital to meet these brave young men \nand women who have lost an arm, a leg, both hands, suffered head \ninjuries. They are there with their families trying to put their lives \nback together, still proud of their service to this country, as they \nshould be.\n  But as you walk away from the hospitals, you think we could do more. \nWe should have been ready. We were not ready. But we could not wait. We \ncould not wait for the U.N. inspectors to finish. We could not wait for \na real coalition to come together--taking nothing away from the \ncoalition we have, let's be honest. When you pick up the morning paper, \nthe casualties, the soldiers who have lost their lives are \noverwhelmingly American soldiers. I am glad the Brits are with us. I am \nglad another 30 nations have given us some assistance in this regard, \nbut when it comes to putting lives on the line in Iraq every single \nday, trust me, it is America front and center. And it has been for \na long, long time.\n\n  When it comes to paying for this war, it is the American taxpayers \nfront and center. We have spent over $1 billion a week on the war in \nIraq and there is no end in sight. We appropriated almost $20 billion \nto start rebuilding Iraq and we are not spending it. Why? It is a \nvicious circle. Let me tell you what it is.\n  You cannot stabilize Iraq until you move the economy forward. You \ncannot move the economy forward until you build basic infrastructure \nsuch as electricity, and you cannot build basic infrastructure if you \nhave insurgents and terrorists and guerillas blowing up everything you \nbuild. This vicious circle suggests there is no end in sight.\n  So the President has driven our national bus into a cul-de-sac and \nnow challenges Senator Kerry to explain how to get out of this mess. A \nlot of us think that even giving the President the authority to go \nforward, he should have been prepared. He should have known what we \nwere getting into.\n  Ambassador Bremer said, within the week, we did not send enough \ntroops there. Had the right number of troops been sent at the right \ntime, it could have been a more peaceful environment, but instead it is \ndangerous and American soldiers are still living in fear of what is \ngoing to happen from day to day.\n  At the same time, we turned our back on the obvious target, Osama bin \nLaden. I went to Afghanistan in the first codel with Senator Daschle, \nthe first daylight codel that was allowed into Afghanistan, to Bagram \nAir Force Base, to a closed briefing by our intelligence agents about \nOsama bin Laden. They put up this huge aerial photo of the Tora Bora \nMountains and they drew a tiny circle on the map. They pointed to all \nMembers of Congress and the Senate and said: This is where Osama bin \nLaden is and we are going to nail him. This tiny circle.\n  I left there thinking, great, that will break the back and the morale \nof this terrorism network of al-Qaida. But it didn't happen. The Bush \nadministration did not execute it well. They did not bring in the \ntroops. They did not capture Osama bin Laden. He is not only still on \nthe loose but al-Qaida is spreading like a cancer across the globe.\n  Where is our coalition to fight al-Qaida? It is the coalition that \nwas stiff-armed by this administration when it came to the invasion of \nIraq, when the President said, We will do it alone. We do not need you. \nBring it on.\n  Remember when the President said, ``Bring it on''? Well, they brought \nit on and, sadly, we have a lot of soldiers who have sacrificed so much \nfor their country because of it.\n  We need to turn this corner. We need to have a new vision. We need to \nhave a leader who will reach out to the world and reestablish America \nas a leader willing to work with others, not\n\n[[Page S10774]]\n\nthat any country should ever have veto power over our national defense. \nThat is our call. That is our decision.\n\n  But we know, as President Bush's father knew, that it is a coalition \nof nations that makes us stronger. When we decided in the Persian Gulf \nwar to bring Arab nations and their soldiers into that war as part of \nour coalition, it did not just add more soldiers in the field, it added \nan element that is missing in this war in Iraq.\n  Why are we being criticized so roundly in Arab States? Because we \nwent into Iraq without waiting for those who could and would have \nhelped us. This President could not wait, and now our soldiers are \npaying the price. I hope the American people make a decision to move \nforward with a new vision for this country, not to repeat the same \nmistakes again and again.\n  We have made mistakes when it comes to our economic policy, and we \nhave paid a dear price for it. We have made mistakes when it comes to \nour agenda in Congress. We do not take up the serious bills that \nAmerica's working families expect us to take up. We have generated the \nbiggest deficit in the history of the United States to leave our \nchildren. We have the costs of war that are over $1 billion a week, and \nno end in sight. And, sadly, we are still losing our soldiers.\n  I was on the phone yesterday, as I have tried to so many times, to \ncall the families of Illinois soldiers who have died overseas. I have \nnot been able to get through to all of them, and I can understand some \nof them just don't want to take phone calls. That is understandable. \nAnd each and every one of them is a profile in courage. They are so \nproud of their son or daughter who has lost his life or her life in \nIraq, and they are proud they served their country. I am, too. But I \nalso want to take some pride that we have policies that are going to \nreduce the likelihood that more soldiers will end up losing their \nlives.\n  This administration has been in total denial about the reality of the \nthreat in Iraq, total denial about the reality of what continues as a \nwar in Iraq, total denial when it comes to understanding that we have \nlost a worldwide coalition that stood by our side after 9/11 and now \nwonders why the United States wants to go it alone.\n  I want to make certain, as I end these remarks, that we understand \nthat in this great Nation we live in, we do have a chance to make a \nchoice. And that chance will come on November 2.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that as part of my unanimous \nconsent agreement, that when I finish and yield the floor, a quorum \nwill be questioned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has to actually suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas wishes to speak for \n20 minutes as in morning business. The time will count toward the 30 \nhours. Following that, Senator Durbin, who has already used his hour, \nor his designee, would be recognized for 20 minutes to speak as in \nmorning business. That time would also count against the 30 hours. That \nis the request for which I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, can I ask the distinguished Democratic \nwhip if from the 20 minutes allotted to our side I could consume 10 \nminutes, and then Senator Talent be recognized to speak for 10 minutes, \nand then Senator Durbin be recognized for his time?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely. And that following Senator Durbin, or his \ndesignee, we will return to a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n             Americans Are Stronger, Safer, And Better Off\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was sitting in my office watching on \ntelevision the proceedings in the Chamber, and I was inspired to come \nto the Chamber to respond to some of the comments I heard on the Senate \nfloor. I expected to be watching debate about reform of the oversight \nthat this body provides for the intelligence community and homeland \nsecurity but instead watched what appeared to be part of the \nPresidential campaign playing out here on the Senate floor.\n  I just want to respond to some of the things that I heard, and not at \ngreat length. But I think in fairness to the American people they \nshould not be fed just one side, which I think is fraught with \ninaccuracies. So I think a few facts are pertinent.\n  First of all, I would say that after listening to the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, you would wonder why in the world anyone would \nwant to live in the United States of America today because things are \nso bad we might as well give up and depart for somewhere else. And you \nmay have noticed, Mr. President, people are not knocking down the door \nto leave the United States of America because somehow we are no longer \nthe land of opportunity and freedom and hope.\n  Indeed, just the contrary is true. People are literally dying to get \ninto the United States by any method they can because they recognize \nthat America still is the last best hope of freedom-loving people \nanywhere in the world.\n  For example, we heard some very dire statements made about job \nfigures. Well, it just so happens that since August 2003, we learned \ntoday, 1.9 million new jobs have been created in the United States of \nAmerica--1.9 million new jobs. That is not because the Government \ncreated the jobs, but it is because Government created the conditions \nthat allowed the risk takers and the hard-working people all across \nthis country to create jobs, by investing and building opportunities \nfor those who wanted to find work.\n  Now, the truth is, as we all know, we came out of a very difficult \ntime at the beginning of President Bush's first term in office when he \nstarted his Presidency because during the end of President Clinton's \nterm we were going through a recession. The recession had just started \nthen. Then we know that the terrible events of 9/11 followed on shortly \nthereafter, with tremendous negative impact on our economy in addition \nto the terrible loss of human life.\n  Then there were the corporate scandals at the highest level of \ncorporate America which caused the public to lose confidence in the \nmarketplace.\n  Thanks to the efforts of this President and this administration, this \nCongress, thanks to the fact that we lowered taxes for hard-working men \nand women, it allowed them to save more, invest more, and for small \nbusinesses to create more jobs. Indeed, we are coming back with 1.9 \nmillion jobs being created since August 2003.\n  If we had agreed with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nabout what course to take, the recovery would have been killed in its \ninfancy because their solution was to raise taxes, not to lower taxes \nand let people keep more of what they earn. Yet what they want to do is \nplay the card of class warfare and accuse this President and this \nadministration of favoring part of the population, the wealthiest, over \nthe rest of America.\n  The fact is, the tax cuts that were passed by this Congress affected \nevery taxpayer, lowered the tax rates for even those of the most modest \nmeans, and are responsible for creating 1.9 million jobs.\n  We continually hear criticism about this President's policy in Iraq \nand in the global war on terror. Our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have a short-term memory because the only reason we took \nSaddam Hussein out of Iraq, as the bloodthirsty dictator that he was, \nand put him in a prison cell, is because of the authorization of this \nCongress. An overwhelming\n\n[[Page S10775]]\n\nmajority of the Members of this Congress, of this Senate, voted to \nauthorize the use of force in October of 2002, to enforce U.N. \nresolutions which Saddam Hussein had defied since 1991.\n  I was at the same Senate Armed Services Committee where Mr. Duelfer \ntestified a couple of days ago. While he confirmed that the \nintelligence the President relied on and this Congress relied on with \nregard to weapons of mass destruction proved not to be correct--and we \nare working in this bill to correct those deficiencies in our \nintelligence gathering and analysis capability--he did confirm Saddam \nHussein had corrupted the Oil for Food Program, was evading sanctions, \nchased the inspectors out of his country because he didn't want them to \nknow he was in the process of rebuilding his capacity to rearm himself \nwith weapons of mass destruction as soon as those sanctions failed.\n  Indeed, former Ambassador Paul Bremer, who served as the head of the \ncoalition efforts to rebuild Iraq, said:\n\n       The president was right when he concluded that Saddam \n     Hussein was a menace who needed to be removed from power. \n     [The president] understands that our enemies are not confined \n     to al Qaeda, and certainly not just Osama bin Laden, who is \n     probably trapped in his hide-out in Afghanistan. As the \n     bipartisan 9/11 commission reported, there were contacts \n     between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's regime going back a \n     decade. We will win the war against global terror only by \n     staying on the offensive and confronting terrorists and the \n     state sponsors of terror--wherever they are. Right now, Abu \n     Musab al-Zarqawi, a Qaeda ally, is a dangerous threat. He is \n     in Iraq.\n\n  I hope those who listen to the debate and the politics of this season \nand the attempt to score political points by criticizing this Nation's \npolicy with regard to the global war on terror understand exactly what \nis going on. We are in the silly season, where sometimes the statements \nbeing made in pursuit of scoring political points stray way too far \nfrom the facts.\n  The fact is, America is stronger and safer and better off as a result \nof President Bush's leadership and as a result of the leadership of \nthis Congress. We have created opportunity for more Americans. America \nis more secure than we were on 9/11. We are constantly working, \nincluding here today, to make it safer. We have created 1.9 million \njobs since August 2003 as a result of the policies of this Congress and \nthis President. If we had accepted the rationale of our colleagues \nacross the aisle and raised taxes and let spending run amok, then we \nwould still be in very dire straits, indeed, and not on the road to \nrecovery.\n  I yield the remainder of the 20 minutes allotted to our side to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, how much of the 20 minutes remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, if the Senator from New Jersey would \nagree, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes, and I \nwould, of course, agree that he could have an additional 5 minutes, if \nwe could modify that previous unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Speaking for our side, is the Senator asking for 5 \nminutes from our remaining time?\n  Mr. TALENT. No, 5 minutes in addition to my 11 minutes, and then my \nrequest would be that you would have an additional 5 minutes, for a \ntotal of 25.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  Mr. TALENT. Under the same parameters as the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from Illinois, I ask to extend the 20 minutes to \n25 minutes on each side. I think I can do what I need to do if I have \nabout 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. As I understand, the Senator from Missouri would be \nrecognized for 15 minutes, and Senator Durbin or his designee would be \nrecognized for 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lautenberg be the \ndesignated substitute for Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. TALENT. If the Senator from Nevada will yield, it is only a \nminute, but a minute is a minute. I think I had 11, so an additional 5 \nwould be 16 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And further, the consent agreement said that following the \nstatement of Senator Durbin or his designee, we would return to a \nquorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank the Senator from Nevada. I don't mean to quibble \nover a minute. On the other hand, the Rams would probably have won the \nSuper Bowl a couple of years ago if they had had another minute, so one \nnever knows.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend would yield, those of us who \nserved in the House know how important a minute is.\n  Mr. TALENT. And the Senator knows, I also served in the House and \ncame from there more recently than he did. I do guard my minutes \njealously.\n  Mr. REID. In the House, how we got to speak was, we were entitled to \n1 minute a day. We were always guaranteed 1 minute a day. But most of \nthe time that was all we got all week long, that 1 minute a day.\n  Mr. TALENT. The Senator has had a similar experience as I have. \nHaving prepared a nice set of remarks on issues about which he feels \npassionately and gone to the floor manager in the House and asked how \nmuch time he could have and being told: Well, a couple of other people \nhave expressed a desire for time; how about 90 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Speaking from the Chair and the observation of \nthe Chair, I never served in the House, and we might observe the same \nrules here some days.\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from \nNevada for their flexibility. I will proceed with my 16 minutes as best \nI can.\n  Mr. President, I share the observation of the Senator from Texas that \nour friend from Illinois is certainly very angry and seems to be rather \nnegative about the prospects for America. He would probably say he is \nnegative about the administration, but he seems to describe an economic \nand foreign policy picture that is very bleak. I don't think it \nreflects reality or what most Americans believe is reality. I am \ncertain it does not reflect the views or the policies of the \nadministration.\n  I do think it is important to get some of these charges correct. I \ndon't have time to go through everything. I want to talk about a couple \nof things that have interested me. I don't generally get up here to \nparticipate in these debates that are clearly part of the Presidential \ncampaign. I am here to try and do things. I have an agenda I am trying \nto accomplish, and others share it.\n  I was distressed when the Senator from California referred to some of \nthe remarks of the Senator from Utah and said: Talk about flimflam, \ntalk about misleading the seniors.\n  That was with reference to the Senator's comments regarding the \nMedicare prescription drug bill, which I happened to rather like and I \nsupported. It is already helping thousands of Missouri seniors, and I \ndon't think that is flimflam. I will get to that in a minute.\n\n  The Senator from Texas correctly pointed out that when the whole \nissue of jobs lost over the last few years comes up, it is important to \nkeep in mind, before blaming President Bush, that President Bush was \nnot in office when the recession began. Americans all across the \ncountry understand there is something called a business cycle, an \neconomic cycle in the country. I don't tend to blame Presidents for \nrecessions. I blame them if they have long-term policies that depress \nthe economy over the long term.\n  I agree with the Senator from Texas, if you want economic growth--and \nwe should all want that because we cannot do anything we want to \nwithout growth; we cannot fund education, we cannot have good health \ncare, or a strong defense, and we cannot have retirement security \nwithout growth.\n  How do you get growth? Our Democrat friends believe you get it by \nraising taxes on people. What the Senator from Illinois said--they \ndidn't used to think that. There was a time not so long ago when there \nwas a bipartisan agreement that, if you wanted growth, one of the \nthings you did was cut taxes. That is not some kind of modern \nconservative philosophy. That is what John Maynard Keynes thought; that \nis what FDR thought; that is what LBJ and JFK thought. But they don't \nbelieve that today. They are entitled to\n\n[[Page S10776]]\n\ntheir beliefs, but they are not entitled to blame President Bush for a \nrecession that was in effect and had started before he assumed office \nand was magnified by events over which he had no control--the attack on \n9/11 and corporate fraud.\n  I don't blame any President for that either, but it didn't happen on \nPresident Bush's watch. He took steps to get the economy moving. He \nproposed a tax cut, which we passed despite the opposition of many--\nalthough not all--Members of the other side of the aisle. He proposed \ntort reform, restrictions on abusive lawsuits, which I think is the \nmost important thing we can do to get the economy going. That was \nfilibustered by the other side. You can filibuster if you want to, but \nyou cannot filibuster and then blame somebody else for not getting \nthings done.\n  You heard from the Senator from Illinois that energy prices are too \nhigh. I am on the Energy Committee. It is one of my priorities to get \nenergy prices down. We put together a really good Energy bill. We got \nit all the way through the process, with one vote left. We could not \ntake that vote. Do you know why? It was filibustered. Is it President \nBush's fault that the Energy bill was filibustered--a pro-production, \npro-jobs, pro-growth Energy bill?\n  Many Members on the other side joined us in trying to defeat the \nfilibuster, but there were not enough. We lost three-quarters of the \nother party. Senator Kerry voted for the filibuster.\n  Iraq. We hear over and over again that there was no reason, no plan, \nno coalition. There was a reason and it goes back to 1991. I remember \nduring the 1990s, when people criticized the first President Bush \nbecause he didn't get rid of Hussein. He was trying to appeal to the \nU.N., and he left Saddam Hussein in power.\n  I was in the House all through the 1990s on the Armed Services \nCommittee. This man and his regime was an organic threat to the \ninterests and security of the United States of America. Everybody saw \nit. He had attacked his neighbors twice, lobbed missiles all over the \ncountry. He used weapons of mass destruction on his own people. We \ncannot permit an anti-American tyrant to take control of that part of \nthe world.\n  I believe very strongly that President Clinton was moving toward a \nresolution of that when he left office. Look at the statements he made \nthen and the statements he has made since then. Even if there had not \nbeen a 9/11, we would have had to do something about Saddam Hussein \nand, no, we could not wait longer. How long are you supposed to wait? \nAt what point do arguments in favor of waiting really become just a \ndisguise for doing nothing and not wanting to admit it?\n\n  No plan. The plan was to remove Saddam Hussein and replace him, with \nthe help of the Iraqi people, with a liberal democracy that would be an \nally against terrorism. Saddam Hussein is gone. We have had the \nprovisional convention. We have a provisional government in place. We \nare going to have elections in January. Prime Minister Allawi stood on \nthe dais in the House and said that. He also said: We are going to \nstand with you. He said--I remarked on this--``as you have stood with \nus, we will stand with you in the battle against terrorism.''\n  No coalition. Look, this kind of a military effort, no matter where \nit occurs, and whether the U.N. supports it or not, is going to be 95-\npercent led and executed by forces of the United States of America. In \nthe air war in Bosnia, which everybody supported, even though there was \nno U.N. resolution in support of it, 95 to 97 percent of the airpower \nwas American.\n  There is one very important coalition partner--the Iraqis. It is \nincorrect to say that 90 percent of the casualties have been American. \nWe have taken casualties, but they are taking them too, and they will \ntake more and more as they assume responsibility for this war.\n  The Medicare prescription drug bill. The Senator from Illinois says \nit is a terrible political conspiracy on the part of the President to \ndelay the full implementation of the bill until after November 2004. \nNobody's proposal would have been implemented before November 2004. I \ndidn't like that. I complained about that. I thought, well, in 1965 \nthey did the whole Medicare bill in 8 months. Why does it take so long \nto set up one new feature? Everybody believed that. There were not any \nof their proposals that would have taken effect before November of \n2004. I don't like that, but that is not a political conspiracy. I \ndon't know if the Senator from Texas heard that. I had not. You cannot \nbargain.\n  Look, this is the reason for the Medicare prescription drug bill--and \nI have 200,000 senior citizens in Missouri who have no insurance for \ntheir prescription drugs. They are paying not only out of pocket, which \nis the first thing that is wrong, but they are paying the highest price \nbecause when they walk into the pharmacy, it is them against the big \ninsurance companies. The whole idea is to get them into a pool because \nif you are part of a big pool, you have economies of scale and prices \nwill be lower. That is what this bill does. I don't have time to go \ninto length on this issue.\n  The bargaining with the prescription drug companies is going to be \ndone by the organizations that put the pool together--like we have \ndiscount cards, one, for example, that AARP puts out, and AARP bargains \nwith the prescription drug companies and you buy the AARP discount card \nand you get the discount. People are getting that discount today.\n  If I go to the car dealer and buy an automobile, I may bargain with \nthe dealer about the price of the car. I am not going to bargain about \nthe price of the tires on the automobile. That doesn't mean there was \nno bargaining over the price of the tires; it means the automobile \nmanufacturer did it. The difference between us and them on this--and it \nis a legitimate difference--is they want a one-size-fits-all, \nGovernment-dominated program where the Government would directly do the \nbargaining with the drug company.\n  There are worse things than that. We thought ours was better. We \nwanted a number of different options for seniors, where the people who \norganized the options would bargain with the prescription \ndrug companies. It is a difference of philosophy because they are more \ntrusting of the Government than we are. It is not some kind of \nconspiracy with the drug companies.\n\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 32 seconds.\n  Mr. TALENT. I think I can do it in 6 minutes.\n  This is the reason I got up. President Bush actually has a plan to \nlower health insurance premiums. It is a pretty good plan. It is my \nplan. He kind of got it from me and Senator Snowe and Senator Bond and \na couple of us over here, those of us who have worked on this since \n1997 when I was in the House. I don't like people saying my plan is not \na plan.\n  President Bush wants two things. He wants medical liability reform--\nreform of frivolous lawsuits in medicine. In Missouri, they know about \nthis because we are losing doctors because malpractice insurance \npremiums are going up due to a problem with frivolous lawsuits.\n  The Senator from Texas told me they just passed a bill to reform that \nand their health insurance premiums are going down substantially, and I \nknow this is happening all over the country. If you cut that risk of \nthe frivolous lawsuits, where people are recovering many more times the \nvalue of actual injuries, insurance premiums will go down. President \nBush wants that. We didn't get that here because it was filibustered. \nHis opponent in the election supported the filibuster.\n  How can you say he doesn't have a plan? You can say you disagree with \nthe plan if you want--you filibustered it. The plan I have that the \nPresident supports is called the association health plan.\n  Most of the people who do not have health insurance in the country \nare working people. They work for small businesses or are farmers. They \ncannot get health insurance because it is more expensive to buy health \ninsurance as part of a small group than it is as a big national pool.\n  There is a reason everybody else who has health insurance, except \npeople who work for small businesses, get in as part of a national \npool. Think about that for a minute. You work for a big company, you \nare part of a big labor union plan, Medicare, a national pool, \nMedicaid, a national pool. You are a Federal employee, retired Federal \nemployee, retired military, you get it as\n\n[[Page S10777]]\n\npart of a national pool because there are economies of scale to \ninsuring a large group. Administrative costs are less, and the \nbargaining power is more. You get more for less. You get better quality \nhealth insurance at less cost and no sacrifice of access or quality.\n  What I would like to do and the President would like to do is allow \nsmall businesses to do the same, to get health insurance through their \ntrade association, so that my brother--and I have mentioned him on the \nfloor before--who has a little restaurant in St. Louis--and I encourage \nanybody within the sound of my voice to patronize it; great hamburgers, \nMr. President--he would like to get health insurance for his people as \npart of a big group. He would get it then. He is an employee of his \ncorporation, his little business. He has to buy it on the small group \nmarket. But what if he could join the National Restaurant Association \nand become part of a 10-, 20-, 30-person pool and get health insurance \non the same terms as if he worked for Anheuser-Busch headquartered in \nSt. Louis or Hallmark headquartered in Kansas City. The health \ninsurance premiums would go down 30 percent, at no cost to the \ntaxpayers because it is not a Government program. It empowers small \nbusinesses to do what big businesses can do.\n  We hear over there how they do not like big business. They are not \nsupporting this. It has passed in the House year after year with \nbipartisan support. The President supports it; his opponent does not.\n  Mr. President, look, there are differences between President Bush and \nSenator Kerry. The nature of our elections, unfortunately, is our \ncandidates--and I can assure voters of this--are never as bad as they \nmake each other out to be. They are both better people than you would \nbelieve from the commercials, but there are big differences of opinion. \nAnd I am proud of the fact that with the support of many people on the \nother side of the aisle, my party in leading this Congress and my \nparty's leader at the White House has proposed a series of measures \nthat empower small businesses and farmers that create jobs, that lower \nhealth insurance costs in innovative ways that will not cost the \ntaxpayers a lot of money, that has built up our defenses, has taken the \nfight to the terrorists and has stood with respect but clearly for the \ncommonsense cultural values of this country.\n  I would say in each of those areas, there is a big difference between \nmy party's nominee for President and the other party's nominee, as much \nas I respect him and as often as I have worked with him on various \nissues in the past. With the greatest respect to the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Illinois, that ``ain't'' flimflam. That \nis not misleading anybody. That is the way it is. If we are going to \ndebate out here on the floor regarding the Presidential election, we \nought to at least get it right.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will use our time to discuss a \ncouple of subjects, one of which relates to the present debate or \ndialog, and that is the position of our respective parties on behalf of \nthe interests of the American people. After that, I will talk about the \nterrible attack that took place in Egypt against a group of Israelis \nand what the world is saying about events such as that.\n  First, what we heard in the debate a little while ago was the fact \nthat the reason, as I heard it--and I am willing to be corrected if \nwrong--that one of the reasons we went to war in Iraq was a resolution \nthat was passed in this body, in the Senate--talking about the \nresolution that was passed in October 2002--giving the President \nauthority to send our troops to Iraq. That hardly was the reason we did \nthat.\n  We did not mandate in this body that we go to war. What we said was: \nOK, Mr. President, if you know about those weapons of mass destruction, \nand if you know that al-Qaida has a presence there, and if all of these \nthreats are directed at world peace and a threat to the security of the \nUnited States, we give you permission, we give you support to send \nthem.\n  We never relinquished our support for the troops in Iraq, nobody \nhere, not even the most tranquil of the personalities. Everybody said: \nTake care of our troops. Senator John Kerry stood up and said: Take \ncare of our troops.\n  I was not in the Senate at that particular moment, but I have been \nback here again since the beginning of 2003. There was never a moment \nwhen it was suggested that we would not support our troops and their \nneeds, the basic things.\n  So when we were told that all these threats were there, that we have \nto do it to protect ourselves, that 9/11 was fresh in our memory, that \nwe felt we had to get out there before we had another 9/11 thrust down \nour throats that would kill more Americans, we said: OK, let's do it. \nLet's go ahead and make sure that we wipe out these things that menace \nAmerica's population, that menace American citizens.\n  That was the reason we did it. Then we found out that we were duped. \nThat is what happened. We were fooled. We were misled, and now \neverybody knows it. Yes, Senator John Kerry had the same information \nPresident Bush had. The fact is, Senator John Kerry did not manipulate \nthe information, did not make sure that people were identifying tubes \nand pipes as part of the threat that Iraq raised to us and to world \npeace.\n  Much of that was, if not fabricated, tainted, biased. Some of our \nmost distinguished Government servants, our distinguished Secretary of \nState Colin Powell, made such a convincing argument in front of the \nU.N. and in front of the world at large about where these weapons were \nstored, how they were transported, and so forth. And all of us--I speak \nfor myself--have faith in Secretary Powell, a distinguished soldier, \ngreat statesman, brilliant man, honest--honest. He later on said in a \npublic release that he, too, was deceived by the information that he \nreceived.\n  Now when we try to suggest that we were parties to the origination of \nthis war, it is an outrage. I felt, too--and I was not in the Senate, \nbut I said it publicly, people were still hearing me occasionally--that \nI supported the thrust to go to war in Iraq because of the ominous \nreports we had.\n  It was not that we wanted to throw American lives in there. We are \nnow about to deploy some 1,500 Guard people from New Jersey. I hope \nthat tomorrow I will be able to be there to wish them well when they \ndepart New Jersey. It reminds me of a long time ago when I also was \ntransported out of New Jersey to a ship up in Massachusetts so I could \ngo to Europe during the war. I want to be there tomorrow. They are all \nconcerned. They are frightened. The families are frightened. Their \nspouses are frightened. Their kids are frightened. We are in a mess, we \nare in a quagmire, and the world is looking at us and listening to the \nmessages that say we are doing well, we are prepared for the Iraqi \ntakeover fully for the next election.\n  We hear, well, maybe the next election cannot be held as we thought \nit might be in the whole country, maybe only part of it, maybe just the \npart that we think is friendly.\n  The assertion when Prime Minister Allawi was here, the interim Prime \nMinister who made his speech at the joint session, that we should be \nassured--I heard President Bush say we should be assured that things \nare on the right track. In other words, do not believe what one sees in \nfront of them. No, no. Listen to what we tell people coming from the \nadministration. Listen to the fabrications. Listen to the stories about \nSenator John Kerry's lack of courage, unwillingness to support the \ntroops. There is an unwillingness that stands largely in our sight \nabout an unwillingness to serve when the country was sending its people \nto Vietnam, where 58,000 of them perished on the battlefield. For Vice \nPresident Cheney, he said, and I quote him, I think--if I do not quote \nhim, I am sure about the general content of what he said, and that is: \nI had other priorities. He received almost a half dozen deferments.\n  President Bush's service, yes, I know, it was 30 years ago, and what \ndoes it matter? It matters because it shows character. That is what it \ndoes. It shows character. President Bush did not want to be over there \nwhere the fighting was tough, where one's life\n\n[[Page S10778]]\n\nmight be at risk. No, no. He managed to have a sweetheart duty and \nnever went to war when he could very well have, with the bravado that \nis now exhibited. He could have gone to war and stood alongside people \nlike John Kerry and Max Cleland, those who paid a price for their \nloyalty to country.\n  I saw a commercial running on TV this morning. I found it shocking. \nWidows, apparently, whose husbands perished in the Korean War were \nsaying they did not trust John Kerry's judgment because, why? It is \nbecause the Bush administration and the political operation there has \nsucceeded in poisoning the minds of Americans.\n  Do not believe the fact that Senator Kerry got three Purple Hearts, \ndeservedly, oh, no. They want to make the judgment from the White \nHouse. Those judgments were made by the medical department of the U.S. \nmilitary, and they were confirmed by the highest authorities in the \nmilitary.\n  The medals for valor, the Bronze Star and Silver Star--I served in \nEurope during the war and I know what it took to get those medals. It \ntook heroism. I did not get one of those medals. I did my job the best \nI could. But John Kerry earned his medals, and they are being \nquestioned to try to show he is unpatriotic.\n  The fact that he rebelled against the purpose of the war in Vietnam \nafter he served, boy, what kind of backbone that takes. The man knows \nthe policy is wrong, and it turned out to be wrong, and it turned out \nto be a terrible loss of life, but he fought the battle. He exposed \nhimself to danger, to death. He did it. What kind of courage that is. \nThat is not the kind of courage we saw from a young George W. Bush, not \nat all, or from Vice President Cheney. I think Attorney General \nAshcroft also had a few deferments. There is a list of them.\n\n  I think the race against former Senator Max Cleland, who lost two \nlegs and most of an arm and struggles to get out of bed every day and \ndo what he has to--he is a courageous man and he lost because he was \nportrayed as soft on defense. He was portrayed as soft on defense by \nthose who also had Vietnam deferments.\n  The country was in a rage, with demonstrations all over the place, \nbut John Kerry took up the challenge and went to war.\n  So now when I hear these spurious assertions that one cannot trust \nJohn Kerry, well, I will say, if I was lost in the woods and had a \nchoice between John Kerry or George W. Bush getting me out, I know John \nKerry can make a decision. I know he can find his way. I know he can \nsurvive when the going is tough. I know he had the guts to reach into \nthe water to pull out one of his companions who was likely to drown and \nsaved his life. The man says so all over the place.\n  I think the country would be far better off if we followed John \nKerry's courageous character and tried to find a way out of the mess. \nWe are almost a year and a half after President Bush declared the \nmission was accomplished. It is almost 18 months ago but more \nimportantly it was more than 800 lives ago. We have now lost over 1,000 \npeople and more than 800 of them since May of a year ago, and they are \nstill trying to portray what the President said as gospel: mission \naccomplished.\n  He said, bring them on. Boy, that one got to me because I know what \nit is like to be worried about the enemy. They shoot at you. Bring them \non? I never wanted to see a German uniform, I can say that. I never \nwanted to see more of the enemy. I wanted to make sure I did my duty. I \nwanted to make sure that I got through. I wanted to make sure I got \nback to my widowed mother and my kid sister. That is what I wanted to \ndo. So we never said, bring them on. I have never heard of another \nCommander in Chief say, bring them on.\n  I do not want to elongate this discussion, but I must say when I see \nthese character assassination ads that run on television regularly, I \ndo not hear them talking seriously about the job recovery, no, no. Some \njobs are newly created but not as many as we lost.\n  They talk on the other side about how John Kerry is going to raise \ntaxes. Outrageous, the thought that he had voted to increase taxes. No, \nthey would rather vote to increase the deficit and to increase our \nindebtedness. That is what they want to vote for. Let America owe so \nmuch money that we may one day tip the world's economy into a recession \nmode. That was said by former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin, a very \nreliable voice. Both Republicans and Democrats had faith in Bob Rubin. \nHe said if this indebtedness continues to grow, we could upset the \nworld's economy, not just ours. And I believe it. Anybody who has ever \nbeen in business, anybody who has ever paid bills, anybody who has ever \nlived in a serious adult life knows that indebtedness is a killer. But \nthe administration managed to turn things around. It wasn't my doing, I \ncan tell you. I tried to help. When I left here, we were having \nsurpluses, a couple of hundred billion dollars in surplus with \nforecasts of a $5 trillion surplus at the end of 10 years. That has \nturned around. Instead, we expect about a $7 trillion deficit after 10 \nyears.\n\n  We have managed to take this economy and turn it on its ear, borrow \nfrom Social Security, threaten Medicare with insolvency in 15 years. By \n2019, the expectation is that Medicare will go belly-up at that time. \nSocial Security? We are borrowing everything available there. Why don't \nwe tell the people the truth? Why don't we talk about those issues in \ndepth?\n  In the debates coming up tonight and another one next week, I hope \nthe focus will be on what kind of plans each of the candidates has. \nWhat kind of plans has President George W. Bush for getting us out of \nIraq? What kind of plans does he have for getting this economy back \ninto surplus performances year after year? What kind of plans does he \nhave to fulfill the obligation he took on with the Leave No Child \nBehind Act? It is one thing to enact legislation, to create law; it is \nanother to pay for it. When it comes to paying for it, that didn't \nhappen.\n  When you think about these tax cuts, we were accused before by one of \nour distinguished colleagues on the other side of trying to create \nclass warfare. That is the cheesiest thing I have ever heard. Class \nwarfare? I happen to be in a class of income earners who did very well \nin America, I and two other kids who came from the same poor \nneighborhood that I did. Their father worked in the same mill my father \nworked in, and my father died at 43 from an occupationally hazardous \nenvironment. We built a huge business, a huge business. We went from \nnothing, three of us together, kids in their 20s, and we built a \nbusiness that today employs 40,000 people. That is the old-fashioned \nAmerican way. I made some money with this, as did many others who \nsucceeded in business. We did it the old-fashioned way.\n  Class warfare? I come from working-class stock, and I am proud of it. \nBut because I have been successful, because this country was the \nenabler that permitted me to be successful, as everybody else who has \nbeen successful here, I say I don't need a tax cut. It will not do me \nany more good. I can't buy more, I can't eat more, I can't do more, and \nI want it distributed among the ordinary people who work every day, \nstruggling the way I remember my mother and my father did just to keep \nthings on an even keel, to provide clothing, to provide food, to \nprovide decent shelter. I lived in the back of the store for a lot of \nyears, I can tell you, four of us in one room. Nobody wants to hear \nthose stories anymore. The Great Depression is a thing of the past. But \nwe do understand when people want to rise above their circumstances and \neducate their children and make sure they have a chance at a job, a \ncareer, and a family where they can afford the ordinary things of \nlife--not the luxuries.\n  So we can't talk about class warfare. If there is class warfare, boy, \nit is over there. They say take the upper class, give them a lot of \nmoney back, and don't worry about those poor people or those who now \nhave two jobs, who now find their purchasing power is substantially \nreduced, who now are worried about what it is going to cost for health \ncare and who are worried about pensions.\n  I was at a hearing the other day on the financial condition of the \nairlines. What they want to do is to get rid of their pension \nobligation. If you work 26 years for an airline, a factory, or a \ncompany, work 27 years, count on your pension, and wake up one day and \nfind out it is not there, what do you do? You are 55, 60, 65 years of \nage. These are terrible blights. I hope we are going to see something \nof the truth.\n\n[[Page S10779]]\n\n                       Terrorist Bombing In Egypt\n\n  Mr. President, I want to discuss another subject. I want to discuss \nthe news we heard today of a raid in Egypt aimed at a bunch of Israelis \nwho were there on vacation--brutalizing, suicide bombers, the whole \nthing. An Israeli official says maybe it was al-Qaida. Obviously it was \nsome mad group.\n  What I see lately is disturbing trends regarding the various \ncriticisms of Israel. We have seen two prominent church bodies decide \nto take away their investments from Israel because of Israel's--maybe \nit is because Israel wants to defend itself, to keep its people alive. \nMaybe it is because Israel wants to live as any other country--in \npeace, without torture, without suicide bombers ripping up the society.\n  The Israelis have lost over 1,000 lives since 2000. Think of it in \nterms of America and the numerical equivalents because their population \nis so much smaller. One thousand citizens of Israel would be the same \nas 48,000 Americans lost to terror. Heaven forbid it, but that is the \ntruth of the matter.\n  Israel has taken appropriate measures to defend itself against the \nterrorist threat it faces every day. Israel has made tough choices to \ndefend her people. But now we are seeing these respected, mainstream \nchurch organizations contemplating divestment campaigns against the \nState of Israel. I wish they would talk about ending the violence that \nhas been the pattern there for so long. There is so much violence and \nstrife in the region, not dissimilar to that which we are facing in \nIraq.\n  There is a trend. You can see it in the talk of a divestment \ncampaign--blame Israel first. The innocents killed by terrorists are \nignored, but there is a disproportionate focus on civilian victims of \nIsraeli military operations against terrorists. To blame Israel for the \nturmoil and violence in the Middle East is outrageous. Review some of \nthe recent history in the Middle East, events that had nothing to do \nwith Israel. Yet when I was in Syria with other Senators, we heard the \nPresident of Syria, President Assad, say all the problems that exist in \nthe area are because of Israel.\n  Millions died in the Iran-Iraq war. It had nothing to do with Israel. \nIn Sudan, Arab Muslims are murdering thousands of Black Christians--\nnothing to do with Israel. Iraq invading Kuwait in 1991 and threatening \nSaudi Arabia had nothing to do with Israel. The Taliban took control of \nAfghanistan and severely oppressed women and gave safe haven to \nterrorists--nothing to do with Israel. None of these events had \nanything to do with Israel, yet somehow or other the region's problems \nare Israel's fault.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, with that, I will close my comments \nand hope the world takes a look at what is causing the problems within \nIsrael and her right to defend herself.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll, and the following \nSenators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                          [Quorum No. 1, Leg.]\n\n       Frist\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). A quorum is not present. The clerk \nwill call the names of absent Senators.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I now move to instruct the Sergeant at Arms \nto request the presence of absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays on the motion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: Are we not in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have had a quorum call, and a quorum is not \npresent.\n  Is there a sufficient second on the motion?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Chambliss), the Senator from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nSununu) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Graham), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. \nLeahy), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 85, nays 4, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 205 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--85\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--4\n\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Breaux\n     Inouye\n\n                             NOT VOTING--11\n\n     Boxer\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Edwards\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Hollings\n     Kerry\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Sununu\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum is present.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Bingaman amendment has been set aside.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the two distinguished whips have done a lot \nof work on the resolution before us through yesterday, last night, and \nover the course of the morning. As people have been saying, we have \ncome to a stall period, and we really do need to refocus on the \nresolution itself. We are down to a very few remaining amendments that \nwere agreed to. The list was agreed to last night. I urge our \ncolleagues to allow us to progress on the underlying resolution and on \nthose amendments so we can progress with a lot of business that we have \nto do. But we cannot do the other business until we address these \namendments.\n  I understand everyone's rights, but I remind everybody that we are in \na cloture period, and we invoked cloture. I believe the vote this \nmorning was 88 to 3. Therefore, I urge us to stay on the business we \nare now on and to address the amendments. Once we complete the \namendments, we will proceed to the cloture vote on the underlying \nresolution itself.\n  We have just used a procedural vote. We have not had to use \nprocedural votes very often over the last couple of years. I am \ndisappointed to have to force Members to come back to the floor, but we \ndo need to focus on the business at hand. We have other issues to \naddress, such as the FSC/ETI bill and the Homeland Security \nappropriations that we are doing. We cannot get to those until we \naddress the business at hand.\n  Some people are saying we ought to go home or we should not do the \nNation's business. We are talking about intelligence reform, the safety \nand security of the American people, and we need to address those \nissues now.\n  We do have the FSC/ETI bill, the Defense authorization bill, and the \nHomeland Security appropriations, when they are available, and we will \ntake those up. But we have to complete this bill first.\n  On the business at hand, I have an amendment at the desk, which has\n\n[[Page S10780]]\n\nbeen cleared on both sides. I do ask consent to call up a modified \nversion of my amendment, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again, this amendment was an amendment \nthat, last night, we said we would be addressing today. We have Members \nwho are trying to work on that business. Again, I plead with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle to allow us to address the intelligence \noversight of the Senate. The American people expect it. I know \nindividual Senators have certain rights to put a block and to obstruct, \nbut we are talking about the Nation's business.\n  We are about ready to adjourn over the next hours, but it looks as \nthough, because of the obstruction, it is going to be days now, but we \nare going to stay here. The American people deserve it. The 9/11 \nCommission Report said act and we have acted, and now we are in that \nfinal few feet of this sprint, and we are there, but we are having this \nobstruction.\n  The amendment I just asked to turn to is part of the underlying \nbusiness. Again, we just heard another objection. So I am frustrated, \nbut nevertheless we are going to stay here and we are going to complete \nthe Nation's business.\n\n  I am prepared at this juncture to yield the floor to allow business. \nI understand Senators have rights and can speak under rule XXII, but I \ndo want to at least advise Members that we cannot just sit in a quorum \ncall like we have for the last little bit throughout the afternoon. The \nAmerican people deserve more. We are here to work. We are here to \nproduce. We are here to address the safety and security of the American \npeople. If Members want to debate this resolution, please come forward \nand do it. It is the resolution that is the business on the floor. We \nwill have votes as necessary through the afternoon and through the \nevening, hopefully on substantive amendments. We will have procedural \nvotes, if necessary, to bring people back to conduct the Nation's \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have the floor. I would be glad to yield to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico for purposes of a discussion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, discussion of this bill. First, I want to say I \nhave a little amendment pending, but believe me, I do not intend to \ndelay things. I will offer it with Senator Bingaman, so I am not \nrunning to my office, and the Senator does not have to call me back \nwith anything.\n  I want to tell the Senator why things are taking so long. We have \nSenator Harkin. He has a legitimate point. I mean, the whole law of the \nland on big subjects that the conferees know nothing about in \nappropriations should not be changed. The Senator from Iowa can speak \nfor himself, but I have a situation where the conferees on that \nsubcommittee have not had a hearing on the huge program called the milk \nsubsidy for America. They changed it. They extended part of it. They \nadded a new subsidy and a new forward contract.\n  Now, how do they know how that affects Oklahoma, California, or \nTexas? They do not, but there are enough people on the conference to do \nthat, and Senators know about that.\n  Now, I am a player, and there is nobody who has more respect for what \nthe Senator is trying to do than I, but there comes a point where one \ncannot stand it anymore. People want this big bill to protect our \ncountry, Homeland Security, but they do not have to protect some cows \nalong with it, do they? We are not here for a cow protection program; \nwe are here to protect America.\n  So if they do that--I do the rules, although not very often, but that \nbill has three perfect points of order in it. I say to the leader, they \nwill be made, and they are all debatable. Unless they can get to the \nfloor to make a motion to table, we will be here and then we can talk a \nlittle bit.\n  So the great desire of the Senator to get out of here Sunday, I can \ntell the Senator that if he brings that bill out here with that on it, \nwe are here until Wednesday.\n  That is a cinch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the distinguished Chair, and I thank the Senator \nfrom New Mexico and respect always his opinion and his passion.\n  Since the Senator from Iowa is in the Chamber, I would like to \nperhaps do something that may be pleasant for him, and that is I will \nyield to him for 5 minutes without losing my right to the floor, if he \nwould like to describe his plans to the body. No?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Arizona. I did not hear what he \nsaid.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I said I would be glad to propound a unanimous consent to \nyield to the Senator for 5 minutes without losing my right to the \nfloor, if the Senator would like to describe what he intends to do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Arizona. I did not hear what he \nsaid.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I said I would be happy to propound a unanimous consent \nto yield to you without losing my right to the floor, if you would like \nto describe what you intend to do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for that kindness.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from Iowa \nfor 5 minutes and then regain my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator asked what my plans are. My plans are to \nprotect my farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. My plans are to fight for what we in the Agriculture \nCommittee----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Arizona, my plan is to fight for \nan agreement that was hammered out in the Agriculture bill a couple or \n3 years ago that everybody signed up on, everyone agreed, the President \nsigned it.\n  It is not right. I tell my friends, it is not right to treat farmers \nin one area of this country different than the other. For the last 50 \nyears, this Congress has responded to disasters, whether they are \nearthquakes or tornadoes or floods or hail or fire or hurricanes. For \n50 years, we have responded, and not once, not once have we offset it. \nIt has always been in emergency spending.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Not once until 2 years ago they did it once, and that was \ncorrected. Now they want to do it again. Once was once too many. Now \nthey want to change the underlying structure of the farm bill. I am \ntelling you, it is not right to do so.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for giving me the time to explain \nwhy I am doing what I am doing. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to do the same thing with the Senator from \nArkansas in just a minute. I would like to make a point to my friend \nfrom Iowa and others. I don't think there is anyone else in this body \nwho has been viewed in as many ways as one who is--maybe the word is \nobstructionist and disagreeable from time to time on issues with which \nI do not agree, but let me say I have never filibustered, nor have I \never tried to prevent the passage of legislation as long as I have been \nable to have my amendment, make my point, and get a vote and move \nforward.\n  I say to my friend from Iowa, I think for the good of the body here, \non Friday afternoon, I would be glad to vote on any amendment he would \npropose. I would be glad to debate and vote, because I just do not \nthink it is good for the institution for us to stay here until Tuesday, \nbasically doing nothing. I am not sure we satisfy our constituents by \ndoing so.\n  Now, if it is agreeable--I ask unanimous consent to yield 2 minutes \nto the Senator from Arkansas, without losing my right to the floor--\nexcuse me, Louisiana. My deep apologies. I do know the difference \nbetween Louisiana and Arkansas.\n\n[[Page S10781]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for \nyielding.\n  I am objecting also because of an issue that is of great concern to \nme and to the people of Louisiana. It is in this $137 billion tax bill \nthat we have worked on very hard for 2 years. Our leaders in the Senate \nhave done an excellent job under very difficult circumstances. It was a \nHouse committee, without the cameras rolling and without a real record \nof it.\n  The only people taking bullets for us, who are the men and women on \nthe front line in Afghanistan and Iraq--in this case the Guard and \nNational Reserve--the only people taking the bullets were left out of \nthe bill completely. They were not the top of the list, they were not \nin the middle of the list, and they were not in the bottom of the list.\n  So I am slowing the Senate down until I can get this message out, and \ntalking to as many reporters and others who will talk so I can tell \nthem the truth and what happened. I can talk to my colleagues if we are \ngoing to stay here a day or 2 days or 3 days. They have been in Iraq \nfor over a year and a half, 2 years, and another weekend is not going \nto hurt me. We need to talk about a plan to work through it. But I am \nnot leaving them on the cutting-room floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to say again to my colleagues, as one who \nhas a reputation for disagreeing from time to time, I think we should \nlet the body move forward and decide on these amendments. I believe we \ncould work out agreements that would allow for amendments to be voted \nup or down on these very compelling issues.\n  I share the concern and view of the Senator from Louisiana. I think \nthat issue needs to be discussed and debated. I am not sure just \nholding up the body is the answer.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent for my colleague from Oklahoma to \nspeak for 3 minutes, without losing my right to the floor, and then the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4027 to Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4027.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4027 to amendment No. 3981.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To vest sole jurisdiction over the Federal budget process in \n                      the Committee on the Budget)\n\n       At the end of Section 101, insert the following:\n       ``(e) Jurisdiction of Budget Committee.--Notwithstanding \n     paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Committee on the Budget \n     shall have exclusive jurisdiction over measures affecting the \n     congressional budget process, including:\n       (1) the functions, duties, and powers of the Congressional \n     Budget Office;\n       (2) the functions, duties, and powers of the Congressional \n     Budget Office;\n       (3) the process by which Congress annually establishes the \n     appropriate levels of budget authority, outlays, revenues, \n     deficits or surpluses, and public debt--including \n     subdivisions thereof--and including the establishment of \n     mandatory ceilings on spending and appropriations, a floor on \n     revenues, timetables for congressional action on concurrent \n     resolutions, on the reporting of authorization bills, and on \n     the enactment of appropriation bills, and enforcement \n     mechanisms for budgetary limits and timetables;\n       (4) the limiting of backdoor spending devices;\n       (5) the timetables for Presidential submission of \n     appropriations and authorization requests;\n       (6) the definitions of what constitutes impoundment--such \n     as ``rescissions'' and ``deferrals'';\n       (7) the process and determination by which impoundments \n     must be reported to and considered by Congress;\n       (8) the mechanisms to insure Executive compliance with the \n     provisions of the Impoundment Control Act, title X--such as \n     GAO review and lawsuits; and\n       (9) the provisions which affect the content or \n     determination of amounts included in or excluded from the \n     congressional budget or the calculation of such amounts, \n     including the definition of terms provided by the Budget \n     Act.''\n\n                Amendment No. 4041 To Amendment No. 4027\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4041 to amendment \nNo. 4027.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Point of order, Mr. President. Parliamentary inquiry: As \nI understood it, the Senator from Arizona yielded for points of \ndiscussion. I ask the Chair if he would not rule. I ask if he asked \nconsent if he would be able to yield, for the point of discussion, to \nother Members here? As I understand it now, the Senator is offering an \namendment. That is not discussion. I make a point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yielded for a specified period of \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And not for discussion only?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Simply for a specified period of time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the request now that is before the Chair?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the right to \ncall up an amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the pending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has called up an amendment and has \nsent it to the desk, and a second-degree amendment as well, which is \nhis right.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe I was recognized.\n  For the information of my colleagues, to help clarify, I believe I \nunderstood the underlying Domenici amendment was set aside.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not believe the pending amendment was \nset aside. It required unanimous consent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. My understanding--I will ask the Chair, but it is my \nunderstanding the Domenici-Craig amendment was set aside. Under the \nunanimous consent agreement that was entered into yesterday, there were \nseveral amendments to be pending, that are in order. One of those \namendments is an amendment I had, dealing with the budget office. I am \njust trying to get in, too.\n  I have modified it at the request of the chairman of the Government \nOperations Committee. This is not a significant amendment, but it is an \nimportant one and I am trying to advance the movement of this bill, to \nhave a pending amendment. I have now modified it. I have a second-\ndegree amendment pending to it, that Senator Kent Conrad and myself are \ncosponsoring.\n  It now means that would be the pending amendment to the underlying \nbill when we go to the regular order on the bill. I would like for us \nto finish this bill.\n  I know some people wish to speak at length because they happen to be \nupset about the Homeland Security bill. I may support them in their \nefforts. That remains to be seen. But I do think it is important we \nfinish the bill that is pending, and there are four or five amendments \nthat are out there. Maybe two or three of those amendments will be \nagreed to and we can finish the Homeland Security bill in a very short \nperiod of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before I yield to the Senator from Kentucky--I mean \nMassachusetts----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the second-degree \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4041 to amendment No. 4027.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the reading, as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word, and insert the following:\n       ``Jurisdiction of Budget Committee.--Notwithstanding \n     paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and except as otherwise \n     provided in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the \n     Committee on the Budget shall have exclusive jurisdiction \n     over measures affecting the congressional budget process, \n     which are:\n\n[[Page S10782]]\n\n       (1) the functions, duties, and powers of the Budget \n     Committee;\n       (2) the functions, duties, and powers of the Congressional \n     Budget Office;\n       (3) the process by which Congress annually establishes the \n     appropriate levels of budget authority, outlays, revenues, \n     deficits or surpluses, and public debt--including \n     subdivisions thereof--and including the establishment of \n     mandatory ceilings on spending and appropriations, a floor on \n     revenues, timetables for congressional action on concurrent \n     resolutions, on the reporting of authorization bills, and on \n     the enactment of appropriation bills, and enforcement \n     mechanisms for budgetary limits and timetables;\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it does not take consent to stop reading. I \nseek recognition. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the attention----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Has the time of the Senator from Oklahoma expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Oklahoma has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Massachusetts was waiting to say a few \nwords. I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts for 5 minutes for the purpose of discussion, followed by \nthe Senator from Nevada for 2 minutes, with my right to regain the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent to speak before Senator Kennedy for \n1 or 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I direct this to my friend from Oklahoma. I \nhave the greatest respect for the Senator from Oklahoma. But it is not \nappropriate when neither manager is on the floor to send an amendment \nto the desk. It is not the way we do things around here. I ask \nunanimous consent that the action taken by my friend be vitiated. That \nis not fair. I say that with all due respect. We have been here for the \nlast 3 or 4 days.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Once, shame on you; twice, shame on me. The Senator from \nMassachusetts was recognized.\n  Mr. REID. My time is not up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the action \ntaken by the Senator from Oklahoma be vitiated, and that we go back to \nwhere we started before he offered his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my friends and colleagues from Iowa, \nFlorida, and Louisiana have outlined very briefly some of their \nconcerns about how they felt the minority had been treated in an \narbitrary way in the conference committee.\n  I want to remind the Senate that we had a 78-to-15 vote in the Senate \nto tie the tobacco buyout with the FDA regulations, and that particular \nproposal came back. We had not asked that the tobacco buyout be in the \ntax bill. But, nonetheless, the House decided to put it in the bill. \nThen when it came back here, the decision of that conference was made \nto take care of the tobacco companies and give short shrift to the \nchildren of this country.\n  I think it is going to be appropriate that many of us talk about that \nand make sure the American people understand that.\n  Finally, we have also had the issue on overtime. Three times we saw \nthe decision made in the Senate to repeal the administration's \novertime--twice in the House of Representatives. This was given 6 \nminutes in the conference committee.\n  I think the working families of this country have a right to \nunderstand and know what is in that FSC bill. I for one intend to use \nmy time to make sure that they do.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to say again I am not sure \nthat the situation on Monday, or Tuesday, or midnight tonight, or \nWednesday, or whatever, is going to be any different than it is now. I \nhave been assured by the leader that we could have any amendment within \nreason considered, debated, and voted on in a reasonable length of \ntime. I hope my colleagues will consider doing that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I am not mistaken, it is possible to amend the \nconference committee report which was sent to us for consideration on \nthe floor of the Senate. The Senator suggested amendments several \ntimes. I ask if he would please clarify that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think the Senator knows that conference reports are not \namendable. But I would also respond by saying as frustrated as many of \nus are with conference reports, especially appropriations conference \nreports coming out with little things in them that we never \nanticipated, if you want to delay it 1 day, or 2 days, or a week, the \nresult is basically going to be the same. I think we all know that.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield for a question by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  I am learning.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator has spent some time there, and we appreciate \nit.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Arizona if he would be willing \nto allow me to go forward with a unanimous consent request which the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and I have agreed to which \nwould extend the higher education bill and which would in addition \nallow us to save the taxpayers $100 million from money that is now \nbeing paid out to banks that are getting unconscionably high rates of \nreturn on student loans, and take that money and apply it so that \nteachers who go into underserved districts or in matters such as \nspecial education could receive a much higher forgiveness of their \nloans, raising their forgiveness from $5,000 to $17,000.\n  I was wondering if the Senator would allow me to offer a unanimous \nconsent request. I believe it has been signed off on by both sides.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to.\n  I wonder why the Senator missed this one. What happened? Are we \nasleep at the switch? Everything else is in here.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is a good point.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There is all kinds of fun in that. I don't know why you \nmissed that one. Of course, we have homeland appropriations coming \ndown. That is loaded with pork. The Senator from New Mexico just \nmentioned they changed the formula on milk to the tune of about $2.4 \nbillion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They haven't yet.\n  Mr. GREGG. This is within the jurisdiction of my committee, and the \nSenator from Massachusetts and I have worked on this. We think it is \nimportant for existing students who are paying this ridiculous interest \nrate--the Government is paying this ridiculous interest rate--and use \nthe money to help teachers who are going into underserved areas. Will \nthe Senator allow me to do that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am in strong support.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield for a question by the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator agree with me that even though I might \nstrongly support what the Senator from New Hampshire has stated, I \nwould like to defer action because my friend and colleague Senator \nHarkin is not here at the moment. He may or may not object. He objected \nto it earlier. I hope the Senator will address this later on in the \nafternoon or evening.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield the floor at \nthis time? At some time I would like to put the body on notice that we \nneed to handle it today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire and the Senator from\n\n[[Page S10783]]\n\nMassachusetts on this issue. I have been reading a lot about it. I \nthink it is disgraceful and outrageous, and I think every Member of \nthis body agrees with it. I hope we can get this done today because it \nis as egregious as the Senator from New Hampshire described.\n  I have little doubt about the outcome of this vote, but I will \ncontinue to remind my colleagues that the so-called reorganization \nresolution is a farce. The hypocrisy was bad enough when the resolution \nwas laid down Wednesday evening. Since that time, Members' parochial \ninterests have whittled away the little new oversight authority that \nwould be transferred to the renamed homeland security and governmental \naffairs committee. The result is nothing more than a name change for \nthe committee.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of Senator Voinovich, who made \nsome comments last night when he further exposed this sham for what it \nis. We should adopt this proposal to not rename the committee but keep \nit the Governmental Affairs Committee since we really are not making \nany substantive changes.\n  In today's Washington Post, there is an excellent column by David \nIgnatius. David Ignatius says in the article:\n\n       ``It's outrageous. The American people should be angry,'' \n     says former Senator Bob Kerrey, who was a Member of the Sept. \n     11 commission and for eight years served as a member of the \n     Senate intelligence committee. He argues that it would have \n     been better to drop the executive-branch changes if Congress \n     was not going to reform itself. ``These are secret \n     agencies,'' he explains. ``Unless you put in place strong \n     oversight, it isn't going to work.''\n\n  In fact, Senator Kerrey and others argue with the consolidation of \npower we are making it more dangerous because there is no oversight. We \nmay have not only remained in neutral here as far as increasing \ncongressional oversight, but since we are consolidating power, what \nthis proposal does is even more dangerous to America than the status \nquo.\n  The 9/11 Commission in its report described congressional oversight \nof intelligence as ``dysfunctional.'' They did not say it needed \nimprovement; they did not say the system could use a tweak here or \nthere; they said it was dysfunctional and that it needed comprehensive \nchange. So we in the Senate supposedly committed to doing just that. We \nformed a working group, held discussions--they were interesting \ndiscussions, by the way--committed to bringing a bill to the Senate, \nand now we are here.\n  What have we done? Have we embraced comprehensive change? No, we \nhaven't. We haven't even embraced a modicum of change. We have said \nthat the status quo is fine with us, and as far as the Senate is \nconcerned, September 11 never happened. It never happened, if you look \nat what is being done in the name of responding to September 11 and the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  Now, we are tinkering with the oversight responsibilities of the \nIntelligence Committee but certainly nothing substantive. When I go \nhome to Arizona and I say: My friends, we have really reformed \nintelligence; we have changed the Intelligence Committee from a B \ncommittee to an A committee. How do you like that? They are going to be \noverwhelmed when they hear that we have changed the Intelligence \nCommittee from a B committee to an A committee. I can see the \nScottsdale Rotary Club rising to their feet in applause for this \nincredible change we have made in the way we carry out our intelligence \noversight responsibility.\n  I apologize for engaging in a little bit too much hyperbole.\n  We took away from the new committee jurisdiction over immigration, \nthen the Secret Service. I have to relate to my colleagues a funny \nstory in case they missed it. I was on the Senate floor with the two \nsponsors of the amendment that would keep the Secret Service under the \nJudiciary Committee when they said: You know, the Secret Service really \nwants to be under the Judiciary Committee. I have encountered hundreds \nof Secret Service agents, and I have never had a single one come up to \nme and say: Senator, please put me under the oversight of the \nJudiciary Committee. Never. I guess I have not spoken to the right \nagents.\n\n  Anyway, all that is remains of the committee on homeland security is \nthe name. I wouldn't be surprised if someone objected to that on \njurisdictional grounds.\n  The new committee, as the Senator from Maine and the Senator from \nConnecticut will attest, the new committee will have responsibility \nover 34 percent of the budget and 3.9 percent of the employees. About \nall that it will be responsible for is FEMA and the Office of the \nSecretary. That is right, over 96 percent of the employees of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security will fall under the jurisdiction of \nother committees, not the committee on homeland security. So much for \nreal reform.\n  One of the recurrent themes has been the overload of the Department \nof Homeland Security because of the number of committees they have to \ntestify before during the course of a year. The number, as I remember, \nis 88 different committees and subcommittees, et cetera. I hope the \nSenator from Maine will assert exactly how many committees and \nsubcommittees under this revolutionary new reorganization the \nDepartment of Homeland Security will have to testify to.\n  Now, a word about the Department of Homeland Security, the White \nHouse, and the administration. While we were trying in our amendment to \nmove the TSA--a radical idea--to move the Transportation Security \nAdministration under the new Department of Homeland Security, which I \nthink garnered 22 of my colleagues' votes, along with myself, while we \ndid that, we got these calls: Way to go, we are with you, we are with \nyou. This is a great thing to do. You have to move the TSA into the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I said: Fine, will you issue a statement saying that? No, no, no, we \ncannot do that. We cannot issue a statement saying we support such an \namendment. We might make somebody mad.\n  We saw the result of that outrageous attempt to move the organization \ncalled the Transportation Security Administration under the \njurisdiction of the committee on homeland security. I will admit in \nretrospect I cannot imagine why anyone would assume that the \nTransportation Security Administration should fall under the committee \non homeland security.\n  Anyway, we aren't changing things here. We have decided the status \nquo is good enough, and we are sticking with it.\n  I again quote from David Ignatius' article in the Washington Post \nthis morning:\n\n       Senators were patting themselves on the back yesterday for \n     passing some of the intelligence reforms recommended by the \n     9/11 Commission.\n\n  I was one of those. I was praising the work that was done as far as \nexecutive reorganization. It was landmark legislation, the first major \nreorganization of Government since 1947. It was an incredible job.\n  But behind the scenes, the legislative process has been an egregious \nexample of congressional politics as usual.\n\n       Legislators have embraced the commission's call for a \n     national intelligence director and a national \n     counterterrorism center that would, in theory, coordinate \n     intelligence efforts in the executive branch. But they \n     have ignored or gutted the commission's proposal for \n     similar reforms in the way Congress oversees intelligence.\n       ``Of all our recommendations, strengthening congressional \n     oversight may be among the most difficult and important,'' \n     the commissioners stressed in their final report. They urged \n     that Congress give its intelligence committees control over \n     both authorizations and appropriations--so that the \n     committees would finally have the muscle to provide real \n     oversight.\n       Why did the Senate bill scuttle these internal reforms of \n     what the commission called ``a dysfunctional'' system? \n     Because they would threaten the turf of powerful legislators. \n     To be blunt, the Senators put their own perks and \n     prerogatives ahead of the Nation's security.\n\n  That is a pretty tough statement.\n\n       ``It is outrageous. The American people should be angry,'' \n     says former Senator Bob Kerrey.\n\n  By the way, Senator Bob Kerrey left part of his leg on the \nbattlefield at Vietnam and received the Congressional Medal of Honor \nand was also a member of the 9/11 Commission and for 8 years served as \na member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\n       He argues that it would have been better to drop the \n     executive-branch changes if Congress was not going to reform \n     itself. ``These are secret agencies,'' he explains. ``Unless\n\n[[Page S10784]]\n\n     you put in place strong oversight, it isn't going to work.''\n\n  Because the real power lies with the appropriations, the intelligence \nagencies know they can safely ignore pressure from the Intelligence \nCommittee. Indeed, major contractors that do business with the \nintelligence community, such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and TRW, are \nsaid to spend little time lobbying the intelligence panels because they \nknow the appropriators have the power of the purse. CIA Directors \nrecognize the same reality. They can ignore the intelligence committees \nas long as they keep stroking the appropriators.\n  We will have a status quo Intelligence Committee without combined \nauthorization and appropriations power, a committee that handles only a \ntiny fraction of homeland security issues, and we will be right back \nwhere we started. So let's be honest with ourselves and with the \nAmerican people. We aren't changing things here. We have decided that \nthe status quo is good enough, and we are sticking with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, no matter how many times you say something \nthat is not true, it does not make it true. I am not going to belabor \nthe point other than to say we have spent a lot of time doing what the \n9/11 Commission recommended. Did we do everything they asked? No, we \ndid not. Did we do 90 percent of what they asked? The answer is yes, as \nI explained on the floor on more than one occasion with the charts \nwhere we checked off what they asked for and we did. Again, I repeat, \nit does not matter how many times you say something that is not true, \nit does not make it true.\n  Now, people can minimize all they want. The committee on homeland \nsecurity will be created as soon as we complete this cloture fiasco we \nare now involved in. As I read on the floor here yesterday evening for \nhalf an hour, only getting into two directorates, the homeland security \ncommittee that will be formed could hold hearings every day next year \nand still not complete all the policy decisions that are made regarding \nterrorism in this country. Yes, they may not have all the employees, \nbut they have the policy that is important to make our country safer.\n  We start out with the basic Government Operations Committee, and we \ndo not change that one iota, and we add to that four directorates. For \nthree they have total 100 percent responsibility, and for the fourth \none they have partial responsibility.\n  I repeat for the third time today, no matter how many times you say \nsomething that is untrue, it does not make it true. You cannot have it \nboth ways. We have people telling us that we may establish nothing out \nof this committee, but yet we have people here grousing from 10 \ndifferent committees saying we gave them too much. You cannot have it \nboth ways.\n  Now, I know there is some disappointment on the part of the Senator \nfrom Maine, and I have heard very little from the Senator from \nConnecticut. I know he has been away for religious observances, but I \nhave kept in close contact with him. I think he realizes the glass is \nnot half empty, it is half full.\n  This committee is a good committee. It is going to be one of the most \nsignificant committees in this Congress. It is going to increase the \nbrawn and muscle of the Government Operations Committee tenfold. We \ntook jurisdiction from 10 standing committees and gave things to the \nnew committee.\n  Now, as an example, let's just take my committee. I have been \nchairman on two separate occasions of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. We have wide-ranging responsibilities in that committee. But \none thing we have that is most important is the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. I have spent a lot of time on that committee.\n  When I served in the House of Representatives, Congressman Al Gore \nwas chairman of a committee called Investigations and Oversight, and we \nspent weeks doing investigations regarding FEMA. I know a little bit \nabout it. It is a very powerful institution. The new government \noperations/expanded homeland security has complete jurisdiction over \nthat, except for flood control. Flood control has always been with the \nBanking Committee. It took all day yesterday to work something out so \nthat the new Government Operations Committee could still have that.\n\n  So, Mr. President, when we complete our work on this--and we are \ngoing to complete it pretty soon--people will be striving to get on the \ncommittee that will be chaired, at least for the next couple of months, \nby Chairman Collins; after that maybe Senator Lieberman.\n  But the point I want to make is I know people have been putting in \nthe mind of the distinguished Senator from Maine that she got nothing. \nIsn't it terrible what they did to you? The fact of the matter is, I \nread only partially here on the Senate floor last night the \nresponsibilities of this new committee. The responsibilities are \nterribly significant.\n  We still have work to do on this resolution. I am disappointed that \nit has not been completed. I want the record to be spread with the fact \nthat Senator McConnell and I did not do a perfect job, but we did the \nbest job we could do, and we have worked for weeks trying to do \nsomething that was very hard to do; that is, change what this body \ndoes.\n  Everyone hates change, as when I started my remarks, whether it is a \nchange in your family relationship, as I explained when my daughter \nleft to go to college, or whether it is a committee you feel strongly \nabout.\n  I talked to a Member of the Senate today, and he said: Today was a \nbig change in my life. I said: What? And he said--I am not going to \nembarrass him and use his name; this happened at lunchtime--he said: I \nhave been using the House gymnasium for 22 years. He said: I switched; \ntoday I started using the Senate gym. He said: You have no idea how \nhard that was for me to do because even though I am a Senator now, I \nhave used that gym for 22 years.\n  People hate change. They fight change. And I have to say, I have \nnever changed; I still use the House gym.\n  So I am sorry, because I have talked to her personally, and I am \nsorry the Senator from Maine is disappointed in the jurisdiction she \nhas. I am sorry we could not give her more jurisdiction. But, believe \nme, she will do a good job, because there is so much to do. I have \nworked here with a lot of different Senators in the years I have been \nin the Senate, and I have found very few people as competent and as \nresourceful and who work as hard as the Senator from Maine. I know when \nshe gets this committee, even though she feels slighted that she did \nnot get more, she will have her hands full doing what she will be doing \nvery competently.\n  So the main point I want to make here, for the fourth time--and I am \nnot going to apologize to anyone for the work I did on this. Not to \nanyone. I worked hard. It was hard to get where we are. And I repeat, \nif people think we did nothing, why have I been berated the last few \ndays about: How could you do this? How could you take this from me? And \nI used, every time, the example of FEMA. FEMA is no insignificant \nmatter. We took significant matters from 10 standing committees and \nhave given them to the new government operations, expanded homeland \nsecurity committee.\n  I am going to continue to support the legislation. I have kept the 9/\n11 Commission advised. This is not an end run we have done on the 9/11 \nCommission. Oh, isn't it surprising? Why didn't Reid keep us informed? \nReid kept them informed.\n  Now, I wrote a book, published a history book, and people criticized \nmy book. They can if they want. I defend what is in my book, and they \ndefend what is in their report. The 9/11 Commission--I have said on \nthis floor, not on one occasion, not on two occasions, I cannot count \nhow many occasions I have complimented my friend, Congressman Lee \nHamilton, and Governor Kean. I know Lee Hamilton very well. I have \nknown him for 22 years. I do not know Governor Kean very well, but I \nsurely like him. I know how competent he is. I know Roemer, who served \nthere; Slade Gorton, an outstanding Senator whom I served with; Bob \nKerrey, one of my good friends, whom I think the world of. They did a \nwonderful job.\n\n  We have given the 9/11 Commission and the people of America, as I \nsaid, most everything the 9/11 Commission\n\n[[Page S10785]]\n\nrecommended. The 9/11 Commission, by the way, did not tell us how to \nreorganize the Senate. What we are doing here does not take the \nPresident to sign off on. We do this on our own. This is what we are \ndoing. This is one of the most significant changes in the history of \nthis Congress.\n  Now, people say: Well, big deal; it is not a very big change. I think \nit is a significant change. Remember, we got rid of a subcommittee on \nAppropriations. We created a new subcommittee. We gave a lot of muscle \nto the new Intelligence Committee.\n  I checked off here yesterday all the things we gave to the new \nIntelligence Committee. We got rid of term limits, which they \ncomplained about for so long, increased staffing and made it \nbipartisan, so now it is not divided 3 to the minority and 23--I don't \nknow the exact number, but about that--33 to the majority. It is now \ndivided 60/40. That is the way it should be.\n\n       Congress should create a single, principal point of \n     oversight and review for homeland security. Congressional \n     leaders are best able to judge what committee should have \n     jurisdiction over this department and its duties.\n\n  This is not something I dreamed up. This comes directly from the 9/11 \nCommission. Page 421 of the 9/11 Commission, what did they say? They \nsaid:\n\n       Congressional leaders are best able to judge what committee \n     should have jurisdiction over this department and its duties.\n\n  We did that. Now, is it in keeping with what my friend for 22 years, \nSenator McCain, thinks we should do? No. He thinks we should do things \ndifferently. But we made decisions he does not agree with. That does \nnot mean we are all right, but that does not mean he is all right \neither. I mean, he is all right--not right on this issue. So we did as \nthe 9/11 Commission said we should do.\n  Again, it is not as if we were doing something that was significantly \nmore important anyway. But I read yesterday all the many \nresponsibilities that this committee has. I want to find this again. I \nam turning to my loyal staff here. This is directorate No. 1. The \nresponsibilities are very significant. And for someone to say this is \nnot important, I defy reason to say this is not important.\n  This committee has jurisdiction over this: To access, receive, and \nanalyze law enforcement information, intelligence information, and \nother information from agencies of the Federal Government--and it \nalways says ``State and local''--to integrate such information in order \nto, A, identify and assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats to \nthe homeland; B, detect and identify threats of terrorism against the \nUnited States; and, C, understand such threats in light of actual and \npotential vulnerabilities of the homeland.\n  No. 2, to carry out comprehensive assessments of the vulnerabilities \nof key resources and critical infrastructure of the United States, \nincluding the performance of risk assessments to determine the risks \nposed by particular types of terrorist attacks within the United \nStates, including assessment of the probability of success of such \nattacks and the feasibility and potential efficacy of various \ncountermeasures to such attacks.\n  I say through the Chair to my friend from Maine, if you spent 6 \nmonths of the next congressional session having congressional hearings \non this, you would have your plate completely full just on this. But we \ndidn't stop there. I have gone through two of the obligations, \nresponsibilities they have. But there are 17 more, such as: To \nintegrate relevant information--I am skipping a little bit--analyses, \nand vulnerability assessments in order to identify priorities for \nprotective and support measures by the Department, other agencies of \nthe Federal Government, State and local government agencies; to ensure \nthe timely and efficient access by the Department to all information \nnecessary to discharge the responsibilities.\n  No. 5, to develop a comprehensive national plan for securing the key \nresources and critical infrastructure of the United States, including \npower production, generation, and distribution systems, information \ntechnology, telecommunications systems, including satellites, \nelectronic, financial, property record storage, transmission systems, \nemergency preparedness communications systems, and the physical and \ntechnological aspects that support such systems.\n  I say, these responsibilities may not be very glamorous. You may not \nbe calling people in that are part of the 41,000 Transportation \nSecurity Administration, but it sure is important to my family and the \npeople of the State of Nevada that we do some good work to find out \nabout a national plan for securing our electricity, our satellites, our \nelectronic and financial records storage and transmission systems. That \nrequires some congressional hearings.\n  If somebody is chairman of that committee and ranking member or a \nmember of the committee, I think that is something they should focus \non, at least for a little while.\n  No. 6, to recommend measures necessary to protect key resources and \ncritical infrastructure of the United States, in coordination with \nother agencies of the Federal Government.\n  No. 7, to administer the homeland security advisory system, including \nexercising primary responsibility for public advisories related to \nthreats to homeland security; to review, analyze, and make \nrecommendations for improvements in the policies and procedures \ngoverning the sharing of law enforcement information, intelligence \ninformation, intelligence-related information, other information \nrelated to homeland security.\n\n  No. 9, to disseminate information analyzed by the Department to \nHomeland Security, agencies of State and local governments, and private \nsector entities with such responsibilities to assist in the deterrence, \nprevention, preemption of, or response to terrorist acts against the \nUnited States.\n  I think that is a pretty heavy responsibility. To say this is \nnothing, you haven't given us anything.\n  No. 10, to consult with the Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency--right now we still have a CIA Director--and other appropriate \nintelligence, law enforcement, or other elements of the Federal \nGovernment to establish collection priorities and strategies for \ninformation relating to threats of terrorism against the United States; \nto consult with State and local governments and private sector entities \nto ensure appropriate exchanges of information, including law-\nenforcement-related information; to ensure that any material received \npursuant to this act is protected from unauthorized disclosure; to \nensure that any intelligence information is shared, retained, and \ndisseminated consistent with the authority of the Director of the CIA.\n  So for someone to say: What is this? You wasted all of our time here. \nWe should not have done anything. It is an insult. I told people this \nis, if not the hardest thing I have ever done, one of the hardest in \nall the time I have been in Congress. For someone to stand and say, You \ndidn't do anything, what I would suggest to the Senator from Maine, if \nshe doesn't like this committee, turn it over to somebody else. I will \nbet a lot of people would like it. The ranking member right under her, \nI bet they would love to have this committee.\n  To request additional information from other agencies of the Federal \nGovernment, State and local government agencies, and the private sector \nrelating to threats of terrorism against the United States; to \nestablish and utilize, in conjunction with the chief information \nofficer of the Department, a secure communication and information \ntechnology infrastructure, including data mining, and other advanced \nanalytical tools, in order to access, receive, and analyze data and \ninformation.\n  Again, there are not a lot of employees involved in this, but if we \ndepended on that--I don't know the number of employees we have in the \nFederal Government; it is over 2 million, millions anyway--how many \nemployees were involved, you would just ignore the FBI. There are only \n11,000, only 11,000 out of approximately 2 million. I don't know that \nexact number, a very tiny percentage of what the FBI makes up of the \noverall workforce, but it is still real important.\n  What I am talking about is, that is going to be the responsibility of \nthis committee, and it is also important.\n  I am still only through No. 13. We have six more to go in the first \ndirectorate. I have three more directorates to go through to show what \nthis new committee that a small minority here think doesn't amount to \nmuch, I am\n\n[[Page S10786]]\n\nsaying it amounts to plenty. If this committee does its job--and I say \nwithout any hesitation that I know that Senator Lieberman and the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine will do a good job--they will have a \nlot to do. They make sure to listen in one ear about all they don't \nhave to do, but let's also listen with the other ear about all they \nhave to do. Some people like to denigrate anything we try to do about \nthis institution. Some like to tear it down.\n\n  No. 15, to ensure, in conjunction with the chief information officer \nof the Department, that any information databases and analytical tools \ndeveloped or utilized by the Department are compatible with one another \nand with relevant information databases of other agencies of the \nFederal Government; B, treat the information in such databases in a \nmanner that complies with applicable Federal laws on privacy.\n  That is one of the biggest issues. I did a poll in Nevada a few years \nago, and my staff, when they came to me, was stunned. In Nevada, the \nmost important issue was not health care, it was not education, not the \nenvironment, not jobs--it was privacy. People in America are extremely \nconcerned about privacy. We have all these electronic tools to do all \nkinds of things. And we want to make sure people's privacy is \nprotected. One of the obligations of this committee is to see what can \nbe done, with all the electronic apparatus we have for collecting \nintelligence and protecting the homeland, that it doesn't interfere \nwith my family's privacy. That is a responsibility this committee will \nhave when we complete it.\n  No. 16, to coordinate training and other support to the elements and \npersonnel of the Department.\n  No. 17, to coordinate elements in the intelligence community with \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and the private \nsector, as appropriate; to provide intelligence and information \nanalysis, and support to other elements of the Department.\n  And who does this cover? Who does this committee look to, to gather \ninformation? One of their defined legislative responsibilities--it is \nin this Record right now, we are making legislative history with the \njurisdiction of this committee, but this is also in the underlying \namendment that is now before this body, covered agencies: The \nDepartment of State, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, the National Security Agency, the National \nImagery and Mapping Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and any \nother agency of the Federal Government that the President considers \nappropriate.\n\n  This is the legislative history that we are making to establish what \nthis committee has to do. For someone to say their dealing with the \nCIA, FBI, NSA, and the DIA is not important, well, that is too bad \nbecause it is important.\n  We also have another directorate, and I will only cover a couple \nbecause there are four. The fourth one doesn't have total coverage over \nthat. That is the one where immigration--they only have part of that--\nrelating to security.\n  The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over immigration as it \nrelates to policy matters, as I understand it. They have security \nmatters. I may not have defined it as policy, but they don't have 100 \npercent of the other directorate.\n  One of the directorates they have is emergency preparedness and \nresponse. I already talked about FEMA being part of their \nresponsibility--and a big responsibility FEMA is, Mr. President. It is \none of the most important agencies we have in the Federal Government \ntoday. As we speak, they are doing gallant work in Florida, Alabama, \nand Georgia as a result of the hurricanes. We lend that agency to \nforeign countries because they are the best in the world when there is \nan emergency. I have learned over the years that the most important \nthing they work on is water-related emergencies across the country, \nwith flooding and those kinds of things. Floods are caused by lots of \ndifferent things. So what does the FEMA have to do? They do this:\n  All functions and authorities prescribed by the Robert T. Stafford \nDisaster Relief and Emergency Assistant Act, which is carrying out its \nmission to reduce the loss of life and property and protect the Nation \nfrom all hazards by leading and supporting the Nation in a \ncomprehensive, risk-based emergency management program--A, of \nmitigation, by taking sustained actions to reduce or eliminate long-\nterm risk to people and property from hazards and their effects; B, of \nplanning for building the emergency management profession to prepare \neffectively for, mitigate against, respond to, and recover from any \nhazard; of response, by conducting emergency operations to save lives \nand property through positioning emergency equipment and supplies, \nthrough evacuating potential victims, through providing food, water, \nshelter, and medical care to those in need, and through restoring \ncritical public services; of recovery, by rebuilding communities so \nindividuals, businesses, and governments can function on their own, \nreturn to normal life, and protect against future hazards.\n  Mr. President, I first became aware of the work that FEMA does when \nwe had a disastrous flood in northern Nevada. We don't get much rain in \nNevada, but we had a lot of snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We had \nearly rain. That water came down without warning. And as I traveled to \nGardnerville and Minden in Douglas County, one of my friends there, a \nfarmer who had lived there for a long time, said: Look out here. A \nlittle river that a child could walk across most of the time was like a \nraging river. Cottonwood trees that were 100 years old were being \nthrown down the river path like toothpicks. By the time I got to \nnorthern Nevada, coming in a different airport because the regular \nairport was closed, FEMA had already set up operations and started \nlife-sustaining operations, feeding people. They had already set up \nlocations for businesses that had been devastated to come and make \ntheir claims.\n\n  If we did nothing else other than transfer FEMA from the Environment \nand Public Works to the new homeland security committee, that is a \ntremendous new responsibility for that committee--in addition to the \npage after page of other stuff I read that is their responsibility.\n  For the fifth time, people can come on this floor and keep saying \nwhat we have done is inconsequential and doesn't mean anything, but \nsaying that doesn't mean it is true. I want everybody within the sound \nof my voice to understand some of the things we have transferred to \nthis committee. Remember, this was already an A committee. It had lots \nof work to do. That is why some people around here are saying, What are \npeople complaining about? It is already an A committee. They are \ngetting a lot of stuff to do, other responsibilities from 10 different \ncommittees. What more do they want?\n  Well, I guess they want more. I say the glass should be half full, \nnot half empty. It may not be perfect, but it is certainly pretty good.\n  We have to complete this legislation. There are six amendments, a \ncouple maybe we can work out. Some of them probably we will not be able \nto work out, and a couple will be withdrawn. We are close to being able \nto finish. As I understand the parliamentary aspect, first of all, \nsometime tomorrow, if all time is used, we will vote on the amendment \nnow before the body. After having completed these amendments, then we \nwill vote on the underlying resolution--invoke cloture on that and, of \ncourse, there are 30 hours to run on that. When that is completed, this \nwill be done.\n  The Senate, without having to go to the House of Representatives or \nthe President, will have made one of the largest changes in the history \nof this body by reorganizing the legislative branch of Government. So, \nagain, we transferred matters from Agriculture, Armed Services, \nCommerce, Energy and Natural Resources, Environment and Public Works, \nFinance, Foreign Relations, and Judiciary, so I think we have done a \ngood job.\n  I am disappointed that my friend from Maine is apparently \ndisappointed in thinking she is not going to have enough to do. I want \nher to know that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and I did the \nbest we could. Remember, this is not a dictatorship we have here, it is \na legislative body. We cannot just suddenly decide what we want and it \nhappens. It is a process that I talked about last night.\n\n[[Page S10787]]\n\n  Legislation is the art of compromise. That is why you don't see much \nreorganization in the legislative branch of Government, because it is \nhard to do. As the President said in the last debate: This is hard \nwork. It is hard work what we have done.\n  Again, I am disappointed that she is disappointed because I have the \nhighest respect for her. I want her to know that I have only touched, \nthis afternoon, on a very few things that she has to do. There are so \nmany other things that this committee has. As I said, in years to come, \nwhat we have done this afternoon and what we will do on this \nlegislation will be laid out before the Senate, so it will be easy for \nreferrals and other things this committee will do.\n  This is one of the directorates, emergency preparedness and response:\n  The Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary for Emergency \nPreparedness and Response shall include: Helping to ensure the \neffectiveness of emergency response providers to terrorist attacks, \nmajor disasters, and other emergencies; coordinating other Federal \nresponse resources in the event of a terrorist attack or major \ndisaster; aiding the recovery from terrorist attacks and major \ndisasters; building a comprehensive national incident management system \nwith Federal, State, and local government personnel, agencies, and \nauthorities, to respond to such attacks and disasters; consolidating \nexisting Federal Government emergency response plans into a single, \ncoordinated national response plan; and finally, developing \ncomprehensive programs for developing interoperative communications \ntechnology and helping to ensure that emergency response providers \nacquire such technology. So please do not tell me this committee does \nnot have a lot to do. This committee will be one of the most important \ncommittees there is.\n\n  I say, in closing, to my friend from Maine, when I first came to the \nSenate, I received a phone call from Howard Metzenbaum. Howard \nMetzenbaum said: We finished--I think it is called the Steering \nCommittee--and you are going to the Appropriations Committee. I was so \nexcited about that. He said: You have a choice of two other committees \nyou can go on--either Environment and Public Works or Government \nOperations.\n  I said: Senator Metzenbaum, I am so thrilled about being able to be \non Appropriations. You decide which one I should go on.\n  He said: It does not matter. They are both great committees.\n  He chose for me Environment and Public Works. One reason he chose \nthat is because in those days--I don't know if it is still the same \nway--a member of the Government Operations Committee, even though you \nwere a new member, you were entitled to a staff person, someone \nassigned to you. They figured they would give that plum to someone \nelse.\n  My point being, the Government Operations Committee has always been a \ngood committee, but it is going to be a really good committee now. I \nthink it will be on the par of Armed Services. I think it will be on \nthe par with any committee we have. I will sleep well knowing that my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and \nmy friend, the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, will be \nthe two leading that committee. I know they have the ability to do a \ngood job in meeting all the responsibilities this new committee has, \nincluding all the responsibilities they had to start with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as I was listening to the Senator from \nNevada, it brought back memories of the night when he started reading \nfrom a book he wrote. I think it was about, if I remember correctly, \nSearchlight, NV. I was listening that evening to him, and much to my \nsurprise, I actually got caught up in the story of Searchlight, NV. It \nwas delightfully told, and although the Senator was clearly killing \ntime that evening, I learned a lot about his upbringing and his talent \nin telling a story.\n  This afternoon, I feel we have once again seen his talent in telling \na story. I think it is unfortunate that the Senator from Nevada is \npersonalizing this debate. This debate has nothing to do with the \nSenator from Maine. The authority over homeland security could have \nbeen given to a brandnew committee or some other committee.\n  What is important to me is that we try to address the recommendation \nmade by the 9/11 Commission. I want to read that recommendation because \nit is very clear, it is very straightforward. It says:\n\n       Congress should create a single, principal point of \n     oversight and review for homeland security.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Congress does have the obligation to choose one in the \n     House and one in the Senate. . . .\n\n  It certainly says the congressional leaders are best able to judge \nwhich committee should have jurisdiction over this Department and its \nduties, but it makes very clear that it should be a single committee, \nand we have not come close to doing this.\n  I admire the Senator from Nevada. He was extremely helpful to me when \nI was managing the intelligence reform bill over 10 days' time. I \nlooked to him often for advice. I admire his experience and his \nknowledge, but the recommendation is very clear. It says ``a single, \nprincipal point of oversight.'' It says ``choose one.'' It does not say \nwhich one. It did not have to be Governmental Affairs. It could have \nbeen a new committee. It could have been some other committee. But it \nsays ``choose one,'' and we did not choose one. This plan does not even \ncome close to choosing one.\n  We know that between the House and the Senate, the Department has to \nreport to some 88 committees and subcommittees. Here in the Senate, I \nthink it is around 26 committees and subcommittees. We reduced those by \nmaybe one or two. We still have the Judiciary Committee with \nsignificant jurisdiction. We still have the Commerce Committee with \njurisdiction over the two largest agencies within the Department of \nHomeland Security--the Transportation Security Agency and the Coast \nGuard. You can make a case that the Coast Guard has a lot of \nnonhomeland security functions, but certainly the homeland security \nfunctions of the Coast Guard should have been transferred to the new \ncommittee. And certainly the TSA, the largest agency within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security with 51,000 employees, should have been \ntransferred.\n  Under the proposal of the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from \nKentucky, certain responsibilities were transferred from the Judiciary \nCommittee, but those have been reversed in the course of this debate. \nIn fact, the first amendment on the floor had to do with a \nCustoms responsibility that had been transferred, and before either the \nSenator from Maine or the Senator from Connecticut were even given the \ncourtesy of a phone call about that amendment, it was adopted by the \nmanagers of the bill. They immediately transferred away from the new \ncommittee some jurisdiction. Then they went on to suggest the adoption \nof other amendments as well.\n\n  My point is this: This jurisdiction does not have to come to \nGovernmental Affairs, but what it should go to is a single committee. \nWe should not pretend we are fulfilling the recommendation of the 9/11 \nCommission--the very specific recommendation of the 9/11 Commission--\nthat Congress should vest this responsibility in a single committee \nbecause we have not come close to that.\n  That is the issue. The issue is not whether Governmental Affairs is \nthe right committee. The issue is not whether Governmental Affairs has \nother jurisdiction. The issue is, are we going to try to follow the \nrecommendation--the very strong recommendation--of the 9/11 Commission \nto consolidate oversight of the Department within one congressional \ncommittee. Are we going to follow the advice--no, the plea--of \nSecretary Tom Ridge that we consolidate jurisdiction so he and his top \nofficials do not have to be constantly racing up to the Hill to testify \nrather than concentrating on the security of our country, because that \nis what this is about.\n  This is not about turf battles--this should not be about turf \nbattles. This should not be about power plays. This should not be about \npower grabs. It is about how we can best improve congressional \noversight over a department that is critical to the security of this\n\n[[Page S10788]]\n\ncountry, and that is the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Senator from Nevada referred to the Senator from Connecticut. \nPerhaps he missed some of the debate yesterday. He is extremely \nattentive to the floor, but at times did step out. The Senator from \nConnecticut could not have made clearer yesterday his disappointment \nwith this resolution, and he argued against the amendments that even \nthe modest transfers provided in the Reid-McConnell resolution.\n  The staff of the Senator from Connecticut has told me they are \ncertain the Senator from Connecticut would want me, since he is not \nable to be here today, to make very clear to his colleagues in the \nSenate that he shares, indeed he mirrors, my concerns.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has worked very hard to make sure the \nmajor recommendations of the 9/11 Commission are implemented, and that \nis not what we are doing here.\n  At best, we are taking a very modest step forward, but let's not \npretend that we are in any way implementing the recommendations for a \nsingle congressional committee in the Senate to have jurisdiction over \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business \nfor a period of 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. No objection, as long as the time continues to be counted \nagainst the 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2823\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 711, S. 2823.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  (Several Senators addressed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, you can see by my unanimous consent request \nthe alarm I brought to the Senate floor just now. The reason that \nhappened is because I was attempting to bring to the floor a very \ncritical issue that this Congress and this Senate have refused to \naddress this year. It is a bill called AgJOBS. It is a bill that has \nmore than 60 Members of this body as cosponsors, and yet it is a bill \nthat nobody wants to talk about right now and nobody wants to deal with \nin the final hours of this 108th Congress.\n  The reason I brought it up now, and I worked it through the Rule XIV \nprocess over the last several weeks, is because when we talk about \nhomeland security, we are talking about border security, we are talking \nimmigration reform, we are talking about identifying 8 to 12 million \nundocumented foreign nationals in this country.\n  We have seen this Congress, this Senate, toil mightily over the last \n2 weeks to try to address the 9/11 Commission's study and to reshape \nour intelligence community, to enhance our national security and \nhomeland security. But this Congress has left one part of that effort \nunfinished.\n  This year, we have refused to address one of the greatest problems in \nour country, and that is an immigration policy that has resulted in 8 \nto 12 million undocumented workers.\n  For the last 5 years, I and others have tried to deal with one small \naspect of this issue, those foreign nationals who come to our country \nin agriculture. There are about 1.6 million individuals in our \nagricultural work force, and most of them are undocumented. Yet they \ncome here to work and harvest our fields and to process our foods, to \nallow this great agriculture of ours to be the most abundant in the \nworld, and yet we will not give them a reasonable and legal status so \nthey can continue to work, continue to return home across our borders \nwith a degree of fluidity, without fear to go to their families. The \ncurrent system has effectively locked them inside this country, in the \nshadows.\n  We have created for ourselves a monstrous problem, and the American \npublic knows it. It is all about homeland security, and it is all about \nborder security, and yet, oh, my goodness, we just could not get to it \nthis year.\n  I have worked for several years to produce the AgJOBS legislation. It \nis bipartisan. Senator Ted Kennedy is my primary cosponsor, and we have \nworked very hard to keep it bipartisan. The numbers on the same bill \nhave grown rapidly in the House, because this is an issue whose time \nhas come and yet somehow we just do not have time to get to it.\n  So I thought it was important one more time, in the waning hours of \nthe 108th Congress, to try to bring it to the floor and at least talk a \nlittle bit about it. When I risked bringing it to the floor, my \ngoodness, papers flew and chairs tipped over as people rushed to the \nmicrophones to object. Is it a matter of timing? Is it a matter of \nopposition to reform? Oh, no, it is a matter of, gee, we just do not \nwant to talk about this issue this year.\n  Let me serve notice to the Senate right now--I do not oftentimes do \nthis--but when there are more than 60 Members of this body who are \nready to debate an issue and vote on it, We will get a vote. With a \nbipartisan coalition nationwide of more than 400 groups that have come \ntogether, from the American Farm Bureau to the United Farm Workers, \nsaying, for goodness' sake, Government, get your act together, solve \nthis problem, create a program that moves us forward, that gives a \nlegal status for people to work in this country who do the kind of work \nthat many Americans would choose not to do, we will get a vote. That is \nwhat the AgJOBS is about. It means the reduction of illegal immigration \nby a reasonable program that allows that kind of safe, productive, \neconomically beneficial movement in our country.\n\n  Of the nearly 12 million undocumented population, the vast majority \ndo not create or even pose any threat. They are here, they are hard \nworking, they work 12 and 14 hours a day, and they save their money, \nbecause they want to feed their families, they want a better life for \ntheir children, they want the same opportunity that has always beckoned \nhard working people to America. Some of them would like to be U.S. \ncitizens; many would not. Many want to go home to their families across \nthe border or overseas at the end of the work season. They are here to \nbetter themselves and to better their families, something all Americans \ncan understand.\n  By their presence, they better us. They make our lives better, and in \nthis issue with American agriculture, there is no question, they help \nto produce the abundance on the supermarket shelves and the family \ntables of America.\n  When I said ``serve notice,'' here is what I am serving: I will not \ngive up on getting a vote on this bill and passing it. The bill is \nready to move now. Its time has come. I have been trying to move it \nthis year. If we don't move it this year, when we get back this next \nCongress, this bill will move. We will vote on this issue. If not the \nold Congress, then the new Congress will face this issue. They will \nface it in a variety of ways.\n  Some will say, let us do a large, all-inclusive immigration bill. \nFine, while the committees are spending the 10 or 12 months or 2 years \nto try to figure that one out, we are going to vote on this one because \nit is a small piece of a very large puzzle, but it is the right piece. \nIt will show we can cooperatively do what we ought to do in a fair and \nresponsible way to create an earned status so these folks can work here \nin a legal way and can move freely back and forth across the borders, \ndominantly between the United States and Mexico, but clearly with other \ncountries of the world, too. We want to eliminate these human hazards \nof the kind that have been created along the Mexican-American border, \nwhere last year more than 300 people died, many of them in the deserts, \nin the hot sun, or being smuggled in the back of trucks, trying to get \nhere to work, because we have a program that does not function.\n  That is why I came to the floor, and I am sorry if I caused undue \nalarm on the part of some of my colleagues. I was quite confident that \nat some point someone would object because some would argue this \nissue's time has not yet come. It will come. It may be January, \nFebruary, or March of 2005, but it will be on this floor for a full, \nconstructive, and positive debate and a vote up\n\n[[Page S10789]]\n\nor down, possibly with the opportunity for some amendments, because \nthis is legislation that now demands our consideration.\n  Americans want our borders controlled. They want undocumented foreign \nnationals identified in our country. This is a small step in the right \ndirection of that effort to accomplish that goal.\n  Amnesty is not the solution. It has been tried before and it has \nfailed.\n  The current system has not worked either, and opposition to amnesty \nshould not be an excuse for tolerating a dysfunctional status quo.\n  AgJOBS avoids the problems and limitations of past initiatives and \nother proposals. AgJOBS is the only proposal that addresses the problem \nfor both the short term and the long term.\n  In the long term, when willing American workers can not be found to \nwork in our fields, that shortage would be addressed through a reformed \nH-2A program. The current program is so burdensome and costly that it \nnow supplies only about 2 percent of our farm workers. It will take \ntime to implement reforms that allow H-2A to meet our needs with legal \nguest workers.\n  In the short run, while H-2A reforms are being implemented, the \nearned adjustment program in AgJOBS would stabilize our current \nagricultural work force. Trusted, proven workers who have already been \nworking here in 2003 and 2002 and before would be allowed to stay and \ncontinue to work.\n  A reformed H-2A program, made workable with the red tape cut out, \nwould meet future work force needs and mean the earned adjustment \nprogram would not have to be repeated.\n  A realistic, workable guest worker program actually would reduce \nillegal immigration.\n  The last time the United States had a substantial agricultural guest \nworker program, apprehensions of undocumented workers actually \nplummeted, from almost 900,000 in 1953 to a low of 45,336 in 1959.\n  Whatever other aspects of this so-called ``bracero'' program were \nsubject to criticism, history proved that its 500,000 farm workers \nentered our country legally, worked in jobs citizens did not want, \nobeyed our laws, returned home at the end of the work season, and \ndramatically reduced the demand for, and supply of, undocumented labor.\n  Increased enforcement of our laws is part of the solution, and we've \nmade progress.\n  In the last decade, we have tripled the number of agents enforcing \nborder and immigration laws.\n  Worker identification checks have intensified.\n  Apprehensions have skyrocketed above 900,000 a year and formal \nremovals have increased sixfold.\n  High-tech initiatives are coming online.\n  We are poised to take up the FY 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations \nbill, which again increases resources in this area.\n  However, more enforcement is only part of the answer.\n  This is demonstrated by the fact that, despite more enforcement, over \nthe last decade, the undocumented population has more than doubled.\n  The self-described ``experts'' who say, ``Just round them up and \ndeport them,'' are only proposing an excuse, not a solution, while the \nsituation just gets worse. That is the cruelest amnesty of all.\n  Instead, we must manage our borders and our immigration system \nbetter.\n  AgJOBS is a critical part of doing just that--managing our borders \nbetter and improving our homeland security by bringing hundreds of \nthousands of individuals up out of the shadows and into a legal system.\n  We can never neglect the humanitarian side of this, as well, that we \nshould treat with dignity and humaneness those who labor to put the \nfood on our families' tables.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is a privilege to join Senator Craig today in urging \nthe Senate to pass this important jobs bill for immigrants in \nagriculture. We have been struggling for decades to find a solution to \nthe heart-wrenching problems facing so many farm workers for so long.\n  The Agricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act--\nAgJOBS--is an opportunity to correct these long-festering problems. In \na landmark agreement, both the United Farm Workers and the agricultural \nindustry support this solution. It gives farm workers and their \nfamilies the dignity and opportunity they deserve, and it gives farm \nowners a legal workforce.\n  The bill is a compromise, and it has 63 Senate sponsors, with almost \nequal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. More than 400 organizations \nacross the country support it. They include advocates for farm workers, \nsuch as the United Farm Workers, the Farm Labor Organizing Community, \nand the Farm Worker Justice Fund. They include business groups such as \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Council of Agricultural \nEmployers, the American Nursery and Landscape Association, and the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation. They include civil rights groups such \nas the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Latino organizations such \nas the National Council of LaRaza, the Mexican American Legal Defense \nand Educational Fund, and the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n  It is a bill whose time has come. In fact, we should have passed it \nlong before now, because the need is so great, and the current \nsituation is so untenable. For economic, security, and humanitarian \nreasons, Congress ought to complete action on this legislation before \nwe adjourn for the year.\n  The AgJOBS bill is good for both business and labor. The Nation can \nno longer ignore the fact that more than half of our agricultural \nworkers are undocumented immigrants. Growers need a reliable and legal \nworkforce. Workers need legal status to improve their wages and working \nconditions. Everyone is harmed when crops rot in the field because of \nthe lack of an adequate labor force.\n  The AgJOBS bill provides a fair and reasonable process for these \nagricultural workers to earn legal status. It reforms the current visa \nprogram, so that employers unable to obtain American workers can hire \nthe foreign workers they need.\n  Undocumented farm workers are easily and unfairly exploited by \nunscrupulous contractors and growers. Their illegal status deprives \nthem of bargaining power and depresses the wages of all farm workers. \nOur bill provides fair solutions for undocumented workers who have been \ntoiling in our fields, harvesting our fruits and vegetables.\n  The bill is not an amnesty. To earn the right to remain in this \ncountry, workers have to demonstrate past work contributions to the \nU.S. economy, and also make a substantial future work commitment. These \nmen and women will finally be able to come out of the shadows, identify \nthemselves, and provide evidence that they have worked in agriculture, \nso that they can continue to work hard and play by the rules.\n  Hard-working migrant farm workers are essential to American \nagriculture. We need an honest agriculture policy that recognizes the \ncontributions of these workers and respects and rewards their work.\n  The legislation will also modify the current temporary foreign \nagricultural worker program, and it does so in a way that preserves and \nenhances key labor protections. It strikes a fair balance. It also \nbenefits employers, by streamlining the visa application process and \nreducing paperwork for employers.\n  This legislation will also unify families. When temporary residence \nis granted, a farm worker's spouse and minor children will be allowed \nto remain legally in the United States, but they will not be authorized \nto work. When the worker becomes a permanent resident, the spouse and \nminor children will also be granted that status.\n  In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, we can no \nlonger accept policies that fail to protect our borders. Congress has \nperiodically invested millions of dollars to increase the number of \nimmigration border patrol agents, improve surveillance technology, and \ninstall other controls to strengthen border enforcement, especially \nalong our southwest border. Yet, almost everyone agrees that these \nsteps have failed to stop illegal immigration. The proof is in the \nnumbers--several hundred thousand people a year continue to enter the \nUnited States illegally, and a significant part of the workforce in \nmany sectors of the economy, especially agriculture, is undocumented.\n\n[[Page S10790]]\n\n  One major unintended effect of our border enforcement strategy has \nbeen to shift illegal border crossings to the harsh desert and mountain \nterrains along the border, causing significant increases in deaths. \nAccording to the U.S. Border Patrol, since 1998 nearly 2000 people have \ndied attempting to make the difficult journey across that border. \nDesperate migrants are being drawn into criminal smuggling syndicates, \nwhich increase the danger of violence to border patrol officers, border \ncommunities, and the workers themselves. As Stephen Flynn, an expert on \nterrorism, noted at a recent Congressional hearing, these ``draconian \nmeasures'' have produced chaos at our borders, which ``makes it ideal \nfor exploitation by criminals and terrorists.''\n  The AgJOBS bill will make legality the norm and reduce illegal \nimmigration. It provides reasonable rules that are realistic and \nenforceable. It replaces the chaotic, deadly, and illegal flows at our \nborders with orderly, safe, and legal avenues for these farm workers \nand their families. A workable and legal program for foreign workers \ncrossing our borders will strengthen our security, substantially reduce \ncrime and enable immigration enforcement authorities to focus their \nresources on terrorists and criminals trying to enter the country \nillegally. We need laws that recognize reality, so that legality is the \nrule, not the exception.\n  In this post-9/11 world, we cannot afford to ignore the fact any \nlonger that so much of today's agricultural workforce is undocumented. \nThe AgJOBS bill enhances our national security and makes out \ncommunities safer. It brings undocumented farm workers and their \nfamilies out of the shadows and makes it possible for them to pass \nthorough security checks. It shrinks the pool of law enforcement \ntargets and enables law enforcement officers to give priority to \nterrorists and criminals. It will make our communities safer, because \nonce immigrants become legal, they will no longer fear deportation if \nthey report crimes to law enforcement officers.\n  Reducing the size of the undocumented population also reduces the \nability of suspected terrorists to hide. The half million or more \nundocumented farm workers eligible for this program will undergo \nrigorous security checks when they apply for legal status. Future \ntemporary workers will be carefully screened to meet security concerns. \nLaw enforcement resources will be more effectively focused on the \nhighest risks.\n  Opponents of this legislation offer no workable solutions to the \nserious problems of current law. Yet they have blocked our efforts for \na genuine debate on the issue. We cannot be complacent any longer. I \nurge my colleagues to support this needed legislation. It is long past \ntime to end these dangerous conditions, and to do it in a way that not \nonly improves the lives and working conditions of all farm workers, but \nalso enhances the security of our Nation. I urge my colleagues to \napprove this legislation, and I look forward to its enactment into law \nas soon as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada wishes to speak; \nalso the Senator from Louisiana. Even though there has not been a lot \nof order here today, I wonder if we could attempt, at least for a short \ntime--how much time does the Senator wish to speak?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I would like to speak for 10 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Nevada, 15 minutes in morning business. \nThe Senator from Louisiana, 15 minutes. So 15 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Nevada, Senator Ensign, followed by the Senator from Louisiana, 15 \nminutes, and then we would return to a quorum. Is that appropriate? I \nask consent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. It is 15, 15, go back to a quorum.\n  Mr. HARKIN. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Nevada for \nallowing us to cooperate to get some time to talk about a couple of \nissues that are related to what we are talking about today.\n  I want to talk about the Duelfer report that has been reported widely \nin the papers are in our national news in the last several days.\n  The Duelfer report proves one thing--Senator Kerry was right about \nthe coalition of the bribed and coerced. They were the countries that \nopposed the war in Iraq. They were the corrupt members of the U.N. \nSecurity Council who were brought off by Saddam Hussein.\n  Back in June, when I introduced the Oil-For-Food Accountability Act, \nI stated that I believed Saddam Hussein, corrupt U.N. officials, and \ncorrupt well-connected countries were the real benefactors of the Oil-\nfor-Food program. I noted there was evidence that they profited from \nillegal oil shipments, financial transactions, kickbacks, and \nsurcharges that allowed Saddam Hussein to build up his armed forces and \nlive in the lap of luxury.\n  The just-released 1,200-page CIA report confirms those allegations \nand details even more. The report states that some $10.9 billion, \nthat's billion with a ``B'', was secretly skimmed from the U.N. oil-\nfor-food program for Saddam to use as he pleased.\n  The report outlines how Saddam Hussein used lavish gifts of oil \nvouchers and contracts to secure the support of countries to lift U.N. \nsanctions on Iraq and oppose American initiatives in the Security \nCouncil. And this might be the most important point I make today--an \nIraqi Intelligence report indicated that one nation--France--was bribe \nto use its veto in the U.N. Security Council againts any effort to use \narmed forces in Iraq, and France later threatened to do just that.\n  France was not the only culprit in corruption. France was joined by \nRussia and China--also permanent members of the U.N. Security Council--\nas the top three countries in which influential individuals, companies \nor entities received oil vouchers. According to the report, Russia \nreceived 30 percent of the vouchers, France 15 percent and China 10 \npercent.\n  The real ``coalition of the bribed and coerced'' is the three members \nof the U.N. Security Council that were bought and sold by Saddam \nHussein. The three members of the Security Council that profited \nimmensely as long as Saddam Hussen remained in power.\n  The oil voucher system used by Saddam through the U.N. Oil-For-Food \nprogram was clever in that the vouchers were negotiable and could be \nresold to oil companies or other buyers at profits of 10 to 35 cents \nper barrel.\n  A voucher for 10 million barrels could generate between $1 million \nand $3.5 million to the holder of those vouchers.\n  The report notes that Benon Sevan, the former top U.N. Official in \ncharge of the oil-for-food program was himself a recipent of Saddam's \nscheme. The report says that Mr. Sevan was allocated 13 million barrels \nof oil, of which 7.3 million were cashed in. There is also information \nabout how Saddam's illicit oil profits were used to rearm Iraq. The \nreport details how Saddam's deals with Chinese companies helped Iraq \nimprove its missile capabilities. Russian companies provided barrels \nfor antiaircraft guns, missile components, and missile-guidance \nelectronics. French military contractors offered to supply Saddam \nHussein with helicopters, spare parts for fighter aircraft and air \ndefense systems. On the WMD front, Duelfer reports that using the Oil-\nfor-Food program, Saddam Hussein was making a point of procuring the \nresources and establishing the networks to start a massive effort to \nproduce chemical-weapons production just months after sanctions were \nlifted.\n\n  With Saddam's coalition of the bribed and coerced in place as three \nof the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, no amount of \ncoalition-building by an American president was going to preserve the \nsanctions on Saddam Hussein. No amount of diplomacy was going to get \nthose countries to enforce Security Council resolutions by force. They \nwere permanent members on Saddam's payroll. The CIA report notes that \nSaddam had succeeded: to the point where sitting members of\n\n[[Page S10791]]\n\nthe Security Council were actively violating resolutions passed by the \nSecurity Council.\n  So when I hear talk about some kind of a global test, or the need for \nUN Security Council approval for the use of force this Senator turns \naway in disgust because, with the release of the Duelfer report, we \nhave names, dates, and amounts of bribes to prove that our critics, \nincluding the UN, do not have the moral authority to judge our actions. \nThey are not motivated by security interests, humanitarian needs or any \nother noble cause. They are motivated by greed. America's freedom to \nuse force wisely and justly is truly the world's best hope for peace \nand security. God bless President George W. Bush for having the courage \nto stand by his convictions.\n  He is doing his job. It is time, now, for the U.S. Senate to follow \nthe 9/11 Commission's recommendations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I think under the unanimous consent \nagreement that I am entitled to speak for the next 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                               TAX RELIEF\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada makes some \ninteresting points. I will have more to say about that specific issue \nlater, as will other Senators from this side. But I am glad that he \nbrought up the point of greed because it is actually something that I \nam going to speak about myself but as it relates to a different aspect, \na different bill, and a different issue, but basically the same \n``sin,'' if you will.\n  Unfortunately, it is not our allies who are committing this sin, it \nis us right here. We are debating now, over the course of the next \nseveral days, and have actually been debating for 2 years, a tax relief \nbill prompted by the World Trade Organization's decision that some of \nthe things in our U.S. Tax Code were contrary to the free trade \nprinciples that most of us--not all of us but most of us--espouse. So \nthat decision set in motion a very necessary effort to address that \ndecision by changing some things in our Tax Code.\n  Of course, anytime you open up the Tax Code there are many people \ninterested in changing the words, the letters, the titles, the \nparagraphs, and the provisions. Sometimes a change in one word could \nmean a $1 billion windfall for a particular company, or millions of \ndollars of windfall for particular entities. There is a lot of interest \nevery time this body opens up a tax bill.\n  Two years ago when it came to the attention of some of us that a tax \nbill would be opened, and then as the 9/11 tragedy happened and as we \nsaw men and women from our States going to the front lines to fight in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, and as we watched some of our health units, \nparticularly in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, right here in \nWashington, DC, and Virginia respond to some very tough casualties that \nthis country experienced, some of us began to think: What could we do \nin this tax bill to honor the men and women who are on the front lines?\n  Not being on the Finance Committee, I wasn't aware of all the \nspecific aspects, but I knew there would be maybe hundreds or thousands \nof entities, corporations, big and small, groups that thought they were \nentitled to some sort of tax break.\n  For the life of me, I didn't think we would have any trouble at all \nwhen a group of us got together--Senator Boxer being one, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Murray, Senator Daschle, Senator Reid, Senator Bond, \nthe Senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, and many others--and \nthought, having been to a lot of parades and flag-waving ceremonies for \nour troops, maybe there would be a way we could help them in this tax \nbill.\n  I know it is not the focus, but we figured--or I thought--there would \nbe lots of other people who were trying to get in. So why don't we try \nto get our troops in? The good part of this story is we did in the \nSenate, with the help of Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, and many \nmembers on the Senate Finance Committee who worked long hours, many \nweeks, many months negotiating a bill that would correct the original \nproblem that the World Trade Organization had, and provide some tax \nrelief, according to their views and other people who wanted tax \nrelief; we put in a tax benefit of $2 billion for the men and women who \nare actually on the front lines, the guardsmen and reservists who have \nbecome a larger and larger component of our fighting force, who leave \ntheir regular jobs, leave their families, and leave their regular \ncivilian life, put on their uniforms and go to the front lines.\n  We know from reports which we have read and from our own experience \nrepresenting our Guard and Reserve in our own States that 40 percent of \nthese men and women take a cut in pay to go to the front lines. Not \nonly do they take the bullet, not only do their Humvees get blown up on \npatrols, but they also take a cut in pay to go.\n  Some of us had the notion that maybe in this bill, whether it was \ngoing to be $350 billion or $75 billion or $100 billion, now it is $137 \nbillion--I would like to show you what that looks like. This is only \npart of it. This is what a bill looks like that has tax relief \nprovisions of $137 billion. This is just part of it. I am going to get \nthe rest of it because it is a lot of pages.\n  Some of us had the foolish notion that maybe the Congress could find \none page, one paragraph, one letter to include tax relief for American \nbusinesses that are doing the right thing, the patriotic thing, by \nfilling the pay gap that these men and women are experiencing. When \nthey leave their civilian life and they put the uniform on, and they \npick up their paychecks from the Army, Air Force, or the Navy, they get \na substantial cut in pay. Some of the employers are making them whole \nand doing the right thing, the patriotic thing. We thought surely in \nthis tax bill we could give a tax credit to those small businesses \nbecause times are not good everywhere in some States and communities. \nReally, the whole economy is weaker than we had expected and these \nsmall businesses are struggling.\n\n  But I don't know why Chairman Thomas from California who wrote the \nbill, and the House leadership of Congressman DeLay and Speaker \nHastert, couldn't find one page or paragraph to include them. So they \nwere left out. They weren't in the top of the list, they weren't in the \nmiddle of the list, and they were not at the bottom of the list. They \nare not on the list.\n  We stand here and talk all weekend about our intelligence \nreorganization to secure ourselves. We talk about spending and the \ninvestment in our defense to secure ourselves. Let me just ask anyone \nwho would want to come to this floor, or Chairman Thomas, if he is \nlistening to me, what could we be thinking if we are not even keeping \nthe paychecks of the men and women on the front lines whole? No bonus, \nno extra, just keep their paycheck whole, just to keep their house \npayments up, just to keep the car notes for their spouse who is at home \nso they can continue to work and transport the children, just keep the \nchildren's trust funds moving along so they don't have to make that up \nwhen they come home--what could they be thinking? They weren't thinking \nvery well on the House side. They took it out.\n  If we could afford $2.5 trillion in tax cuts in 2001, I think we \ncould at least allocate one-tenth of 1 percent to our troops on the \nfront lines who are protecting us today.\n  I want to say another thing to the businesses that are in this bill. \nI have a lot of companies in Louisiana that are going to benefit from \nthis bill. I have not a word to say about that. I am happy they are in. \nI am sure they have good reasons. I am sure it is going to help create \njobs.\n  But I have a word to say to the businesses in the United States of \nAmerica. No business would be here, no business could operate, no \nbusiness would have international trade, no business would have \nstockholders, no business would have a profit sheet, no businesspeople \nwould be paying taxes on profits they made if it were not for the men \nand women in uniform who go to the front lines every time we have a \nconflict, a peacekeeping mission or a war to undertake to protect their \ncommercial interests.\n  I am confident that the businesspeople who are represented in this \nbill know that. I know they are not going to blame me for taking a few \ndays to talk about it. I know they will say, Senator, you are right. We \nare\n\n[[Page S10792]]\n\ngrateful to the men and women in uniform. We are actually a little \nembarrassed because we are in the bill and they are not. It is not \ntheir fault. It is nobody's fault. But the House leadership who wrote \nthe bill left them out.\n  We have in this bill help for investors who want to invest in a \nsubway system in Paris. I like NASCAR. Lots of people in my State go to \nNASCAR races. We have tax relief for NASCAR. We have tax relief for \nceiling fan importers with Home Depot. I shop at Home Depot. I like \nHome Depot. But we left out the Guard and Reserve.\n  I don't know. I am just starting to think that unless the cameras are \non nobody remembers the truth. It is only the photo opportunities or \nthe rallies or the parades that everybody goes to. We wear the pins and \nthe flags, but when it comes to the budget and to the tax bill, we \nleave them out.\n  I don't think our troops need a lobbyist. I thought we were their \nadvocates. Mr. President, $137 billion and we could not allocate $2 \nbillion, not $1 billion, not half a billion?\n\n  I will speak about this as often as possible for the next couple of \ndays. I tell my leadership, I don't want to make people's lives \nmiserable. I am happy to talk with our leadership and the Republican \nleadership about any time agreements that make people's weekends \nconvenient, but I could not in good conscience not spend some hours--\nwhether it is 2, 5, 10, or 30--talking about the 5,000 men and women \nwho have been deployed out of Louisiana, who are on the front lines, \nwhose employers, whom I know personally, are making their paychecks \nwhole.\n  We had the chance to help out small business, to help our National \nGuard and Reserve. Somebody, somewhere, on the other side of this \nCapitol made a decision that is immoral, unconscionable, and most \ncertainly not justifiable.\n  I will present for the record some names of families. I will present \nsome hardship cases so the record is clear about the kind of families \nwe have turned our backs on and the kind of employers who are doing the \nvery best they can. While they are hiring a replacement, because they \nobviously need the job done, and sending the paycheck overseas, the \nGovernment of the United States, which is supposed to be on their side, \ndecides we do not want to help them because we have higher priorities.\n  What higher priorities could we possibly have in the Tax Code at this \ntime? If any one of my colleagues wants to explain to me and anyone \nelse what could be a higher priority, I would appreciate it. If there \nis something else in here for the Guard and Reserve, for the military, \nto support our troops directly, please tell me. Maybe I didn't get to \nread the whole report.\n  I was on the Armed Services Committee for several years. Eventually, \nI hope to be on Defense Appropriations where I can do more work along \nthis line. I know one thing, last year the Guard and Reserve, despite \nthe fact these are the most dedicated and patriotic men and women--they \nwill go the distance. They do not complain. They do not even like to \nsay what is wrong because they feel sacrifice is what they do. I \nunderstand that. They came 5,000 people short of their retention goals. \nCould it possibly be because, although the soldiers do not mind making \nthe sacrifice, they are getting belly sick of their spouses and their \nwives and children making sacrifices more than the rest of us are \nmaking? Why can't we sacrifice and help them? Why do they have to \ncontinue to make the sacrifice? When we have the opportunity, we say \nno.\n  Drastic pay cuts, bankruptcies, foreclosures--these aren't exactly \nthe kinds of challenges members of the American military reserve signed \nup for when they volunteered to put their life on the line for us and \nfor a country as great as this. For all of our pompous talk about how \npatriotic we are in this Congress, the least we can do is keep their \npaycheck whole.\n  Let me talk about three families I actually know. I will be in the \nChamber talking about more.\n  Janet Wright is from Hammond, LA. Her husband Russell is in the \nMarine Corps. I have the Marine Corps pin on today in honor of our men \nand women. He makes $60,000 a year in the civilian world. He was \nactivated and made only $30,000. He took a 50-percent pay cut. Mrs. \nWright said that after a couple of months she started to put water \nin her children's cereal while her husband was gone because she had to \ncount every penny. That is what happens when we give out $137 billion: \nWe cannot help the Wrights. We don't have enough money to help the \nWrights, so they have to put water in the children's cereal bowls.\n\n  Scott is a Navy reservist from California. He lost his home when he \nwas activated and he lost nearly $1,000 a month in pay because the Navy \njob was different than the civilian. People say, Senator, that is \nimpossible. There is a law that protects people from losing their home. \nI know that. You cannot foreclose on someone's home when they are on \nthe front line. But the problem is, the bills add up and when they have \nto come home, if they have not paid those monthly notes and they cannot \npay it within a certain amount of time, the foreclosure happens.\n  I don't understand how we don't have any money to fix it. How can I \ngo home and tell my Guard and Reserve, I'm sorry, we didn't have any \nmoney, but here is $137 billion we gave out to everybody else? I am not \ngoing to do it. I can't go home. So I would as soon stay here because I \ndon't have a thing I can tell them, not a thing I can say.\n  I will tell more stories about real people. They are calling my \noffice right now and sending letters. We are getting a lot of e-mails. \nI will come down here until I hear from Chairman Thomas. We are sending \na letter to the President at 6 o'clock today.\n  Let me say on the record I don't think the President of the United \nStates knows they were left out. He has a lot on his mind. I understand \nthat. And I know this is only one of a thousand things he has to \nconsider, literally, weekly. But I am sending him a letter to let him \nknow. I cannot amend this bill; it is beyond my power to amend it. It \nis against the rules. But the bill could be vetoed and this could be \nincluded. Or the President could send a message to his House leadership \nthat says, you must have made a mistake; we should have included this. \nWe obviously could afford it and he could promise to fix it.\n  I hope that is a response we will get over the next couple of days. I \ndon't know. I know he is very busy on many other things right now. \nThere will be a big debate tonight, but this is something I had to \nbring to our attention.\n  Over 410,000 members of the National Guard and Reserve have been \nactivated since September 11. Secretary Rumsfeld has predicted that \nnumber may go up to 640,000. That is a lot of families dependent on us \nto make good decisions for them. This was not a good decision made by \nthe House leadership. I will do everything in my power to get them to \nchange their mind, to change the bill, or to promise they will put in \nthis $2 billion or $3 billion--whatever it will cost to close this pay \ngap--so the men and women who leave your State of Illinois or my State \nof Louisiana or the Senator's State of Ohio or the Senator's State of \nMassachusetts, when the soldiers leave to go overseas, they have \nconfidence that when we have a chance to help them keep their pay \nwhole, keep their benefits intact, give them some support in the \nspousal support program we have established, we are there for them.\n  I understand the Senator from Massachusetts will speak and I \nunderstand the Senator from Iowa will yield the time to make that \npossible. But if my colleagues are wondering why the process has slowed \ndown, why we are having a hard time getting a schedule for the next \ncouple of days, this is one of the reasons. This is the reason I am \nvoting against the bill and will be speaking about it as the days go \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the majority has people who \nwant to speak. I know the Senator from North Carolina is here and \nwishes to speak for 10 minutes and the Senator from Massachusetts \nwishes to speak for up to 30 minutes. This would be as if in morning \nbusiness. Senator Kennedy will speak for up to 30 minutes. Of course, \nthe time counts against the 30 hours we are working under now. And we \nwould ask that the majority be recognized for up to 30 minutes, to \nmatch that of the time for Senator Kennedy,\n\n[[Page S10793]]\n\nwith the first 10 minutes being for the Senator from North Carolina, \nand that time also be counted against the 30 hours. I ask unanimous \nconsent that be the order.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, while my good friend the Senator from \nLouisiana is in the Chamber, I commend her for the enormously \npersuasive case she has made and say I agree with her 100 percent and \nwill certainly do everything I can to support her.\n  The point is, we passed this underlying bill in June, and the \nconferees were appointed in July by the Senate of the United States. \nThe House of Representatives did not even appoint their conferees until \nthe end of last week, and did not have their first meeting until Monday \nof this week, and we are trying to jam this legislation through the \nSenate late in the afternoon on a Friday, and the cloture motion was \nfiled the first thing this morning before there was 1 minute of debate \non it.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I say that both in terms of the substance, which is so \npowerful, and the process and the procedure in standing for the Guard \nand Reserve, I commend the leader. There is an arrogance among the \nchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Republican \nleadership that ends up and results in this kind of a situation where \nthey say: Well, there won't be people over there who will stand for the \nGuard and Reserve. We will send it over there late either last night, \nwhich they would have done if they had been able to get these printed \nup, or we will have it over there on Friday morning, and they will all \nwant to take off on Friday, so they will go ahead and pass it. That is \nthe view.\n  I commend the Senator from Louisiana for the substance and commend \nher for the process as well. And I will take the time not just at this \nmoment but also to comment about the same legislation, how Chairman \nThomas and the Republican leadership are prepared to take care of the \ntobacco companies but not take care of America's children. That was the \nchoice. You could have done both. I would have supported looking out \nafter tobacco farmers who are having difficulties on that. I would have \nsupported having the tobacco companies pay for that particular bailout. \nBut it should have included the protection of America's children, and \nthe Republican leadership refused to do that.\n  It refused to look out after American workers. We have passed--three \ntimes in the Senate, twice in the House of Representatives--a \nprohibition against this administration's repeal of the overtime \nprovisions that affect 6 million of our fellow workers, primarily the \nfirst responders. Police and firefighters and nurses: They are three of \nthe largest groups that were going to be affected. We passed that three \ntimes. The House of Representatives passed it twice.\n  We had 5 minutes of discussion on it from the proponents of it in the \nsame conference. I was there. So that is certainly one of the reasons \nthat we speak and we are so concerned about those provisions. We will \nhave a chance to address those matters. But I do want to speak to the \nSenate on two other matters briefly this afternoon.\n\n\n                            Afghan Elections\n\n  Madam President, one is the greatest intelligence failures in our \nhistory occurred on 9/11, and the seeds of that disaster were planted \nlong ago in Afghanistan, whose people will participate tomorrow in the \nhistoric election to select their next President. I know my colleagues \nshare my deep respect for the Afghan people and the many others \nwho worked so hard in recent months to make these elections possible.\n\n  The elections already have been postponed three times, and the \nparliamentary elections that were to be held this weekend have now been \ndelayed until next year. President Karzai has shown tremendous courage \nand determination in the face of multiple assassination attempts. He \nand the vast majority of the Afghan people have demonstrated an \nimpressive commitment to a free and democratic Afghanistan.\n  Yet Afghanistan still faces fundamental threats to the casting of \nballots on Saturday, let alone its long-term stability and prosperity. \nElections are vitally important to the process of rebuilding a free \ncountry, but they are not a panacea for the myriad of problems that \nface the people in Afghanistan. Those problems will still be there the \nday after the elections, and the Bush administration, Congress, and the \nAmerican people cannot afford to be distracted from the ongoing efforts \nthat will be required to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan.\n  We made that mistake once before in Afghanistan, in the aftermath of \nthe Soviet withdrawal in 1989, and the result was a failed nation that \nbecame the breeding ground for the terrorists who attacked us on \nSeptember 11, 2001. We cannot afford to allow Afghanistan to fall into \nchaos once again. Unfortunately, because of its misguided war in Iraq, \nthe Bush administration may bring us perilously close to doing just \nthat.\n  In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, President \nBush rightly spoke about the need to put Afghanistan on the right \ncourse. He welcomed then-Chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority Hamid \nKarzai to the White House in January 2002, and said:\n\n       The United States is committed to building a lasting \n     partnership with Afghanistan. We will help the new Afghan \n     government provide the security that is the foundation for \n     peace.\n\n  Instead of finishing the job, however, President Bush foolishly and \nrecklessly diverted America's attention from the real war on terrorism \nin Afghanistan by rushing to war in Iraq, a country that had no \noperational links to al-Qaida terrorists.\n  We now know that President Bush began planning the invasion of Iraq \nfrom the earliest days of his administration. Finding a rationale to \nget rid of Saddam Hussein was on the agenda from day one of this \nadministration. Barely 3 months after the most vicious terrorist attack \non America, the President already began concentrating on Iraq, not \nAfghanistan. On November 26, 2001, he said:\n\n       Afghanistan is still just the beginning.\n\n  And 3 days later, even before Hamid Karzai had been approved as \ninterim Afghan President, Vice President Cheney publicly began to send \nsignals about attacking Iraq. On November 29, he said:\n\n       I don't think it takes a genius to figure out this guy \n     [Saddam Hussein] is clearly . . . a significant potential \n     problem for the region, for the United States, for everybody \n     with interests in the area.\n\n  The shift was all but sealed by the time of President Bush's State of \nthe Union Address on January 29, 2002. Karl Rove had told the \nRepublican National Committee that terrorism could be used politically. \nRemember that speech, that terrorism could be used politically? That is \nKarl Rove in 2002: Republicans could ``go to the country on this \nissue.''\n  In the State of the Union Address, President Bush unveiled his ``Axis \nof Evil''--Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Those three words forged the \nlockstep linkage between the Bush administration's top political \nadvisers and the Big Three: Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz.\n  What did President Bush say about bin Laden in the State of the Union \nAddress that day? Nothing.\n  What did he say about al-Qaida? One fleeting mention.\n  What did he say about the Taliban? Nothing.\n  Nothing about bin Laden, a fleeting mention of al-Qaida, nothing \nabout the Taliban in that State of the Union Address.\n  With those words, we lost our clear focus on the most imminent threat \nto our national security--Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. The President \nhad checked the box on Afghanistan and was poised to use the 9/11 \nattacks to advance his Iraq war agenda of a war on Iraq.\n  The consequences of that decision have been severe for the security \nof Afghanistan and for the security of the American people. Without a \ndoubt, the war with Iraq has distracted us from the hunt for Osama bin \nLaden.\n  The administration botched the battle at Tora Bora in December 2001. \nBy outsourcing the job to warlords in Afghanistan, he let Osama bin \nLaden escape. Instead of sticking with the job of capturing bin Laden, \nthe administration launched a war with Iraq. Reports indicate that the \nBush administration shifted special operations soldiers and\n\n[[Page S10794]]\n\nArab language specialists from Afghanistan to prepare for the war in \nIraq. And it recently pulled the State Department's extraordinarily \ntalented assistance coordinator for Afghanistan, William Taylor, out of \nAfghanistan and sent him to Iraq. Saddam Hussein is behind bars, but he \ndid not attack America.\n  Meanwhile, Osama bin Laden is probably hiding somewhere in the \nungovernable tribal region between Afghanistan and Pakistan planning \nanother attack on America.\n  Security outside of Kabul is tenuous because we and our allies are \noverstretched in Iraq and cannot commit sufficient troops in \nAfghanistan. We have 140,000 troops in Iraq and our allies, another \n20,000. It was al-Qaida operatives who trained in Afghanistan who \nattacked America. Yet America has seven times more troops in Iraq than \nin Afghanistan.\n  We obviously do not have enough soldiers to secure Afghanistan. It \nwas the lowest troop-to-population ratio of any postconflict country \nduring the past 60 years. President Karzai asked for 20,000 new troops \nfor election security at the NATO summit last June. The U.N. reportedly \nestimated this summer that it would take somewhere between 5,000 and \n15,000 additional troops to secure this Saturday's election. Sadly, \nwhat NATO and the United States eventually provided fell far short of \nthat requirement--3,000 troops total. Spain agreed to send a battalion \nto Afghanistan for election security only after the Government pulled \nits troops out of Iraq. Our allies can't meet NATO requests for a \nminimal increase in troops for Afghanistan because they too are bogged \ndown in Iraq.\n  This administration's lack of credibility with the international \ncommunity has made it almost impossible to obtain the necessary troop \ncommitments to win peace in Afghanistan. Because the international \ncommunity is unable to provide adequate security in Afghanistan, the \nforces of the Taliban and al-Qaida continue to strike regularly. Most \nexperts believe that elements of the Pakistani security services \ncontinue to support the Taliban and that Taliban forces are able to \nmove freely between Afghanistan and Pakistan and can launch attacks on \nAmerican and Afghan forces before retreating to their sanctuaries in \nPakistan.\n  The Bush administration's Ambassador to Afghanistan admits what has \nbecome the obvious truth on the ground: The Taliban ranks are growing \nin Afghanistan.\n  Our Ambassador Zalmay Khalizad told reporters in September:\n\n       With regard to Taliban, I have to say that there may have \n     been some growth in the numbers of their people that are \n     active. There has been some effort, obviously, at \n     recruitment, increased effort at recruitment in the refugee \n     camps and in the madrasas.\n\n  Ambassador Khalizad also tells us that he still sees a ``strong \nlink'' between al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Three years \nafter our invasion of Afghanistan to deny al-Qaida its sanctuary under \nTaliban protection, the Taliban and al-Qaida still retain a strong \nrelationship in Afghanistan. How did the Bush administration ignore the \nfact that America cannot be safe until Afghanistan is stable and al-\nQaida no longer has a haven there?\n  As a result of the poor security, President Karzai still does not \nhave full control over his country and is forced to negotiate with \nwarlords who control private militias with forces numbering in the tens \nof thousands. A recent report by Human Rights Watch summarized the \nissue well:\n\n       Political repression by the local strongmen is the \n     principal problem. Through the country, militarized political \n     factions . . . continue to cement their hold on political \n     power at the local level, using force, threats, and \n     corruption to stifle more legitimate political activity and \n     dominate the election process.\n\n  Our inability to secure Afghanistan means that opium production is at \nrecord levels. Funds from the drug trade are being used to finance \nattacks against our troops and against the Afghan people. They are \nbeing used to operate the private armies of the warlords and rebuild \nthe ranks of the Taliban. They are pouring fuel on the fire of \ninstability and terrorism. Yet the administration failed to give a \npriority to shutting off the drug trade in Afghanistan, and the result \nhas been predictably destructive.\n  Two weeks ago, Robert Charles, our Assistant Secretary of State for \nInternational Narcotics and Law Enforcement, painted an ominous picture \nin his testimony in the House International Relations Committee. He \nsaid:\n\n       On the narcotics front, tied like a ball and chain to \n     security, justice and economic development, we stand in the \n     darkness of a long shadow . . . President Karzai and other \n     Afghan officials have said that drug trafficking and the \n     corruption it breeds may be the biggest threat right now to \n     Afghan's long-term security and democratic future.\n\n  The CIA and the United Nations estimate that the crop of poppies for \n2004 will be 20 to 40 percent greater than last year. That means 500 \ntons of heroin. No wonder Afghanistan now accounts for 75 percent of \nthe worldwide production of opium.\n  The long shadow that Robert Charles described is the shadow of our \nmisguided war in Iraq. The forces and resources we are pouring into \nIraq could have been used and should have been used to end the drug \ntrade in Afghanistan, regain control of the country from the warlords, \nand dismantle their militias.\n  Last month, LTG Walter Sharp of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the \nHouse International Relations Committee that less than half of the \napproximately 40,000 people targeted in Afghanistan for disarmament had \nactually been disarmed. The operations manager of the U.N. disarmament \nprogram on the ground in Afghanistan told the Financial Times that \nfewer than 10,000 of the targeted individuals had been disarmed. \nClearly, the effort to dismantle the private militias has fallen \ndrastically short with dangerous consequences for Afghan stability.\n  In June, local militias killed five aid workers from Doctors Without \nBorders in a brutal attack. In July, that distinguished nongovernmental \norganization pulled out of Afghanistan after 24 years of helping the \nAfghan people. Their loss is a sad commentary on the continuing \nviolence and the Bush administration's misguided handling of \nAfghanistan. The failure to crack down on the narcotics trade, the \ncontinuing domination of much of the countryside by warlords, and the \ninability of this administration to provide sufficient troops to \nstabilize the country are major setbacks to the war on terrorism. \nClearly some progress has been made. I hope the elections tomorrow will \nproceed without incident. But if we had not rushed to war with Iraq, \nmuch greater progress could have been made and certainly would have \nbeen made in Afghanistan, and America would be safer today. Yet \nPresident Bush continues to deny this obvious reality. Incredibly, he \ntold a campaign rally in Ohio last week that as a result of the U.S. \nmilitary, the Taliban no longer is in existence.\n  Representative Ron Paul, a Republican Congressman from Texas, does \nnot agree. As he said on September 23:\n\n       A picture of Afghanistan has been painted, I think, overly \n     optimistic. You read the newspapers, what you're talking \n     about doesn't even exist from the reports that I have read \n     about what's really going on. And when you hear about the \n     Doctors Without Borders leaving, after having been there \n     through the Russian occupation. The U.N. wants to leave. \n     Protection of the president is very precarious. We don't know \n     what will come of that.\n       The airport's getting bombed. There's estimates that 90 \n     percent of the country, at least a very large percent of the \n     country, is under the occupation of the Taliban and the \n     warlords. We have a serious disconnect here and we have to \n     be--as Americans and as members of Congress, we have to be \n     realistic and not hide from the realities of what is \n     happening.\n\n  That is from a Republican Congressman from Texas. I couldn't agree \nmore.\n  In the aftermath of 9/11, it was clear that America had to deal \neffectively with Afghanistan as the highest priority for our national \nsecurity. It was clear that America could not be safe if Afghanistan \nremained unstable. Instead of finishing the job, we rushed off to fight \na different war, the war in Iraq. We squandered the tremendous \nworldwide good will that flowed to America after 9/11. We alienated \nlongtime friends and leaders in other nations on whom we heavily depend \nfor intelligence for support in the ongoing war against terrorism. \nDistrust of America has soared throughout the world. We are especially \nhated in the Muslim world. The past 2 years have seen the steepest and \ndeepest fall from grace our country has ever suffered in the eyes of \nthe world community in all our history.\n\n[[Page S10795]]\n\n  All this is the heavy price our country has paid because of the war \nin Iraq that America never should have fought. We cannot afford to \ncontinue down this dangerous path of incompetence in foreign policy. We \nknow that America has to do better.\n  As I have said before, the only thing we have to fear is 4 more years \nof George Bush.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                              Unemployment\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, earlier today, the Department of Labor \nissued its report on the state of unemployment in the country. I want \nto just comment on this. It is official now that President Bush will be \nthe first President since the days of Herbert Hoover and the Great \nDepression--over 70 years ago--to preside over a net loss of jobs \nduring his Presidency.\n  Today's job numbers show that only 96,000 were created last month, \nwhich is even lower than economists had predicted in order to keep up \nwith population growth. Even worse, a third of the jobs created were in \ntemporary positions. Another third were government jobs, which means \nthe private sector job creation is far from recovering.\n  The official unemployment rate is 5.4 percent, but the real rate of \nunemployment and underemployment is 9.4 percent. More than 400,000 \nworkers have stopped looking for work because they are so discouraged. \nThey are no longer counted in the official rate. Another 4.5 million \nare working part time because they cannot find full-time jobs.\n  Part-time workers and temporary workers earn less money than full-\ntime permanent employees and often do not even receive benefits. \nAmerica's workers have been out of work for months. They have finally \nfound a job, but it is part time or temporary, so they take a huge cut \nand have no health insurance. Temporary workers earn about 40 percent \nless a week than the rest of the workforce.\n  Of the 8 million unemployed workers, nearly 22 percent are long-term \nunemployed; they have been out of a job for more than 6 months. This \nlong-term unemployment rate has been over the 20-percent mark each \nmonth since October 2002, 2 consecutive years, which is the longest \nstreak since this data has ever been collected.\n  Despite these record highs in long-term unemployment, President Bush \nallowed the unemployment insurance program to expire last December. \nThese workers have worked hard, played by the rules, and paid into the \nunemployment trust fund, which now has $20 billion in it. But the \nPresident had said no to extending unemployment benefits for these \nworkers.\n  Do we understand that, Madam President? You don't get unemployment \ncompensation; you are not eligible unless you have worked and \ncontributed to the fund. The reason the fund was set up was for just \nthis kind of condition, where workers have been working, want to work, \nand need to work, but the economy slows down, so they receive \nunemployment compensation for a period of time, generally 26 weeks. It \nhas been extended 13 weeks in particularly high unemployment areas. It \nis just enough to cover the mortgage and put some food on the table and \nput gas in the automobile. It is interesting that Bush No. 1 extended \nthe unemployment compensation three times, when we never had the \neconomic and adverse economic conditions we have at this time. But this \nPresident will not extend it to help these workers.\n  The job situation is even worse for people of color. The unemployment \nrate for African Americans is more than 10 percent--almost double the \nnational average--and for Hispanics, it is 7 percent. And women are not \nfaring well in this economy. The income of low-income single mothers \nhas gone down by 3 percent every year in the Bush economy--3 percent \nconstantly down.\n  But President Bush and the Republican Congress refused to raise the \nminimum wage, which would benefit primarily women--7 million of our \nfellow citizens, men and women of dignity, who work hard, clean out the \ngreat buildings where American industry is housed, help as assistant \nteachers, work in nursing homes--primarily women; and many of them have \nchildren, so it is a women and children's issue, a family issue. It is \nalso a civil rights issue because so many of those who earn minimum \nwage are men and women of color. It is a civil rights, family, women \nand children, and a fairness issue.\n\n  Americans believe if you work hard 52 weeks in the year, you should \nnot have to live in poverty. Why is it that the Republican leadership \nhas refused to let us have a vote on increasing the minimum wage? I \noffered to increase the minimum wage on the TANF bill. What did the \nleadership do? They pulled the bill. I offered it on the State \nDepartment reauthorization bill. They pulled the bill so the Senate \ncould not vote. Here you see the results of that: no long-term \nunemployment compensation, no increase in the minimum wage.\n  Now we hear, as I heard on the Joint Economic Committee, about how \nthe hurricanes have really impacted things. We heard other testimony \nthat because of the hurricanes more people are working to try to deal \nwith the problems. All of this is against a background where those \nworkers are facing the perfect storm: the lack of an increase in the \nminimum wage, lack of unemployment compensation, and the fact that this \nadministration has put in the regulations to deny overtime for up to 6 \nmillion American workers. So they are going to work longer and harder--\nbecause that is the record if you don't have that protection--and they \nwill make less.\n  You have those three coming at you and, at the same time, you have \ncollege tuition going up 38 percent. Health care premiums are up 59 \npercent. Gas, 40 percent.\n  If you can believe it, milk, in Cape Cod, MA, last week was $4.05 a \ngallon. It is a little less in other parts of Massachusetts, maybe a \nlittle over $3. But it is $4.05 a gallon there, and we cannot get an \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  So American families are working and working long and hard.\n  What happens after all this? We have a proposal on the floor of the \nSenate called the JOBS bill--how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 \\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The JOBS bill was meant to initially deal with the $4.5 \nbillion problem at the World Trade Organization. What has happened is \nthe Republican leadership in the House of Representatives sent over a \n$143 billion program that benefited the tobacco companies at the \nexpense of the children, and also increased financial incentives to \ndrive more American jobs out of the country, rather than bring them \nhome--outsourcing.\n  My friend, the Senator from Florida, Bob Graham, will address this \nissue during the course of this debate. We see how this legislation \ndisserves American workers even more.\n  This is a fierce record and everybody on Main Street knows it. This \neconomy is working fine for Wall Street. It works well for the elites, \nthe elite corporations and the elite individuals. In this economy, we \nhave had four tax breaks--at a time when we are fighting two wars--for \nthe elite corporations and elite individuals. But for the working \nfamilies on Main Street, they are suffering. Hopefully, they will have \nan opportunity to express themselves on election day.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I understand the Senator from North \nCarolina is speaking as in morning business under a block of time \nallocated to the other side by prior agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the Senator from North \nCarolina--if nobody is on the floor--that I be recognized for 15 \nminutes as in morning business, preserving the remainder of the 30 \nminutes allocated to the other side. If other speakers on that side are \nhere to follow the Senator from North Carolina, I suggest that I follow \nthem at the end of the 30-minute period.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nmodify his request that for whatever time he uses, the majority have \nequal\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\ntime, subsequent time, and that the time the Senator from North Dakota \nuses and the time of the majority following him be charged against the \n30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                  Connection Between Iraq And Al-Qaida\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Madam President, in our post-9/11 world, most Americans \nwould agree that to defend our Nation and the freedoms we hold dear we \nmust continue to succeed in the war on terror. As many of my colleagues \nand I have said, Iraq is the central battleground in the war on terror. \nThe terrorists certainly know what is at stake, which is why they are \npulling out all the stops to derail our efforts there. They know that a \nfree and democratic Iraq is a serious blow to their interests.\n  Collaboration of Iraq's former regime with terrorist groups and its \nfunding of them have not been in question. Democratic cochairman of the \n9/11 Commission, former Congressman Lee Hamilton, told reporters that \nthere were connections between al-Qaida, and Saddam Hussein's \ngovernment. Still, few naysayers have passed up the chance to contest \nlinks between Iraq and al-Qaida, links that have existed for more than \na decade.\n  Charges have been made that Iraq was not a haven for terrorists \nbefore the war, this statement being made just days after terrorist \nfollowers of Zarqawi, arguably the most dangerous terrorist in the \nworld today, kidnapped and beheaded American civilians in Iraq. Reports \nstrongly suggest that Zarqawi himself committed the atrocities.\n  He and his men trained and fought with al-Qaida for years. Not only \nwas Zarqawi in Baghdad prior to Saddam's ousting, but nearly two dozen \nmembers of al-Qaida were there as well. One al-Qaida associate even \ndescribed the situation in Iraq as ``good'' and stated that Baghdad \ncould be transited quickly.\n  Then there is Abdul Rahman Yasin, another terrorist who was in Iraq \nlong before the war. Yasin was a member of the al-Qaida cell that \ndetonated the 1993 World Trade Center bomb. Documents discovered \nrecently by U.S. forces in Saddam's hometown of Tikrit show that Iraq \ngave Yasin both a home and a salary until the eve of the war in Iraq. \nWhen a Newsweek reporter interviewed Yasin's Baghdad neighbors, they \ntold the reporter that Yasin was ``working for the government.'' Is \nthis not a clear example of Iraq not only having a relationship with \nal-Qaida but also harboring and rewarding a terrorist, a person who was \ndirectly involved in a terrorist attack on our soil?\n  What about a link between Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader \nhimself, and Iraq? The 9/11 Commission Report states that Iraqi \nintelligence officials and al-Qaida members met in the spring and \nsummer of 1998, and that an Iraqi official offered bin Laden a safe \nhaven in Iraq. In its 1998 indictment of bin Laden, the Clinton \nadministration asserted that al-Qaida and the Iraqi Government had an \nunderstanding that they would not work against each other, and on \nprojects such as weapons development, they would work cooperatively. Is \nthis not evidence of bin Laden and al-Qaida having a collaborative \nrelationship with the Iraqi Government?\n  In a recent interview with a French newspaper published August 29, \n2004, Hudayfa Azzam, the son of bin Laden's mentor, Abdullah Azzam, \nsaid the Iraqi regime and al-Qaida had worked together closely before \nthe war. He said:\n\n       Saddam Hussein's regime welcomed them with open arms and \n     young al-Qaida members entered Iraq in large numbers, setting \n     up an organization to confront the occupation.\n\n  Azzam said that al-Qaida members came into Iraq from Afghanistan, \nacross mountains in Iran, with the help of Kurdish militants. And once \nin Iraq, Saddam strictly and directly controlled their activities, \naccording to Azzam. Here is yet another example of al-Qaida members \ninfiltrating Iraq and being given safe haven prior to the entrance of \ncoalition forces.\n\n  Let me be clear, despite recent political criticisms and media \nreports that have clouded or even misrepresented the facts, there is \nample evidence of terrorists operating out of Iraq prior to the war, \nand there is compelling evidence of a longstanding link between al-\nQaida and Iraq. The bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report \ninforms us of this, as does the bipartisan 9/11 Commission Report.\n  Again, let me emphasize, Iraq is the central battleground in the war \non terror. Recently, before a joint meeting of Congress, Prime Minister \nAllawi spoke of the challenges and continued progress in his country. \nHe offered eloquent words of gratitude for America liberating the Iraqi \npeople. I close today with a simple, but significant, statement that he \nmade without much notice or fanfare. In talking about Iraq he said:\n\n       We are fighting for freedom and democracy--ours and yours.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I believe I asked for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                               JOBS Bill\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I came to the floor because we are going \nto have a great deal of business in the final days of this legislative \nsession. Some of the legislation will be very significant. This is one \npiece of tax legislation that originally came out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the House Ways and Means Committee. It rests on all of \nour desks. It is a large unwieldy piece of legislation dealing with, in \nsome cases, arcane portions of our Tax Code.\n  There is much in this conference report on what is called the FSC/ETI \nbill, which is the shorthand way we talk around here. Others call it \nthe JOBS bill. There is much I commend, much that I support, and much \nthat I think represents good work. But I want to talk a moment about \nsome missed opportunities as well.\n  I am mindful of what Mark Twain once said. It is always easy to be \nnegative. Mark Twain once said, when asked if he would debate: Of \ncourse, if I can take the negative side.\n  They said: We haven't told you the subject.\n  He said: It doesn't matter, the negative side doesn't require \npreparation.\n  I am mindful of that when I am trying to pick apart some pieces of \nthis bill, but I think it is important to talk about missed \nopportunities at this late date.\n  I am going to vote for this bill, but I will tell you what is not in \nit and should be.\n  We are drowning in debt in this country. We have the largest budget \ndeficit in the history of America, and add to that the largest trade \ndeficit in the history of this country. We are neck deep in debt. We \nare spending money we do not have, in some cases on things we do not \nneed. We send our men and women to war and say, by the way, we will not \npay for that, we will have them pay for it when they come back. We are \ndrowning in debt.\n\n  One part of dealing with that debt in fiscal policy is to try to get \nthe revenue into the coffers of the Federal Government that is owed by \nthose who are required to pay taxes.\n  Let me describe a couple headlines from recent days:\n\n       House Negotiators Reject Tougher Tax Shelter Penalties.\n\n  Those House negotiators said: No, we do not want to get tough to shut \ndown tax shelters and tax dodgers. I am talking now about very large \ncorporations that make billions of dollars and decide they want to do \neverything they can do as an American citizen, except they do not want \nto pay taxes. They do not want the obligation of paying taxes.\n  Madam President, $40 billion would have been raised as a result of \nthe provision that was objected to by the House negotiators. That's $40 \nbillion saved in taxes that will not be paid by companies that should \nhave been full taxpayers.\n  October 7:\n\n       How Big Tax Shelters with Cities Shortchanges the Federal \n     Treasury.\n\n  This is about people buying a sewer system. Can you imagine someone \nwanting to own a sewer system? But cities are now selling their \nsubways, city hall, and the sewer system. Why? Because if they sell it \nto a corporation, a corporation can depreciate it, and then they can \neach share in the tax writeoff because a city does not have a tax write \noff because it is not taxable. So we see these things being sold to\n\n[[Page S10797]]\n\nprivate investors so that everybody wins, except the taxpayer loses, \nand our debt goes up and up because entities that should be paying \ntaxes are not.\n  Let me talk just for a moment about the issue of missed opportunities \nwith respect to runaway plants and moving American jobs overseas.\n  This morning there was an announcement about the number of jobs \ncreated in the last month. We need to create about 175,000 jobs a month \njust to keep pace with the increased population moving into the \nworkforce. This month it was only 96,000 new jobs, far short of what is \nnecessary just to keep pace with the new people coming into the \nworkforce.\n  Even as we struggled to create these new jobs, we have in place a \nprovision in this country's Tax Code that says to a company: Guess \nwhat. If you will just decide to move your jobs overseas, we will give \nyou a tax cut for doing it.\n  We will give you a big fat tax cut if you move your jobs overseas. \nNow, I cannot think of a more pernicious, obscene thing to do than to \nsay to American companies, move your jobs and we will give you a tax \ncut.\n  If some tax concessions are going to be given, give them to the \nbusinesses that create jobs and stay here, not to the businesses that \nfire their workers and move their jobs to China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, \nand Indonesia.\n  We voted on this provision and the Senate actually turned it down. \nSenator Mikulski and I offered an amendment that said let us shut down \nthis pernicious tax cut that says to people, move your job overseas and \nwe will give you a benefit. That, it seems to me, should have been a \nrevenue raiser in this bill.\n  Or how about the proposition of American companies that decide they \nwant to have all the benefits that accrue to being an American citizen \nas a corporation--because in law we say a corporation is a citizen, \nartificial citizenship. It can sue and be sued; contract and be \ncontracted with. It wants in some cases all of the opportunities of \ncitizenship in this country except for paying taxes. That is why we see \ncorporations that decide what they want to do is do their business \nthrough a post office box in the Cayman Islands. Why? Is that where \nthey run their company, from a post office box? No. What they want to \ndo is shelter their income from this country so they can have all the \nbenefits our country has to offer them but avoid paying U.S. taxes that \nare required.\n  Who then pays the taxes? Oh, it is just the working men and women who \nget up in the morning and dress and go to work all day. They do \neverything right, and at the end of the day they try to provide for \ntheir families and try to pay shelter and transportation, all the \nthings that are necessary to send their kids to school, pay for health \ncare, and then pay taxes as well.\n  It seems to me this is a terrible missed opportunity to shut down \naggressive tax shelters, to shut down the tax opportunities that have \ncome from tax haven subsidiaries of U.S. corporations.\n  I could go through a list of corporations. One corporation, for \nexample, set up 441 entities in the Cayman Islands alone. Yes, an \nAmerican corporation, an energy company, for example, set up 441 \nsubsidiaries in the Cayman Islands. Why? Because they do not want to \npay taxes.\n  The Halliburton Company has 17 tax haven subsidiaries, including in \nLiechtenstein--Panama, Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein. I would like to \nsee these shut down. If you are setting up circumstances where you are \ndoing business through a post office box in the Bahamas or the Cayman \nIslands or, yes, Liechtenstein, in order to avoid paying taxes, the \nnext time you get in trouble maybe you should call out the \nLiechtenstein Navy to protect you, or the Bahamian Navy. Someone told \nme the Bahamian Navy has 20 people.\n  These companies want all the benefits that can come to an American \ncitizen, but they do not want to pay their fair share of taxes. Again, \nwe have people who get up every morning in this country, they are good \ncitizens, pay their bills, and they pay their taxes, because they want \nto send their kids to the best schools, and they want to be able to \nhave affordable health care. They want to live in safe neighborhoods. \nThey want grandma and grandpa to have access to health care. They want \na good job that pays well. Instead, we have a tax system that says, oh, \nby the way, we will give you a tax cut to ship your job overseas and \noh, by the way, it is fine for you to access, even if you stay here, \ntax shelters so that if you make money, you do not have to pay, but \nyour workers do. Your workers should pay taxes, but you make $2 \nbillion, you do not have to pay. Do your business through a mailbox \nsomewhere.\n  These are enormous missed opportunities, and they are missed \nopportunities because, as this says--and this is why House negotiators \nreject tougher tax shelter penalties. What that means is a bunch of \npeople come to this conference and say, no, we want to protect these \nspecial deals, we do not want to close these loopholes. The fact is, \nthe American people deserve better. This country is drowning in debt.\n  People ask, how do you get a handle on the fiscal policy? The first \nthing you do is you stop this sort of nonsense. You stop subsidizing \njobs being exported overseas by American companies that are told by \nthis Government, shut down your plant and we will give you a tax cut if \nyou move your job overseas.\n  Yes, we voted on that in the Senate and it was voted down. Closing \nthat loophole was voted down in the Senate. My hope would have been \nwith the deficit growing worse and worse, that perhaps in conference, \nworking on this bill, we would have seen a conference that would have \nclosed these loopholes, closed these shelters, closed off the \nopportunities that result in such a massive amount of lost revenue to \nthe Federal Treasury at a time when we are deep in debt.\n  At a time as well when our country is reliant on about 60 percent of \nour oil from others around the world, it seems to me that we also \nmissed some opportunities to move aggressively in areas to make us more \nindependent with respect to our oil supply. It seems to me that when we \nhave a circumstance where we need additional energy and we reach for 60 \npercent of that oil from troubled parts of the world, it puts our \neconomy in great jeopardy. When we are talking about incentives for \nenergy production in this country, we could have done and should have \ndone much better. If we do not understand that the 60 percent reliance \non Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and, yes, Iraq, Venezuela, and Nigeria is \nvery troublesome to this country, then we do not understand very much.\n  I happen to think we are going to always continue to use fossil \nfuels--coal, oil, and natural gas. I also believe we ought to move \ntoward a hydrogen fuel cell future in which we stop putting gasoline \nthrough our carburetors; find an inexhaustible supply of energy such as \nhydrogen, which is ubiquitous and everywhere, and when you use a fuel \ncell hydrogen vehicle you put water vapor on the tailpipe, you have \ntwice the power to the wheel. What a remarkable future.\n  We will not get there because the energy companies, particularly many \nof them that have a vested interest in what we are doing now, do not \nwant to get there. There are some who are very excited about a new \nApollo project in which this country describes a completely new energy \nfuture. I would hope some of those incentives would have been in this \nbill, and they are not.\n  This legislation which is presented to us now over the weekend is \nlegislation that has a number of things that I believe moves us in a \ngood direction, a number of constructive things.\n  I will make one other point on tax shelters. My colleague Senator \nGrassley, for example, announced some long while ago that he was going \nto put a stop these phony lease transactions between cities and \ncompanies. Yet, the way this conference report comes out they actually \nwent easier on some of these transactions. The same is true with \nrespect to inversions.\n  Corporations that decide, we do not want to be American citizens \nanymore, we renounce our American citizenship, we want to become \ncitizens of the Bahamas. Why? I do not know. Sun, sand, good food. I do \nnot know. They want to become citizens of the Bahamas in order to avoid \npaying U.S. taxes so they do something called inversion, which is \nrenounce your citizenship.\n  There was a date set by my colleague Senator Grassley and his \ncounterpart and they said, beyond this date, understand you are in \njeopardy when you do\n\n[[Page S10798]]\n\nthis. Well, guess what. In this conference, they went a year forward \nfrom that date. I do not have the foggiest idea why they did that.\n  By the way, this is not a criticism of Senator Grassley because he \nhas been a leader in shutting down these abusive transactions. My \nassumption is that the House of Representatives came over once again \nand said, no, we cannot buy that.\n  It is unbelievable that corporations that want to renounce their \ncitizenship are given even an inch of ground by anybody in this \nChamber, let alone anybody in that conference. We ought to say, you \nwant to renounce your American citizenship in order to save on taxes? \nShame on you. You are not going to get tax benefits or tax savings from \nthis Tax Code, not from this Congress. You want to do what is called an \ninversion and renounce your American citizenship? Then this Congress is \nnot going to give you one cent of benefits in the Tax Code.\n  Yet regrettably, what has happened here is they have actually given \nanother year's flexibility to the companies that did that, a year \nbeyond the date in which my colleague--and good for him, Senator \nGrassley--said, here is the date.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Does it strike the Senator as odd and actually unjust \nthat the same bill that would push the date back for companies to go \nregister in the Bahamas--to give up their U.S. citizenship presumably \nbecause they think it is too hard for them to pay their taxes--in that \nsame bill, the men and women who are protecting the right of those \nbusinesses to make a profit and to benefit from the great riches of \nthis country were deprived of a tax credit? Does that strike the \nSenator as an odd way to either begin or end a session of the Congress?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute to answer \nmy colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me answer my colleague from Louisiana by saying of \ncourse it is absurd. Let me say it seems to me the first obligation in \nthis Congress is to make sure we are doing what we should do for those \nmen and women who, when called, left their homes, left their families, \nleft their jobs, and went to serve this country. It is unbelievable to \nme, some of the priorities that have been established around here.\n  I heard the Senator from Louisiana make the case earlier today. She \nis absolutely right about that. The soldiers she is talking about \nshould not be put at the end of the line. They ought to be at the front \nof the line when you talk about trying to do what is right in this \nbill. I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Louisiana on that \npoint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I am a little surprised to hear my \nfriend from North Dakota. This bill has been worked on for a long time \nhere. It passed this Senate with a great amount of support. There are \nsome things here that are very important that we are doing, and all I \nhear is talk about how bad it is. That is interesting.\n  I think it has a little to do with politics. There are some things on \nhere we ought to be talking about. Please remember why this bill was \noffered in the first place. We had a benefit that went to \nmanufacturers, a 3-percent reduction if they shipped overseas. What \nhappened is WTO, the World Trade Organization, said, That is not in \nkeeping with our rules, and they started to levy a penalty, each month, \nthat goes up to 17 percent. Something had to be done about that.\n  The Senator didn't bother to mention that. He didn't bother to \nmention all the good things that are on here. I don't know whether that \nis politics or whether they are trying to talk a little bit about the \nfacts. That would be a surprise.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for me to have an opportunity to \ntry to answer that just briefly?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Really, if you have a question, I will take that. \nOtherwise I think it is my turn to have the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. OK. I would just ask the Senator, did he know that at \nleast my remarks were not at all directed politically to this bill? The \nSenator is correct. Did he know that when the provision I spoke about \nearlier left the Senate floor, 100 percent of the Senators, including \nthe leadership of Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus, sent our bill \nover to the House saying, please put our troops at the top of the list \nif we are going to give out $137 billion? Did the Senator know they \ndidn't even come back in any part of the list? They are not on the \nlist. I just wanted to ask the Senator if he remembered that that was \nsomething we sent over.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Absolutely. There is no question. But this is the size of \nthe bill. There are thousands of things in there.\n  I am sorry. I agree with you. I was on the conference committee. We \nwent through this process. But it is the House and the Senate both. \nWhen you go through a conference committee you come out with some \nthings added and some things subtracted. I agree with the Senator and \nsupported what she is talking about. But that is not the whole issue in \nthis bill. This is a huge bill.\n  The other thing that seldom is mentioned is that this is revenue \nneutral over 10 years. There are offsets to these expenditures which I \nfeel very strongly about because I probably feel more strongly about \nthe deficit than the Senator from North Dakota. But this is revenue \nneutral. They took enough things out, and that is one of the reasons \nsome of the things are not in there that people would like in there, \nbecause they had to limit it to the amount of offsets they could find \nto make it work this way.\n  But what happened then is they took off this 3-percent addition that \nwent to manufacturers because the WTO opposed it and turned it around \nand gave that to all manufacturers, including people, for instance, who \nproduce oil and who produce coal. It broadened the definition of \nmanufacturers to where nearly every business in this country, \nthen, receives it.\n\n  We are talking about jobs numbers, which have grown pretty \nsignificantly. We are talking here about strengthening business to \ncreate jobs. Somehow we seem to forget that is where jobs come from, is \nby encouraging and giving incentives to businesses so they will invest \nand provide an opportunity to create jobs. That is what it is for. I \ndon't quite understand where the Senator thinks jobs come from unless \nit has to do with businesses that invest and create those jobs.\n  There are a great many things in there. Everyone could find something \nthey don't like. I thought it was perhaps a little overdone, frankly, \nin terms of some of the things that were there. I tried very hard to \nget the tax element of the Energy bill into the bill. We were not able \nto put that all in there. We did get some energy incentives here, \nhowever, which will help some. We all had some things.\n  There are some things that are particularly useful, just little \nthings that are kind of typical of the many issues that are in there.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMAS. When you have medical providers who go to underserved \nareas, they are given financial incentives to go, and in the past those \nincentives which caused them to go there were taxable. We were able to \ntake that taxable business out, so we will have more people willing and \nable to go to underserved areas--nurses, physicians, clinicians, and so \nforth.\n  I will certainly yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think the Senator was not in the Chamber when I began \nmy presentation. I did say I intend to vote for this. I said there is \nmuch in it that I commend and much that I support, including some of \nthe energy provisions that I believe you just mentioned. I was speaking \nspecifically only about the series of tax shelters representing, in my \njudgment, a missed opportunity.\n  But I think the Senator from Wyoming missed the opening comments of \nthis Senator. He probably missed that I did say there is much here to \ncommend, and I was speaking about what I think is a gross abuse, which \nwe call tax shelters, which we have to close, and I think most Members \nthink at some point we will have to close them.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I did not hear that. I continue to hear a lot of \ncomplaint and\n\n[[Page S10799]]\n\ncriticism when talking about spending when indeed it is revenue \nneutral, and the Senator didn't brother to mention that. Obviously in a \nbill this size there are a great many things you can talk about. \nObviously no one is going to agree with all of the hundreds of issues \nthat are there.\n  There are some really good things, some things I thought were \nparticularly good. For instance, ranchers who, because of the drought, \nhad to sell their herd and cattle, they don't have to pay on capital \ngains now for 4 years. It gives them a chance to get back without \nhaving to pay for that.\n  One of the fairness issues that is there is the idea that States that \ndo not have State income tax, which is deductible from the Federal \ntaxes, but indeed finance through sales taxes, can now deduct the sales \ntaxes, which makes it fair. States can choose to either have income \ntax, they can have sales tax, they can have both, and then they can \nhave one of the two of them deductible. In the past, sometimes, my \nState did not have a State income tax, but we had a sales tax and it \nwas not deductible. It will be now. That is a real incentive for people \nto be able to save some of the money they have.\n  We also had a provision in there that was put in that had to do with \nenlarging the loans that are available to small businesses from the \nGovernment. The limit was put in there in the 1970s. Of course, that \nhas changed a great deal. Here again, the purpose is to encourage \nbusinesses to build up so they can, in fact, hire people, and we do \nsomething for jobs.\n  There are a number of things here that are very good.\n  As I said, we need incentives for the small production oil wells. If \nyou have an oil well that does not produce a lot of oil, the fact is \nthere is an incentive in here for marginal wells--to have a production \ntax credit for electricity produced by renewable sources--geothermal, \nsolar energy, those kinds of things which we have been looking forward \nto in the energy package.\n  Obviously, I think anyone in effect can find some things in here that \nwouldn't be their choice. On the other hand, this is a jobs bill. It is \ndesigned to encourage the economy and create jobs. That is what it is \nall about.\n  I get a little concerned when we seem to direct more attention toward \nthe election which is coming up. I will be happy when that is over so \nwe can talk a little bit more about the merits of the issues. That is \nwhat we are here for. It would be a good idea if in fact that is what \nwe do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, is there a specific order under the \nunanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has up to 30 minutes of debate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to speak for the next 10 \nminutes, if I am not interrupting anyone's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, before the Senator from Wyoming \nleaves, I want to make a couple of comments regarding some of the \nthings he said. While some Members of this Senate intend to vote for \nthis bill, I am one who will not be voting for the bill. I would like \nto restate why.\n  There is only one reason, one specific reason, and I think one \ncompelling reason, that injustice was done in this bill after it left \nthe Senate, and that injustice was that the one provision which would \ngive direct tax relief to the men and women on the front lines, the \nGuard and Reserve fighting in Afghanistan, in Iraq, or whether it is \nNorth Korea, or South Korea, was left out of the bill.\n  We have a lot of bills, and not all of them are this fat, this full, \nand this expensive. This is $137 billion.\n  In 2 years, we negotiated between the House and the Senate. I know \nthe Senator from Wyoming is aware of this because he helped to put it \nin. But there was only one provision in this entire bill that would \nhave actually directed some modest tax relief to the men and women in \nthe Guard and Reserve. But for some reason--I am not sure if it was \npolitics, I am not sure if it was an election, I am not sure because I \nhave not gotten an answer yet from anyone about why it was left out. \nObviously, we had $137 billion to spend, and we spent it. We allocated \nit, but not for the Guard and Reserve.\n  We send the Guard and Reserve to the front lines. According to \nSecretary Rumsfeld, we sent 640,000 men and women, 5,000-plus from my \nState of Louisiana, to the front lines. We can't even send them with a \nfull paycheck.\n  Some of us thought, gee, if we have this tax bill going through, we \nhave to fix this problem with the World Trade Organization, and surely \nin the middle of this war at this time we could spend $2 billion to \ngive tax credit. If we didn't have the $2 billion, I certainly would \nnot have suggested that we spend it. But we have $137 billion in this \nbill.\n  I am confused. My constituents are confused. The men and women in the \narmed services are confused and their families are wondering and are \nvery puzzled: How could we possibly be giving away $137 billion to \nbusinesses here and abroad and leave them out?\n  I am going to stand here for a couple of days and talk about it. I \ndon't have an explanation for it. I don't want to go home because I \ndon't know what I would tell them.\n  When the Senator from Wyoming says it is politics involved in the \nopposition of this bill, I think that is a good question. I am not sure \nof the answer. But I would like to say it this way. Is politics in any \nway involved in the passage of this bill? This bill, $137 billion for \nevery corporation, or many corporations that you could think of, big \nones, little ones, ones that make ceiling fans, ones that operate horse \nracing--just go through it. I am not going to even comment about the \nbenefits of that. I don't want the reporters and the people following \nthis debate to say Senator Landrieu objects to anything in this bill \nexcept that the Guard and Reserve were left out. That is what I object \nto. I am not going to even talk about ceiling fans and horse racing, or \nshipbuilding, which happens in my State. There are lots of wonderful \nthings in this bill. My only question is, How could we possibly have \nthe nerve to pass a bill and leave the Guard and Reserve out?\n  According to the GAO, the men and women in the Guard and Reserve on \nthe front lines are taking a 41-percent pay cut.\n\n  You may say to me, Senator, they knew it when they signed up. Let me \nanswer that. They knew there would be sacrifice. These men and women \ndon't want a lot of pity or attention. They are happy to go. They want \nto go. They are proud to serve. I know many of them personally. I am \nproud of them. But I tell you what they did not know: They didn't know \nthat we--when I say ``we'', I mean this President, the former \nPresident, and the leadership of the Armed Services Committee--would \nmake a policy decision that would say that our Armed Forces, instead of \nrelying mostly on Active and a little bit on our Reserve, decided \nbecause it is less expensive we are going to rely more on our Reserve \nand a little less on our Active.\n  We didn't tell them that because they signed up 10 years ago and we \nhave been making these decisions in the last couple of years. They sign \nup. They weigh the pros and cons. They want to serve their country. \nThey are patriotic. They say, I will make the sacrifice. But then we \nchanged the rules on them. It is not their job to fix that. It is our \njob to fix it.\n  We had a bill coming along. It started 2 years ago. I thought: this \nis a perfect time to fix this situation. Here is the money. It is small \nbusinesses that are writing these checks to keep their pay whole, and \nsurely this country would find money in this bill to do this, and then \nwhatever else they want to do is fine with me. But, oh, no.\n  Let me make another point about what the Senator from Wyoming said. \nHe said something along the lines that jobs are created by tax cuts. We \nhave to have tax cuts for businesses to grow. I think that is partially \ncorrect. I don't think just any tax cut at any time makes business \ngrow, but I will give him that. But I will tell you what makes \nbusinesses in America grow. I will tell you what no business could \noperate without. I will tell you in large measure what this war is \nabout. It is about economic freedom. It is about global trade. It is \nabout peace in the world so people can make a profit. No business in \nthis bill could possibly function without the men and women\n\n[[Page S10800]]\n\nin the Active or Reserve units. They wouldn't exist. Yet we have this \nbill to help companies and businesses, and we can't help the men and \nwomen taking the bullets.\n  I am not voting for a bill like that. I urge my colleagues, if they \nhave decided how to vote, they might want to change their minds. I hope \nmaybe people listening in their States, and maybe some of the families \nwho have actually lost soldiers on the front lines might call their \nSenators, and say, Senator, if you do not mind, what Senator Landrieu \nis saying makes sense. Please don't leave me out of the bill. You put \nme in the war. Don't leave me out of the bill. You put me in the \nphotograph, don't leave me out of the budget.\n  I will say one more thing before my 10 minutes is up.\n  I know something else about military families, and it is what I love \nabout them the most. They never even want attention. I have had a \nlittle bit of a difficult time getting some of the families to call me. \nDo you know why? Because these men and women understand what sacrifice \nis all about. They didn't sign up to get rich. They didn't sign up to \nget an award. They don't really advertise their bravery every day, not \nlike some people around here who cannot wait to show their awards off, \net cetera. The men and women in uniform don't do that. So it is hard \nfor them to ask.\n\n  I want them to know it is my job as their Senator to ask for them and \nto fight for them. I don't blame them for not wanting to have their \nnames used. They want to feel self-reliant. But I will be darned if I \nwill sit here and watch this $137 billion get out of this Chamber and \nleave them behind.\n  My colleagues, we are going to be here for a long weekend because I \nhave a lot of things to say about this. My time now is up, but I am not \ngoing far. I don't live far from here. I am back and forth from \nLouisiana, and the house I live in when I am here is four blocks away, \nso I am not far away. I would stay here for many days to talk about it.\n  Members in this Chamber feel very strongly about their Guard and \nReserve. They know the sacrifices they are making and a mistake was \nmade. Mistakes can be corrected.\n  At 6 o'clock today I am delivering a letter to the White House. I \nwill read it before 6 o'clock in the Senate. It is being delivered to \nthe President. It is assumed in the letter that he didn't know about \nthis personally, that it was just something that did not come to his \nattention. But he has the power as the President to fix it, and I hope \nthat he will take that action.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I hope the Senator's \ntime--I make it clear that under the consent that the Senator's time, \nhowever much time he uses, be counted as running with the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, it is.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Iowa for clarifying that.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  We are here today at the end of the session. We have some important \nlegislation yet to act on: this legislation that deals with the \neconomic health of this country; it is legislation that deals with the \nsecurity of this country. We have been working all session on these two \nissues primarily, with a plethora of other issues, but we do have some \nvery important bills. The FSC/ETI bill is important, obviously, to \nsustaining and continuing the economic growth. We have the intelligence \nbill, the conference report. That is important for the security of this \ncountry. We have the Department of Defense authorization bill, which we \nare still waiting to get passed out of the Senate, the conference \nreport to that. That is also very important.\n  I will talk a little bit about our economy because today an economic \nreport came out. When we look at this economic report with all that has \nbeen happening through 2004, I don't see how anyone can deny this has \nnot been a good year for America's economy.\n  I think back a little bit when President Bush was elected President \nand what kind of economy he inherited from the Clinton administration. \nThe economy was going down. It was not doing well. As a result of that, \nthe President decided to address the economic growth of this country \nand put in place tax cuts that did make a difference. There were 3 \nyears of tax cuts put in place that took the burden of government off \nof the people of this country, and they produced.\n  The sector of this economy that produces more jobs than any other is \nthe small business sector. I know because I came from that sector. As a \nveterinarian, I had my own veterinarian practice, my small business, \nand I know how taxes can impact the bottom line of the business and how \nit can affect whether you have any capital remaining to buy new \nequipment. A lot of new ideas, or creation, comes out of small \nbusiness, and too much regulation has an impact.\n  In some ways, with the security challenges this country has faced, we \nhave had to put in rules and regulations for business to be able to \nsustain their growth and create jobs.\n  The real choice we have is to do something about the tax burden. It \nhas been working. I will share some of those figures that came out \ntoday.\n  America's economy is doing much better than just good. It has been \ndoing really good. Since August of 2003, more than 1.5 million jobs \nhave been created; 1.3 million jobs in 2004 alone. The unemployment \nrate of 5.4 percent today is well above the average employment rate of \nthe 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s. For the last 12 months, the \nAmerican economy has grown faster than the economy of any major \nindustrial nation.\n  Today's Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics report, \nwhich, by the way, measures payroll--that is an important distinction \nthat I will talk about later--according to that report, the economy \nadded 96,000 new payroll jobs in September, continuing an upward trend \nin job creation. Employment gains over the last 4 months totaled more \nthan 405,000, and this year the economy has added an average of 170,000 \njobs per month. Manufacturers have increased hiring in 6 of the last 9 \nmonths and are responsible for more than 70,000 jobs so far this year. \nAnd we still have October, November, and December to go.\n  Unemployment remains steady at 5.4 percent, exactly where it was when \nPresident Clinton was reelected in 1996. Unemployment peaked more than \na year ago in June of 2003 at 6.3 percent, and the labor force has \nincreased by almost 950,000. The overall number of unemployed has \nfallen dramatically by 1.2 million since June of 2003. The economic \npolicy of this President, what we have been doing in Congress, has been \nworking.\n\n  I will take a little time and talk about the other survey that we \nhave out there, the household survey. There are some remarkable things \nhappening in the household survey. It has increased more than 2.2 \nmillion since April of 2003. Those are fantastic figures. They reflect \nthe self-employed. They reflect people who work on a part-time basis. \nThey reflect people who work out of their homes for various reasons--\nmaybe they have a high-tech business and work through eBay to market \nsome products that they have available, or perhaps they are real estate \nsalesmen who have been working out of their home. This gets measured in \nthe household survey.\n  The household survey measures much more of our economy than just the \nlabor payroll report. That is exciting. During those times when we had \nsome layoffs in the high-tech industry and went through the high-tech \nslump, people who lost those jobs said, we are getting some bonuses \nbecause when they were asked to leave the company they frequently gave \nthem a bonus and they took some of the money to start their own \nbusiness.\n  The most logical place to start a small business is out of your home \nif you can make it work. That is where most of them started their \nbusiness. You keep your overhead down. You have a phone, you can hook \nit to the phone line. You can work out of there. What little money you \nearn you can put it back in the business or put it aside and hopefully \nbuy more equipment and maybe move into a larger\n\n[[Page S10801]]\n\nbuilding at some point in time when that business takes off and begins \nto operate.\n  So I think it is important to point out that the payroll numbers, as \nstrong as they are, do not reflect the growth of self-employment. \nAccording to the household survey, employment has increased by more \nthan 2.2 million, as I said earlier, since April 2003. Again, these are \nfabulous figures. It reflects the ingenuity of a small businessperson \nwho decides he wants to go out there and apply the American dream. He \nwants to start his own business. He wants to be self-employed. He wants \nto be independent. And he wants to be his own boss.\n  I think America is on the right track.\n  Now, the National Bureau of Economic Research determined that the \nlatest recession ended in November of 2001, well after this President \nwas sworn into office. Today's numbers are further evidence that the \ndoom and gloom of those challenging the policies of this President is \nsimply unfounded.\n  We have created and we are witnessing the impact of policies that \nencourage growth. What did we do? We lowered tax rates on personal \nincome for all taxpayers. The top marginal rate was reduced from 39.6 \npercent to 35 percent, and a 10-percent bracket was introduced. Where \ndid the real impact of this fall? It fell on small businesses in this \ncountry. It helped them grow and prosper. It helped them create a lot \nof the figures you are seeing out of the household survey--favorable \nfigures, fabulous figures, I might add.\n  We lowered taxes on business investment, including a much lower tax \nrate, 15 percent, on dividends and on long-term capital gains. Of great \nimportance is the tax cuts allowed businesses to more quickly deduct \nthe expenses of their investments in machinery, computers, and \nsoftware. American companies have responded by employing more people \nand investing more money in equipment and facilities. And in what part \nof the business sector will you see most of that happening? You will \nsee it happening in the small business sector.\n  Now, small businesses, they can be organized in a number of different \nways. They can be organized as individual entrepreneurs. They can be \norganized as partnerships, various legal organizations. Family \nbusinesses will even incorporate. Professionals like myself, we have \nprofessional corporations that we organize in. So when we talk about \nseparating business out into various sectors, no matter how you do it, \nsomehow you are going to affect the small business community, where we \nsee most of our economic growth.\n  So we have to be careful about attacking corporations and attacking \nbusinesses in general because they do create the jobs in this economy. \nThey create employment. They are what America is all about; that is, \nthe principle of free enterprise and people holding their own property \nand being able to move themselves up in society.\n  Another thing that happened to help keep our economy moving was the \nincreased child tax credit from $500 to $1,000 per child. We also ended \nthe marriage penalty. Married couples no longer pay higher taxes than \nequivalent singles, which eliminates a perverse incentive against \nmarriage.\n  We also repealed the estate tax. Probably the most unfair tax we have \nin this country is the estate tax because the estate tax has been taxed \nonce already, and sometimes taxed twice, and then when you die it \nbecomes a death tax and you have to pay again.\n\n  When a family, a small business family in many cases, is struggling \nto try to get that small business to sustain itself during an untimely \ndeath in the family, then along comes the estate tax and whacks that \nfamily hard. Many times these are farmers and ranchers who have been \nstruggling to try to save their farm or ranch. In States such as \nColorado, where we are getting a lot of rapid growth, there is a demand \nfor real estate, and many times these farmers and ranchers are forced \nto sell to developers or somebody else who is going to use that land \nfor something else other than the production of crops and livestock. \nThe end result is, we lose an opportunity to have an open space \navailable in States like Colorado where there is a desire to have a \nconsiderable amount of open space.\n  Home ownership is at an alltime high. I am pleased to be able to join \nwith the President in putting forth the American Dream Downpayment Act, \nwhere we provide some well-deserved dollars to people, first-time home \nbuyers, in this country. This is for people who have been paying rent \nwho could be owning the same type of dwelling except that the only \nproblem keeping them out of their own house, their own personal \ndwelling, is the fact that they cannot make the downpayment. So this \npiece of legislation was desired to help those individuals. By the way, \nmany of them are minorities. As a result of that act, we are beginning \nto see a lot of growth in home ownership, and particularly among \nminorities it is getting much better.\n  There are a lot of positive effects that happen with home ownership. \nThe children tend to be better educated. They become better citizens in \ntheir communities. They tend to be more stable. They are not moving \naround as much. They care; they take an active role in what is \nhappening in their community.\n  Home ownership is another good story that is coming out of this \nadministration. Sometimes I just do not think we talk enough about it, \nbut it is important. It is important to communities, and it is \nimportant to families.\n  So I summarize and say the good news today is something we need to \nwork hard to sustain. It is important we draw this session to a close. \nWe have some important pending legislation. We need to get that passed \nbecause it will help contribute to the continued growth of this country \nas far as the economy is concerned. It will help to continue to make \nAmerica more secure, and it will help because we need to have a strong \ndefense for this country.\n  Today's numbers, again, are good news, part of a healthy, steady \ntrend of growth and prosperity.\n  I yield back my time, Mr. President.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                               Tax Relief\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thought I would take the next 15 \nminutes or so to review a couple points about the tax relief bill we \nare considering adopting. There are three or four major pieces of \nlegislation that the Senate is trying to finish in the next couple of \ndays. One of them is the reorganization of homeland security and the \nIntelligence Committee. One of them is the tax relief bill that we have \nbeen working on for 2 years. There are other issues that this Congress \nis struggling to get finished in the next few days, but the most \nimportant issue to me and the one I would like to spend a bit of time \ntalking about now is the tax relief bill that was put together by many \nof us, or tried to be put together by many of us, over the last 2 \nyears.\n  That started out for a very good purpose and a very good reason \nbecause there was a trade decision made by the WTO that called into \nquestion the legitimacy of some part of our Tax Code relative to \ncertain businesses.\n  We had to take some action or our businesses would have been fined \nthrough the WTO because the European Union had prevailed in their \nargument. So our tax writers got busy and tried to fix that. We need to \nfix it. But what has happened is, we have done more than fix. We have \nreally messed up some things. Unfortunately, inexplicably, and as a \ngrave injustice, we didn't take care of our men and women in uniform. \nFor the men and women who are taking care of us on the front lines and \nsuffering pay reductions, we are letting pass the opportunity to make \ntheir paychecks whole. I am going to spend a few hours over the next \ncouple of days talking about that. Before I do, let me share a fact \nthat maybe some might not realize. We have always had men and women in \nour Guard and Reserve units supplementing our Active Forces. But never \nin the history of this country have we relied on the Guard and Reserve \nto the extent we are today.\n  Let me share that in the Berlin crisis of 1961, we called up 148,000 \nreservists;\n\n[[Page S10802]]\n\nin the Cuban missile crisis, we called up 14,000; in the Vietnam war, \nwe called up 37,000--for a total of almost 200,000 from 1953 to 1989.\n  You can see from this chart that just in the last 12 years, in the \nPersian Gulf War, the invasion in Haiti, the Bosnia peacekeeping, \nOperation Southern Watch, which is ongoing, the Kosovo conflict, and \nIraq and Afghanistan--and this list is not completely up to date--we \nhave called out 364,000 guardsmen and reservists to supplement our \nActive Forces, to protect this country, to defend this country. These \ntroops have been willing to go at great sacrifice, but the least we \ncould do is keep their paychecks whole. The least we could do, if we \nare giving out tax credits and tax cuts to other people, is include \nthem in the bill. This conference report that this Senate is \nconsidering over the next couple of days, $137 billion, left them \ncompletely out.\n  We talk about helping small business. This is a picture of one of our \nsoldiers. We left them out but we put in ceiling fans. I know people \nare not going to believe this, because it is hard to believe. But the \nguardsmen and reservists and their employers who keep their paychecks \nwhole while they are on the front lines so they can pay their \nmortgages, pay their car notes, continue to contribute to their \nchildren's college trust fund, or just keep their household together, \nthe employers of this country, small employers and large employers, are \ndoing the right thing, the patriotic thing, not mandated by the \nGovernment but out of their own good heart, digging deep, keeping those \nmen and women on the front line with a full paycheck.\n  We had the opportunity to give them a modest tax credit so they could \nkeep that paycheck whole and hire a temporary worker to take the spot \nof that guardsman or that reservist who went overseas to protect us. \nAnd we couldn't find one line, one paragraph, not one word in a $137 \nbillion tax relief bill for every conceivable commercial, industrial, \nor manufacturing interest in the country, for our guardsmen and \nreservists.\n  I want to show you the state of our Active Reserve. Sometimes \npictures help us to understand. I know this subject can be complicated, \nbut it is actually very simple. We just didn't put our Guard and \nReserve in the $137 billion tax bill. We put everybody else in, but we \nleft them out. I am going to stand here until I get an answer why.\n  In 1940, at the height of the Second World War in the 1940s, this was \nthe Army troop strength. This is where we had to go in the Second World \nWar to defend. This is in the thousands, so it was 600,000 to defend \nour Nation. Because we, of course, won that war, won the Cold War, \ndefeated communism, we have dropped the active strength force of our \ntroops down to probably the lowest level since 1942. What fills this \ngap is our Guard and Reserve that are called up when we need them.\n\n  When September 11 hit, we needed them and we called them. And they \nwent. And 41 percent of them are going with a pay cut. Some of us got \ntogether, Republicans and Democrats on the Senate side, Chairman \nGrassley and our ranking member, Senator Baucus from Montana, and fixed \nthat. Since we have a big, fat tax bill going through, couldn't we \npossibly give a little bit of money to the businesses that are keeping \nthose paychecks whole, filling the gap, giving us extra strength, \nActive and Reserve, to protect us?\n  But for some reason, once the bill left here and got over to the \nHouse Republican leadership, it got taken out.\n  I know Senator Byrd is here to speak so I will wrap up my comments in \njust 5 minutes. I know he wants to speak, perhaps a little about this \nand other subjects. But I want to say a few things that the newspapers \nare saying about this bill.\n  Let me be clear. I don't oppose this bill for any other reason other \nthan the fact that the $2.4 billion tax benefit to employers for the \nGuard and Reserve to help keep their paychecks whole while they are on \nthe front line was left out. There are other provisions of this bill \nthat are questionable. There are other important issues that have been \nraised by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. McCain from Arizona, and the \nSenator from Massachusetts. Those are legitimate arguments as well.\n  But leaving the Reserve and the Guard out and their patriotic \nemployers is more than I can bear to be silent about.\n  This is some of what some of our newspapers are saying about the \ngeneral bill.\n  The Washington Post, October 8:\n\n       The bill is aimed at ending a transatlantic trade war by \n     scrapping certain illegal tax subsidies for U.S. exporters \n     that have brought on retaliatory action by Europe. But in the \n     version approved last night by the House, that modest goal is \n     largely overwhelmed in a preelection package of benefits for \n     dozens of constituencies, including NASCAR track owners and \n     mall builders.\n\n  That is the opinion of the newspaper. Again, I don't know if the \nNASCAR track people are deserving or not. Many people enjoy NASCAR in \nmy State. Maybe they are. But I can promise you that nobody in my State \nthinks NASCAR owners or investors or ceiling fan importers deserve a \ntax break more than the employers who are keeping whole the paychecks \nof our men and women on the front line. I can promise you that--not a \none. I don't know of a business or a mall or a retail establishment \nthat thinks they should get in line before the Guard and the Reserve.\n  It was a long line. This is what I call a long line. This is not a \nthin bill. This is not a one-page bill. This is a lot of lines and a \nlong line. They didn't even get in the middle of the line. They didn't \nget in the end of the line. They didn't get in at all. It is a grave \ninjustice.\n  The New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, \nand the Las Vegas Journal have all editorialized against this bill for \ndifferent reasons. I am hoping that many of these newspapers and others \nthat are listening will begin to focus on this issue as to a reason why \nwe should vote against this bill, send it back to conference, redo it.\n  We all make mistakes. This was a big mistake the House Republican \nleadership made. I say basically this is a paycheck that we send to our \nsoldiers. Their average pay is $30,000. According to our own report, \nthese soldiers are getting a 41-percent pay cut. We could have done \nsomething to help them, but we chose not to. So I am going to vote \nagainst this bill. I know other Senators are joining me in letters \nbeing sent to the conferees, which evidently did not make an impression \non them--at least not to the point where they kept our provision in. \nThat was passed by 100 votes here, Republicans and Democrats, and it \nwould be paid for with an offset. We didn't ask for this provision to \nbe included without paying for it. It is even paid for. But they \ndecided--the leadership, Chairman Thomas and, I guess, Congressman \nDeLay and Speaker Hastert--we could not afford it.\n  Let me again say for the record that there is $137 billion in this \nbill. The bill started out as being a $50 billion fix over 10 years. \nThat was the cost of fixing the problem we originally started to \ncorrect. It grew and grew and grew. Everyone, it seems, was added in, \nexcept the men and women who are taking the bullets morning, noon, and \nnight.\n  It is hard for me to go back to Louisiana and explain this. I am not \nsure I could explain it adequately to the 5,000 families who are \ncurrently serving on the front lines. Why should they pour a little \nwater into the cereal bowl, as one woman wrote to me, trying to make \nends meet? Why did some of them lose their houses because their notes \npile up and they cannot pay the bill when they get home? What could we \nbe thinking as to the justice of losing an automobile, losing their \nretirement, losing their college benefit, or having to make them \nstretch and sacrifice when we could help them? If we could not afford \nit, if we didn't have the money, that would be one thing. This is $137 \nbillion. Why could we not have given them $1 billion, or $2 billion, or \nhalf a billion? Or even if you could not give them the money, write \nsomething in the bill, for Heaven's sake, and tell them you understand \nthey have a 41-percent pay cut and you are sorry you cannot fix it \ntoday, but when we get another bill, we will try later.\n  Not even a comment.\n  When they go off to war, they don't make a lot of comments to us \neither, other than I am going to my post, I am going to do my job; I \nwill see you when I get back. Take care of my family. That is all they \nsay to us. We could not even get a paragraph of gratitude in this bill.\n\n[[Page S10803]]\n\n  Senator Byrd is going to speak. I will speak a few more times this \nweekend about this. I am doing as many interviews as I can, explaining \nthis to people and handing out material. I am still waiting for \nChairman Thomas to either write me, send me a note, write a letter, \nmake a comment in the newspaper, or meet me for a debate about why he \ntook them out of the bill in the middle of the night, when the cameras \nwere not on, and there is virtually no record of the discussion. I \ndon't know. The people in my State would like to know.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to an hour under the \ncloture rules.\n\n\n                   another white house excuse for war\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator who is \npresiding over the Senate with a degree of dignity, poise, collection, \nand composure, as it is so rare today. I thank Senator Burns.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator who has been speaking, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana. She tells a story that many of my Guardsmen and \nReservists and their families can also relate to. I compliment her on \nstanding on the floor. She has courage and determination. When she says \nshe is going to stay here until she gets some satisfaction from other \nSenators, she means that. I know that. I thank her for her kind \nreference to me.\n  I will not speak longer than 15 minutes, after which the Senator may \nresume if she so desires.\n  On Wednesday, October 6, the Senate Armed Services Committee received \ntestimony from the top CIA weapons inspector in Iraq. The report of \nCharles Duelfer explains in precise detail the facts that the American \npeople have long ago realized: that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of \nmass destruction, and that Iraq never posed an imminent threat to the \nUnited States. I said that at the beginning, before we voted on that \nnefarious resolution on October 11, 2002, to shift the power to declare \nwar, which is set forth in the Constitution very clearly, as being \nreposed here in the Congress of the United States; instead, to shift \nthat power to the hands of a President. How shameful. How shameful that \nwe turned our backs--the Senate and House collectively--on the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  The fact that weapons of mass destruction have not been found in Iraq \nis nothing new. Our military has been on the hunt for banned Iraqi \nweapons since March 19, 2003, when President Bush ordered the invasion \nof Iraq under his nefarious doctrine of preemption--preemptive war--a \ndoctrine that squarely contradicts the constitutional powers given in \nthe Constitution as having been reposed in this body and in the other \nbody across the way. The CIA conducted its own extensive search for \nmore than a year. Did anything turn up? No. No stockpiles of dangerous \ngerms, no warehouses of poison gases, no nuclear weapons.\n  They say, well, Saddam Hussein has used these on his own people. Of \ncourse, he had some years before. I can understand how many Senators \nwere misled by the statements of the administration and, in particular, \nthe statements of the President and the Vice President and others on \nthe President's team.\n  In fact, the CIA report finds that the truth on the ground in Iraq \nwas almost the exact opposite of what the White House had claimed in \nthe runup to the war. Contrary to the President's statement, the CIA \nreport says that Saddam had no active WMD programs, and he didn't have \neven so much as a plan to restart them. Despite the Vice President's \ninsinuations, the CIA found no secret plans for Iraq to attack the \nUnited States. Despite the National Security Adviser's warnings of \nmushroom clouds, the CIA found that Iraq's nuclear weapons program was \ndormant and decaying.\n  Now, the White House is desperately trying to have their spin machine \ngenerate a new reason for the war. We have seen a litany of reasons as \ntime has ensued following March 19, 2003--a litany of reasons. When one \nreason was shot down, when one reason proved to be wrong, the White \nHouse always came up with another reason, another reason, another \nreason we sent our men and women to war, the first war fought under the \npernicious doctrine of preemption, the Bush doctrine of preemption. And \nregardless of how many times the President may seek to salve the \nconscience of his administration, the fact remains that Saddam Hussein \nwas not an immediate, imminent threat to the security of the United \nStates. I said so at that time. It was the wrong war at the wrong time \nin the wrong place, and I will say that again and again.\n\n  The President, on his way to a campaign stop in Wisconsin, has tried \nto gloss over the collapse of his central reasons for a preemptive war. \nAccording to the Associated Press, the President said:\n\n       The Duelfer report showed that Saddam was systematically \n     gaming the system, using the U.N. Oil for Food Program to try \n     to influence countries and companies in an effort to \n     undermine sanctions.\n\n  So does the President mean to say he launched this war to stop waste, \nfraud, and abuse in a U.N.-run humanitarian program? Does the President \nmean to say that Saddam Hussein's greed was the reason that 225,000 \nAmerican troops were sent overseas, away from their families, their \nloved ones, and their communities, to attack Iraq? Are we to believe \nthat the President now seeks, once again, to justify his war against \nIraq because Saddam was cheating the Oil for Food Program? Is that the \nreason we sent our men and women to war? Mr. President, unbelievable, \nunbelievable, incredible. Too bad that the White House does not hold \nHalliburton to the same standard.\n  The truth is that the President changes his reasons for the war more \noften than he changes his socks. On March 19, 2003, the day he sent \nAmerican troops into battle--many of them never again to return to \ntheir homes, their families, their native soil--the President said:\n\n       The people of the United States and our friends and allies \n     will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens \n     the peace with weapons of mass murder. We will meet that \n     threat now with our Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and \n     Marines so that we do not have to meet it later with armies \n     of firefighters and police and doctors on the streets of our \n     cities.\n\n  I have heard that so many times. The President did not say a peep--\nnot a peep--about the Oil for Food Program on the day he ordered our \nbrave men and women to march on Baghdad. Talk about flip-flops. Yet \ndespite all that has gone wrong in Iraq--the failure to find weapons of \nmass destruction, the failure to stabilize postwar Iraq, the failure to \nshare the burdens of occupation with our allies, the failure to equip \nour soldiers with the body armor they need, and the deaths of 1,061 \nAmerican troops as of my last reading of the press the President \nmaintains that he would do everything the same if he had to do it over \nagain.\n  Well, I hope not, and I hope the Senate of the United States would \nnot do the same thing it did before if it had to do it over again. I \nspoke out against that nefarious, terrible action, sending our men and \nwomen to their deaths in Iraq, in a foreign land, spilling their blood \nin the hot sands of the Middle East. For what? For what?\n  The President maintains he would do everything the same if he had to \ndo it over again. Maybe he would. Surely he should learn from what has \nalready happened. The American people might not stand again for that.\n\n  Mr. President, the fog of war is beginning to lift and for the first \ntime, the American people are beginning to see the war in Iraq on clear \nterms. As cruel as Saddam Hussein was to the Iraqi people, he was no \nimminent threat to the American people. That is why we went to war. \nThat is why this administration led this country into a war against a \nnation that had not provoked us, had not attacked our country. That was \nthe Bush doctrine, and it is the Bush war.\n  Saddam Hussein had no links to the 9/11 attacks, and yet a majority \nof the American people I noticed in some polls not too long ago, \nbelieved at the time the polls were taken that many or, indeed, most of \nthe attackers, most of the hijackers on 9/11 were from Iraq. That is \nnot the case. Not one, not a single one of those 19 hijackers was from \nIraq, and yet this administration would like to have the American \npeople believe that it was otherwise.\n\n[[Page S10804]]\n\n  I guess they lie awake at night concocting new ways in case this \nfails, in case it is shown to be wrong: Where is the next fallback? \nWhat do we fall back on next? Iraq was not the central front of the war \non terrorism until President Bush invaded and unleashed a firestorm of \nanti-American sentiment.\n  The President's postwar strategy has been a failure. The President's \nhandpicked envoy to run postwar Iraq, Ambassador Bremer, said there \nwere never enough troops to stabilize Iraq. The President himself, in a \nrare acknowledgment of fallibility, admitted on August 27, 2004, that \nhe had miscalculated the danger of postwar Iraq. Yet the President \nstill has no exit strategy for Iraq. How long will the American people \nhave to wait to hear from this President and this administration an \nexit strategy? How long will we have to wait for a plan from this \nadministration to bring our men and women home with honor?\n  The White House still refuses to acknowledge that Iraq has been \nturned into an international basket case due to an unprovoked and \nunjustified war. Instead, the White House has paralyzed our military, \nhas paralyzed our diplomacy and our allies by maintaining we must \ncontinue to stay the course. Stay what course? Keep on with the same? \nMr. President, 1,061 dead and counting, and we are supposed to stay the \ncourse? What our Iraq policy needs is change, not more of the same.\n  The original rationale for preemptive war against Iraq has collapsed. \nThe CIA's new report on the absence of weapons of mass destruction is \nthe final nail in the coffin of the administration's prewar claims. How \nlong will the American people be content with a President who refuses \nto acknowledge the disaster caused by his doctrine of preemptive war? \nHow many more American men and women will have to shed their blood in \nthe hot sands of the Middle East? How long will our troops struggle \nagainst a tide, the increasing tide of violent anti-Americanism that \nthis terrible misbegotten war has spawned? How long will the United \nStates of America be tied down in a Middle Eastern country while other \nthreats at home--here at home--go unaddressed? How long, Mr. President? \nHow long?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                       Business is Doing its Part\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes. I see \nother colleagues on the Senate floor. I will take the 10 or 12 minutes \nI have remaining, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor the kind words he spoke before he made the very important points he \nhas made this evening and throughout the course of actually the last \nfew days. The challenge we face in Iraq is the most important issue \nbefore our country. I thank him for his kind words, and I want to thank \nhim for his continued leadership.\n  As we get toward these evening hours, I remind my colleagues--\n  Mr. BYRD. If the distinguished Senator would yield, let me thank her \nfor her most charitable comments concerning this Senator. She graces \nthe Senate from the great State of Louisiana. She does her work. She is \ndeeply dedicated. She is on the Appropriations Committee, on which I \nhave had the good fortune to serve for many years. I thank her for what \nshe is doing for her people. I thank her for what she is saying on the \nSenate floor. I thank her very much. I appreciate it. I appreciate the \nfact that she is my colleague and shares the concerns of my people in \nwhat she is saying today.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. My colleague is so right that the \nmen and women of West Virginia have served so bravely and so willingly, \nas so many people from our States have served in the Active Forces and \nin the Reserve and the Guard and, as I said earlier in my remarks, do \nso without the expectation of fanfare. They do not want awards. They do \nnot even want that special attention in their communities because they \nare so proud to serve and they are so willing to serve. That is what \nmakes me want to stay on this Senate floor even more for them, knowing \nthat about these families.\n  I will read a few things into the Record during the 10 minutes that I \nhave to build this argument and get out these facts about this \nimportant issue. One of the three or four important pieces of \nlegislation we are trying to make decisions about in the last 2, 3, 4 \ndays of this Congress is whether this bill, which is called the FSC \nbill--it is a tax cut bill which modifies many sections of the Tax \nCode--should pass or if it should not. I am going to vote against it \nbecause the Guard and Reserve were left out. The people on the front \nlines taking the bullets, taking the cut in pay to serve us, and \nrisking their lives were in the bill when it left the Senate, but \nbecause of the House leadership they were left out.\n  This bill is $137 billion, and if we could not afford $2 billion of \nthis $137 billion for them, then I do not know what we can afford \nbecause none of us would be here without them and none of the \nbusinesses benefiting from this bill would be able to actually operate, \nfunction, have a license, or have the freedom to function or enjoy the \nfree enterprise system that has been created over 220 years without the \nmen and women in the armed services.\n  Some of us were silly enough to believe that in a bill that was $137 \nbillion, they could get in at the top of the list, but we were mistaken \nbecause they did not even make the cut.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Officer, Dec. 2003]\n\n                         Employer Support Grows\n\n       ``I know of no other time in our nation's history when so \n     many employers have voluntarily offered this level of support \n     and benefits,'' Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld wrote \n     in September to employers of Reservists and National Guard \n     members called to active duty in the global war on terrorism.\n       In his open letter of thanks and praise, Mr. Rumsfeld \n     expressed ``the deepest appreciation of this department and \n     the United States government for your unswerving support of \n     our nation's military.'' His letters were sent 29 September \n     2003 to directors of major employer associations and \n     government agencies who are asked to then distribute them to \n     their members.\n       Many employers ``did more than was required by law by \n     voluntarily offering continued benefits, pay differentials, \n     and additional, creative forms of family support, which made \n     the period of separation so much easier to bear,'' Mr. \n     Rumsfeld noted. He said that without the continued support, \n     ``we could not maintain a strong military or sustain the \n     current effort to overcome the international terrorist threat \n     directed at our country, our citizens, and all who love \n     freedom.''\n       In concluding, the Secretary of Defense wrote: ``You have \n     my deepest thanks. Your direct contributions and support are \n     another illustration of America's greatness as a nation.''\n       Since 11 September 2001, that employer support has been \n     extended to more than 350,000 Reservists and Guard members \n     who have been mobilized and demobilized. This commitment is \n     documented in the charts on the pages that follow, \n     summarizing corporate policy for 185 of the Fortune 500 \n     companies when Reservist/Guard employees are called to \n     emergency active duty. Replies represent 112 new responses \n     (compared with 91 last year) adn 73 repeats from previous \n     years. On the charts, as well as in this article, asterisks \n     indicate responses from last year or two years ago. For many \n     companies, policies represent upgrades since 9/11 and are \n     usually for implementation during the period of the terrorist \n     threat.\n       Of the 185 companies listed, 19 provide full salary; 17 \n     provide salary plus differential; 137 provide differential; \n     nine provide no salary or differential; and three reply \n     either vaguely or ``do not participate in surveys.''\n\n\n                          companies that lead\n\n       From among the 19 where full salary is provided, companies \n     that lead the way are #26 J.P.

This is from ``Citizen-Soldiers and the Fortune 500. \nEmployer Support Grows.'' The article reads:\n\n       ``I know of no other time in our nation's history when so \n     many employers have voluntarily offered this level of support \n     and benefits,'' Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld wrote \n     in September to employers of Reservists and National Guard \n     members called to active duty in the global war on terror.\n\n  In his open letter of thanks and praise, Mr. Rumsfeld expressed the \ndeepest appreciation of his Department and the U.S. Government for \n``your unswerving support of our nation's military.'' His letters were \nsent on 29 September to directors of major employer associations and \nGovernment agencies that were asked to distribute them to their members \nso their members would know of the good works and good words of \nSecretary Rumsfeld.\n  His letter went on to say:\n\n       Many employers did more than was required by law by \n     voluntarily offering continued benefits, pay differentials, \n     and additional, creative forms of family support, which made \n     the period of separation so much easier to bear, Mr. Rumsfeld \n     noted. He said that without the continued support, we could \n     not maintain a strong military or sustain the current effort \n     to overcome the international terrorist threat directed at \n     our country, our citizens, and all who love freedom.\n\n  Those are beautiful words. My colleagues would acknowledge these are \nbeautiful words. The problem is, they are only words, because when the \nadministration that Secretary Rumsfeld works for and the House \nRepublican leadership that follows his lead and his direction put \ntogether a $137 billion tax package, they did not think they could find \nthe room, the time, the energy, or the concern to really thank the \nemployers by giving them part of this tax cut. They decided to send \nthem the brochures and the newsletters and the go-for-it \ncongratulations kind of letters, but the real people who they wanted to \nhelp or the people they thought deserved the most help were actually in \nthe bill.\n  I think this is pretty clear evidence that the words that are \nsometimes written by leaders do not really convey what actually \nhappens, that really what happens is what is in the budget. When one is \nin the budget, they know they matter, and if they are not, they do not. \nIt is about as simple as that.\n  I am going to submit a list of the employers--the National Committee \nfor Employers supports the Guard and Reserve, outstanding employers. I \nhave them all through my State. I am so proud of these small \nbusinesses, I do not know what to do.\n  I had one of my mayors whose chief operating officer was called out \nof the city not once but twice, one of the most talented, remarkable \npublic servants. The whole city sort of suffers when one of these \nskilled folks goes off, and I have heard his story out of Lake Charles, \nLA. But they kept his paycheck going voluntarily. Many employers keep \nthe paychecks going.\n  I thought, silly me, we have a tax bill. Could we not acknowledge the \npatriotism of these thousands of employers in our country, big \ncompanies, small companies, local governments, fire departments and \npolice departments that are digging deep? There are no line items in \ntheir corporate budgets to pay people who are not at work, but they do \nit anyway. We do not even mandate they do it; they are doing it \nvoluntarily. They do not put a line item in their corporate budget: Pay \npeople that are not on the job that are on the front line. But you know \nwhat. They do it. They do it for a good reason--because 41 percent of \nthe Guard and Reserve are taking a pay cut to serve on the front line.\n\n  I want to submit for the record some the patriotic employers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have some of their names printed at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Unlike some of the leaders who just write these \nemployers letters and tell them what a good job they do, I want these \nemployers--Conoco and Chevron and Alcoa and All About Music and Allianz \nLife Insurance Company and American Electric Power, American Express, \nthe American Stock Exchange, and I could go on and on, 250 Central, \n3M--there are pages of them--I want to tell them all that there are a \nfew Senators, some Republicans and some Democrats, who are going to do \nmore than send you a letter. We would like to send you a tax credit and \nwe think you deserve it.\n  You didn't really ask for it. We understand that because you are \ndigging deep. But we are going to give tax credits out to everybody in \nthe world, it looks like, because we have ceiling fan importers and \nNASCAR race investors; we have shipbuilders--many of which are in my \nState and they know I support them--but we can't find a tax credit to \nhelp these companies that are sending paychecks for the front line to \nkeep our soldiers prepared to fight and defend our country when really \nit is the Federal Government's responsibility.\n  If they said we didn't have the money, I would just sit down and say \nwe just don't have it. We are running a deficit. We can't afford it. \nBut for me to sit here and watch $137 billion fly through this Chamber \nand land in the hands of whomever, but not these companies, not our \ntroops, not the people who are having a hard time paying their house \nnote and keeping their household together, it makes me literally want \nto just get on my knees. I can hardly stand here. I really feel like \njust falling out.\n  I want to read a couple more things into the Record. I only have a \nfew minutes. This is from Kristin who called in today from Portland. \nHer husband is in the Army Reserve and has been in Iraq for about a \nmonth. She is anticipating a 50-percent cut in pay. Her husband was a \nprivate consultant project manager.\n\n       We knew when he was activated that he was going to have to \n     be away, but to think that some in Congress aren't even \n     willing to do something to help employers continue to pay him \n     is hard to believe.\n\n  Gwen from Minnesota, her husband spent a year deployed in Iraq as a \nreservist. He is a schoolteacher. He took a significant pay cut during \ndeployment.\n  Because I talked to Gwen, let me add a few things to this. Her \nhusband has a doctorate degree. He is teaching school, in either high \nschool or elementary school. He is a real double patriotic American \nbecause, even though he has a doctorate degree and could teach at a \ncollege or get some high-paying job, he feels compelled to give his \nlife to help children.\n  In his spare time he goes to the front line. So what does our \nGovernment do for Gwen and her husband? Send them letters in the \nnewsletter to tell them\n\n[[Page S10806]]\n\nhow proud we are. Then, when they are not looking, in the dead of \nnight, we pass a $137 billion tax cut and leave them out? I don't think \nso.\n  Sue, from New Orleans, her husband has been activated for a year and \na half but has not been deployed. Even so, her family is experiencing a \n60-percent pay cut during his deployment.\n  Trish from Pennsylvania, her family is experiencing a one-third pay \ncut. He is on his second deployment. They may have to declare \nbankruptcy. Her husband is in the Air Force Reserve. He was deployed to \nAfghanistan last year and is headed to Iraq in the fall.\n  We in Congress think we do a great job for these families by \nproviding them financial counseling. Let me say one thing. Most of the \npeople I know in the Army and Reserve do a very good job managing their \nmoney. They are happy for the help we could give them and they are \nhappy for the counseling that they could sign up for, but I can tell \nyou what they really want. They just want a paycheck and they want a \nsolid paycheck. They don't want something to make them rich, not \nsomething to allow them to live in a mansion or drive around in a \nLexus, but they would like a real paycheck. We could have helped them \nbut we decided this Congress had other priorities.\n  The last thing I want to submit for the Record is a letter to the \nPresident of the United States that I am sending right now. I am going \nto read it and then I am going to yield the floor to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  May I have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The letter says:\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to bring a grave injustice \n     to your personal attention. During Senate consideration of \n     the FSC-ETI legislation, the members of the Senate added a \n     modest provision to assist our troops. GAO studies have \n     concluded that 41% of our Guardsmen and Reservists called to \n     serve their country on the front line must take a pay cut to \n     do so. Fortunately, some companies around the country have \n     stepped up to the plate, and taken the patriotic step to make \n     up the pay gap of these brave men and women.\n       The provision that we added in the Senate would have \n     provided a tax credit of 50% of these costs to companies who \n     make up that difference. In so doing, we hoped both to \n     acknowledge the patriotism of existing companies, and at the \n     same time encourage more employers to take this step.\n       Mr. President, no doubt that as you have traveled the \n     country, you have confronted the same stories I have from \n     spouses and military families struggling to make ends meet. \n     We have had to ask an awful lot of our Guard and Reserves, \n     and they ask very little from us. So trying to take this \n     worry off the minds of our men and women on the front lines \n     seemed to be the least we can do.\n       So it is with deep embarrassment for our government that I \n     must report that this very modest relief for our troops was \n     stripped from the conference report by Congressman Thomas and \n     the leadership of the United States House. While I am certain \n     that representatives of your administration participated in \n     this conference, I presume that you did not have personal \n     knowledge of the decision to cut support for our military \n     families.\n       Regrettably, this decision has placed all of us in a \n     difficult position. While I endorse many aspects of the FSC-\n     ETI bill, but I simply cannot support a measure that places \n     so many lesser priorities ahead of our military families.\n       Mr. President, I respectfully request that your exert your \n     great influence to correct this injustice. Your willingness \n     to veto this bill, or your insistence that a free standing \n     bill be adopted, could redress this failure. Mr. President \n     our troops need your leadership on this matter. Let us not \n     disappoint them.\n\n  I might add, our troops need our leadership. I am sending this \nletter. I am sending a similar letter to Congressman Thomas. I hope in \nthe next 3 days that we are debating we may get an answer that tells us \neither why they were left out or what we could do to help them, because \n$137 billion is a lot of money and they deserve to be in the bill.\n  I have ended my speech. I see the Senator from Kansas on the floor \nand I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve\n\n\n                         Outstanding Employers\n\n       250 Central, 3M, 99th RRC, AMSA 113 (G), A.G.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                                FSC/ETI\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to address a couple of topics \nthat have come up this afternoon, and then address a couple that are \npending in front of us.\n  No. 1, on the FSC/ETI bill, there are a lot of things in the bill \nthat I think are very positive. There are some things I disagree with \nin the bill. One thing I am going to draw to the attention of some of \nmy colleagues in this bill that is very helpful in my State is a \nparticular provision extending the bonus depreciation allowance for \ncivil aviation aircraft. That is something about which I know the \nPresiding Officer is interested. These are small manufacturers of \nairplanes. These are not the big airliners but general aviation \nmanufacturers that have extended bonus depreciation.\n  You may ask, what am I interested in that for? That bonus \ndepreciation has brought back an industry that was on its knees, that \nwas crushed after 9/11. They were selling no aircraft. By having the \nbonus depreciation in there, they started selling aircraft. In fact, \nthey quadrupled their sales of aircraft, particularly Cessna, \nBombardier, Learjet. This hits Raytheon, the whole industry, much of \nwhich is concentrated in my State but has fingers around much of the \ncountry. It is a fabulous industry, great productivity of workers. \nThere are really good people associated with it. It was on its knees \nafter 9/11. The bonus depreciation was put in the first tax cut bill \nthat really revived it and brought it back. They started hiring people \nagain instead of\n\n[[Page S10808]]\n\nlaying off workers, but then they were hitting up against the time \ndeadline of that bonus depreciation, so their sales orders starting \ngoing back down again.\n  With it in this bill and by passing this bill, we are going to be \nable to bring sales back to that industry. You can say that is a pretty \nnarrow provision, that it doesn't cost anything, that it actually \nscored at zero, but the point being the reason this FSC/ETI bill is \ncalled a jobs bill is because it creates jobs. Here is a bill that \ncreates a number of jobs. By doing this, there are going to be people \nworking in Wichita, throughout my State, throughout the region, \nbuilding general aviation aircraft products. The chairman has done a \ngood job in working on this particular provision.\n  Most of this bill contains provisions that create jobs so people can \nwork. They can continue their work. They are not laid off from their \nwork. There are provisions in it which I don't agree with. There are \nthings which I wish we could have had more of in it.\n  The Senator from Louisiana made a speech saying there was something \nthat should have been in it. It would have been nice to be in it, but \nit didn't make it in. The bill has provisions in it that will create \njobs and continue jobs, such as this bonus depreciation extension on \ngeneral aviation manufactured products. This is a good thing that needs \nto happen. It is the right thing to do. It is the sort of thing we need \nfor this country, particularly in these areas of manufacturing jobs \nwhich have so much difficulty and so much competition overseas for \nthese jobs. Here is an area where we can do it. We need a little bit of \nbenefit. It is in the bill.\n  I applaud the Chairman, Senator Grassley, particularly for putting \nthat provision in the bill.\n  There is a second thing which hasn't had the notice and which \nhappened this week. It is not in the bill, but it is another job \ncreator. This week, the U.S. Trade Representative in the Office of the \nPresident announced that they will be withdrawing from the 1992 civil \naviation agreement with the European Union. The issue here is that \nAirbus has stolen by Government subsidies a huge market share from \nBoeing and other manufacturers, primarily from Boeing and large-scale \naircraft.\n  Since 1992 when the agreement was entered into, Airbus has gotten \nsomewhere between 8 to 15 percent of the market share. With Government \nsubsidies, Airbus now has a majority of the market share in the large \nairline manufacturing business. It has gotten that through Government \nsubsidies in Europe.\n  What type of Government subsidies? It is a subsidy where the European \nGovernments say to Airbus, you want to make this new airliner, you want \nto be able to sell it to United Airlines, you want to sell it to \nLufthansa and other airlines around the world; we will provide you with \nthe money. We will loan the money to create this new aircraft to sell \nto these major airlines. And if you sell the product and if it works, \nyou will have to repay the loan. But if it doesn't work, if people do \nnot buy the aircraft, you don't have to pay back the loan.\n  There are a number of countries in the world that would love this \ndeal. As such, you never have to bet the company on a new product. You \ncan go out and say we think there is a market for a 600-seat airliner. \nIf it makes it, great; you have to repay the loan. If it doesn't, the \nGovernment is going to pick up the tab.\n  That is what is taking place, billions of dollars of direct subsidies \non putting these aircraft into the manufacturing system that have \nsubsidized the takeover of Airbus over Boeing and the majority of \naircraft manufacturing in the world today. If it were a fair \ncompetition between Airbus and Boeing, that would be another matter. \nBut these sorts of subsidies are wrong. It is wrong for us to allow \nEurope to continue to do that.\n\n  I am delighted that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is \nwithdrawing from this 1992 protocol, saying to the Europeans we are \ngoing to start consultation and take this to the World Trade \nOrganization to have you stop the subsidization of aircraft \nmanufacturing and stealing jobs from America.\n  What does that have to do with this bill? Again, it is about jobs and \nfighting for jobs. Boeing itself has lost nearly 60,000 jobs since 9/\n11. We have been losing market share. We have had difficulty in the \neconomy. Here is something to say we have to start fighting back \naggressively, pull out of this agreement, start the consultation, bring \nthe World Trade Organization into it, and if we have to subsidize to be \nable to get back into market share to compete on a dollar-for-dollar \nbasis for Europe, I think we have to look at that as well.\n  Here is the administration through the USTR fighting for \nmanufacturing jobs that have been lost because of a bad agreement in \n1992 on airliners being subsidized and made by Airbus. I am delighted \nthe administration is doing this. I wholeheartedly support it. I have a \nresolution which I put in here asking my colleagues to support, saying \nthis is the right way for us to reclaim manufacturing jobs that are \nbeing stolen by Europe providing these subsidies to Airbus.\n  Another issue which is coming up in some of the debate on the floor \nis the discussion about the war in Iraq. For all of us, this is a very \nsensitive issue. We have lost American lives. We have lost a number of \nAmerican lives. We have lost a number of Kansans in this war in Iraq. \nThey are fighting for freedom. They are fighting to spread democracy in \na part of the world that has not known it. They are fighting against \nterrorists. They are fighting against a government that has harbored \nterrorists. They are fighting against a government that was identified \nby us for a number of years as being a state sponsor of terrorism--one \nof only seven countries in the world. Abu Nidal operated out of Iraq. \nThere has been and continues to be, and was continued under Saddam \nHussein, a connection between terrorism and his regime.\n  It becomes quite fashionable, it seems to me, to criticize this war \nin Iraq. Certainly there are things there to criticize. But I want to \ncaution my colleagues. When I visit with soldiers coming back from Fort \nRiley, or leaving from Fort Riley to go over, officers who have been \nover and back, and Fort Leavenworth, or I see them here, they want to \nknow that America continues to support them. It gets to be a real \ndissidence for a lot of people. OK, I support the troops but I don't \nsupport this effort in conflict.\n  I think a number of people look at this, saying what you mean is you \ndon't support this conflict and does that mean we are going to be \npulling out and are we not going to complete the job? Are we not going \nto make the turn to democracy in Iraq? This is a very difficult attempt \nwe are making. Once it is done, it will spread throughout the region. \nBut getting there is going to be very difficult.\n\n  I want to caution my colleagues, when you are being critical of this \nwar--and everybody has their right to put their opinion forward--how \nthat is heard by our troops. I say that from the practical experience \nin talking with a number of troops who have come back to my State. They \nwant to know and want to make sure that the country still supports \nthem. People will have different opinions on the war, but they want to \nknow they are supported. Once we are in, they want people to stand \nbehind them and with them.\n  I hope we let our troops know that, yes, we have not found weapons of \nmass destruction. It doesn't mean their efforts have been in vain, or \nwhat they have done has been wrong.\n  We have spread a message of democracy and hope. We have pushed Libya \nto the point now where they have given up WMDs, and are opening up \ntheir society. We have pushed them to the point they opened up the Dr. \nKahn nuclear network. That has made the world safer on nuclear weapons. \nWe are not completely safe, but it has made us safer in the process. \nTheir effort has not been in vain. They are opening their society, \nbringing schools and opportunity to people who have not known it.\n  We have gotten rid of a mass murderer in Saddam Hussein. There are \nthousands of people buried in mass graves. That is not a vain effort. \nYes, they are having difficulty. We are losing blood on a regular \nbasis, but we have to continue and we need to speak strongly that we \nsupport the war and we support the troops.\n\n[[Page S10809]]\n\n  In our efforts to have vigorous political debate here, I don't want \nto take the wind out of the sails of our troops who fight so hard and \nwho put their lives and their families on the line for our safety.\n  Finally, I want to address an issue that we thought we were going to \nbe able to get with the Department of Defense authorization bill; that \nis, raising of the fines for indecent material in public over-the-air \nbroadcasts over the radio and television. We have had broad bipartisan \nsupport for this effort. There is the Janet Jackson bill, for lack of \nbetter terminology, at the Super Bowl last year in the event with her \nand Justin Timberlake. It spawned a lot of complaints going to the FCC \nabout indecent material on public over-the-air broadcasts. I remind \nthose watching, the issue is that the airwaves used by radio and \ntelevision broadcast are public airwaves. They are licensed from the \npublic to radio stations and must be used for the common good.\n\n  There is a level of material that has been deemed as indecent if you \nhave this license. It is not so much about the first amendment, \nalthough the first amendment is protected. It is about abiding by your \nlicense agreement to use public property. It is like going to a \nnational park. A national park is owned by the public. Visitors have to \nabide by the rules in the national park when they go in. They cannot \nstart a fire just anywhere in that national park. Everyone has to abide \nby the rules.\n  If you are going to go into this, the property is owned by the \npublic, and there are rules to follow. If you are going to use a \nlicense, the property is owned by the public, the airwaves, and you \nhave to abide by the requirements. One of those requirements is you \ncannot put on indecent material. That has been defined.\n  We have had several broadcast violations. As a matter of fact, the \ncompany that broadcast the Super Bowl was fined heavily for that Janet \nJackson and Justin Timberlake episode. But their fine amounted to one-\nfourth of the value of a 30-second ad on the Super Bowl. So the total \nfine CBS received was the equivalent of a quarter of the price paid for \na 30-second ad at the Super Bowl. It was not even commensurate. It is \nthe cost-of-doing-business type of fine.\n  Within the bill that passed, the amendment that passed 99 to 1, was \nto increase these fines. We increased fines substantially so there \nwould be a penalty to the companies broadcasting the indecent material. \nThe FCC would be given the authority to fine up to $500,000 per \nviolation with a $3 million cap per 24-hour period per station group. \nHowever, the FCC has to consider a number of factors in deciding \nwhether to put that level of fine forward. Broadcasters do not make $2 \nmillion per 30-second ad on every show, and many broadcasters in small \nmarkets, particularly in my State or in other States, do not make near \nthat kind of money. So we give the FCC a top figure they can use in big \ninstances, but we give them a series of factors to consider such as \nability of the company to pay in assessing the fine.\n  We also have included fines for performers. If it is the performers \nwho choose to do this and the companies broadcasting did not have \nclearance ahead of time, then the performers themselves need to be held \nresponsible. That was included.\n  We also required an annual report that the FCC would have to give to \nthe Congress on what they are doing on indecency complaints and \nviolations. This had broad bipartisan support. It was pulled out of the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill because there were other \nissues associated with it, such as media ownership and a provision for \nfamily-hour viewing of violent television programming that had some \ncontroversy so it did not make it through.\n  We brought this issue back and we have put it today in a House bill \nthat is at the desk numbered 3717, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement \nAct of 2004, which we are attempting to move through the Senate in the \nfinal hours of this session so we can get what has been agreed to, what \nhas been passed by this Senate 99 to 1, what has passed through the \nHouse by an overwhelming majority as well, and have it as a stand-alone \nbill. It is being held by some Members on the other side of the aisle.\n\n  I am pleased my colleague, Senator Dorgan, in particular, is a \ncosponsor on this individual bill. We are trying to have it cleared. It \nhas cleared the Republican side and has not cleared the Democratic \nside. It has bipartisan support. I am hopeful we can get any holds \nlifted from this particular bill. It is an important provision.\n  The public is fed up with the amount of the indecent material on \ntelevision, particularly during prime time when families are watching. \nThey want the FCC to have tools that are real, that can be used against \nthe broadcast companies willing to put forward this sort of material \nthat families do not want in their living room.\n  I applaud the FCC for fining CBS for the Super Bowl incident. But, my \ngoodness, that fine wasn't much because that was the maximum amount \nthey can be fined under the old fine structure. We need to get this new \nfine structure in place.\n  We have this House-passed bill. It is at the desk. It is amended with \na House-Senate agreement that was part of the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. We are hopeful to get through that, and we are \nworking to get this through the Senate. The House stands ready to pass \nthat if we can get it cleared through the Senate.\n  The broadcast decency bill, the bill that is at our desk, sends the \nmessage that indecent and obscene material will not be tolerated on the \npublic airwaves during the hours in which children might be in the \naudience. Along with licensed use of the public airwaves for a period \nof time comes a set of responsibilities that need to be taken \nseriously.\n  I am hopeful, as we are here for a couple of days on these votes, \nthat we can get this matter cleared to send it to the House, we can get \nit passed to the President and take care of something that has broad \nbipartisan support. I urge my colleagues if they are holding this bill \nto consider this is something that they have probably already \nsupported. It would be important as a step forward in trying to present \nairwaves to the public the way the public wants them to be presented, \nas the public does own these airwaves.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Under the procedure \nwe are under now, the Senator from Iowa has how much time to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is advised he has up to \n58 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Then, I ask, as others have before me, unanimous consent \nto speak as in morning business but that the time keep running on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time would continue to run on the clock?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                              Overtime Pay\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, tonight, in just a couple hours, there \nwill be another Presidential debate between our colleague, Senator John \nKerry, and President George Bush. The debate tonight will be with \nquestions from audience members. I assume these are rank-and-file \ncitizens of Missouri or maybe Illinois and Iowa. I do not know where \nthey are coming from. It will be interesting to see. The moderator is \ngoing to pick and choose the questions that are asked of both President \nBush and Senator Kerry. I understand they will cover a broad range of \ntopics, but the basic topic tonight will be on domestic issues.\n  Well, I hope there will be a number of questions asked of President \nBush for him to explain why it is that he is so intent on taking away \nthe overtime pay rights of over 6 million American workers.\n\n[[Page S10810]]\n\n  A year and a half ago, his Department of Labor issued proposed \nregulations to drastically--drastically--change who is eligible for \novertime pay in America. After analysis by independent groups, I \ndecided we had to do everything we could to stop these rules from going \ninto effect and hurting the workers of America.\n  So we have had debate on this issue over the last year and a half. \nThe Congress has voted six times--four times in the Senate, twice in \nthe House--each time voting to overturn and to stop these onerous new \nregulations from going into effect. Six times, the President has not \nlistened to the elected representatives of the American people. Six \ntimes he basically said: I don't care what you want; this is what we \nare going to do.\n  Now, keep in mind, when these proposed regulations came out in \nFebruary of 2003, they were sort of put out in the middle of the night, \nso to speak a stealth attack. Not one public hearing was held on these \nproposed rules--not one. Congress was not involved in shaping or \nfashioning them. This simply came out of the heads--I wouldn't say the \nhearts because these are heartless kinds of regulations--but it came \nout of the heads of some people in the Department of Labor, I guess, \nand maybe in the White House.\n  We have said time and time again they should not go into effect, but \non August 23 of this year those rules went into effect. The new rules \ntook effect on that date because House Republicans have been able to \nstrip my amendment and its House companions in conferences. It goes to \nconference, they strip it out.\n\n  Now, I want to be clear. And I want to clear up one misstatement that \ncomes out of the administration's press releases all the time; and that \nis that somehow I am denying workers the right to get overtime pay \nbecause the base pay on which people are exempt from overtime--I should \nsay not exempt from any overtime regulations--starts at about $8,000 \nand goes up to $23,000 under these new rules. Every time I have offered \nmy amendment, we keep that in there. The base ought to go up. But we \nsay that no person who was eligible for overtime prior to August 23 \nought to lose overtime afterwards. They ought to still be eligible for \nit. That is what the White House has said time and time again. They \nsay: Well, if people got overtime before, they are going to get it \nafterwards. I say: OK, why not pass my bill? That is all I say. Anybody \nwho got it before ought to get it afterwards. But the White House has \nresisted that.\n  As a result, employers will no longer have to pay more money for \novertime work for millions of American workers. And most of these \nworkers will be women, make no mistake about it. This is going hit \nwomen hardest. Why do I say that? Because women are in that class of \nemployees out there who many times are salaried. They work at what \nmight be termed white-collar-type jobs. They work with perhaps \ninformation systems. They are inputting data in computers, many times \nworking for small businesses.\n  A lot of times they are working in jobs that are maybe their second \njob, for example, or they have entered the workforce later in life \nafter their children have grown, and they are working at a job that \ndoes not pay a lot, but they are salaried.\n  Well, right now, they might be eligible if they worked over 40 hours \na week to get time and a half. But under these new rules, they will be \nreclassified. They will then be asked to work over 40 hours a week and \nwill not get one dime of overtime pay.\n  As one woman wrote me, who lives in Seattle, WA, she said: When I get \nhome from work, my second job starts. I have to take care of my kids. I \nget dinner ready. I make sure they get to their afterschool events. \nThen we have homework. I put them to bed. And I have my laundry to do. \nBut she said: That time with my family and that time at home is my \npremium time. If I am asked to give up my premium time to work longer, \nI ought to get at least premium pay for it.\n  I have never heard it said better. Yet that woman will be asked to \ngive up her time with her family, her time with her children, working \nlonger hours, and not get one dime of overtime pay.\n  If overtime pay is free to the employer, it is going to be overused. \nIf employers no longer have to pay more money for overtime work, they \nwill have no incentive to demand longer hours, no incentive to hire \nmore workers. Workers will have less time to spend with their families.\n  A study done by the Center for Women and Work at Rutgers University \nshowed that only 20 percent of the workers eligible for overtime worked \nmore than 40 hours a week. In other words, of 20 percent of workers \neligible for overtime, only 20 percent worked more than 40 hours a \nweek, but 44 percent of workers who are exempt from overtime pay work \novertime, so twice as many. In other words, if the employer doesn't \nhave to pay you overtime, you are twice as likely to work over 40 hours \na week than if they have to pay overtime. That is common sense. It \nstands to reason.\n  When Congress enacted the overtime provisions in the Fair Labor \nStandards Act in 1938, Congress did so with the intent that a hard-\nworking America would not leave behind the concept of valuable family \ntime. We believe that workers should be paid extra for the extra hours \nthey work. Time-and-a-half pay accounts for some 25 percent of total \nincome of those who work overtime, and the economic health of too many \nfamilies is at stake. Congress has voted on this six times on a \nbipartisan basis to protect these American workers' overtime. Now they \nwant to strip it out again, out of conference. In these tough economic \ntimes, why are we taking away families' rights to be fairly compensated \nin their overtime?\n  During the first 3 years of the Bush administration, the typical \nhousehold saw their real income fall by more than $1,500. Real wages \nhave fallen while gas prices have gone up. Milk prices have gone up. \nHealth care costs have gone up. More than 4 million people have been \nthrown into poverty since the beginning of the Bush administration. \nMore than 5 million have joined the ranks of the uninsured. In this \nkind of economy, why would the President of the United States want to \ntake money out of families' pockets?\n  I hope this will be something that will be talked about tonight in \nthe Presidential debate. I am sure the President will say they are \nexpanding overtime pay because they are raising the base. They are \nraising the base with one hand, taking it away with the other. It is \nthe old shell game. Yes, a worker who is making $15,000 or $18,000 a \nyear will now be automatically covered by overtime. But guess what the \nadministration did in the rules. They have suggestions to employers on \nhow to get around it, how to get around paying the lowest income \nworkers in America overtime.\n  We have had examples of that. We had an example in The Detroit News: \n``Workers Agonize About Overtime Loss.'' Two managers out of 150 at \nmetro Detroit Burger King franchises became eligible for overtime. \nRather than make them hourly workers, the company gave them $20 a week \nraises to maintain their salaried status. They gave them a $20 a week \nraise so they would just be over that threshold, and they are not \neligible for overtime. That means they have a $20 raise, and they to \nhave work 3 or 4 hours' overtime. They are getting minimum wage or \nbelow even for working overtime. Two managers out of 150 eligible for \novertime. So that is what is happening.\n\n  The President might say tonight: Well, they raised the base. But they \nare already telling employers how to beat it. I hope the President will \ntonight respond and answer to the American people why he is so intent \non taking away the right to overtime pay, to time and a half over 40 \nhours of work.\n  Please, Mr. President, tell the women of America why you are sticking \nit to them, the working mothers of America, why you are taking away \ntheir premium time from their families but not allowing them to make \npremium time by working overtime.\n  Another issue I hope comes up tonight is the issue of job growth. The \njob report came out today. The economy created 96,000 jobs last month, \nless than two-thirds of the amount needed just to keep up with \npopulation growth. Only 59,000 were in the private sector, so just \nslightly over half in the private sector, and the rest were in the \npublic sector. We have lost 1.6 million private sector jobs since \nPresident Bush took office.\n\n[[Page S10811]]\n\n  They may say: That is not quite right. There was an 813,000 job \nincrease. Well, that is because of Government employment. The gap \nbetween total jobs and private sector jobs accounted for 813,000 jobs \nin Government employment. That is called socialism. I wonder what this \nis called now. President Bush is for socialism? We can't get jobs in \nthe private sector. We will put them on the Government payroll. Shades \nof the Soviet Union. But the private sector jobs are not there.\n  Total manufacturing jobs fell by 18,000 in September, the largest \ndrop since last December. A total of 2.7 million manufacturing jobs \nhave been lost since President Bush took office--the first President \nsince Herbert Hoover to not have created one net new job in 4 years in \noffice. What a record. I hope the President talks about how great that \nis for our country, that the only increase we are getting is in \nGovernment jobs.\n  The unemployment rate is unchanged, 5.4 percent. It was 4.2 percent \nwhen the President took office in January of 2001. Eight million \nAmericans were unemployed in September; 2 million more Americans \nunemployed today than when President Bush took office in January of \n2001--a 33-percent increase. That is a terrible way to say it, a 33-\npercent increase in the number of unemployed in this country since \nPresident Bush took office.\n  Let's talk about long-term unemployment. That is longer than 26 \nweeks. That means you are out of work longer than 6\\1/2\\ months. Long-\nterm unemployment rose by 83,000 last month. It is now at 1.7 million \npeople. It has increased by 1 million under President Bush. That is \nlong-term unemployment. The long-term unemployed are now 21.8 percent \nof the unemployed. That share has nearly doubled. This is the economic \nrecord. Long-term unemployment more than doubled.\n  In January of 2001, there were 680,000 long-term unemployed. \nSeptember 2004, there are 1.75 million, a 160-percent increase in long-\nterm unemployed.\n  That is it. I hope that the President will please talk about that \ntonight and how good this is for America and why things are getting \nbetter for America and for American families.\n  As I said, he is the worst President since Herbert Hoover to face the \nvoters, having lost jobs during his tenure. He will finish his term \nwith the worst record since the Great Depression and finish his term \nhaving lost private sector jobs. While the economy has created jobs \nover the last year, the recovery has been modest, with a total of 1.7 \nmillion jobs created, which is about 143,000 a month. This is below \nwhat is needed to keep up with population growth. A healthy labor \nmarket would be creating jobs at a more rapid pace.\n  During the last economic expansion, the economy created 200,000 jobs \nper month, for a full decade, every year, and 236,000 jobs per month \nduring President Clinton's two terms. I will repeat that. During \nPresident Clinton's two terms, the economy created 236,000 jobs per \nmonth. During President Bush's tenure, we have had 143,000 jobs created \nper month. In January 2001, we had 111,560,000 private sector jobs. In \nSeptember 2004, we had 109,930,000, with 1.6 million lost during that \nperiod of time.\n  So when the President says they are creating jobs, yes, they are \ncreating jobs--mostly in the public sector, Government employment, but \nfar fewer than is even needed to keep up with the population growth.\n  The administration has billed its tax cuts as a solution. But its \npredictions of the impact of the tax cuts have been consistently wrong. \nIn 2001, Congress passed the President's economic plan. Three years \nlater, we still have fewer jobs than existed when the plan became law. \nIn 2003, the administration predicted that passage of that year's tax \ncut would create 5.5 million jobs by the end of this year, 306,000 jobs \nper month. That target has only been reached in 2 months, and the total \n15-month shortfall is 2.9 million jobs behind the pace predicted by the \nadministration. Job growth is roughly 7 million behind the \nadministration's 2002 prediction of the impact of their economic plan.\n  I know these are big numbers when you talk about 306,000 and 5.5 \nmillion. Well, the fact is that has resulted in hitting our families \nhard. Here is what happened to families. Median household income: In \n2000, the median household income was $44,853. Today, it is $43,318. So \nit is down $1,500.\n  I hope the President tonight talks about how this is good for \nAmerica, how things are getting better, when family income is coming \ndown. I hope the President will address himself to the huge increase in \nthe cost of natural gas in the Midwest, and what that is going to mean \nto our farmers, our families, to the elderly who have to heat homes \nwith natural gas, to our manufacturing concerns who use natural gas, \nand power companies that use natural gas to produce electricity.\n  Yet, household family income is down. The price of natural gas is up, \ngasoline is up, and oil hit a new high yesterday at $53 a barrel. Great \nfor Halliburton and the oil companies; not too good for our families \nwho have to drive a car to work--maybe drive two cars to work if they \nhave two people working at different times. That is the median \nhousehold income right there.\n  I hope tonight's debate will be about domestic issues. I hope they \ntalk about the lack of job growth, the cut in median family income, the \nnumber of long-term unemployed; and, yes, I hope they talk about \novertime pay and what is happening to people who work hard and are now \ngoing to see their rights to overtime pay taken away. Those are mostly \nwomen. So that is the economy.\n\n  I want to talk about all of those who are going to be hurt by the \nrules on overtime. Employees earning between $23,660 and $100,000 a \nyear are going to find themselves with their right to overtime \nrestricted or taken away, including veterans, police, nurses, team \nleaders, journalists, cooks, financial services, computer workers, and \nmany others--a lot of people. So someone earning as low as $23,661 a \nyear will find that their rights to overtime will be taken away. They \nwill be reclassified.\n  As I pointed out, in Detroit, 2 out of 150 managers at a certain \nplace of business were eligible for overtime--2 out of 150. What \nhappened is the employer realized how to fix it. By raising their \nsalary so it was $23,661, or $23,662--just over the $23,660--guess \nwhat. They don't have to pay them overtime anymore. I hope they will \ntalk about that tonight. I hope we will also recognize that there are \nno excuses for this overtime being taken away.\n  Three career employees of the Department of Labor who worked in this \narea under Presidents Reagan, the first Bush, Clinton, and this Bush--\nso they have worked for various Presidents--all three of them basically \nsaid that in every instance where the Department of Labor has made \nsubstantive changes to the existing rules, it has weakened the criteria \nfor overtime exemptions, thereby expanding the reach and scope of the \nexemptions. That means that in every instance where they have made \nsubstantive changes to these rules, it has made it easier for employers \nto deny you the right to overtime pay.\n  So I hope the President again tonight will respond and tell us why he \nis intent on taking away the right to overtime pay. I also hope they \nwill talk about health care and what happened to health care coverage \nin this country. We are now up to about 4.5 million more people who \nhave lost health insurance under this President. Somewhere around 45 \nmillion to 50 million people in America have no health insurance \ncoverage--none. No health insurance coverage.\n  As we have said, the rate of poverty has gone up in this country. We \nknow that especially the elderly are cutting pills in half and going \nwithout medicine to pay their heating bills or their lighting bills or \ntheir rent. Well, I happened to listen to the Senator from Utah, my \nfriend Senator Hatch, this morning go on and on. As I said, I like him, \nbut he happens to be wrong on this issue, that's all. I don't know how \nanyone can stand here with a straight face and say that Medicare \ndoesn't have the right to bargain down prices of drugs. In the Medicare \nprescription drug bill that we passed, which the President signed into \nlaw, there is an express prohibition against Medicare bargaining with \nthe pharmaceutical companies to get a cheaper price. They are \nprohibited from doing this.\n\n  The Veterans' Administration is allowed to bargain, and they get \ngreat prices. In fact, our veterans get the cheapest drugs anywhere in \nAmerica through the Veterans' Administration. That is great for our \nveterans. Why\n\n[[Page S10812]]\n\nshouldn't Medicare be able to do the same thing?\n  John Kerry has a plan. He has a plan for better health care in \nAmerica, and the first part of his health care plan is to take away \nthat restriction on Medicare and to allow Medicare--not even to allow \nMedicare, to insist that Medicare bargain with the pharmaceutical \ncompanies to get a cheaper price for drugs for the elderly in this \ncountry. Now that would be meaningful prescription drug reform.\n  The second part of the Kerry plan for having better health care for \nour people is to allow us to have free trade with Canada. One might say \nwe have a free-trade agreement with Canada. Of course, we do. We have \nNAFTA. It allows free trade with Canada. We can have free trade in \ncars, clothes, shoes, glasses, paper, and I suppose anything you want \nto mention, except one item. We do not have free trade with Canada on \nprescription drugs.\n  Go along the northern border of the United States and people are \ndriving across the border every day to buy cheaper drugs. Sometimes \nthey take a bus from Iowa, go up through Minnesota, buy prescription \ndrugs, and come back.\n  Why don't we have a free-trade agreement with Canada on drugs? Why \nnot allow us to reimport drugs from Canada for our people in this \ncountry to get a cheaper price? It is time to do so. The Bush \nadministration will not allow that to happen.\n  For a lot of people in this country who do not have health insurance, \nthey look at us. I have a really good plan. I have a health care plan \nthat allows me to choose doctors and hospitals and covers me wherever I \ngo. Every year I can change my plan. When our kids were little, we had \none plan. Now that our kids are grown up and married, we have a \ndifferent plan. I get to choose from about--I don't know, I didn't \ncheck last year--15, 20 different plans. It is a good plan. I have that \nplan. President Bush is under that plan. Vice President Cheney is under \nthat plan.\n  If it is so good, why don't we let the American people buy into this? \nWhy don't we let them buy into the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nPlan? Senator Kerry says we ought to do that. President Bush says no. \nIt is OK for us, but it is too good for the American people. I think it \nought to be good enough for the American people. John Kerry says, yes, \nhe wants to open up the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan to allow \nthe American people to buy in. That would be very meaningful, \nespecially for small businesses and people who work for small business.\n  The fourth part of John Kerry's comprehensive plan to have better \nhealth care for America is to allow better tax breaks for small \nbusinesses to cover their employees with health care. It is very \nmeaningful to those of us who live in rural States. Most of our people \nwho live in small towns and communities work for small businesses. \nSmall businesses simply cannot afford any longer to cover their \nemployees.\n  John Kerry says we should provide up to a 50-percent tax credit to \nsmall businesses and to family farmers to allow them to purchase health \ncare coverage for their employees. President Bush says no. But this is \nwhere we need to focus--on our small businesses. That is where most of \nthe people work, and that is where most jobs are created. Yet small \nbusinesses simply cannot afford it any longer. John Kerry says, let's \nprovide tax cuts to small businesses to get health care coverage for \ntheir employees.\n  The fourth part of John Kerry's comprehensive health care program is \nto extend and make more comprehensive the SCHIP program; that is the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. One might say, the President says \nhe is for that. At his convention in New York, President Bush announced \na new $1 billion initiative to enroll millions of poor children in two \npopular Government health programs, but next week the Bush \nadministration plans to return $1.1 billion in children's unspent \nhealth funds to the Treasury. A projected shortfall in Federal SCHIP \nfunds reduced health care to more than 200,000 children.\n\n  There you have it. A President Kerry would expand the SCHIP program \nand get every kid covered. Let poor families get into the SCHIP program \nand provide them the wherewithal to do so. Under this administration, \nfewer and fewer children are being covered under the SCHIP program.\n  Lastly, in his comprehensive plan for health care reform, Senator \nKerry has said that we need a real prescription drug benefit for the \nelderly, not a phony card. And that is what it is, a phony card. That \nis what the elderly get today, a card. I cannot tell you how many \nsenior citizens have come up to me in Iowa and told me how worthless \nthat card is. They say: I have two or three cards in my billfold or in \nmy purse and some of those are better than the Government card. The \ncard I got with this drug company, or an AARP card--whatever card they \nhave; there are a bunch out there--are better than the Government card. \nSo why should they buy yet another card?\n  Senators were on the floor the other day saying we should not be \ndenigrating; we should not be talking badly about this card for the \nelderly. We ought to be promoting it. Promoting it? Don't talk to me; \ntalk to the senior citizens. Find out why they are not buying it. They \nare not buying it just because I got up here and said it is worthless. \nThey know it is worthless. They are telling me it is worthless. But we \nare supposed to, I guess, be a cheerleader and get them to buy \nsomething that is not in their best interest, that is worthless. \nSenator Kerry says we need a real prescription drug plan for the \nelderly and not just a phony card.\n  Lastly, I want to talk about education. I hope education also is a \npart of the debate tonight. The President can probably tout the fact \nthat he got a bipartisan bill through called No Child Left Behind. I \nsupported that bill. I am on the Education Committee. We had a lot of \nnegotiations. I was sitting there, since I am a senior member of that \ncommittee, in the final negotiations, and the big holdup was how much \nmoney would we put into it. We agreed on a number, and President Bush \nagreed that in exchange for the States doing these things and the \nmandates we put on No Child Left Behind, in exchange for that, we would \nprovide the funding necessary to meet these requirements, and we \nspecified how much money that would be.\n  What happened? The first budget year comes up, they get shortchanged. \nThe second budget year comes up, shortchanged again, and once again \nthis year.\n  I believe we are now in the neighborhood of about $27 billion short \nin education from what we had guaranteed. If I am wrong, I will come \nback and correct that, but it is something like that. I know it is over \n20. The figure 27 sticks in my head. Even if it was $10 billion or $5 \nbillion, the fact is, we put a mandate on our schools. We said we were \ngoing to pay for it, and we have reneged.\n  Now, do not take my word for it. I tell people, talk to your \nteachers. If you do not like that, talk to your principal or your \nsuperintendent. Talk to your school board members and see what they say \nabout No Child Left Behind. Most of them will say, look, it is test \nafter test. We can handle that, but we are not getting the supporting \nmechanisms we need because we do not have the funds to do it.\n  I cannot tell my colleagues how many times it has happened to me in \nmy State of Iowa that I have seen schools where, guess what, they have \ncut out art classes, they have cut out music classes, they have cut out \nPE. Why? Because they are pinched. They are strapped. They have to put \nthe money in for No Child Left Behind. Why? Because we did not fund it, \none of the largest unfunded mandates ever.\n  President Bush has not asked for the money in his budget. He did not \nput it in there to fund No Child Left Behind. I think the President \nshould be held accountable for that on education.\n  The second largest unfunded mandate our schools have is special \neducation. We promised 25 years ago that we would pay up to 40 percent \nof the additional costs of funding special education in America. I \nthink we are now at about 18 percent of funding additional costs for \nspecial education. We promised 40 percent, and yet time and again we do \nnot get the funds and we do not get the budget allocation to fund \nspecial education.\n  So I hope these will be some of the issues that the President will \ntalk about tonight, that I hope will be involved in the debate because \nthese are the issues that affect families in their daily lives.\n\n[[Page S10813]]\n\n  Lastly, I will take a little bit of time to talk about why I have \nbeen involved in slowing down the process in the Senate today. There \nare a lot of press people who talked to me about that so I thought I \nmight at least take this time to explain why I am doing it.\n  The Senator from Arizona yielded me a couple of minutes to explain \nwhy I was doing it, and I have only one simple declarative sentence: I \nam doing it to protect our farmers. I am doing it to protect the \njurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee. The occupant of the Chair is \nour distinguished chairman.\n  When we pass bills that are multiyear bills, sometimes it takes a lot \nof debate and discussion and working things out. In the 2002 farm bill, \nthat was true. It took many weeks. I can remember sitting in these \nconversations on Saturday, Saturday night, and Sunday working it out. \nThese are tough negotiations. Agriculture is very diverse, but I have \nalways believed the Agriculture Committee ought to represent all of \nagriculture; that we are all in this together.\n  So we hammered out a farm bill and we passed it. There was give-and-\ntake. Now, I did not get everything I wanted. The Senator from Indiana, \nwho was ranking at the time, did not get what he wanted. The House \nDemocrats did not get all they wanted. The House Republicans did not \nget all they wanted. That is the art of compromise. But I thought we \nhad a pretty good bill. We had one which was a true compromise, and \neveryone signed off on it. We passed it with big majorities in the \nSenate and the House, and the President signed it. I was there for the \nsigning.\n  I remember the President talking about how this bill was so strong on \nconservation. That was one of the reasons he was signing it. Yes, I am \nproud of the fact that the bill had an 80-percent increase in \nconservation, everything from the WHIP program, the Wildlife Habitat \nIncentives Program, to the Waters Resources Program, Wetlands Reserve \nProgram, CRP, Conservation Reserve Program, and a whole host of others, \nand a new program that we started called the Conservation Security \nProgram, Farmland Protection Program, a lot of conservation programs.\n\n  So we had a provision dealing with the Conservation Security Program, \nwhich was designed to be an uncapped program that entitled every farmer \nwho met certain requirements to be eligible to get payments for \nprotecting soil, water, and air, and being a good farmer. I have long \nbelieved that it was not right that we just pay farmers to take land \nout of production. What about all of those farmers who do produce our \nfood supply and work hard every day, who are good stewards of the land? \nShould they not have some incentive to take care of the soil, to \nprotect our water, to protect our wildlife? So that is what we hammered \nout in the Conservation Security Program, an incentive program for \nfarmers, yes, to take better care of the land. It does not require one \niota of land taken out of production.\n  It is voluntary. It is not a mandatory program. No farmer has to \nparticipate, but if they will do certain things--there is a minimum \nlevel, a moderate level, and a higher level, and if they do these \nthings they will get a payment. But they have to agree to do it for \nbetween 5 and 10 years by contract, and then they have to meet certain \nrequirements from the Natural Resources Conservation Service. They sign \nan agreement that they will do certain things to indeed keep soil from \nrunning off, make their soil better, better tilled, protect the water, \na whole host of things, all kinds of things, because what is considered \ngood conservation practices in my State of Iowa may not be good \nconservation practices in the States of Mississippi, Colorado, \nWashington, or Pennsylvania. Different soil, different land, different \ncrops, different ways. So we wanted to make it so it was adaptable to \nevery part of the country; it was not some cookie-cutter approach.\n  Well, everyone touted this as a new approach. It was signed off on by \nthe Agriculture Committee, passed and signed by President Bush. Then \nwhat happened was the Department of Agriculture began to drag their \nfeet. In the bill, we gave them 18 months to come up with rules and \nregulations to get this program implemented. We passed the law and it \nwas signed by the President in May of 2002. So that is almost 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago, and the final rules still have not been promulgated by the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  They put out the proposed rules finally after 2 years. So they have \nbeen dragging their feet. I guess they just did that for some reason.\n  We finally got it going and then a couple of years ago for the first \ntime in the history of this Congress we responded to a disaster, a \ndrought, by providing for disaster assistance to hard-hit farmers, but \nfor the first time ever we took it out of agriculture. We made \nagriculture pay for it. In the 50 years that we have been providing \ndisaster assistance to farmers--or others--it has always been paid for \nas an emergency spending. Two years ago, for the first time, they took \nit out of agriculture.\n  I warned at the time that they were reopening the farm bill, changing \na program that was agreed upon and passed by an authorizing committee; \nthat they were fundamentally changing the appropriations process--and I \nam on the Appropriations Committee, as is the occupant of the Chair. I \nsaid that they are fundamentally changing it; this is not right to do \nthis.\n  Well, it was an on an Omnibus appropriations bill. The House passed \nit, went home, the funding of the Government was in it, so we had to \npass it. I entered into a colloquy with the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nthe Presiding Officer, the Senate majority leader, and Senate minority \nleader. In that colloquy we stated that we agreed, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee agreed that at the first possible time--I will \nget the exact language--we would put the program back so that we could \nassure that it would run as intended by the farm bill for the life of \nthe farm bill, which would take us to 2007. Fine. That is OK. So it was \nput back.\n\n  Because there was a lapse of time there, a gap in time, the \nDepartment of Agriculture issued some rules on how to implement this \nprogram, but they issued rules based upon the fact that it was a capped \nprogram and not eligible to every farmer. But the farm bill said it is \neligible for every farmer in every State of this country if they meet \ncertain requirements. They said they had to do that because it was \ncapped.\n  I said, Now it is not capped. We changed it back.\n  The Department said, OK, we will have to change the rules to make it \ngo back, and they said that. They said they were going to change it.\n  I know this is a long story, but now it takes us up to today. Once \nagain, we had a disaster. We had two hurricanes, three hurricanes that \nhit Florida and Georgia and the Carolinas so they are going to provide \ndisaster assistance. I think we should. We always have. How are they \ngoing to pay for it? They are going to pay for it as emergency \nspending.\n  But there is another disaster that has taken place in other States of \nthe country. We have had tornadoes, mud slides, high winds, hail in \nother agricultural parts of the country. We want those disasters taken \ncare of, too. The administration said: Yes, we will take care of those \ndisasters, but agriculture has to pay for it, and guess what, it is \ngoing to come out of conservation.\n  Strange. If you are a citrus farmer in Florida and you have an orange \ngrove and there were tornadoes in this hurricane, if a tornado came \nthrough and ripped out your trees--and it did, by the way, in a lot of \nplaces--you will now get disaster assistance, crop-loss disaster \nassistance paid for under the hurricane bill, not taken out of \nagriculture. But if you are a farmer in Mississippi or Iowa and you had \na tornado come through and take out your cotton crop or take out my \ncorn crop, you might get compensated, but, guess what, they are taking \nit out of your other pocket. They are taking it out of agriculture.\n  Why should our farmers be treated differently than the farmers in \nFlorida, I ask. That is why I have slowed this up today. That is why I \nwanted to get the attention of the Senate. I have always believed \nfarmers had to be treated the same no matter where they are. That is \nwhy this is so bad, what is happening. They are opening up the farm \nbill\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\nagain. They are taking it out of conservation again. They say they are \ngoing to do it. It may be conservation today. Next year, it might be \ncommodity payments, maybe payment limitations. I have fought on this \nfloor to protect those things. Maybe that is what it is going to be \nnext year.\n  Look out. Once we in agriculture divide ourselves up and we say, No, \nthat's all right, we will take it out of there; we will treat farmers \nsomeplace different than in another place. Now we opened the farm bill. \nOur baseline is going to be down. It is going to take it right out of \nthe baseline of agriculture. I know that is sort of the inside game \naround here. That means agriculture is taking a hit.\n\n  What makes this so terrible is that in the last 3 years we, \nagriculture--I should not say ``we''--the farmers of America saved the \ntaxpayers of this country $15 billion that was allotted for them under \nthe farm bill that they did not have to take. That was $15 billion that \nwent back to the Treasury. You would think we would say: OK, if we \nsaved $15 billion, that is where the disaster assistance ought to come \nfrom. We are talking about $3 billion or $2.8 billion. We have already \nsaved $15 billion.\n  But no, they are not going to count that. They are not going to count \nthat. I am sorry to have to say this. We in the Senate passed an \namendment to provide for disaster assistance that would be emergency. \nWe did it here, but the House didn't. And the White House, OMB, is \ninsisting, insisting that this $2.8 billion of disaster assistance for \nour farmers be taken out of agriculture but not the disaster assistance \nfor farmers in Alabama or Georgia or the Carolinas or Florida. Please, \nsomeone tell me, what is the difference? Maybe we are just not lucky \nenough to have the President's brother as our Governor, or your \nGovernor.\n  That is why I am so upset about this. It is just not right. It is not \nright what they are doing. They are fundamentally changing a program we \nagreed upon. They are taking it out of agriculture, even after we saved \nall this money. It is not right. I am going to stand here and I am \ngoing to fight.\n  I told them I probably can't win. They have the votes and they have \nthe White House. But I am going to fight for my farmers. I am going to \nstand here or sit here to the bitter end. If I do not win this time, I \nwill be back.\n  I told the majority leader. Majority leader, I said, I like you, I \nrespect you. He is a fine guy and he has a tough job. But, I said, I \nhave to fight for my farmers. I have to fight for my rural people. I \nhave to fight to make sure they are not discriminated against. I said, \nLeader, if I get rolled here, I will be back. If we come back in \nOctober, I will be back then. I will be back in November, too. I will \nbe back. I will be back.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Jurisdiction\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to engage in a colloquy with the ranking \nmember on the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, regarding provisions \nin Senate Resolution 445 pertaining to the jurisdiction of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. In particular, \nI wish to address the provisions that exclude from the jurisdiction of \nthat committee oversight of matters relating to the customs revenue \nfunctions, and the commercial functions and commercial operations, of \nthe Bureau of Customs and Border Protection--CBP--and the Bureau of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement--ICE.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is a very important topic. As the Chairman of the \nFinance Committee will recall, the issue of customs authority was a \nmajor one in the debate leading up to passage of the Homeland Security \nAct of 2002. The Finance Committee held a hearing in July 2002, \nfollowed by a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. We stressed the importance of \npreserving the revenue collection and trade facilitation functions of \nthe U.S. Customs Service, even as that agency moved into the Department \nof Homeland Security with an added national security focus. I would be \npleased to engage in a colloquy on this topic with my good friend from \nIowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate the Senator's recollection of our efforts \non this issue. I would add that following the hearing and our letter, \nwe worked closely with the Committee on Governmental Affairs and with \nthe Administration to develop text that would keep intact the \ncommercial functions of the Customs Service. Under the final \nlegislation, authorities vested in the Secretary of the Treasury \nrelating to customs revenue functions remained with the Secretary of \nthe Treasury unless delegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security. By \norder of the Secretary dated May 15, 2003 Treasury Order 100-16), the \nSecretary of the Treasury delegated to the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity general authority over Customs revenue functions, subject to \ncertain exceptions that preserved Treasury's oversight of the Customs \nService with respect to policy matters and the authority to issue \nregulations and determinations.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, and I believe we can both agree that our efforts \nwere successful in preserving the revenue functions, commercial \nfunctions, and commercial operations of the Customs Service, including \noversight of those functions and operations within the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I concur entirely. And the Senator's last point-the \nimportance of preserving oversight of the revenue functions, commercial \nfunctions, and commercial operations that are now delegated to CBP and \nICE--leads directly to the main point of this colloquy; namely, the \nnecessity of preserving the role of the Finance Committee as primary \noverseer of the customs revenue functions, the commercial functions, \nand the commercial operations associated with the customs duties now \nbeing performed by employees of the Department of Homeland Security. I \nwant to thank my colleagues, Senator McConnell and Senator Reid, for \nworking so constructively with me and Senator Baucus  to address this \npriority. Together, we have clarified the scope of jurisdiction for the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs as it relates \nto the commercial aspects of customs operations.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I concur in thanking our colleagues for their cooperation \nin addressing this important issue. For the benefit of the record, \nwould the Chairman of the Finance Committee outline the clarifications \nthat have been added to the resolution?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would be pleased to do so. To begin, I think it's \nimportant to appreciate the context in which the clarifications have \nbeen made. Commercial customs functions are one element of the \ncomprehensive international trade agenda of the United States. The \nvarious elements of international trade and trade policy are woven \ntogether so thoroughly that effective oversight of the whole \nnecessitates oversight of the individual elements of trade. Now, of \nutmost importance to our broader purpose here today, we agree that \npreservation of Finance Committee jurisdiction in this manner will not \nin any way diminish the effective oversight of Department of Homeland \nSecurity functions by the Committee on Homeland Security and al \naffairs. Consequently, the clarifications we've added serve only to \nenhance effective oversight by the United States Senate of both the \nhomeland security interests and the international trade interests of \nthe United States.\n  Now, the provisions we've added specify that the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs will have jurisdiction over \nmatters relating to the Department of Homeland Security, except matters \nrelating to the following: first, any customs revenue function, \nincluding but not limited to the customs revenue functions enumerated \nin section 415 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. For example, that \nwould cover the assessment and collection of customs duties, \nantidumping and countervailing duties, duties imposed under the various \nsafeguard provisions in our trade laws, excise taxes, fees and \npenalties due on imported merchandise. But these are only some of the \nmany revenue functions associated with customs operations. I encourage \nmy colleagues to refer to section 415 of the Act, and again I note that \nsection 415 is illustrative and does not provide an exhaustive list of \nthe customs revenue functions that will remain within Finance Committee \njurisdiction.\n  Second, matters relating to any commercial function or commercial \noperation of the Bureau of Customs and Border Patrol and the Bureau of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement\n\n[[Page S10815]]\n\nwould be excluded from the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs. That would cover, for example, \nmatters relating to trade facilitation and trade regulation. But let's \ntake a closer look at what that would mean. Last year I introduced the \nClean Diamond Trade Act. That important legislation prohibits trade in \nconflict diamonds. Once introduced, it was referred to the Committee on \nFinance where we held a hearing and reported it to the full Senate with \nthe benefit of committee's expertise. In the future, similar \nlegislation to regulate imports or exports would also be referred to \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That specific example is very helpful. Does the Chairman \nof the Finance Committee have any other examples in mind?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, another example would be the Convention on \nCultural Property Implementation Act, over which the Finance Committee \nwould retain jurisdiction. That legislation authorizes the United \nStates to enter into bilateral agreements to protect the cultural \nantiquities of a trading partner. Another example would include matters \nrelating to the Automated Commercial Environment--or ACE--computerized \nentry system for imports. Again, the driving factor here is whether a \nmatter is commercial or trade regulatory in nature; if so, the Finance \nCommittee would retain jurisdiction over the matter notwithstanding \nthat the matter may fall among the duties assigned to an employee of \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chairman. Are there any other matters that \nfall within the exception to transfer of jurisdiction to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, in fact there is a third clarification that's been \nadded. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs will \nhave jurisdiction over matters relating to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, except with respect to any other function related to the \ncustoms revenue functions or to the commercial functions or commercial \noperations that were exercised by the United States Customs Service on \nthe day before the effective date of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. \nNow, the Homeland Security Act directed the Secretary of the Treasury \nto identify, within 60 days after the date of enactment of the Act, \nthose authorities vested in the Secretary of the Treasury that were \nexercised by the Commissioner of Customs on or before the effective \ndate of the act. By letter dated January 24, 2003, the General Counsel \nat the Department of the Treasury transmitted that report to the \nFinance Committee. I ask unanimous consent that the General Counsel's \nletter and attached report be printed in the Record, in order to \nprovide further guidance as to what is covered by this third clarifying \nprovision. As comprehensive as this report is, I note that it serves to \nprovide illustrative guidance and is not an exhaustive list of the \nfunctions or operations encompassed by the third clarification we've \nadded.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Gentlemen: Under Section 418(b) of the Homeland Security \n     Act of 2002 (the ``Act''), Title IV, Subtitle B, Public L. \n     No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (November 24, 2002), the \n     Secretary of the Treasury is directed to report to your \n     Committees any proposed conforming amendments to determine \n     the appropriate allocation of legal authorities described \n     under section 412(a)(2) of the Act. The Secretary of the \n     Treasury is also directed to identify those authorities \n     vested in the Secretary of the Treasury that are exercised by \n     the Commissioner of Customs on or before the effective date \n     of this section. This report is due not later than 60 days \n     after the date of enactment of the Act and is provided by \n     this letter.\n       Treasury has identified no conforming amendments needed to \n     determine the appropriate allocation of legal authorities \n     described under section 412(a)(2) of the Act. Under section \n     412(a)(1), authority related to Customs revenue functions \n     that was vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by law \n     before the effective date of this Act under those provisions \n     of law set forth in section 412(a)(2), shall not be \n     transferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security by reason \n     of this Act. Rather, on and after the effective date of this \n     Act, the law provides that the Secretary of the Treasury may, \n     at his discretion, delegate any such authority to the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security and that the Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall consult with the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security regarding the exercise of any authority not so \n     delegated. Based on our review, we have identified no \n     barriers to the appropriate allocation of legal authorities \n     described under section 412(a)(2). As we work with the \n     Department of Homeland Security and others to implement the \n     act, we will notify you promptly if we determine that \n     currently unforeseen legal barriers pose a problem that \n     require a legislative solution.\n       To complete this report, a chart is attached identifying \n     those authorities vested in the Secretary of the Treasury \n     that are exercised by the Commissioner of Customs on or \n     before the effective date of this Act. We are pleased to be \n     of assistance in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               David D. Aufhauser,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the chart attached to the January 24, \n2003, letter of the General Counsel to the Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Senate Finance Committee regarding the authorities vested in the \nSecretary of the Treasury that were exercised by the Commissioner of \nCustoms prior to the effective date of the Homeland Security Act of \n2002 may be accessed at the Finance Committee Web site under \n``Legislation--January 2003''.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Finance Committee Chairman. There is one last \npoint, I think, we should address. First, I would like to add that it's \nmy understanding that the Finance Committee has had jurisdiction over \ncustoms for 188 years, and so I am glad to see today that the \nCommittee's expertise will continue to be brought to bear on the \ncustoms revenue functions and the commercial functions and operations \nof our customs officials. As part of that longstanding oversight, I \nnote that referral of nominees for the position of Commissioner of \nCustoms has been to the Finance Committee. I ask the Chairman, does he \nanticipate that such referral will continue in the future?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator. Under section 411 of the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002, there is established a Commissioner of Customs, \nwho shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate. The Commissioner of Customs reports to the Under \nSecretary for Border and Transportation Security. The Commissioner of \nCustoms shall oversee certain functions, including functions performed \nby the following personnel and associated support staff of the United \nStates Customs Service on the day before the effective date of the \nHomeland Security Act: Import Specialists, Entry Specialists, Drawback \nSpecialists, National Import Specialists, Fines and Penalties \nSpecialists, attorneys of the Office of Regulations and Rulings, \nCustoms Auditors, International Trade Specialists, and Financial \nSystems Specialists. Clearly, the responsibilities of the Commissioner \nof Customs encompass customs revenue functions, and commercial \nfunctions and operations, that are now assigned to employees of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. So, in response to the Senator, I say \nyes, it is clear that referral of future nominees for the position of \nCommissioner of Customs, or any position or positions charged with \nresponsibilities similar to those of the Commissioner of Customs, will \ncontinue to be made to the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chairman of the Finance Committee for his \nelaboration of the provisions that have been added to clarify the \nparameters of the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs, and for his description of illustrative and \nnon-exhaustive examples of the types of jurisdiction that will remain \nwithin the Committee on Finance.\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on H.R. \n4520, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.\n  This important legislation attempts to comply with the World Trade \nOrganization, WTO, rulings on the Foreign Sales Corporation, FSC, \nExtraterritorial Income, ETI, benefit in order to prompt the European \nUnion to rescind trade tariffs currently placed on United States \nexporters. It would repeal an export provision in the\n\n[[Page S10816]]\n\nUnited States tax code that has been ruled an unfair subsidy and \ntherefore does not comply with the WTO. In addition this bill seeks to \npreserve jobs and production activities in the United States via the \nsimplification of international tax laws and a mix of investment \nincentives. A $10 million tobacco buyout, minus the Food and Drug \nAdministration's regulation, is also incorporated within this bill.\n  This bill would replace the current export subsidy that has been \nruled unfair by the WTO with a new $77 billion tax break on \nmanufacturing income. Companies will also be able to exclude 9 percent \nof their manufacturing profits from taxation and multinational \ncompanies will receive $43 billion in a variety of tax cuts on their \noverseas income. These tax breaks and incentives are instrumental in \nour attempt to comply with the WTO while ensuring American jobs stay at \nhome.\n  Also included in this package is a landmark change. This bill \ncontains provisions to terminate the Federal tobacco quota program. \nThis tobacco quota program was created during the 1930s and has \nprovided controls on the production of tobacco for decades. And it has \nworked well. However, since 1998 tobacco quotas have been cut by over \n50 percent leaving tobacco farmers with no where to turn. This package \nprovides compensation for those farmers and quota holders who have lost \nover half of their assets through no fault of their own.\n  Compensation of $7 to quota owners and $3 to producers based on the \n2002 effective quota level is provided in this package while at the \nsame time it keeps producers free of potential burdensome regulations \nadvocated by some in the industry. I am pleased that the funding for \nthis buyout comes at no cost to the taxpayer without granting authority \nto the FDA to regulate tobacco and tobacco products.\n  In terms of the economy, this legislation will have a significant \nimpact on rural Georgia. Mr. President, $607 million will be provided \nover a ten year period. Additionally growers can continue to produce \ntobacco without government constraints and be competitive in the world \ntobacco market.\n  I support the passage of this significant legislation because it will \nbenefit the manufacturing industry in Georgia while ensuring American \njobs are not lost overseas due to burdensome and unfair tax \nregulations. I also support the passage of this bill because of the \nunregulated FDA tobacco buyout provisions that compensate tobacco \nfarmers for assets that have been plundered by the Federal Government.\n  It is because of my son's wedding this weekend in Georgia that I \nregret that I will not be able to actually vote on this legislation. \nHowever, if I was in attendance and able to cast my vote on H.R. 4520, \nit would be in support of this bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to thank the \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee for their \nassistance in getting my amendment on the Civil Rights Tax Review in \nthe conference report to accompany H.R. 4520, the American Jobs \nCreation Act of 2004.\n  The law with respect to the tax treatment of attorneys' fees paid by \nthose that receive settlements or judgments in connection with a claim \nof unlawful discrimination, a Qui Tam proceeding or actions containing \ndamages for non-physical injuries was unclear and that its application \nwas questionable as interpreted by the IRS. It was never the intent of \nCongress that the attorneys' fees portions of such recoveries should be \nincluded in taxable income whether for regular income or alternative \nminimum tax purposes. The language contained in section 703 of H.R. \n4520, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 is intended to clarify the \nproper interpretation of the prior law, and any settlements prior to \nthe date of enactment should be treated in a manner consistent with \nsuch intent.\n  The conferees are acting to make it clear that attorneys' fees and \ncosts in these cases are not taxable income, especially where the \nplaintiff, or in the case of a Qui Tam proceeding, the relator, never \nactually receives the portion of the award paid to the attorneys. \nDespite differing opinions by certain jurisdictions and the IRS, this \nis the correct interpretation of the law prior to enactment of section \n703 as it will be going forward. In adopting this provision, the \nCongress in no way intends to prejudice the tax treatment of \nsettlements or awards made prior to that time and the courts and IRS \nshould not treat attorneys' fees and other costs as taxable income.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10816-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I have been in a lot of discussions today \nby phone, with my staff, and elsewhere, on H.R. 5107, something \nreferred to as the innocent protection act and by others as the DNA \nact.\n  I think we are close. In some ways, it is like the perils of Pauline, \nyou are up the hill, down the hill, if we can excuse, at 10 minutes of \n8 in the evening, mixed metaphors.\n  But this is a bill that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support \nin the other body, from the most conservative to the most liberal \nMembers of the other body. Then there is just a little difference, or \nat the last moment the Department of Justice comes up with some little \nthing they just thought of.\n\n  After a while, one wonders if even with the proven, overwhelming \nsupport--polls show overwhelming support for it; the other body has \npassed it overwhelmingly. I would guess if we actually had a vote in \nthis body, 80 to 90 Members would vote for it. There are always a \ncouple of Members who have some reason for holding it up. I hope we get \nrid of that. I hope we are coming closer.\n  I only wanted to say this for my colleagues both in the House and in \nthe Senate who have been working with me and my staff today and working \nwith people everywhere, from church groups to prosecutors' groups \nthroughout yesterday and late last night and throughout today, I am \nhoping we can settle. That is why I asked the question of the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee, to make sure we reach such an \nagreement at some point and we can move forward.\n\n[[Page S10817]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I pray for these young Americans and their families.\n\n\n               LIEUTENANT David Kingsley Memorial Service\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in just a couple of weeks, on October 23, a \nmemorial will be erected by villagers and family member at Suhozem, \nBulgaria to honor one of our Nation's brave soldiers and one of \nOregon's native sons, Lt. Kingsley. Today, I wish to take a few minutes \nto remember Lt. Kingsley and share his story of great courage and \nsacrifice.\n  The story of Lt. David Kingsley is emblematic of the strength and \npioneering spirit of the earliest Oregonians. Lt. Kingsley was born and \nraised in Portland, OR and graduated from Benson High School. Prior to \nenlisting in the Air Force, he worked in the disaster unit of the \nPortland Fire Bureau--always committed to the service of his community \nand country. During the Second World War, he went to pilot training, \nand then served as a bombardier in a B-17F. He was assigned to the \n341st Bomb Squadron, 97th Bombardment Group, 15th Air Force.\n  On June 23, 1944, he was on Mission No. 295, flying out of Amendola \nairfield in Foggia, Italy against the Dacia Oil Refinery in Ploesti, \nRomania. While on the bombing run, the right wing of his aircraft was \nhit by enemy fire. His aircraft took 15 strikes, crippling it as it \nflew over Bulgaria. The attack injured several members of the aircrew, \nincluding the tail-gunner. Lt. Kingsley had to remove the tail-gunner's \ndamaged parachute to provide first-aid.\n  An order to bailout was given; the Lieutenant gave his parachute to \nthe injured tail-gunner and reminded him to pull the ripcord. The last \nairman exiting the crippled aircraft remembers seeing Lt. Kingsley \nstanding in the bomb bay of the plane, making sure all of his fellow \ncrew were out of the plane first. Because of Lt. Kingsley's previous \nflying experience, he jumped into the pilot's seat and tried to regain \ncontrol of the aircraft, which descended and circled the field in an \nattempt to land. Witnesses reported seeing the aircraft dive steeply \nand crash in a field just north of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Lt. Kingsley \nnever got out alive. For his extreme bravery he was posthumously \nawarded the Medal of Honor.\n  Today, one of the Oregon Air Guard's F-15 units is based in southern \nOregon at Kingsley Field, named in Lt. Kingsley's honor. This year \nmarked the 60th anniversary of that fateful day and of Kingsley's \nheroism.\n  At a time when so many young men and women from Oregon and all across \nthe Nation are fighting overseas, we honor their service. And we must \nalso remember to honor the service of these veterans--some of whom, \nlike Lt. Kingsley, have made the ultimate sacrifice--so that we can \nlive in freedom and continue to pursue our dreams. We do not forget and \nwill not forget them, and we are forever grateful for their honorable \nservice to and sacrifices for our Nation.\n\n\n                        Sergeant Joshua J. Skvor\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a fellow Iowan \nand a dedicated serviceman, Sergeant Joshua J. Skvor, of Cedar Rapids, \nIA. It is my sad duty to inform the Senate that Sgt. Skvor, a member of \nthe Iowa National Guard, lost his life when the truck he was driving \nwas involved in a collision with another vehicle north of Amana, IA. My \ndeepest sympathy goes out to his family and friends. Sgt. Skvor was \nassigned to the Iowa Army National Guard's Headquarters and \nHeadquarters Company, 234th Signal Battalion, stationed in Cedar \nRapids. He is survived by his mother and father, Rachel and Joseph \nSkvor. They can be very proud of their son.\n  Though not currently serving on Federal active duty, Sgt. Skvor had \nrecently returned from a 14-month deployment in Iraq in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. As we mourn his tragic loss, it is fitting \nthat we pay tribute to his service to his country. He will be missed by \nhis fellow soldiers as well as all those who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10818-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CORRAL DRIVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncongratulate the Corral Drive Elementary School in Rapid City for being \nrecognized by the U.S. Department of Education as a ``Blue Ribbon \nSchool.''\n  The Federal Blue Ribbon Schools program recognizes schools that make \nsignificant progress in closing the achievement gap or whose students \nachieve at very high levels. Corral Drive Elementary School clearly \nmeets those high standards. Last year, 90 percent of its students were \nproficient or advanced in reading, and 84 percent were proficient or \nadvanced in math.\n  South Dakota also has one other Blue Ribbon School this year: The \nChallenge Center School in Sioux Falls.\n  If you visit Corral Drive Elementary School--as I had the pleasure of \ndoing last spring--it's clear why the school is so successful. It is a \nlively place where each child's spark of curiosity is nurtured and \nvalued. The walls are covered with students' work and teachers and \nparents are eager to talk about the children's progress. Overseeing it \nall is a thoughtful and energetic principal, Mrs. Nancy Whitcher.\n  Like communities across America, Rapid City has had to cut a number \nof programs for students, in order to meet budget constraints as well \nas the new mandates in the No Child Left Behind Act. The fact that \nCorral Drive Elementary School has achieved such success in the face of \nsuch significant challenges makes the Blue Ribbon School designation \nall the more impressive. Parents, teachers, administrators and everyone \nin the Corral Drive community can be very proud of Blue Ribbon School \ndesignation and, more importantly, of everything they are doing to make \nsure that their children have the opportunity to develop their God-\ngiven skills and abilities.\n  Education is something South Dakotans take very seriously, and we are \nproud of how well our schools are doing. About three-quarters of our \nchildren demonstrated proficient on the latest No Child Left Behind \nexams, and our state ranks among the top 10 in the country on the \nNational Assessment of Educational Progress.\n  Good, strong public schools like Corral Drive are pillars of hope. \nThey are also the cornerstone of American democracy. They are what has \nhelped America create the most innovative, powerful economy the world \nhas ever known. It's important to let our educators and parents know \nthat we value their efforts and celebrate their successes. So today, I \nam pleased to send my congratulations to the educators and families of \nthe Corral Drive school. Keep up the great work!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10818-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10818-S10819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATIONS ON 30 YEARS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this month we celebrate an important \nmilestone in South Dakota: The opening of the first Super 8 Motel.\n  In 1974, the first Super 8 Motel opened in my hometown of Aberdeen, \nSD. This motel is a pioneer of the economy motel industry, and a \nperfect example of entrepreneurial success. In its first year of \noperation, Super 8 showed that its founders, Dennis Brown and Ron \nRivett, were surpassing their goals by leaps and bounds--one year after \nits first motel opened, an additional three motels sprang up in the \ncities of Pierre, Mitchell, and Yankton. This unprecedented growth \ncontinued, and today, in Super 8's thirtieth year of operation, this \nsmall business venture\n\n[[Page S10819]]\n\nhas resulted in over 2,000 motels opening throughout the United States \nand Canada.\n  Super 8's success is predicated on the core operating values that \nDennis and Ron instilled in their employees and motel owners: \ncleanliness, efficiency, and friendly service. From its inception, the \nfounders and board members continually strived to better serve their \ncustomers. Some examples of their strong commitment to customer service \nare the implementation of one of the first toll-free reservation lines \nin the early 1970s and the VIP club, which currently has over 7.5 \nmillion members.\n  I will never forget when I returned home to Aberdeen and saw the \nfirst Super 8 Motel: a two story stucco building on Sixth Avenue, \nSoutheast. At that time, very few people could conceive that this \nstart-up business would reshape the hospitality industry. Thankfully, \nDennis and Ron had the plan and the motivation to realize their goals \nand make believers out of ordinary folks in need of a place to stay on \nthe road.\n  After my stays at Super 8 Motels, it was clear that this company was \ndestined for greatness. Super 8 is a true American success story, which \ncould not have been achieved without the hard work and determination of \nDennis, Ron, and all of their hard-working staff. I am confident that \nSuper 8 will continue to grow for many years to come, and I wish to \nextend my congratulations to everyone that has been involved in this \nmonumental effort over the past 30 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10819-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JAPAN AND BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that since \nOctober of last year, the Government of Japan has funded at least 28 \nnew projects in Burma totaling more than $18 million. Some of these \nfunds appear to have been provided directly to the illegitimate and \nrepressive State Peace and Development Council, SPDC.\n  A question many of my colleagues may be asking is: Why is Japan \nproviding assistance to Burma and the thugs in Rangoon when Burmese \ndemocracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other members and supporters \nof the National League for Democracy, NLD, remain imprisoned?\n  I wish I knew the answer.\n  Providing assistance to Burma and the SPDC sends exactly the wrong \nmessage at the wrong time. Assistance to the junta prolongs the \nsuffering of the Burmese people and props up an illegitimate regime, \nheaded by Than Swe, which has tortured, murdered and raped with \nimpunity.\n  It is time Japan gets with the program and pressures the SPDC to \nbegin meaningful reconciliation with the NLD--the only legitimately \nelected leadership of that country.\n  Freedom needs Japan's help in Burma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10819-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MR. CLATIS WALKER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a valued \neducator in my State who is retiring in November after more than 30 \nyears of service to the youth of Kentucky, Mr. Clatis Walker.\n  The education profession is one that people seem to take for granted \nfrom time to time in our society, but its importance cannot be \noverlooked. The impact educators have on future generations is \nparamount. This responsibility is made all the greater when the focus \nis on children with special needs. Mr. Walker has taken this \nresponsibility and welcomed it throughout his career.\n  In 1972, Mr. Walker began his career as a special education teacher \nin Montgomery County, KY. Six years later, he became a field service \nconsultant for the Bureau of Education for Exceptional Children for the \nKentucky Department of Education.\n  Mr. Walker jumped back into the classroom in 1980 when he accepted \nthe position as Special Education Work Study Program coordinator and \nAthletics Director at Bourbon County High School. In 1982, he returned \nto Montgomery County, where he began his teaching career. He spent the \nnext 9 years serving in several capacities including, special education \ncoordinator, early childhood coordinator, chairman of the Northeastern \nBluegrass Education Cooperative Project, and Assistant Principal at \nJ.B. McNabb Middle School.\n  A change in profession occurred in 1991 when he left the education \nfield to become an assistant vice president at Montgomery Traders Bank, \nwhere he was a loan specialist. His absence in the Montgomery County \nschool system was noticed and in 1993, Mr. Walker returned as the \nDirector of Special Education and the Director of Public Relations.\n  In 1999, he was named the Executive Director of the Central Kentucky \nSpecial Education Cooperative. This cooperative aims to enhance the \neducational opportunities for its students by allowing the Kentucky \nDepartment of Education, school districts, and state universities to \nwork together. The important work of this cooperative has taken place \nbecause of the leadership of Mr. Walker.\n  Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and \nrecognizing the career of this outstanding Kentuckian, Mr. Clatis \nWalker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10819-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HONORING LUCES\n\n  Mr. REID.

This day will focus attention on an important health \nchallenge facing the Latino community, and on how we can help the \ncommunity overcome this challenge.\n  Latinos account for 14 percent of all HIV infection cases and 15 \npercent of AIDS cases in Clark County. It is critical that we stop the \nspread of this terrible disease. The dedication of LUCES to educating \nand advocating on this important issue in Clark County is commendable.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize several individuals for \ntheir hard work and strong commitment on this issue: Cheryl Ballard, \nMarcia English, Cherie Filler-Maietta, Robbie Keeley, Ernesto Martinez, \nJulie McCain, Keanu Medina, Molly Puno, Elias Zamorano, and Louise \nZuniga.\n  Please join me in congratulating the members of LUCES for their work \nto promote public health, and in wishing them great success in their \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10819-4", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance.

The entire \nfamily attend the University of Arkansas, making me particularly proud \nbecause that is my alma mater, and Mr. Lucas and three of his children \nhave bravely served our country in the military.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Lucas wrote to me on the occasion of his \nretirement\n\n[[Page S10820]]\n\nand asked that I write to each of his family members in an effort to \nshow them how grateful he is for their love and support over the last \n26 year.

Throughout my entire \ntime in the military, they have always been there to support me and \nprovide that emotional stability during deployments in both peace and \ncrisis. Everything that I have accomplished in the military and in life \ncan be attributed to the upbringing, love, and support by my parents \ncoupled with the love and support from my brothers and sister.

Mr. President, last week the Senate passed yet another \nshort-term extension of the 1996 welfare law. This marks the eighth \ntemporary extension--and the third year we have been unable to improve \nthis program that serves millions of needy families. I rise today to \nexpress my disappointment that improving this legislation has not been \nrealized because of efforts by some of my colleagues to undermine the \nprinciples and goals of reform.\n  I think we can all agree that welfare reform has been one of the most \nsuccessful social policy reforms in U.S. history. The 1996 welfare \nreform legislation made remarkable headway in helping welfare \ndependents move toward self-sufficiency. It dramatically reduced State \nwelfare caseloads, reduced child poverty, and increased employment. But \nthere is still room for improvement.\n  It is a misfortune that we had to pass yet another short-term \nextension that doesn't give States the certainty they need to best plan \nfor the future. We passed this welfare extension because we had to--it \nbought us another 6 months in the hopes that we can finally act on a \nbroader welfare reform bill in the 109th Congress.\n  We want more welfare recipients to prepare for work, which is the \ntrue path off welfare. We want to help more parents marry or stay \nmarried, which helps them and helps their children. We want to help \nmore parents get ready for full-time work, which is what it takes to \nlift families out of poverty. We want to provide more child care, so \nmore parents can go to work knowing their children are cared for and \nsafe.\n  In 2003, I worked tirelessly with my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle to produce a comprehensive welfare reform bill that enjoyed \nsubstantial Democratic support. Many of the provisions in the bill we \nshould have passed in March reflected the provisions in the 2003 bill. \nThis further underscores my frustration with the Senate Democrats' \nfailure to support a comprehensive reauthorization bill, and in effect, \nforce both bodies to fund welfare programs through a series of short-\nterm extensions, without any further improvements.\n  Welfare reform has saved taxpayers money, but it has not been free. \nIt will not be free in the future. The welfare reform bill we tried to \npass 6 months ago included meaningful reforms and resources needed to \nhelp more low-income parents go to work. We understand that parents \nneed to know they have access to quality child care, and the bill \nincluded an additional $6 billion--for a total of $7 billion--in child \ncare funding to support the efforts of working families who need help \nwith this essential assistance.\n  I have seen in my home State of Utah, that many of these parents, \nhardworking people, young and old, end up finding great self-\nsatisfaction in giving their gift of skill at work, at giving \nthemselves to a task at hand so thoroughly, that they have a meaningful \nrelationship with their work. I think we will all agree that sometimes \nit isn't easy to dive into your work with enthusiasm. But sometimes \nthis is necessary and appropriate. That is why I would like to talk a \nlittle bit about its importance, that work requirements are increased.\n  The increased work requirements in H.R. 4 would have changed the core \nwork requirement from 20 hours per week to 24 hours per week. Total \nhours required for a state to receive full credit would have increased \nfrom 30 hours per week to 34 hours per week for single-parent families. \nNow these are sensible, reasonable requirements. Two-parent families \nwould have been required to work 39 hours per week, or 55 hours per \nweek if they received subsidized child care. States would have received \npartial credit if individuals worked 20 hours per week, and extra \ncredit if they worked more than 34 hours per week. Current law provides \nfull credit only at 30 hours.\n  Again, I think these modifications could have made real progress. The \nmore a person sets goals and takes responsibility for the career they \nwant, they will better be able to decide if a particular job fits into \nthe scheme of their life. The harder you work, that is the more hours \nyou work, the more you understand why you're working at a particular \njob and how your hard work is going to benefit you.\n  Another important provision in H.R. 4 was the establishment of a \nmeaningful State participation rate. For years now, States have had no \nreal Federal requirements to actively recruit adults into industrious \nwork and work related activities. Under H.R. 4, States would have been \nrequired to have 70 percent of their caseload involved in approved work \nactivities by 2008. It is important to know that most States currently \nhave less than 50 percent of their caseloads in approved, full-time, \nwork-related activities. Several states are below 25 percent. \nRequirements would oblige States to significantly ramp up their efforts \nto engage a much greater number of families in activities that count \ntoward the work participation rate.\n  Right now, the majority of adults receiving assistance are reporting \nzero hours of activity. I think it is time we recognize that an \neffective participation rate, and by the elimination of the caseload \nreduction credit in the 1996 welfare law, we will encourage people to \ncommit, to careers, to goals, to real recovery. Just half-heartedly \ntrying will not enable a person to succeed, but committing yourself \nwill.\n  For the sake of the millions of families that remain in the welfare \nsystem, we should have been able to come to a final agreement that \nwould have helped Americans achieve independence and a brighter future.\n  Again, I am very frustrated that we have caved to the passage of \nanother short-term placeholder extension. Unfortunately, the remarkable \nimprovements included in H.R. 4 will remain on hold while we continue \nto kick the ball down the field.\n  As time passes, budget pressures will only squeeze tighter and \ntighter. The additional help we could have offered will become only \nharder to come by.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10820-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10820-S10821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WORLD FOOD DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join people from more than \n150 nations in celebrating October 16 as World Food Day.\n  World Food Day brings much-needed attention to hunger and \nmalnutrition around the world. Inadequate nutrition is an unremitting \nglobal health threat. Over 840 million people in the world are hungry, \nincluding more than 300 million children.\n  The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has worked for \n59 years to help both developed and developing nations create their own \nsustainable food supply.\n  Because of the organization's achievements, many people who did not \nknow where their next meal would come from can now live healthy and \nproductive lives. Workers from the Food and Agriculture Organization \nhave assisted farmers in Swaziland with growing new crops to combat \nproblems of hypertension and sugar diabetes. They have offered \nalternatives to more than 2000 poor coca farmers in Bolivia, helping to \ncurb the production of cocaine. Recently, the organization\n\n[[Page S10821]]\n\napproved $400,000 in emergency relief funding for Caribbean countries \ndevastated by this year's hurricanes.\n  The Food and Agriculture Organization is not alone in its effort to \nfight hunger. Last month, the Senate Hunger Caucus, which I cochair \nwith Senators Dole, Lincoln, and Smith, met with Ambassador George \nMcGovern and the Executive Director of the United Nations World Food \nProgram, Jim Morris, to discuss international hunger. We know it is \npossible to feed the hungry and improve the lives of millions of \nimpoverished people around the globe. An additional $13 billion each \nyear, for instance, could meet the most basic health and nutritional \nneeds of the world's poorest people. It is a modest amount compared to \nthe 25,000 lives lost to hunger each day.\n  Several years ago, Ambassador McGovern and the former Senator Bob \nDole called for an international school feeding program. They \nrecognized that we can fight hunger among children in the world's \npoorest countries while also sending them to school. This idea, which \nbecame the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education Program, is \none of the single best policy ideas I have ever heard. We know that \npoor children and families often do not have enough food to eat. We \nalso know that poor children are less likely to go to school. But, by \nproviding food as an incentive to attend school, we are able to provide \nfuel for the bodies and minds of these children.\n  I am pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee accepted my \nrequest to increase funding for the McGovern-Dole program to $100 \nmillion in the fiscal year 2005 Agriculture Appropriations bill. It is \na simple step toward ending an epidemic that leaves children with \nbloated stomachs, emaciated faces, and underdeveloped minds--an image \nthat I will never forget after seeing the devastation first hand in \nsome of these developing nations.\n  As we celebrate World Food Day and the progress of the Food and \nAgriculture Organization and other groups on the front lines in the \nbattle against hunger, let us remember the substantial work that \nremains. I hope this day will spur us on to achieve the vision of a \ntime when abundant food is available to every human being. I look \nforward to working with other members of the Senate Hunger Caucus \ntoward that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10821-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10821-S10822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, October is Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth and as an Alaskan, I welcome this opportunity to discuss a \nproblem my State has been combating for decades.\n  In 2002, more women per capita were killed by men they knew in Alaska \nthan in any other State. During the last 5 years, over 18,000 domestic \nviolence charges have been filed in Alaska, and this statistic does not \ninclude incidences where a women decided not to press charges. Since \n1976, Alaska has ranked in the top five States for the highest rate of \nrape per 100,000 total inhabitants.\n  The epidemic domestic violence and sexual assault rates in Alaska \nconstitute a serious public crisis and our State is dedicated to \nfinding solutions for this problem. In the spirit of that commitment, I \nhelped organize a summit with the Department of Justice to discuss the \nunique challenges that Alaska faces. The summit provided a forum for \nlaw enforcement, nonprofit organizations, governmental entities, health \npersonnel and advocates to come together to openly discuss the multiple \nissues associated with this crisis. The summit covered a wide range of \ntopics, including the role of responders to domestic violence, the best \npractices to implement in communities and the identification of \ntraining needs.\n  The summit gave different entities the opportunity to convene, \ncollaborate, and openly discuss solutions that will help us prevent \ndomestic violence and sexual assault. The summit was a solid first step \nin an ongoing effort in our State.\n  There are no simple solutions to the problem of domestic violence, \nbut we do know that education and programs that take a proactive \napproach can help turn the tide on this issue. This year I secured \nseveral earmarks in the CJS appropriations bill in response to the \ndomestic violence problem that Alaska is facing. Funds will be provided \nto the State of Alaska for a sexual assault/domestic violence \nprosecution unit. Funds will also be available for a new domestic \nviolence prevention project to allow for a comprehensive evaluation and \nassessment of domestic violence cases. Money was also attained to offer \nservices to victims whose lives have been impacted by violent crime.\n  Addressing the public crisis posed by domestic violence and sexual \nassault is a two-front effort. On one front, we are working to meet the \nimmediate needs of the victims of these crimes, ensuring they have the \nresources they need to recover. On the other, we are working on the \nlong term goals of raising awareness and educating the public. Domestic \nViolence Awareness Month is a vital part of that effort.\n  In many cases, victims of domestic violence wrongly believe they are \nresponsible for what has happened to them. We must work to alter the \nsocial stigma associated with being a victim of domestic violence. That \nstigma belongs to those who commit crimes, not their victims. By taking \ncare of victims, prosecuting offenders, and educating the public about \nthis issue, I believe we can begin to end a serious problem that has \nplagued our communities and our citizens for far too long. Many of my \ncolleagues have pledged their support in this effort, and I look \nforward to working with them on additional solutions to address this \nproblem.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President I rise today to mark the beginning of \nNational Domestic Violence Awareness Month, NDVAM and to acknowledge \nthe tenth anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA. NDVAM \nbegan in 1987 as a way to draw attention to the problem domestic \nviolence. Seventeen years later, domestic violence is still a blight in \nour communities. As such, we must do what we can to combat domestic \nviolence. A timely reauthorization of VAWA is a critical step in this \neffort.\n  Ratified in 1994 as title IV of the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act, VAWA established protocol and discretionary grant \nprograms that are managed by the Department of Justice, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. As indicated by Congressional \nResearch Service reports, grants administered by DOJ aid law \nenforcement, establish and operate training programs for victim \nadvocates and counselors, and train probation and parole officers who \nwork with released sex offenders. Grants provided by the HHS fund \nshelters for battered women, rape prevention programs, and community \nprograms on domestic violence. Grants also provide funding for efforts \nto reduce sexual abuse of runaway and homeless street youth.\n  VAWA also finances and annually publishes a series of reports on the \nmethods of assessing and preventing gender-related crimes. The findings \nof these studies are used to develop existing programs and create new \nones in areas that require more attention. As a result, VAWA's efforts \nhave initiated critical changes in Federal laws regarding interstate \nstalking, intrastate domestic abuse, the rules of evidence concerning \nthe use of a victim's past sexual behavior, and HIV testing in rape \ncases.\n  Additionally, VAWA instituted a pilot program for safe custody \nexchange for families of domestic violence, as well as a domestic \nviolence task force. These initiatives greatly enhance the enforcement \nof protective orders across state lines. Without VAWA's assistance, \nbattered women who relocate to other states would be extremely \nvulnerable, as would these States' resources.\n  Despite the enormous strides the VAWA has made for victims of \ndomestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, Native American women \nstill experience the highest rate of violence of any group in the \nUnited States. This is of particular concern to the Lakota, Nakota, and \nDakota tribes located in my home State of South Dakota. A Department of \nJustice report titled, ``American Indians and Crime,'' found that \nNative American women suffer from violent crime at a rate three and a \nhalf times greater than the national average. Researchers also estimate \nthat this number is actually much\n\n[[Page S10822]]\n\nhigher, as according to the Department of Justice, over 70 percent of \nsexual assaults are never reported. Many Native American women remain \nsilent due to cultural barriers, a high level of mistrust for white \ndominated agencies, and a history of inactivity by state and tribal \nagencies to prosecute crimes committed against Native Americans.\n  Furthermore, it is important to address the fact that police and \ncourts tend to ignore cases of violence involving Native American \nwomen, due to alleged confusion between Federal and tribal \njurisdictions. Cases involving a non-Native American perpetrator and a \nNative American victim fall under Federal jurisdiction. Tribes do not \nhave criminal jurisdiction over nontribal members even for crimes \ncommitted against Native women on the reservation, and regrettably, \nStates are not effective enough in enforcing tribal protection orders. \nFortunately, VAWA provides victims with access to critical resources by \nestablishing key grant programs that improve the criminal and civil \njustice systems' response to victims, as mentioned above. However, even \nwith the best efforts of antiviolence advocates, law enforcement \nofficials and judicial personnel have yet to reach everyone in need of \nassistance. Despite the successes of VAWA, Native American women are \nstill at greater risk of becoming victims of violence, and the \njurisdictional issues they face only further complicate the problem.\n  On the tenth anniversary of the VAWA, I call on my colleagues to \ncontinue supporting this important piece of legislation. Its \ncontributions to society, while unfinished, are essential to combating \nabuse against women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10822-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOTICE OF CHANGE IN REGULATIONS REGARDING SENATORIAL SUITE SELECTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to announce that in accordance with \nTitle V of the Rules of Procedure of the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, the committee has updated the senate regulations on \nsenatorial suite selection effective October 7, 2004.\n  Based on the committee's review of the 1992 regulations which allow \nmembers up to 24 hours to select a Senatorial office suite, the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration has concluded that its \nregulations should be updated to facilitate the speedy and smooth \ntransition of assigning Senatorial office space. This update includes \nchanging the allowable time for suite selection from 24 hours to eight \nhours. The Committee on Rules and Administration has also streamlined \nthe process for the submission of office layout plans to the Architect \nof the Capitol. The timeframe for submitting such layouts to the \nArchitect of the Capitol has been amended from two weeks to one week.\n  The amended regulations, as adopted appear below:\n\n      Committee on Rules and Administration, United States Senate\n\n               regulations on senatorial suite selection\n\n  Adopted by the Committee on Rules and Administration, September 20, \n          1988, Amended June 17, 1992, Amended October 7, 2004\n\n  The following policy will be in effect for suite selection by \nSenators following the general elections in November:\n  1. As in the past, seniority will determine the order of selection of \nsuites.\n  2. Suite selection will begin promptly after the election.\n  3. The only opportunity for suite selection by each Senator will \noccur when he or she is contacted by the Rules Committee.\n  4. Selection will consist of only those suites available at the time \nof contact by the Rules Committee.\n  5. Senators shall inform the Rules Committee of the decision on suite \nselection within 8 business hours (9 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday through Friday) \nafter contact by the Rules Committee. Failure to respond within 8 \nbusiness hours will be deemed a decision not to move, unless an \nextension beyond the 8 business hours is approved by the Chairman of \nthe Rules Committee.\n\n  6. Senators shall submit an approved office layout to the Office of \nthe Architect of the Capitol within one week after a suite is assigned. \n(This action is critical because reconfiguration of partitions, \ntelephones, and computer terminals are dependent upon the office \nlayout.)\n  7. Senators shall be expected to begin moving into the newly-assigned \nsuite not later than two days after notification that the suite is \nready for occupancy.\n  8. In considering whether to move, Senators should take into \nconsideration the following requirements:\n  a. Modular furniture will not be moved. If a Senator with an office \ncontaining modular furniture selects a suite without modular furniture, \ntraditional furniture will be assigned. In cases where modular \nfurniture is in place, changes in suite configurations should be kept \nto a minimum.\n  b. A Senator's computer equipment will move to the new suite. The \ncentral processing unit will be initially installed in the location \nwhere the previous occupant's CPU was located.\n  c. If a Senator from a ``large'' state elects to move, the extra \nspace due that state may not be contiguous. Committees will not be \nforced to relocate in order to provide contiguous space. The Rules \nCommittee will seek to locate the extra space in a contiguous area, but \nit may not be possible with most suite choices. It should also be \nunderstood that the Rules Committee will not know where the extra space \ndue a ``large'' state will be located until after all 100 Senators have \nselected a suite. Then and only then will it be possible for the extra \nspace to be assigned.\n  9. Senators from California will be assigned the two largest suites \nin the Hart Building as they become available. The choice between the \ntwo suites is to be made by the California Senators. These offices will \nthen be permanently removed from the pool of available suites for \nassignment.\n  10. Every effort will be made to expedite moves, including the \nemployment of temporary staff. However, the reconfiguration of \npartitions, furniture, telephones, and computer terminals requires \nseven to ten days. It is also desirable to repaint while the suite is \nvacant.\n  11. Each Senator (returning and newly-elected) will be informed of \nthis policy immediately after the general election in November.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10822-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10822-S10823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, back in June the Senate took a strong step \nto support intellectual property on the Internet by updating the \nGovernment's most important tool in the fight against piracy: its \nenforcement authority. Unfortunately, the Bush administration, which \nlikes to talk a good game, is apparently not interested in having the \ntools it needs to do the job. This administration has done nothing, as \nfar as I know, to help enact important intellectual property \nlegislation. As a consequence, congressional Republicans are holding up \nand resisting important legislation.\n  The Protecting Intellectual Rights Against Theft and Expropriation \nAct, S. 2237, allows United States Attorneys' Offices to bring a civil \naction against a large-scale copyright infringer. For some unimaginable \nreason, the Justice Department, which cannot issue enough press \nreleases about its newly-minted Intellectual Property Task Force, has \ntaken no interest in or action on this legislation. Apparently, the \nAshcroft Justice Department rejects having the law enforcement \nauthority to stop large-scale infringers and protect America's \nintellectual property from piracy. A Justice Department that has \nreinterpreted treaties and contorted the law to claim vast and \nunfettered authorities for this executive has little interest in \nassembling legislatively enacted tools for copyright protection and to \nstop piracy.\n  For a number of reasons having to do with law enforcement priorities, \nresources and other considerations, prosecutors rarely decide to bring \ncriminal charges even against flagrant infringers. I have encouraged \nthe Department to be more aggressive both internationally and here at \nhome and have praised them when they have acted against infringers. I \nhave worked hard to provide additional resources to our international \nefforts.\n\n[[Page S10823]]\n\n  The PIRATE Act is another important effort in this fight. It provides \nalternative civil enforcement, authority. When a U.S. Attorney's Office \nsees a need for enforcement, but determines that a criminal case is not \njustified, the PIRATE Act would afford the Government a civil law route \nand civil law remedies. There are times when civil proceedings and \nremedies are more appropriate. Until we enact the PIRATE Act, they are \nunavailable. Presently, very few criminal cases are brought and no \ncivil cases can be brought by the Government for these violations of \nFederal law. When you consider that the copyright industry employs over \n11 million people in the United States, hamstringing the Federal \nGovernment by limiting it to criminal enforcement is unthinkable.\n  The Justice Department has appropriately refocused many resources of \nthe FBI and the Criminal Division on preventing and investigating \nterrorism cases, leaving even fewer resources for protecting the \nintellectual property that is such a critical economic engine in this \ncountry. The PIRATE Act will enable other resources, outside the \nCriminal Division of the Justice Department and U.S. Attorney's \nOffices, to help protect intellectual property. This bill removes legal \nobstacles to the Justice Department's effective use of the resources it \nhas at its disposal to fight piracy. The Attorney General should be \nfighting for this initiative. Unfortunately, the Bush administration \nand its Attorney General are missing in action.\n\n  The logic of the PIRATE Act and the reasoned approach it takes to \nGovernment enforcement of intellectual property rights is compelling. \nConsider that during this divisive session of Congress in which \npartisanship was pervasive, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \nSenate passed the PIRATE Act without a single dissenting voice.\n  I urge the Bush administration to get with the program. If you want \nto talk the talk and pretend to support the protection of intellectual \nproperty rights, then walk the walk and work to clear the Republican \nopposition so that Congress can enact the PIRATE Act. Then use that \nauthority as appropriate to help end the theft of intellectual property \nthat is an enormous drag on our economy and so unfair to the artists \nwho created the works by which others illegally profit.\n  The Ashcroft Justice Department issued a veto threat to the SAFE Act \nbefore a single hearing and before any markup of that legislative \nproposal. The PIRATE Act has passed the Senate and we still await the \nfirst word from the Justice Department providing its views on this \nlegislation. The lack of support for enactment of civil enforcement \ntools by the Department of Justice is most revealing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10823-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF DR.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to recommend \nthat Francis Joseph Harvey, of California, confirmed to be Secretary of \nthe Army. I met with Secretary Harvey on October 5, 2004 in my office. \nI found Secretary Harvey to be not only very well qualified, but also \nto have a great deal of enthusiasm for the task ahead. I was \nparticularly impressed with Secretary Harvey's background. He was born \nand educated in Pennsylvania. His mother still resides in Latrobe, PA.\n  Mr. Harvey is currently serving as Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nNetworks and Information Integration. Prior to his nomination by the \nArmy, he served as vice chairman of Duratek, Inc. in Columbia, MD, and \nhas served as the chief operating officer of the Industries and \nTechnology Group for Westinghouse Electric Corporation where he earlier \nserved as president of the Electronic Systems Group and as president of \nthe Government and Environmental Service Company. Dr. Harvey earned his \nbachelor's degree from the University of Notre Dam and his Ph.D. from \nthe University of Pennsylvania.\n  Pennsylvania has a rich Army tradition. Pennsylavnia is home to \nseveral bases, and the Army War College and Military History Institute \nat Carlisle Barracks.\n  If confirmed, Secretary Harvey will no doubt apply his expertise, \nenergy, and enthusiasm to serve the soldiers of the United States Army \nand our country with distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10823-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10823-S10824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SATELLITE HOME VIEWER ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very upset that the Congress has been \nunable to pass legislation to prevent the termination of satellite \ntelevision service to hundreds of thousands households in the United \nStates. In September, I raised these concerns on the Senate floor in \nthe hope of preventing these potential terminations of satellite \nservice. The Senate Judiciary Committee got its job done in June. We \nreported out a great satellite television bill which would have \nexpanded viewing options for satellite dish owners. The other body has \nalso developed a very good satellite bill which I shall discuss in a \nmoment.\n  However, history may repeat itself because Congress has not completed \naction on this legislation. I explained my concerns on the Senate floor \nwhen I reminded everyone that in ``1998 and 1999 over 2 million \nfamilies were faced with the prospect of losing the ability to receive \none or more of their satellite televisions network stations.''\n  These terminations of satellite service will begin just after \nmidnight on December 31, 2004. The problem is that the Congress will be \nout of session during most of the time between now and that termination \ndate. If we are in session for a small portion of that time, it will \nmost likely be during a lame duck session of Congress after the \nNovember elections. There will be very little time to enact this \nsatellite bill with the huge press of business yet to be completed.\n  Many Midwestern and Rocky Mountain states have vast areas where \nsatellite dish owners receive network stations, such as ABC, NBC, CBS \nor Fox, from out-of-state stations because signals from their local \nstations are blocked by mountains or diminished by distance from TV \nbroadcast towers. Thousands of these families do not have any other way \nto receive television signals except by satellite. They do not have \naccess to TV stations over-the-air because mountain terrain blocks \nthose signals, and distance from the broadcast towers weakens the \nsignals. Many residents in those states do not have access to cable TV \nservice because of the rough terrain or the low population density \nwhich makes it economically difficult for cable companies to invest in \nthe needed cables. Without access to network stations via satellite \nbecause the satellite legislation did not pass, and because they do not \nreceive service over-the-air, or via cable, thousands of families in \nthose areas will lose national network service.\n  Since information about subscribers is proprietary it is difficult \nfor me to tell you exactly how many families will be affected by this, \nbut I assure you it is not a small number.\n  The Hatch-Leahy Satellite Home Viewer Extension Act of 2004 was \napproved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in June. All the Members of \nthe Judiciary Committee supported that bill. Similar legislation in the \nother body entitled the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and \nReauthorization Act of 2004, if enacted, would also be a boon to public \ntelevision, the satellite industry, the movie, music and television \nindustries, and to satellite dish owners throughout America. \nUnfortunately, the time is rapidly approaching when it will be too late \nto act.\n  I am especially pleased that both the Senate and the House, H.R. \n4518, bills contain a provision which I worked on with my colleagues \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Sununu and Senator Gregg. We, along with \nSenator Jeffords, introduced legislation to ensure that satellite dish \nowners in every county in each of our States would be able to receive \nsignals, via satellite, from our respective in-State television \nstations. While our two States represent a small television market as \ncompared to some of the major population centers, this provision is \nnonetheless very important to residents in six of our collective \ncounties two in Vermont and four counties in New Hampshire. The Senate \nbill, S. 2013, as reported in June by the Judiciary Committee also \ncontains this provision, which was just included in H.R. 4518, the \nHouse bill.\n\n[[Page S10824]]\n\n  In Vermont this will mean if one of these bills passes--that \nsatellite dish owners in Bennington and Windham Counties will be able \nto receive all Vermont network stations in addition to the out-of-State \nnetwork stations they now receive.\n  The Senate bill was introduced on January 21, 2004, by Chairman Hatch \nand was cosponsored by myself and Senators DeWine and Kohl. When the \nbill was reported out of committee on June 17, 2004, I noted that the \nbill does far more than just protect satellite dish owners from losing \nsignals. I pointed out that the new satellite bill ``protects \nsubscribers in every state, expands viewing choices for most dish \nowners, promotes access to local programming, and increases direct, \nhead-to-head, competition between cable and satellite providers.''\n  I continued by saying that, ``easily, this bill will benefit 21 \nmillion satellite television dish owners throughout the Nation, and I \nam happy to note that over 85,000 of those subscribers are in \nVermont.''\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee-reported bill, and the recently passed \nbill H.R. 4518, go far beyond protecting what current subscribers \nreceive. As I mentioned in a September statement on the Senate floor, \nthe bills allow additional programming via satellite through adoption \nof the so-call ``significantly viewed'' test now used for cable, but \nnot satellite subscribers. That test means that, in general, if a \nperson in a cable service area that historically received over-the-air \nTV reception from ``nearby'' stations outside that area, those cable \noperators could offer those station signals in that person's cable \nservice area. In other words, if you were in an area in which most \nfamilies in the past had received TV signals using a regular rooftop \nantenna, then you could be offered that same signal TV via cable. By \nhaving similar rules, satellite carriers will be able to directly \ncompete with cable providers who already operate under the \nsignificantly viewed test. This gives home dish owners more choices of \nprogramming.\n  In the past, Congress got the job done. Congress worked together in \n1998 and 1999 when we developed a major satellite law that transformed \nthe industry by allowing local television stations to be carried by \nsatellite and beamed back down to the local communities served by those \nstations. This marked the first time that thousands of TV owners were \nable to get the full complement of local network stations. In 1997 we \nfound a way to avoid cutoffs of satellite TV service to millions of \nhomes and to protect the local affiliate broadcast system. The \nfollowing year we forged an alliance behind a strong satellite bill to \npermit local stations to be offered by satellite, thus increasing \ncompetition between cable and satellite providers.\n  Because of those efforts, in Vermont and most other States, dish \nowners are able to watch their local stations instead of getting \nsignals from distant stations. Such a service allows television \nwatchers to be more easily connected to their communities as well as \nproviding access to necessary emergency signals, news and broadcasts.\n  Mr. President, I hope we are able to work together to finish this \nimportant satellite television bill in the few remaining days of this \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10824-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AUTHORIZATION FOR LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Nation faces crude oil prices of \nover $53 per barrel, the Federal Government must commit to helping \nfamilies fight high home heating oil costs. This week, the Milwaukee \nJournal Sentinel projected that home heating oil costs will increase by \n18 percent this winter. Despite the higher energy costs consumers will \nface this winter, States are reducing benefit levels in order to try to \nserve an increased number of households. Congress must act now to help \nlow-income families and the elderly pay for high home heating costs.\n  To combat these high prices, I urge my colleagues to support a bill \nintroduced today by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, to extend \nand increase the authorization of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, LIHEAP. LIHEAP provides a vital safety net for our Nation's \nlow-income households, who spend approximately 17 percent of their \nannual income on residential energy costs. Last winter, my home State \nof Wisconsin received more than $40 million in Low Income Energy \nAssistance and the program served over 112,656 Wisconsin households. I \nstrongly support extending the LIHEAP program and efforts to increase \nthe authorization to $3.4 billion each year to ensure that low-income \nfamilies and the elderly have this crucial support to heat their homes. \nI urge my colleagues to support and pass this important legislation as \nsoon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10824-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10824-S10825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SUPPORT OF ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank members of the Defense \nAuthorization Committee for addressing the Energy Savings Performance \nContract, ESPC, program. Not only did the conference adopt the Senate \nposition on the importance of this program, they went a step further \nand extended the program through 2006. Getting this reauthorization has \nbeen a long process and unfortunately one that will need to be \nrevisited during the next Congress. We could have avoided this \nsituation by simply providing a permanent authorization for the \nprogram, but since we didn't, I believe we should focus on this issue \nat the beginning of the next Congress instead of waiting until the \ncontracting authority runs out in 2006.\n  I want to take a moment of the Senate's time to explain to my \ncolleagues the importance of energy savings performance contracts. \nEnergy Savings Performance Contracts allow Federal agencies to enter \ninto unique contracts through which private companies provide energy-\nefficiency improvements in Federal buildings. What makes these \ncontracts unique is that the private companies are reimbursed for these \nimprovements only through the resulting stream of savings on that \nFederal agency's energy bill. Simply put, if there are no savings, then \nthere are no payments. The Federal Government owns the energy \nefficiency improvements, but pays for these improvements through actual \nenergy savings achieved. The Government retains the monetary value \nequivalent of any savings that exceed the payments to the private \ncompany during the duration of the contract and then retains all energy \nsavings once the contract is complete. Importantly, the Federal agency \npays no upfront capital costs for the upgrade.\n  The authority to enter into these contracts expired last year. To \nensure continuation of the program, several of us in the Senate worked \nto include renewal authority in the comprehensive energy bill. \nUnfortunately, that extension authority was removed from the modified \nversion of the energy legislation introduced by the majority leader. \nOne of the main reasons for this deletion was because the CBO has \nassigned a significant revenue impact to continuation of the program. \nThis scoring occurred even though the private sector energy efficiency \nproviders are required by law to guarantee the energy savings and thus \nprovide no net cost to the Treasury. Let me say this again, unless \nthere are savings, the Government owes nothing. CBO's interpretation of \nhow to score these contracts may be in line with the literal meaning of \nthe Budget Act, but it certainly is not in line with the spirit of the \nact. By allowing these private sector companies to work with the \nFederal Government on installing energy efficiency measures, an \nenormous service is being provided. We are saving energy; the \nGovernment is not required to pay up front costs; and at the end of the \nday, the Government and the American taxpayer gets the benefit of lower \nenergy bills.\n  With passage of this short-term extension, the Senate must now turn \nits attention to passing a permanent extension. The start-stop program \nwe have now is not conducive to getting these efficiency measures \ninstalled. During debate on the fiscal year 2005 budget resolution over \n40 companies and associations signed a letter in support of the ESPC \nprogram. The signatures ranged from USPIRG to the Chamber of Commerce. \nThere are not many instances when you have those two associations \nagreeing on a measure, so I believe the benefits of the program speak \nfor itself.\n  In closing, I want to again thank members of the conference committee\n\n[[Page S10825]]\n\nfor their work and support for this program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10825-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COLONEL ROBERT MORGAN\n\n  Mrs. DOLE.

Not only was he part of our Greatest \nGeneration, he was a true hero, aptly defined as one who inspires \nthrough manners and actions, who leads through personal example and \naccomplishments requiring bravery, skill, and determination. As \ncommander of the famed Memphis Belle during World War II, and at a time \nwhen German anti-aircraft fire brought down 8 in 10 bombers, Colonel \nMorgan repeatedly risked everything for his country. In this extremely \ndangerous environment he piloted the first heavy bomber to complete 25 \ncombat missions in the European Theater, an unprecedented achievement \nand the magic number to be sent home. Colonel Morgan's exceptional \ncourage did not end in the European Theater. He continued his valiant \nservice to his country in the Pacific Theater and again made history \nwhen his B-29 named ``Dauntless Dotty'' was chosen to lead the first B-\n29 raid on Tokyo. A native of Asheville, North Carolina, Colonel Morgan \nrepresented the American Spirit--courage in the face of seemingly \ninsurmountable odds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10825-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10825-S10826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BUSH IRAQ POLICY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have seen the television reports and the \nnewspaper articles, and I have spoken with people who recently returned \nfrom Iraq. I have seen the escalating violence and the chaos that has \nengulfed parts of that country.\n  And like all Americans I have watched the death toll of our young men \nand women in uniform pass 1000. It is now more than 1050, with many \nthousands more who have been grievously wounded.\n  Yet to hear the President and Vice President talk, one would think \nthat everything is going well. The President uses words like ``freedom \nis winning'' and ``we're making steady progress.''\n  There is no question that all of us here wish that were true, but \nunfortunately the rosy picture that the President paints on the \ncampaign trail is misleading and wildly off base.\n  Even worse, the President's statements are contradicted by \nknowledgeable officials in his Administration, by leading Republicans \nin the Senate, and by a growing number of national security experts \nwithin his own administration.\n  Here are a few examples: Secretary of State Powell said that the \nsituation in Iraq is ``getting worse.'' General Abizaid, the top U.S. \nmilitary commander in Iraq, said ``[w]e're going to have to fight our \nway all the way through elections,'' he said, ``and there'll be a lot \nof violence between now and then.'' Senator Hagel said ``The fact is, \nwe're in trouble. We're in deep trouble in Iraq.'' And, according to a \nrecent article in the Washington Post, a lengthening list of career \nmilitary, intelligence and State Department officials believe that Iraq \nis a mess and things are getting even worse, raising the specter of \ncivil war.\n  Faced with mounting evidence that things are going from bad to worse \nin Iraq, what does the President do?\n  First, he attacks the messenger of the bad news by calling the \nNational Intelligence Estimate ``just guessing.'' Next, he ignores the \nproblem by repeating the same old platitudes and wildly-optimistic \nrhetoric. Then he and his political allies accuse those who dare to \ndisagree of giving aid and comfort to the terrorists. When all else \nfails, the President engages in a time-honored tradition here in \nWashington: He changes the subject and deflects attention.\n  This President and Vice-President are masters at changing the \nsubject. They have attacked John Kerry's distinguished military record, \neven though neither of them saw combat and many others in \nthe administration used family connections or deferments to avoid \nmilitary service altogether. In fact, when asked about serving in \nVietnam Vice President Cheney said that he ``had other priorities in \nthe military service.''\n\n  Imagine what the President's campaign would be saying if John Kerry \nhad said that.\n  Why do the President and Vice-President constantly change the subject \nwhen asked to explain why things are going so badly in Iraq? The answer \nis simple. They have been consistently wrong about Iraq, and the \nresults speak for themselves.\n  The President was wrong about weapons of mass destruction, which cut \nshort the U.N. weapons inspections and got us into Iraq in the first \nplace. The Duelfer report found that Iraq got rid of its weapons of \nmass destruction more than a decade ago, that Saddam Hussein did not \nhave the means to develop a nuclear weapon, and that the U.N. \ninspections were working. Yet the White House insists that this \ndevastating report by its own export somehow supports the President's \ndecision to go to war.\n  The Vice President was wrong about our being greeted as liberators. \nThink about that statement, and compare it to the daily--actually, \nhourly--attacks against our troops in Iraq today.\n  The President was wrong about ``mission accomplished.'' More than 900 \nAmericans have died since that famous photo op on the aircraft carrier.\n  The President was not only wrong, but it is hard to imagine what he \nwas thinking, when he told the insurgents in Iraq to ``bring it on.''\n  The President was wrong about Iraqi oil revenues paying for the \nreconstruction. It is American taxpayers who are paying most of the \ncosts.\n  And the President acts as if everything is on track for Iraqi \nelections in January even as the insurgency grows steadily worse and \nSecretary Rumsfeld is talking about holding elections in only parts of \nthe country.\n  Despite being consistently wrong, the President's strategy stays the \nsame--put the best face on it, insist that everything is going \naccording to plan even though there is no plan, and attack the \npatriotism of anyone who dares to question or to criticize.\n  They have tried to keep the media from publishing photographs of the \nplaneloads of flag-draped coffins of Americans who have died in Iraq.\n  They rarely even mention the casualties--American or Iraqi--since \nthat, of course, would mean having to acknowledge the terrible price \nthat is being paid day after day.\n  They treated the Abu Ghraib prison scandal as an aberration--the work \nof a few rogue recruits.\n  They have done their best to hide the policies to subvert the law \nthat were approved at the highest levels of government, and the fact \nthat Abu Ghraib was only one of several locations where foreign \nprisoners were humiliated, tortured, denied the most basic human \nrights, and even murdered.\n  They shut down distribution of a key security report, issued daily by \na U.S. contractor--which U.S. personnel in Iraq have relied on for \ntheir own safety--because the news of escalating violence in these \nreports did not square with the spin being put out by the Pentagon and \nthe White House.\n  Just as the President ignored those who predicted the widening anti-\nAmerican insurgency, he has sugar-coated the rebuilding of Iraq.\n  A year ago, he asked the Congress to appropriate $19 billion \nimmediately, in fact so immediately that he resisted every amendment \ndesigned to ensure the aid dollars would be well spent.\n  The President opposed my amendment to put Secretary Powell in charge \nof the reconstruction in Iraq, causing the Department of Defense to run \nthe biggest nation-building venture since the Marshall Plan. And they \nbungled it miserably.\n  The President opposed an amendment that would have at least required \nthat the aid be paid for out of the President's tax cuts for the \nwealthiest Americans--not left for our children and grandchildren.\n  The President opposed an amendment that would have created tough \ncriminal penalties for war profiteering in Iraq.\n  The President refused to consider any alternative approaches. His \nattitude was ``my way or the highway.'' And look at what a mess it has \ngotten us into. It has been nearly a year since the Iraq supplemental \nwas signed into law, and only $1 billion of the $19 billion has been \nspent.\n  Of those funds, it is estimated that only 27 cents of every dollar \nhas gone to benefit the Iraqi people. The rest has\n\n[[Page S10826]]\n\nended up in the pockets of high-priced contractors and consultants, and \nto pay for insurance and security and other overhead costs.\n  There are serious consequences resulting from this administration's \nhandling of the chaos in Iraq. One, which all Senators are increasingly \nhearing about from our constituents, is the possibility of a return to \nthe draft. If Iraq continues on its downward spiral, there is growing \nconcern that it may be necessary at some point to reinstate military \nconscription. I oppose returning to a military draft, I do not believe \nit is necessary, and I believe it would lessen our military \neffectiveness.\n  Yet the President needs to acknowledge to the American people that \nour entire military forces, including the active Army, the Reserves, \nand the National Guard, are stretched very thin right now because of \nthe choices the President has made. The military is finding it \ndifficult to get new recruits and has resorted to a backdoor draft, \nforcing personnel to remain in the service through so-called stop-loss \norders.\n  The Pentagon at some point might decide that the only way to find new \nrecruits--unless we pursue more sensible policies--would be through a \ndraft. I sincerely hope not. This is only one of the many examples of \nthe life-and-death choices that the Nation faces in prudently \nallocating our resources to combat terrorism.\n  A lot has been said about President Bush's consistency. His campaign \nadvertisements boast that he is a strong leader because he `says what \nhe means and he does what he says.'\n\n  What good is consistency when it means sending 140,000 Americans into \na guerrilla war in a foreign land fueled by religious and ethnic \nhatred, without justification?\n  What good is consistency when it means spending upwards of $200 \nbillion on a policy that has not made us any safer, and that has turned \nIraq into a haven for terrorists eager to kill Americans who they see \nas foreign invaders out to destroy Islam itself?\n  What good is consistency when it squanders the good will that we need \nto effectively fight terrorism, to build a real coalition so the United \nStates is not paying 90 percent of the cost and suffering 90 percent of \nthe casualties?\n  What good is consistency, when all it really amounts to is hollow \nrhetoric that bears no relationship to the facts?\n  The President and Vice-President have been consistent alright--\nconsistently wrong. There is no value in that.\n  The President and Vice President constantly assert that we need to \n`stay the course.' My answer to that is that if you are captain of the \nship and you are heading for an iceberg, you change course. You want to \nget to the same destination, but you do not want to plow into the \niceberg to get there.\n  It is this President's rigid adherence to a misguided ideology that \nhas gotten us into deep, deep trouble in Iraq.\n  The American people deserve better. They deserve competence and they \ndeserve honesty. They deserve leaders who know the difference between a \npolitical decision, and the right decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10826-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AEROSPACE MANUFACTURING\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a troubling \ndispute between two great partners in trade. Boeing Commercial \nAirplances, a pioneer and mainstay in American aerospace manufacturing \nsince 1917, is being injured by subsidies that European governments are \nproviding to its main competitor, Airbus.\n  More than 30 years ago, Airbus was created by the governments of \nGermany, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain with the goal of \nbuilding a competitive airplane manufacturer for the European \nContinent. To help encourage growth by their new company, these \ngovernments began giving Airbus large amounts of money with very \nliberal terms. These subsidies included infrastructure loans, loss \ncoverage, debt forgiveness, money for research and development, equity \ninfusion, and launch aid.\n  These subsidies have allowed Airbus to develop and market a full \nrange of aircraft without incurring full commercial risk. The launch \naid assistance alone, which is essentially no-fault borrowing, has \namounted to over $15 billion and allowed Airbus to undercut the \nmarketplace with lower prices. In fact, if Airbus had borrowed this \nmoney at standard commercial rates, it is estimated that they would \nhave to incur an additional $35 billion on their books today.\n  While subsidies of this sort might be acceptable for a company in its \ninfancy, Airbus has long since grown into a robust and mature \ncompetitor. Airbus today competes in every single airplane market over \n100 seats and is now jointly owned by the European Aeronautic Defense \nand Space--EADS--Company and BAE Systems, the world's second- and \nfourth-largest aerospace companies respectively. Combined, these two \ndefense companies are actually larger than Boeing. In fact, last year, \nfor the first time, Airbus surpassed Boeing in annual aircraft \ndeliveries. Yet, they continue to receive large government subsidies.\n  As much as these subsidies have helped Airbus, they have harmed \nBoeing. Boeing's global market share, based on deliveries, fell from \nnearly 67 percent in 1999 to 48 percent in 2003. In the past 5 years, \nBoeing Commercial Airplanes has reduced employment from 115,880 to \n54,880--that is 61,000 workers who have lost some of the highest \nquality and highest paying manufacturing jobs in the Nation. The \naerospace industry is one of the most competitive sectors of our \neconomy, and it is the single largest positive contributor to the U.S. \nmanufacturing trade balance.\n  The facts are simple. Airbus is a mature company with a full family \nof airplances that can no longer justify these subsidies, and the \nobvious damage to Boeing must be addressed and resolved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10826-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10826-S10827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES OVERSIGHT BOARD\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the 9/11 Commission recognized that one of \nthe biggest challenges we face in fighting the war on terrorism is \nprotecting civil liberties. The Commission said, ``While protecting our \nhomeland, Americans should be mindful of threats to vital personal and \ncivil liberties. This balancing is no easy task, but we must constantly \nstrive to keep it right.''\n  To help keep this balance right, the Commission wisely recommended \nthe creation of a board to ensure that the Government does not violate \nprivacy or civil liberties. Following this recommendation, the National \nIntelligence Reform Act of 2004 establishes the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board. I want to commend Senator Collins and \nSenator Lieberman for recognizing the importance of this issue.\n  The 9/11 Commission has endorsed the Collins-Lieberman Board. \nCommissioners Slade Gorton and Richard Ben-Veniste told the House \nGovernment Reform Committee: ``A Board of the kind we recommend can be \nfound in the Collins-Lieberman bill in the Senate.''\n  Some have claimed that establishing this board will tilt the balance \nbetween security and liberty too far in favor of liberty. I disagree. \nAs the 9/11 Commission said, ``The choice between security and liberty \nis a false choice.'' We can be both safe and free.\n  Throughout American history, in times of war, we have sacrificed \nliberty in the name of security. Now, we are being tested again. The \ncreation of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board sends a \nclear message: This time will be different. We will protect the lives \nof the American people, but we will also protect their liberty.\n  The board created by the Collins-Lieberman resolution is a vast \nimprovement over the President's Board on Safeguarding Americans' Civil \nLiberties, which the President recently created by Executive order.\n  The President's board is chaired by the Deputy Attorney General and \nits members will all be high-ranking Government officials, the vast \nmajority of them political appointees.\n  This board will not be independent because its members are precisely \nthose officials who need independent civil liberties advice. This is \nlike letting a baseball player call his own balls and strikes.\n  I asked Commission Chair Tom Kean about this. He said that, in the \nCommission's view, the civil liberties board should have independent \nmembers from outside the Government who can provide a ``disinterested \nperspective.''\n  The Collins-Lieberman Board will provide that ``disinterested \nperspective.'' The board will be appointed by\n\n[[Page S10827]]\n\nthe President from outside the Government and by the Senate.\n  The board will have the authority to obtain the information they need \nto determine whether the Government is violating civil liberties. If \nsomeone outside the Government refuses to provide this information, the \nboard would have the power to issue a subpoena to obtain it.\n  This is common sense. An investigative body must have the power to \nget the information it needs to conduct an investigation.\n  It is also common. Countless Federal commissions and boards have \nsubpoena authority. I will name just a few: The National Labor \nRelations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the \nFederal Trade Commission, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \nThe Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which has such an \nimportant role, should have the same power that so many other \nGovernment boards and commissions have.\n  The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board will be required to \nshare information about its work with the public. This is a good thing. \nThere should be transparency in Government. The American people have a \nright to know what their Government is doing.\n  As Commissioners Gorton and Ben-Veniste told the House Government \nReform Committee, ``Such a Board should be transparent, making regular \nreports to Congress and the American public.''\n  Of course, at the same time, we have to protect national security. \nThis bill does that. It requires that information will only be shared \nwith the public, and I quote, ``in a manner consistent with the \nprotection of classified information and applicable law.''\n  I want to thank Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman for working \nwith me on the structure of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \nBoard. I offered several amendments to strengthen the Board. Senator \nCollins and Senator Lieberman accepted these amendments, and I thank \nthem for that.\n  As a result of these amendments: the chairman of the board and the \nboard's executive director will now be full-time. It would very \ndifficult for a part-time Board to function effectively.\n\n  Terms for board members will be fixed at 6 years so the President \nwill not be able to fire board members who provide advice the White \nHouse doesn't like.\n  Board members will be required to have expertise in civil liberties \nand privacy issues.\n  No more than three of the five board members will be from the same \npolitical party, which will ensure the board is bipartisan and \nindependent.\n  The board will be able to meet upon the call the majority of the \nboard and a majority of the board will constitute a quorum. This will \nprotect the board from being dominated by a chair who is too close to \nthe President.\n  Board members will be required to testify before Congress if called \nto do so. This will prevent any administration from trying to shield \nthe disclosure of information by claiming executive privilege for the \nboard.\n  The board will be required to file semiannual unclassified reports \nwith the appropriate Congressional committees. Therefore, Congress will \nbe fully informed on the board's important work.\n  In reviewing a government power, the board will be required to \nconsider whether the need for such power is balanced with the need to \nprotect privacy and civil liberties; whether there is adequate \nsupervision of the use by the executive branch of the power to ensure \nprotection of privacy and civil liberties; and whether there are \nadequate guidelines and oversight to properly confine its use.\n  This standard of review will provide the board to follow guidelines \nrecommended by the 9/11 Commission as it reviews government power. As \nthe 9/11 Commission said, the board should ``ensure that liberty \nconcerns are appropriately considered,'' and ``the burden of proof for \nretaining a particular governmental power should be on the executive.''\n  These changes will make a strong board even stronger. The Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight Board will ensure that, as we fight the war \non terrorism, we will respect the precious liberties that are the \nfoundation of our society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10827-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING DR. JIM MARKS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks \ncommending Dr. Jim Marks, who will be leaving the Department of Health \nand Human Services in December.\n  Dr. Marks has directed the National Center for Chronic Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion within the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention since 1995. During Dr. Marks' tenure, the CDC has had a \nsignificant impact on the lives of all Americans through programs to \nprevent and promote cancer's earliest detection. Under Dr. Marks' \ndirection and with the support of Congress, the Division of Cancer \nPrevention and Control has grown from approximately $123 million to \nover $313 million. This growth has afforded CDC the ability to provide \nnational leadership in the cancer prevention and control. Dr. Marks was \ninstrumental in leading efforts to partner with States, territories, \ntribal organizations as well as national, State and local partners to \nmonitor cancer trends; conduct research and evaluate cancer prevention \nand control activities; apply scientific advances and develop strong \ncancer control programs; and to educate public health professionals and \nthe public about cancer prevention and control.\n  Some specific accomplishments during Dr. Marks' tenure include: the \ntotal number of woman ever served by the National Breast and Cervical \nCancer Early Detection Program NBCCEDP, reached 1.9 million in 2003. \nUnder Dr. Marks' guidance, the NBCCEDP has helped uninsured and \nunderinsured women gain access to lifesaving screening and diagnostic \ntesting programs for the early detection of breast and cervical cancer. \nTo date, the program has: provided over 4.6 million screening \nexaminations; diagnosed 17,009 breast cancers; 61,474 precancerous \ncervical lesions; and 1,157 cervical cancers.\n  Expansion of the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) to \ncover 96 percent of the Nation's population. The cancer information \ngathered by the NPCR serve a key role in determining cancer patterns \namong various populations; monitoring cancer trends over time; guiding \nState planning and evaluation of cancer control programs; assisting \nStates in setting priorities for the allocation of resources; and, \nadvancing clinical, epidemiologic, and health services research. The \ndata gathered through the NPCR coupled with information from the \nNational Cancer Institute and the North American Association of Central \nCancer Registries was combined to produce official Federal statistics \non cancer incidence in the report entitled, U.S. Cancer Statistics: \n2000 Incidence.\n  Development and expansion of the National Comprehensive Cancer \nControl Program to 61 programs in States, territories and tribes. CDC \nsupport permits the respective health agencies to establish broad-based \nComprehensive Cancer Control, CCC, coalitions, assess the burden of \ncancer, determine priorities for cancer prevention and control, and \ndevelop and implement CCC plans.\n  Development of A National Action Plan or Cancer Survivorship: \nAdvancing Public Health Strategies, 2003 in collaboration with the \nLance Armstrong Foundation and national experts in cancer survivorship \nand public health. The action plan charts a course for how the public \nhealth community can more effectively and comprehensively address \ncancer survivorship and focus on improving the quality of life for \nsurvivors.\n  Dr. Marks' leadership and direction in CDC's cancer control and \nprevention efforts helped Americans lead more productive and healthier \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10827-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10827-S10828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TAIWAN'S NATIONAL DAY\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nPresident and the people of Taiwan on the occasion of Taiwan's National \nDay on October 10.\n  Despite the lack of formal diplomatic relations between the United \nStates and Taiwan over the last 25 years, the relationship between the \ntwo countries has continued to flourish in terms of economics, \npolitics, security, culture and education, science and technology, and \nhuman rights. Most important, we share with Taiwan the core values of\n\n[[Page S10828]]\n\ndemocracy and freedom. In the past two decades, Taiwan has truly \nemerged as a model democracy. Taiwan's economy currently ranks as the \nl6th largest in the world. As Secretary of State Colin Powell stated, \n``Taiwan has become a resilient economy, a vibrant democracy and a \ngenerous contributor to the international community.'' I hope that we \nwill continue to help Taiwan proceed on the path toward further \ndemocratization and peaceful relations with its neighbors.\n  The President of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian, is a dedicated and strong \nleader for the people of Taiwan. In his May 20 inaugural address to his \npeople, he reiterated his commitment to maintaining peace and stability \nin the Taiwan Strait, which is vital to the political development and \neconomic prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region as a whole.\n  In closing, I wish to congratulate President Chen, the Taiwan \nAmbassador, Dr. David Lee, and the people of Taiwan on their National \nDay and wish them every success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10828-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DETENTION AND HUMANE TREATMENT OF CAPTURED TERRORISTS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about, section 514 of the \nNational Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 which deals with the detention \nand humane treatment of captured terrorists.\n  Section 514 was added to the bill as a result of an amendment offered \nby Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman. I commend them for their \nleadership on this issue, which is so important to our country, and to \nour ability to fight an effective war on terrorism.\n  The 9/11 Commission correctly concluded that the Iraqi prisoner abuse \nscandal has negatively affected our ability to combat the terrorist \nthreat. The Commission wrote, ``Allegations that the United States \nabused prisoners in its custody make it harder to build the diplomatic, \npolitical, and military alliances the government will need [to fight \nthe war on terrorism].''\n  As a result, the Commission recommended, ``The United States should \nengage its friends to develop a common coalition approach toward the \ndetention and humane treatment of captured terrorists.'' In order to \ndevelop a coalition policy on the humane treatment of captured \nterrorists, the U.S. government must have its own policy that ensures \nthe humane treatment of captured terrorists. That is what section 514 \nwould require.\n  It will reaffirm a very important, long-standing position of our \nNation: that the United States will not engage in torture or cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment. This is a standard that is embodied in \nthe U.S. Constitution and in numerous international agreements which \nthe United States has ratified.\n  Section 514 will require the Defense Secretary and the National \nIntelligence Director, NID, issue policies to ensure compliance with \nthis standard and to provide these policies to Congress.\n  The Defense Secretary and the NID will also be required to report to \nCongress on any suspected violations of the prohibition on torture or \ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\n  Section 514 specifically provides that this information should be \nprovided to Congress only in a manner and form that would protect \nnational security.\n  Section 514 is very similar to an amendment that I offered to this \nyear's Defense Authorization bill. My amendment, which was cosponsored \nby Senators McCain, Levin, Specter, Feinstein, Leahy, and Kennedy, was \nadopted by the Senate by a unanimous voice vote.\n  When I offered this amendment, it was supported by a broad coalition \nof organizations and individuals, including human rights organizations \nlike Human Rights Watch, religious institutions like the Catholic \nChurch and the Episcopal Church, and military officers.\n  Retired RADM John Hutson was the Judge Advocate General, the top \nlawyer in the Navy. In a letter in support of the amendment, he wrote:\n\n       It is absolutely necessary that the United States maintain \n     the high ground in this area and that Congress take a firm \n     stand on the issue. . . . It is critical that we remain \n     steadfast in our absolute opposition to torture and [cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading treatment].\n\n  Former Republican Congressman Pete Peterson, who was a POW in Vietnam \nfor 6\\1/2\\ years, wrote in support of the amendment:\n\n       From my 6\\1/2\\ years of captivity in Vietnam, I know what \n     life in a foreign prison is like. To a large degree, I credit \n     the Geneva Conventions for my survival . . . This is one \n     reason the United States has led the world in upholding \n     treaties governing the status and care of enemy prisoners: \n     because these standards also protect us . . . We need \n     absolute clarity that America will continue to set the gold \n     standard in the treatment of prisoners in wartime.\n\n  As we fight the war on terrorism, we must adhere to the ideals that \nmade our country great. Torture is inconsistent with the principles of \nliberty and the rule of law that underpin our Constitution.\n  Any erosion in these standards would endanger American servicemen and \nwomen who might be captured by our adversaries. It would also create \nanti-American sentiment at a time when we need the support and \nassistance of other countries in the war on terrorism.\n  The U.S. Army fully recognizes these practical downsides. The Army \nField Manual on Intelligence Interrogation states:\n\n       Revelation of use of torture by U.S. personnel will bring \n     discredit upon the U.S. and its armed forces while \n     undermining domestic and international support for the war \n     effort. It may also place U.S. and allied personnel in enemy \n     hands at a greater risk of abuse by their captors.\n\n  As the great American patriot Thomas Paine said: ``He that would make \nhis own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10828-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10828-S10829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CALIFORNIA DESERT PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, ten years ago this fall, President \nBill Clinton signed the California Desert Protection Act into law, \npreserving 7.7 million acres of stunning landscape for generations to \ncome.\n  With the passage of this legislation, the largest parks and \nwilderness bill to impact the lower 48 States was enacted, thereby \nestablishing Joshua Tree National Park, Death Valley National Park and \nthe Mojave National Preserve.\n  Protecting these beautiful lands stands as one of my proudest \nlegislative accomplishments to this day.\n  The California Desert is home to remarkable archaeology, beauty and \nwildlife--some of the last remaining dinosaur tracks, Native American \npetroglyphs, abundant spring wildflowers, and threatened species \nincluding the bighorn sheep and the desert tortoise, an animal known to \nlive for as many as 100 years.\n  And each of the parks created by the act has its own unique beauty. \nJoshua Tree, encompassing parts of both the Mojave Desert and the \nColorado Desert, contains magnificent rock formations and forests which \nblanket the high country throughout the park. The abundant yellow \ncreosote bushes of the eastern side of the park are mirrored by the \nrugged Joshua Trees to the west.\n  The Death Valley landscape, marked by a diverse range of salt playas, \nalpine forests, and jagged rocks, is a land of extremes--one of the \nhottest, driest, and lowest places on Earth. At Dante's View, a visitor \nmay look down into Badwater, the lowest place in the western hemisphere \nand, on a clear day, look west to Mt. Whitney, the highest point in the \nlower 48 States.\n  Mojave National Preserve, with its granite, limestone, and \nmetamorphic rocks, has a remarkable geological diversity, as well as \nthe largest Joshua Tree forest in the world. Many of the preserve's \npeaks are a vivid pink at the top, the result of a volcanic explosion \nmore than 18 million years ago in Arizona that sent deposits flying \nthrough the air and flowing across the land to the Mojave Desert.\n  The California Desert Protection Act ensured that these lands would \nbe preserved for years to come. In total, the act raised the protection \nlevel for 9 million acres of parks and wilderness.\n  Since 2000 the wilderness area has been expanded even further with \nthe purchase of nearly 600,000 acres of land primarily in and around \nthe Mojave National Preserve. The transaction, the largest conservation \nacquisition of private lands in U.S. history, combined Federal Land and \nWater Conservation\n\n[[Page S10829]]\n\nFund appropriations with funding from the Wildlands Conservancy to buy \ndiscounted land owned by the Catellus Development Corporation.\n  This expansion protected 200,000 acres of critical habitat for the \nendangered desert tortoise, 150,000 acres for bighorn sheep, the \nlargest cactus gardens in the world at Bigelow Cholla Gardens and \nrights-of-way for 165 trails and access roads leading to 3.7 million \nadditional acres of land used for hunting, hiking and camping.\n  Visitors have taken advantage of these abundant recreation and \nresearch opportunities in the California Desert. Last year, 2.8 million \npeople traveled to Joshua Tree and Death Valley national parks and the \nMojave National Preserve. In turn, these visitors provided an economic \nboost of approximately $100 million at nearby hotels, restaurants, and \nother local businesses.\n\n  Now, as we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the California Desert \nProtection Act, the preservation of our national park system has never \nbeen more important. Population growth, especially in the western \nUnited States, is placing increased pressure on our public lands. That \nis why it was so critical that we acted 10 years ago and why it is \nurgent that we continue to preserve our Nation's natural treasures \ntoday.\n  Unfortunately, there is much evidence that our national parks are not \nreceiving the funding or attention they deserve. A recent survey of 12 \nnational parks by the Coalition of Concerned National Park Service \nRetirees found that six parks had either reduced or planned to reduce \nvisitor center hours or days of operation. The survey also found that \nall twelve parks had recently cut full-time or seasonal staff \npositions.\n  One of the parks surveyed, Death Valley, reduced its law enforcement \npositions from 23 several years ago to 15 at the time of the study. \nMore than 600 miles of backcountry roads are inadequately secured \nleaving natural resources, wildlife and visitors less safe.\n  Meanwhile, the backlog of maintenance projects in our parks has grown \nto a range of $4 billion to $6.8 billion, according to the Government \nAccountability Office. Throughout our national park system, roads, \nbridges, and historic structures are falling into disrepair, trails and \ncampgrounds are poorly maintained, and visitor centers are becoming \noutdated.\n  Additionally, a recent report by the Environmental Protection Agency \ndesignated eight national parks, including Joshua Tree, as containing \nexcessively high levels of ozone. It is alarming to know that the air \nat some of our national parks is harmful, especially since the problem \nof poor air quality in these regions was identified for action under \nthe Clean Air Act in 1977.\n  Our national parks are America's natural treasures. They make the \nbeauty of our Nation accessible to all Americans and, indeed, visitors \nfrom around the world. We have a responsibility to preserve these \nplaces for the enjoyment of generations to come.\n  Enacting the California Desert Protection Act was an important step \ntoward that end. Now, we must continue to work to ensure that the parks \nwe have already established, and those we may yet protect, have the \nresources they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10829-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RED RIBBON WEEK\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Murkowski in sponsoring a resolution commemorating the annual \n``Red Ribbon Week.'' Celebrated October 23-31, Red Ribbon Week \nencourages individuals, families, and communities to take a stand \nagainst alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drug use. I hope the rest of the \nSenate will join in supporting this resolution and support this very \nimportant campaign.\n  The tradition of Red Ribbon Week and wearing and displaying red \nribbons started back in 1985 following the assassination of U.S. Drug \nEnforcement Agency Special Agent Enrique Camarena. In an effort to \nhonor his memory and unite in the battle against illegal drugs, \nfriends, neighbors and students from his home town began wearing red \nribbons. In 1988 the National Family Partnership took the celebration \nnationwide. Since then, the Red Ribbon campaign has reached millions of \nchildren, families and communities across the country, spreading the \nmessage about the destructive effects of drugs.\n  In my State of Iowa, this year's theme for Red Ribbon Week is ``Take \na Stand--Help Iowa Be Drug Free.'' Schools and community groups across \nthe State are organizing a variety of activities including pledges, \ncontests, workshops, rallies, theatrical and musical performances, and \nother family and educational events all designed to educate our \nchildren on the negative effects of drugs and promote a drug-free \nenvironment.\n  Research tells us that if you can keep a child drug-free until they \nturn 20, chances are very slim that they will ever try or become \naddicted. This is why it is so important to maintain a coherent anti-\ndrug message that begins early in adolescence and continues throughout \nthe growing years. Such an effort must engage parents, communities, and \nyoung people. Red Ribbon week provides each of us the opportunity to \ntake a stand by helping our children make the right decisions when it \ncomes to drugs.\n  More than 80 million people across the country are expected to \nparticipate in Red Ribbon Week. I urge my colleagues to join us in \npassing this resolution to demonstrate our commitment to raising \nawareness about drugs and encourage everyone to make healthy choices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10829-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10829-S10831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          U.S.-JAPAN RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the contribution \nthat one of America's closest and most important allies is making to \nour Nation's efforts to help the Iraqi people build a safe and stable \ndemocracy.\n  In the very public discussions that we hear every day about Iraq we \noften do not hear about the extraordinary efforts of the United States' \nclosest security ally in the Asia-Pacific Region. That ally is, of \ncourse, Japan. We are all aware of the limitations that Japan has \nimposed on its own military since World War II. What many of us are not \naware of is the actions Japan has taken to work with the United States \nand other nations to bring peace and stability to Iraq.\n  One document published by the Japanese Embassy outlines the \ndeployment of Japanese Self-Defense Forces to provide humanitarian \nassistance in Iraq. Many Americans would be interested to learn that \nthere are about 1,000 Japanese troops in Iraq, including almost 600 \nground troops. In addition, Japan has undertaken a very substantial \nhumanitarian relief effort. Through the end of September, Japan's Air \nSelf-Defense Force C-130 aircraft flew 66 missions between Kuwait and \nIraq and delivered over 175 tons of relief supplies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print that paper and two \nothers--one on Japan's very substantial financial assistance for Iraq \nand the other describing Japan's cultural assistance for Iraq--in the \nCongressional Record. Taken together, these papers demonstrate that one \nof America's most reliable security allies is truly dedicated to \nbringing stability and freedom to Iraq.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Japan's Assistance for Iraq--Fact Sheet\n\n                  (Note: All figures are approximate.)\n\n     1. Overview\n       At the International Donors' Conference on Reconstruction \n     of Iraq held in Madrid on 24 October 2003, Japan announced \n     its financial assistance package totaling up to $5 billion.\n       The package comprises (a) $1.5 billion grants for the \n     immediate needs through 2004, and (b) up to $3.5 billion, \n     mainly in ODA loans, in order to meet the medium-term needs \n     for a period approximately through 2007.\n       It's Japan's policy to make its financial assistance by ODA \n     and the humanitarian and reconstruction activities by the \n     Self-Defense Forces work in tandem for the reconstruction of \n     Iraq.\n     2. $1.5 billion grant\n       In the grant assistance, Japan gives priority to areas such \n     as power generation, education, water and sanitation, health \n     and employment, as well as others including improvement of \n     the security, culture, sports and capacity buildings.\n       Out of $1.5 billion, more than $1150 million have already \n     been disbursed or decided as following:\n       $180 million have already been disbursed. (Attachment A);\n       $490 million have been committed to the International \n     Reconstruction Fund Facility\n\n[[Page S10830]]\n\n     for Iraq of the UNDG ($360 million) and the World Bank ($130 \n     million). (Attachment B) $10 million have been disbursed into \n     IFC small business finance facility; and\n       $470 million worth of bilateral projects have been \n     identified and decided including a new package of projects \n     totaling $290 million announced on 29 June (Attachment C).\n     3. Up to $3.5 billion mainly through ODA loans\n       Japan will provide up to $3.5 billion mainly through \n     concessionary loans (ODA loans) to meet the mid-term \n     reconstruction needs between 2005-2007, taking account of the \n     advancement of the political process, developments toward the \n     solution of outstanding debt issues and the improvement of \n     the security situation.\n       With regard to areas of this assistance, in addition to \n     areas mentioned above, Japan will also focus on \n     infrastructure development, including telecommunications and \n     transportation.\n     A.

Japan's assistance through International Reconstruction \n         Fund Facility for Iraq ($490 million)\n       $450 million has been paid into the respective IRFFI \n     (International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq) holding \n     accounts of the UNDG Trust Fund ($360 million) and the World \n     Bank Trust Fund ($90 million). Additionally, $40 million will \n     be paid into WB TF in the near future.\n       Japan has already authorized UNDG to use $260 million out \n     of $360 million for UNDG TF by signing the document, and will \n     authorize WB to use $40 million for WB TF in the near future \n     (totally $300 million).\n       The relevant international organizations will start some \n     projects in the fields of electricity, transportation, \n     education, water resources, environment and so on by using \n     part of Japanese contribution.\n     C. Japan's assistance through bilateral channel ($470 \n         million)\n       (1)) Following projects totaling $490 million was decided \n     on 26 March and 29 June:\n       (i) Electricity: Provision of 27 mobile substations \n     throughout Iraq and rehabilitation of Taji Gas Turbine Power \n     Station, Mosul Gas Turbine Power Station and Mosul \n     Hydroelectric Power Station.\n       (ii) Health: Rehabilitation and provision of equipment to 4 \n     general hospitals in South (Nasiriyah, Najaf, Diwaniyah, and \n     Samawah) constructed by Japanese companies and rehabilitation \n     and provision of equipment to 4 general hospitals in North \n     (Kirkuk, Arbil, Mosul, Dabuk) constructed by Japanese \n     companies.\n       (iii) Water/sanitation: Provision of 30 compact units to \n     the city of Baghdad, and provision of special vehicles for \n     garbage disposal and sewage cleaning throughout Iraq.\n       (iv) Others: Provision of Armored vehicles in Baghdad and \n     Al-Muthanna.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Embassy of Japan, Oct. 4, 2004]\n\n    Deployment of Japan Self-Defense Force To Provide Humanitarian \n                           Assistance in Iraq\n\n       The total number of Japan Self-Defense Force (JSDF) \n     personnel participating in the effort for the reconstruction \n     of Iraq is approximately 1,000, including up to 600 Japanese \n     Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) troops, several Japan \n     Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) vessels and Japan Air \n     Self-Defense Force (ASDF) aircraft.\n       The third contingent of GSDF was dispatched to Iraq on \n     August 8. These new forces represent Japan's firm commitment \n     to the hands-on reconstruction of Iraq.\n       Japan's ASDF, with its C-130 aircraft, started to transport \n     humanitarian relief supplies between Kuwait and Iraq on March \n     3, 2004. During the period between March 3 and September 30, \n     over the course of 66 missions, the supplies carried amounted \n     to 175.6 tons.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Japan's Cultural Assistance for Iraq\n\n       The Government of Japan (GOJ) is determined to offer the \n     most possible support to the continued tenacious efforts by \n     the Iraqi people, who still face very difficult \n     circumstances.\n       It is important that the Iraqi people maintain hope and \n     improve their prospects for the future while tackling their \n     difficulties. Japan's assistance in the fields of culture and \n     sports is expected to provide moral support for the Iraqi \n     efforts to reconstruct their country. The rich history \n     represented by the cultural heritage in Iraq is a credit to \n     the country, and sports contribute to their solidarity.\n       Cultural assistance may also serve to elicit more \n     understanding of Japan by diffusing soft images of Japan \n     (e.g. politeness, kindness) throughout Iraq.\n       As can be seen from Japan's experience of reconstruction \n     after World War II, it is extremely important and pressing \n     for the future development of Iraq, to improve the quality of \n     education in order to nurture human resources.\n\n\n                        Provision of TV Programs\n\n       (1) Provision of ``Oshin'':\n       ``Oshin'' is a TV drama depicting the life of a Japanese \n     woman who overcame poverty and difficulties before, during, \n     and after WWII. ``Oshin'' has been broadcast in 59 countries \n     and has been very popular in many countries, in particular in \n     Middle Eastern countries.\n       In October 2003, the GOJ (the Japan Foundation), in \n     cooperation with Egyptian R & T.V Union, provided 96 episodes \n     (mainly about the woman's childhood) of ``Oshin'' with \n     subtitles in Arabic to the Iraqi Media Network (IMN) free of \n     charge.\n       (2) Provision of other TV programs:\n       In April, the Japan Foundation provided the TV program \n     ``Project X'' to the Lebanon-based Future Satellite TV. (It \n     is a satellite TV station with viewers primarily from Arabic \n     speaking countries including Iraq.)\n\n\n                           Sports Assistance\n\n       (1) Donation of football equipment by the Japan Football \n     Association (JFA):\n       In November 2003, the JFA donated football equipment (1214 \n     balls, 4853 uniforms, and 394 pairs of spiked shoes) to the \n     Iraq Football Association (IFA). The equipment was collected \n     from all over Japan on the initiative of the JFA.\n       The GOJ provided transportation for the football equipment \n     to Baghdad (under the framework of Grant Assistance for \n     Cultural Grassroots Projects).\n       (2) Provision of football equipment to the southern Iraq \n     including Samawah:\n       The GOJ has decided to provide football equipment (1000 \n     balls, 3000 game jackets, and 20 inflators) to the Department \n     of Youth and Sports in the Governorate of Al-Muthanna (under \n     the framework of Grant Assistance for Cultural Grassroots \n     Projects). Part of equipment provided by the Government was \n     transported from Kuwait to Samawah by C-130H of the Self-\n     Defense Forces (SDF). The handover ceremony took place on May \n     23 at the SDF camp in Samawah. An exchange soccer match was \n     convened between three soccer clubs in Samawah and the SDF \n     team on June 10, using soccer balls provided.\n       (3) Cooperation Relating to the International Friendly \n     Football Match between\n\n[[Page S10831]]\n\n     Japanese and Iraqi National Football Teams on February 12, \n     2004:\n       The GOJ provided travel expenses for the Iraqi National \n     Team members through the Japan Foundation.\n       The GOJ provided assistance for the Iraqi Media Network \n     (IMN) to conduct a live broadcast of the friendly football \n     match so that as many people in Iraq as possible could watch \n     the game. The GOJ also provided coverage assistance to the \n     Lebanon-based Future Satellite TV, which was visiting Japan \n     at the invitation of the MOFA.\n       On February 12, Senior Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs \n     Aisawa held a ceremony to present footballs (the design of \n     the balls is same as that of the balls provided to southern \n     Iraq) to the Vice President of the Iraqi Football \n     Association, Mr. Ahmed Radhi, as a token of appreciation for \n     his visit.\n       (4) Assistance involving Judo:\n       The GOJ, in cooperation with the Kodokan Judo Institute, \n     invited the President of the Iraq Judo Federation (IJF) \n     Sameir S. al-Mousoy to visit Japan from February 22 to March \n     6 as a part of a sports exchange assistance program.\n       Taking advantage of this opportunity, the GOJ decided to \n     provide the IJF with 50 blue judo uniforms for international \n     matches and transportation assistance for judo equipment (100 \n     white judo uniforms and 2 sets of tatami mats for official \n     matches (approximately 200 mats)) donated by the All Japan \n     Judo Federation (AJJF) under the framework of Grant \n     Assistance for Cultural Grassroots Projects.\n       On March 3, Senior Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Abe \n     held a ceremony to present the list of judo equipment donated \n     by the GOJ and AJJF to the President of IJF, Sameir S. al-\n     Mousoy.\n       (5) Assistance for athletes aiming to participate in \n     international competitions:\n       The Government invited Chairman Ahmed al-Samarrai of the \n     National Olympic Committee of Iraq to Japan (April 13-17). \n     Chairman al-Samarrai paid courtesy calls on Prime Minister \n     Junichiro Koizumi and Minister for Foreign Affairs Yoriko \n     Kawaguchi, and exchanged opinions with the officials from the \n     Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the members of the Japanese \n     Olympic Committee on Japan's assistance for the Iraqi \n     athletes aiming to participate in international games such as \n     the Athens Olympics 2004. He then observed the training and \n     other facilities which will accept the Iraqi athletes.\n       Trying to provide hope and solidarity towards \n     reconstruction among Iraqi nationals, Japan is considering \n     the provision of assistance for Iraqi athletes aiming to \n     participate in international games such as the Athens Olympic \n     Games in August 2004, the Pan-Arab Sports Games in September \n     2004, and the Asia Sports Games in 2006.\n\n\n              Assistance Related to Culture and Education\n\n       (1) Assistance to the Iraq National Museum:\n       The assistance for the recovery of the restoration \n     laboratory of the Iraqi National Museum of Iraq (provision of \n     equipment, human resources development, and management of \n     facility) is being implemented based on an additional \n     contribution from the GOJ to the UNESCO/Japan Trust Fund. The \n     Japan Foundation invited Director General of the Iraqi \n     National Museum Donny George to Japan from March 30 to April \n     6. Mr. Donny George held several meetings with government \n     officials.\n       (2) Provision of vehicles for protection of cultural \n     heritage, etc.:\n       The GOJ has earmarked part of the contributions which it \n     provided to the UN Trust Fund to assist the reconstruction of \n     Iraq to be used in cultural projects of UNESCO and a project \n     to provide vehicles for protection of cultural heritage is \n     scheduled to be implemented.\n\n\n                         Educational assistance\n\n       The GOJ decided to contribute approximately $1 million \n     through the Japanese Fund-in-Trust for the capacity-building \n     of Human Resources in UNESCO to conduct research on the local \n     needs and to start emergency assistance (training of staff \n     members and launching of Web sites) for the Ministry of \n     Education of Iraq.\n       The GOJ has appropriated part of the contributions it \n     provided to the UN Trust Fund to assist the reconstruction of \n     Iraq for educational projects of UNESCO, and projects such as \n     assistance for literacy education and capacity building of \n     educational personnel are scheduled to be implemented.\n\n\n  Japan-French Cooperation on Sports and Cultural Assistance for Iraq\n\n       In early February 2004, Special Advisor to Prime Minister \n     Junichiro Koizumi, Yukio Okamura visited France and agreed \n     with the French Government to pursue Franco-Japanese \n     cooperation on sports and cultural assistance for Iraq.\n       After discussions at working levels, Japanese Foreign \n     Minister Kawaguchi and French Foreign Minister de Villepin \n     agreed to move forward on the following cooperative projects:\n       Provision of support, inter alia, for the exhibition of \n     Iraq National Museum and rehabilitation of Iraq National \n     Library and Iraq National Archives.\n       Provision of support for Iraqi athletes aiming to \n     participate in international competitions.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to join the Senator from Idaho in \ncalling attention to the very significant contribution that Japan is \nmaking in Iraq. As a Senator from California, I am privileged to \nrepresent thousands of Japanese-Americans who I know will be proud and \npleased to learn about Japan's critical role in Iraq.\n  Beyond the impressive figures on force deployment, which the Senator \nfrom Idaho has so clearly outlined, it should be noted that Japan's \nfinancial commitment to Iraq, and to working closely with the United \nStates in Iraq, is equally significant. At last year's Madrid \nInternational Donors Conference on Reconstruction of Iraq, Japan \nannounced a financial assistance package totaling up to $5 billion. The \npackage includes both $1.5 billion in grants and $3.5 billion in loans. \nIn addition, Japan will host the Third Meeting of the Donors' Committee \nof the International Reconstruction Fund for Iraq this month.\n  Japan has also made a very significant effort to provide cultural \nassistance for Iraq. One of the documents submitted by Senator Craig \nprovides the details on this undertaking. I was especially struck by \nJapan's reference to its own experience of reconstruction after World \nWar II and the need to ensure that the unifying forces, like those of a \nshared culture and athletic tradition, are nurtured to help the Iraqi \npeople reestablish their own identity.\n  It is also important to remember that Japan's commitment to Iraq was \nseverely tested during a hostage crisis this year. Fortunately, that \ncrisis was resolved favorably. Here's what Prime Minister Koizumi said \non April 22 on that subject:\n\n       This hostage taking has not undermined Japan's firm resolve \n     to engage in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in \n     Iraq. It is precisely because the situation in Iraq makes the \n     activities of ordinary individuals impossible that the Self-\n     Defense Forces have been dispatched to engage in humanitarian \n     and reconstruction assistance in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. President, these facts underscore the very important point made \nby the Senator from Idaho. The United States is fortunate to have Japan \nas a close ally. I yield to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senators from Idaho \nand California for their comments, and to associate myself with their \ndiscussion.\n  The depth of my concern with the subject of Japan's cooperation with \nthe U.S. on security matters goes very deep. I was privileged to have \nserved my country during World War II, and I was as proud as any \nAmerican with the victory we achieved over Japan. However, I am much \nmore proud of the events that have occurred since that war--events that \nhave changed two former enemies into the closest of allies.\n  Mr. President, the post-war actions of these two former adversaries \nis one of history's most shining moments. America demanded and received \nJapan's unconditional surrender. America also insisted on compensation, \nand that was accomplished by the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty. Our \ncountry, however, also recognized that Japan is a great nation, and we \ndedicated ourselves to helping restore its place in the world. Thus, \ninstead of the kind of ``armistice'' or ``cold peace'' settlement that \nonly preserves hostility and resentment, both nations worked hard to \ntranscend their recent past and build a true alliance.\n  As Americans, we have seen this before. Our Nation's first enemy, \nBritain, is now one of our very closest allies. It is inspiring that \nJapan and the U.S. have accomplished a similar achievement and created \na truly strong and lasting alliance. The facts that Senators Feinstein \nand Craig put before us only confirm how strong that alliance is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10831-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10831-S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING FAVORITE TEACHERS\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President. I would like to take this \nopportunity to commend the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign \nWars for their great work on behalf of our military members and \nveterans, and specifically those veterans and military personnel in the \nState of Georgia.\n  For many years, the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars \nhas been involved in supporting our brave men and women in uniform and \ntheir families. Throughout the country many Ladies Auxiliary to the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars are providing support and well wishes at our \nNation's airports as soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines leave and \nreturn from Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Iraq. Members of the Ladies \nAuxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars also help the families of \ndeployed troops meet such challenges as trying to fill the roles of \nabsent parents, learning to stretch a reduced paycheck, and dealing \nwith loneliness.\n  In the last year, the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign \nWars has provided many families and troops with Operation Uplink cards, \nwhich allow our troops to make long-distance phone calls to loved ones \nduring challenging times. Additionally, members of the Ladies Auxiliary \nto the Veterans of Foreign Wars have personally helped deployed service \nmembers' families by babysitting, providing transportation, helping \nwith weekly tasks like mowing the lawn and grocery shopping, but most \nof all by being good listeners.\n  The Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars also provides \nscholarship funds for civically minded youth. Through various \nscholarship funds, the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars \nawards $37,500 annually. Young people benefiting from these awards have \noutstanding achievement in academics, volunteerism, and the creative \narts, and these awards allow them to extend these achievements even \nfurther.\n  The Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars also offers a \nunique program to its members. All members are eligible to receive a \ncancer grant, which is a lump sum gift given to a member who has been \ndiagnosed with cancer. Two Cancer Research Fellowships are also offered \nby the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. These grants \nare 1-year, $50,000 postdoctoral fellowships, which are awarded each \nyear to eligible scientists. The auxiliary provides these fellowships \nso that researchers can devote one year full-time to the challenge of \ncancer research.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me today in commending the ladies \nauxiliary for their service and contribution on behalf of our military \npersonnel and veterans. The Nation should be proud and appreciative to \nhave such an organization active and operating. I am especially proud \nto have them active in the State of Georgia and congratulate them for \ntheir accomplishments and their service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10835-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE CHESTERFIELD COUNTY EMS, POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am honored today to recognize the \nEmergency Medical Services, EMS, Police and Fire Departments of \nChesterfield County. It is through their brave and steadfast actions \nduring the floods of Tropical Storm Gaston that the lives of many \nVirginians were saved.\n  Throughout the evening and overnight hours on Monday, August 30, \n2004, the remnants of Tropical Storm Gaston entered the Central \nVirginia area. Although the weather forecasts called for 1-3 inches of \nrain, Chesterfield County residents found themselves under as much as \n10 inches of rain in some areas that night. As a result, numerous roads \nbegan to flood and several swift-water rescues had to be made in the \ncomplete darkness. These rescues tested the knowledge, skills and \nabilities of the members of Chesterfield Fire, Police and EMS; their \nheroic actions under the extreme pressures they faced that night saved \nmany members of their community from life-threatening conditions.\n  Today, I commend: David A. Stone, James B. Anderson, Richard A. \nHolmes, Daniel Juan Robertson, Jim Fitch, Stuart Smith, Curtis Sink, \nSteve Stump, Mike Larkin, William Smith, Steve Traylor, Chris Harrell, \nBill Jeffords, Mark Berry, Frank Blankenship, Brian Riffe, Jack Speed, \nRoger Warden, Bryce Ford, Brook Keenum, Rick Bucher, Jim Stanley and \nthe many other rescuers from Chesterfield County who saved so many \nlives at their own peril on that fateful night.\n  I am pleased to recognize the selfless actions of these tremendous \nmen and women, which demonstrate the incredible dedication, \ndetermination and courage they have in serving their community. \nVirginia should be proud of the brave work undertaken by the rescue \nworkers in Chesterfield County. Their community is a better and safer \nplace because of the job they did that night and each and every \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10835-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            A TRIBUTE TO REV. DR. JOHN HERBERT SPENCER, SR.\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I honor Rev. Dr. John Herbert \nSpencer, Sr. who passed away on October 1, 2004 at the age of 83. Dr. \nSpencer was a compassionate man whose selflessness and devotion to his \nfaith, family and community will be remembered for generations.\n  Dr. Spencer, a native of Greene County, AL, was born on December 7, \n1920, to Manuel and Annie Eatman Spencer. A graduate of the public \nschools in Greene County and Tuscaloosa, Dr. Spencer also attended \nStillman College and Union Seminary. He became the pastor of Morning \nStar Baptist Church in Holt, AL in 1946 and remained at the church for \n58 years. His leadership and devotion to the church spurred tremendous \ngrowth, including a new sanctuary and increased congregation.\n  He also preached at the following churches: Antioch Baptist Church in \nHulls, AL, Hopewell Baptist Church in Lowndes County, Pleasant Green \nBaptist Church in Whitehall, New Mount Moriah Baptist Church in Tyler, \nand the Old Kingston Baptist Church in Prattville. Dr. Spencer also \ndedicated much of his time and energy to the National Baptist \nConvention, USA, Inc. and the Alabama Baptist State Convention, \nparticularly as Missionary for the Northwest District since 1976 and \nlocally as Record Secretary of the New Antioch Bethlehem District, \nNABD, Association and instructor in both the local and State Congress \nof Christian Education. He was the oldest and longest serving pastor in \nthe NABD Association.\n  Dr. Spencer's influence played a vital role in the completion of the \nNABD Association's Religious Center and the Science Building and \nDinkins Hall at Selma University. He served as both Vice Chairman and \nChairman of the Board of Trustees for Selma University and was \ninstrumental in efforts to secure the school's accreditation. Honorary \nDoctorate Degrees from Selma University, Birmingham Baptist Bible \nCollege and Easonian Theological Seminary are among his numerous awards \nand citations for his contributions to Baptist work.\n  Dr. Spencer married Lillian Brown Johnson in 1946, and they were the \nparents of eight children. He later married Kay Frances Turner in 1980, \nwho survives him. He is also survived by his children: Rev. John H. \nSpencer, Jr. and his wife Debra; Rev. Simeon D. Spencer and wife \nGlynis; Dr. Marjorie Spencer Campbell and husband Willie, Lillian M. \nSpencer; Jannis M. Glover and husband Donald and Dr. Faye Spencer Maor \nand husband Terver. He is also survived by two step-sons: Dr. Otis S. \nJohnson and Paul L. Johnson and wife Angeline; twelve grandchildren, \nand one great granddaughter.\n  Indeed, Dr. Spencer's willingness to share his faith had a positive \nimpact on everyone with whom he came in contact. He will be missed by \nhis family, friends, and the many lives he touched through his \nministry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10835-4", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10835-S10836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OAKLAND LIVINGSTON HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncelebrate the 40th anniversary of the Oakland Livingston Human Services \nAgency. The mission of this agency is to help low-income, elderly and \ndisabled individuals become self-sufficient, and OLHSA\n\n[[Page S10836]]\n\nhas been extremely successful in this pursuit. With over 70 programs, \nOLHSA has assisted over 30,000 low-income, elderly and disabled \nindividuals living in Oakland and Livingston counties become more self-\nreliant, thereby improving their quality of life. Over the last forty \nyears, the efforts of OLHSA have improved the lives and livelihoods of \nMichigan citizens across the two counties.\n  Elderly citizens in Southeastern Michigan can turn to OLHSA for a \nvariety of resources and services. Senior centers, located in Pontiac \nand Novi, provide facilities for older adults to eat nutritious meals, \nattend exercise classes and socialize. The Senior AIDES program \nprovides employment and training opportunities for older adults, \nopening the door to career options that would otherwise be unavailable \nbecause of their age and/or inexperience. Volunteers are dispatched to \nhomes around the community to assist elderly individuals with household \nchores and yard work that they can no longer perform themselves.\n  The Oakland Livingston Human Services Agency also provides support \nand advocacy to low-income families and other struggling individuals. \nIf a family or an individual is in an emergency situation, they can \nturn to OLHSA for immediate help. OLHSA provides the necessary \nassistance to those in need through food banks, emergency utility \nassistance and emergency housing. In addition, the Oakland Livingston \nHuman Services Agency provides long-term aid to the surrounding \ncommunity. OLHSA's Financial Education Program offers informational \nclasses on money management, tax law, insurance options and a variety \nof other topics. It also provides counseling on childcare, nutrition \nand other problems that face the community. Those who take advantage of \nthese classes and counseling sessions acquire the knowledge and skills \nthey need to make it on their own and overcome their problems. OLHSA \nhas worked consistently to reduce the causes and consequences of \npoverty in Oakland and Livingston counties, and I know I can speak for \nmy constituents when I say the people of Michigan sincerely appreciate \nthe good work they have done.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in offering congratulations \nto the Oakland Livingston Human Services Agency on its 40th \nanniversary. We recognize and thank the dedicated staff and volunteers \nwho have made the organization successful over the years, and I wish \nthem many more years of service to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10836-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THANK YOU, SENATE POSTMASTER HARRY GREEN\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since September 11, 2001, outstanding \nmembers of our Senate family have stepped forward to deal with the many \nchallenges this institution has faced. One such leader is Harry Green, \nwho I appointed to be the Senate Postmaster in January 1997.\n  I have known Harry Green all my life.\n  I rise today to wish Harry the very best as he plans to retire yet \nagain at the end of October and return to our native State of \nMississippi.\n  Harry began his career in 1961 with the United States Postal Service \nin Pascagoula, MS. After only 10 years, he was promoted into a \nsupervisory role which led to his becoming the postmaster in \nPascagoula. In 1985 he was transferred to Lafayette, LA, where he \nserved as postmaster there until his retirement in 1992.\n  After I became majority leader, I coaxed Harry out of retirement in \n1997 to become the postmaster of the United States Senate.\n  During his tenure with the Senate Post Office, he has been faced with \ntwo significant biological/chemical challenges, anthrax in October 2001 \nand ricin in February 2004. Because of Harry's experience and demeanor, \nboth attacks on the Senate were met with calm leadership and competent \ndirection and stability.\n  After the 2001 anthrax incident, Harry led the Senate Post Office \nteam in a collaborative effort with U.S. Postal Service representatives \nto ensure the delivery of mail in a safe and timely manner. He and his \nteam have received accolades for their performance and responsiveness \nin combating these threats to the Senate mail service.\n  Harry also has proven himself an outstanding steward of appropriated \nfunds. By utilizing existing resources and without compromising \ncustomer service, he has improved the quality of the Senate Post \nOffice's service, in normal times as well as during crises, while still \nmanaging to spend about 58 percent less than other similar government \nagencies.\n  I wish Harry well as he plans his retirement as postmaster of the \nSenate and leaves the Washington, DC area to be closer to his family. \nHarry has a lovely bride, Ilone, of 42 years, four children and five \ngrandchildren. His post-retirement plans are to return to Pascagoula \nand its picturesque view of the Gulf of Mexico where he can enjoy full-\ntime his hobbies of boating and watching SEC football and NASCAR \nracing.\n  We will all miss Harry's excellent leadership, gentle nature and good \nhumor here in the U.S. Senate. Harry, I will see you, riding our \nbicycles on the beach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10836-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10836-S10837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AN AMERICAN PATRIOT\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an American \npatriot who, although not American by birth, demonstrated the best \nideals of our country. Steen Christian Fischer was born in 1920 in \nCopenhagen, Denmark; he died in August in Boise, ID, and I had the \nopportunity to get to know him during the last ten years of his life. \nSteen had a wonderful outlook on life and believed strongly in freedom \nand opportunity. Prior to the German occupation of Denmark during World \nWar II he served in the Danish Navy. After the occupation, when the \nNavy was disbanded by the Germans, he joined the Danish Resistance and \nwas a part of the remarkably successful evacuation of Danish Jews to \nneutral Sweden. He was ultimately captured by the Gestapo in \nCopenhagen, sentenced to be hanged, and transported to Neuengamme \nConcentration Camp near Hamburg. His sentence was not carried out as \nthe paperwork never arrived. Of 106,000 inmates at Neuengamme only \n55,000 survived. After 9 months in the camp, with the Allied army \napproaching, the surviving inmates were loaded onto a train to be \ntransported to another camp, but he and some friends jumped off the \ntrain and escaped to freedom into the surrounding countryside. He spent \nthe rest of the war hidden in various locations in Denmark. As soon as \nhe could do so after the war ended, Steen emigrated to the United \nStates and continued his quest for freedom and opportunity.\n  In New York State, he met a lovely young woman, Mary Anne Bruun, who \nalso had Danish ancestry, and married her. Together they became the \nparents of seven children--Peter, Anne, Douglas, Barbara, Paul, Karin, \nand Mary. He called his children ``the best thing in his life'' and he \npassed his zest for life onto them. Steen was fearless and wanted to \nexperience all that he could in the world. He told his children he \nwanted them to develop ``wide horizons;'' he was willing to go \nanywhere, do anything for the experience. Steen was the kind of guy who \nwould take the dotted line on the map over the freeway every time. He \nwas successful in passing down that philosophy to those seven children \nwho have lived all over the world and are passing onto the next \ngeneration of Fischers that attitude of ``wide horizons.''\n  During Steen's last decade of life, he spent his time in Idaho where \nhis commitment to freedom and his efforts during World War II were \nrecognized by Idaho Governor Dirk Kempthorne. The Danish government \nconsidered him a hero and awarded him a war pension. His experiences \nwere recorded for the U.S. Holocaust Museum and stand as a testament to \nthe efforts of so many like him throughout the world who are committed \nto freedom.\n  Steen passed away in August of 2004 at the age of 83, having lived a \nremarkable, courageous life. He will be remembered by so many who loved \nhim as well as many who had found freedom through his efforts during \nWorld War II. There is no higher compliment I can pay him that to call \nhim a patriot who found freedom during some of the darkest times in our \nworld's history. He will be missed, but never forgotten.\n\n[[Page S10837]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10836-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10836-S10837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AN AMERICAN PATRIOT\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to acknowledge American pharmacists during American \nPharmacists Month. Pharmacists play an important role in our health \ncare system. Their contributions to the care of our country's citizens, \nespecially our seniors, are key to the health of Americans.\n  Pharmacists are medication experts within our Nation's health care \nworkforce. Each day, their efforts assist in improving the use and \neffectiveness of medications. Pharmacists are improving health care in \ncommunity pharmacies, hospitals and health systems, nursing homes, \nhospice, and in patient's own homes through home-infusion therapies, as \nwell as the uniformed services, the government, and in research and \nacademic settings.\n  Pharmacists work towards making sure that consumers safely administer \ntheir medications, and to provide them with crucial information \npertaining to possible side effects or complications of taking multiple \nmedications. Pharmacists assist in providing the most effective \ncombinations of prescription drugs to those who take more than one \nprescription at a time. Pharmacists are a critical part of our health \ncare system and should be recognized and commended this month for their \nimportant role.\n  During the course of the debate on the Medicare prescription drug \nbill, I introduced a medication therapy management, MTM assessment \namendment, which I was pleased to see accepted in the Senate passed \nversion of the Medicare bill. While the amendment was not included in \nthe version sent to the President for his signature, I was pleased to \nsee an MTM program component incorporated. Establishment of such a \nprogram would allow pharmacists, in conjunction with physicians, to \nassist beneficiaries who have various chronic conditions manage their \nmedications. Pharmacists will be able to help ensure that patients use \nmedications appropriately, enhance the patient understanding of such \nmedications and help reduce the risk of adverse reactions to drugs. \nSuch a program highlights the important role that pharmacists play in \nhelping Medicare beneficiaries to reduce the costs of prescription \ndrugs.\n  As prescription drug prices continue to climb, it is all too \nimportant that we continue to support efforts that will help to \nalleviate this burden. As noted, pharmacists are a critical component \nof our health care workforce and therefore need to be provided with the \ntools that help them to best serve the public, as well as to continue \nto combat the rising prices of prescription drugs. During American \nPharmacists Month, I call on my fellow Senate colleagues to join in a \nbipartisan effort to support our pharmacists by acknowledging and \ncommending their hard work and dedication towards improving the \neffectiveness and overall cost of health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10837-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO VALENTIN J. RIVA\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life of \nValentin J. Riva--a friend and transportation industry leader that was \ntaken from us at far too young an age. Earlier this month, I was \nshocked and saddened to learn that Val Riva had passed away suddenly as \na result of complications from heart surgery. Val was only 50 years \nold. I and many of my colleagues who work closely on transportation \npolicy will remember Val as a truly visionary leader and trusted \ncolleague. Moreover, Val was an extraordinarily dedicated father and \nhusband.\n  Over the last two decades, Val has held leadership positions in \nseveral transportation organizations. Throughout, Val has been an \narticulate advocate for investment in our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure. Val served as vice president of government affairs for \nthe National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association from 1988 until 1991 \nand as vice president and general counsel of the American Road and \nTransportation Builders Association from 1991 until 1997.\n  From August of 1997 until the time of his unfortunate death, Val Riva \nserved as president and chief executive officer of the American \nConcrete Pavement Association. And in his most recent position, Val not \nonly continued to be a powerful voice in the fight for infrastructure \ninvestment, but he also was a strong proponent of making sure that \nadequate resources were being dedicated to advancing pavement \ntechnology and transportation research. We have often heard Members \nspeak on this floor about the deteriorating condition of our Nation's \nroads and bridges. Val Riva recognized that we not only need to replace \nand rehabilitate those crumbling roads and bridges but we also need to \nconduct the necessary research to create new technologies that will \nhelp prolong the lifespan of our infrastructure.\n  Val Riva was also respected by his peers in the transportation \nindustry. Best of all, Val had the rare gift of being both thoughtful \nand funny. He was considered a trusted colleague and, more importantly, \na loyal friend to those individuals that had the good fortune to work \nwith him. I consider myself extraordinarily lucky to be one of those \nindividuals.\n  And while Val was very dedicated to his work in the transportation \nindustry, there was no job more important or rewarding to him than \nbeing a father to Clare, Michael and David. No one ever had a meeting \nwith Val without hearing about his children and hearing a historical \nreference. I express my heartfelt condolences to his three children and \nto his wife, Marti. Val's passing is much more than just their loss. It \nis a loss to the entire national transportation enterprise and the \ngreat many of us that recognized his leadership in it. While we will \nmiss Val's personable nature, his humor and his strength, I and many of \nmy Senate colleagues know that his contributions will live on for a \nvery long time to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10837-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PRAISING THE WORK OF CAROLE EDWARDS AND THE ONCOLOGY NURSING SOCIETY\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI.

ONS established the award this year to \nacknowledge the efforts of the many oncology nurses who participate as \nstate health policy liaisons and other members who are active in \nadvocacy efforts.\n  Cancer is a complex, multifaceted and chronic disease, and people \nwith cancer are best served by a multidisciplinary health care team \nspecialized in oncology care, including nurses who are certified in \nthat specialty. This year alone, 1.3 million Americans will hear the \nwords, ``You have cancer.'' In addition, 556,000 will lose their battle \nwith this terrible disease. Every day, oncology nurses see the pain and \nsuffering caused by cancer and understand the physical, emotional, and \nfinancial challenges that people with cancer face throughout their \ndiagnosis and treatment. Oncology nurses play a central role in the \nprovision of quality cancer care as they are principally involved in \nthe administration and monitoring of chemotherapy and the associated \nside-effects patients may experience.\n  The Oncology Nursing Society is the largest organization of oncology \nhealth professionals in the world, with more than 31,000 registered \nnurses and other health care professionals nationwide. Since 1975, the \nONS has been dedicated to excellence in patient care, teaching, \nresearch, administration and education in the field of oncology. To \nthat end, ONS honors and maintains an historical and essential \ncommitment to advocacy for the public good by providing nurses and \nhealthcare professionals with access to the highest quality educational \nprograms, cancer-care resources, research opportunities and networks \nfor peer support.\n  On behalf of the people with cancer and their families in my home \nState of Alaska, I would like to acknowledge Carole Edwards and thank \nher and ONS for their ongoing commitment to improving and assuring \naccess to quality cancer care for all cancer patients and their \nfamilies. Through Carole's and ONS's leadership, our Nation is charting \na course that will help us win the war on cancer. I urge my colleagues \nto support them in their important endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10837-4", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10837-S10838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S10838]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10837-4", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10837-S10838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S10838]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10838-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10838-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:51 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagrees to the Senate amendment to the act (H.R. 4837) making \nappropriations for military construction, family housing, and base \nrealignment and closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 2005, and for other purposes, and agree to \nthe conference asked by the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses thereon and appoints the following members as the managers of \nthe conference on the part of the House: Mr. Knollenberg, Mr. Walsh, \nMr. Aderholt, Mr. Granger, Mr. Goode, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Kingston, Mr. \nCrenshaw, Mr. Young of Florida, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Farr of California, \nMr. Boyd, Mr. Bishop, Mr. Dicks and Mr. Obey.\n  The message also announced that the House passed the bill (S. 211) to \nestablish the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area in the State \nof New Mexico, and for other purposes, with an amendment.\n  The message further announced that the House has passed the bill (S. \n1134) to reauthorize and improve the programs authorized by the Public \nWorks and Economic Development Act of 1965, without amendment.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 4470.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to Social Security \n     disability and workers' compensation benefits; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Assembly Resolution No. 73\n\n       Whereas, the Social Security Act currently limits the total \n     sum that a permanently, totally disabled worker may receive \n     in federal Social Security disability benefits and state \n     workers' compensation benefits combined to 80% of the \n     worker's pre-injury income; and\n       Whereas, that act, because of amendments made in 1981 to 42 \n     U.S.C. 424a (a), limits the sum of Social Security disability \n     and workers' compensation benefits by requiring that if the \n     sum of Social Security disability benefits and workers' \n     compensation exceeds that 80% cap, the Social Security \n     benefits must be reduced by the excess amount; and\n       Whereas, the stated purpose of those 1981 amendments was to \n     prevent disabled workers form collecting the full amount of \n     both Social Security disability benefits and workers' \n     compensation, which in some cases had resulted in the workers \n     receiving benefits of substantially greater value than the \n     value of their previous wages; and\n       Whereas, rather than just preventing the combined total of \n     Social Security and workers' compensation benefits for the \n     disabled from exceeding the value of previous wages, the \n     amendments, because they do not adjust the 80% cap for \n     inflation, have instead had the effect, over time, of \n     steadily reducing the real value of the combined Social \n     Security and workers' compensation benefits to those injured \n     workers; and\n       Whereas, with sustained, substantial inflation causing the \n     Consumer Price Index to increase more than 30% during the \n     last 10 years and more than 100% in the last 20 years, the \n     failure to adjust the 80% cap often has a devastating impact \n     on the real value of the benefits on which many disabled \n     workers depend; and\n       Whereas, the fact that the Social Security Act provides for \n     the annual adjustment of Social Security benefits, including \n     disability benefits, for changes in the Consumer Price Index, \n     suggests that an historic goal of the act is to prevent \n     inflation from eroding the value of benefits, a goal that is \n     undermined, in the case of disabled workers who receive both \n     Social Security disability and workers' compensation \n     benefits, by the failure of the 1981 amendments to provide \n     for the adjustment of the 80% cap for changes in the Consumer \n     Price Index: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House urges Congress to amend the Social Security \n     Act to provide that the calculation of the 80% limit on total \n     combined Social Security and workers' compensation benefits \n     for permanently and totally disabled workers under the act be \n     based, not on the pre-injury earnings of the workers, but on \n     those earnings adjusted for inflation which occurs after the \n     injuries occur.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to the Men's Health Act; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 744\n\n       Whereas, male morbidity and mortality from preventable \n     causes is substantial, with significant and alarming \n     disparities among subpopulations of men based on race, \n     ethnicity and socioeconomic status; and\n       Whereas, a silent health crisis is affecting the health and \n     well-being of American men; and\n       Whereas, this health crisis is of particular concern to men \n     but is also a concern for women, especially those who have \n     fathers, husbands, sons and brothers; and\n       Whereas, the National Center for Health Statistics has \n     shown that men have higher age-adjusted death rates than \n     women for each of the top ten leading causes of death in the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, men are almost twice as likely as women to die \n     from heart disease, and the incidence of stroke is more than \n     10% higher in men than in women; and\n       Whereas, men are 50% more likely to die from cancer than \n     women; and\n       Whereas, the life expectancy gap between men and women has \n     steadily increased from 1 year in 1920 to 5.5 years in 2000; \n     and\n       Whereas, since women live longer and tend to marry older \n     men, seven out of ten baby boom women will outlive their \n     husbands, and many of these women can expect to be widows for \n     more than 15 years; and\n       Whereas, older women are three times more likely than older \n     men to be living alone, nearly twice as likely to reside in a \n     nursing home and more than twice as likely to live in \n     poverty; and\n       Whereas, more than half of the elderly widows now living in \n     poverty were not poor before their husbands died; and\n       Whereas, studies show that health-related disparities \n     between men and women are due in part to lack of awareness, \n     poor health education and the low number of male-specific \n     health programs; and\n       Whereas, men are half as likely as women to visit a doctor \n     for regular checkups or to obtain preventative screening \n     tests for serious diseases; and\n       Whereas, men's health is a concern for employers who lose \n     productive employees and who pay the cost of medical care; \n     and\n       Whereas, men's health is a concern for Federal and State \n     Government and society, which absorb the enormous costs of \n     premature death and disability, including the cost of caring \n     for dependents; and\n       Whereas, every state has formed a commission to address \n     women's issues or has established a women's health program, \n     but only seven states have a commission to address men's \n     issues or a men's health program; and\n       Whereas, educating men, their families and health care \n     providers about the importance of early detection of male \n     health problems can result in reducing mortality rates and \n     improving the health of America's men and the economy: \n     Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, recognizing that Government \n     health networks can be utilized to promote men's health and \n     well-being, encourage the Congress to support passage of the \n     Men's Health Act to secure access and remove barriers to \n     health care for men and their family members and urge passage \n     of state legislation addressing men's health issues.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-536.

Sec. 3796) has \n     ruled for a second time that Christopher Kangas was not a \n     public safety officer, despite the fact that the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania and the Brookhaven Fire Department legally \n     maintained him on their rolls; and\n       Whereas, this ruling by the Department of Justice has \n     denied his family the $267,000 line-of-duty benefit and has \n     denied Christopher Kangas his rightful place at the National \n     Fallen Firefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg, Maryland, along \n     side his fellow fallen heroes; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Justice ruling not only ignored \n     the facts but also the letter and spirit of section 1201 of \n     the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, which \n     Congress enacted to provide benefits to any firefighter \n     serving as an officially recognized member of a legally \n     organized fire department, regardless of age or type of \n     activities: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the President and Congress \n     of the United States to enact H.R. 4472 which amends the \n     Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to expand \n     the definition of firefighter to include apprentices and \n     trainees, regardless of age or duty limitations, applicable \n     to death or injuries which occurred on or after May 4, 2002; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be presented to \n     the family of Christopher Kangas in recognition of his \n     dedication to the Borough of Brookhaven and the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania as a firefighter; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, to the presiding officers of \n     each House of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-537. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to the Pledge of Allegiance; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 96\n\n       Whereas, one of the founding principles of the United \n     States of America was the free exercise of religion and \n     religious beliefs; and\n       Whereas, the First Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States declares that congress shall make no law \n     establishing a religion or prohibiting the free exercise of \n     religion; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana Constitution of 1974, Article I, \n     Section 8, similarly prohibits the enactment of law \n     respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the \n     free exercise of religion; and\n       Whereas, in celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of \n     Christopher Columbus' discovery of America on October 11, \n     1892, the Pledge of Allegiance was written to honor the \n     United States and to salute the flag; and\n\n[[Page S10843]]\n\n       Whereas, the first words of the Pledge of Allegiance were \n     published in September of 1892, in the Boston-based youth \n     magazine, The Youth's Companion, and in less than one month, \n     more than twelve million school children were reciting the \n     words of the Pledge of Allegiance across the nation; and\n       Whereas, in June of 1942, the Pledge of Allegiance was \n     officially sanctioned by the United States Congress when it \n     was included in the United States Flag Code (Title 36), after \n     almost fifty years of daily recitals in schools; and\n       Whereas, there have been four changes to the original \n     Pledge of Allegiance, and the final change occurred on June \n     14, 1954 (Flag Day), when the words ``under God'' were added \n     with the approval of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who \n     stated, ``In his way we are reaffirming the transcendence of \n     religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way \n     we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which \n     forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace \n     and war''; and\n       Whereas, this display of symbolic patriotism contained in \n     the words of the Pledge of Allegiance is more critical today \n     than ever before in our nation's history and should be \n     maintained; and\n       Whereas, the Pledge of Allegiance, including the phrase \n     ``one nation under God'', reflects the historical fact that a \n     belief in God permeated the founding and development of the \n     United States of America: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Supreme Court and the United \n     States Congress to take all necessary measures to preserve \n     the phrase ``one nation under God'' in the Pledge of \n     Allegiance; be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the chief justice of the United States Supreme \n     Court, the speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the president of the United States Senate, \n     and each member of Louisiana's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-538.

Sec. 470 et \n     seq.) and Section 4(f) of the federal Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240); \n     and\n       Whereas, the State Office of Historic Preservation has the \n     smallest support staff of any office with a similar function \n     in any other state in the nation, but California has the \n     largest transportation program; and\n       Whereas, the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \n     Century (Public Law 105-178), also known as TEA-21, provided \n     funding for additional staff for the State Office of Historic \n     Preservation; and\n       Whereas, review delays at the State Office of Historic \n     Preservation continue to be identified as a bottleneck in \n     moving transportation projects through the environmental \n     review phase; and\n       Whereas, lack of involvement of federal resource agencies \n     in the transportation planning process has been identified as \n     a cause for project delivery delays; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That California urges the President and \n     Congress of the United States, the federal Secretary of \n     Transportation, and the federal Department of Transportation \n     to streamline the federal government review and permitting \n     process by doing all of the following:\n       (a) Ensuring adequate funding for the State Office of \n     Historic Preservation in California.\n       (b) Accelerating project delivery by developing a \n     multiagency infrastructure team to be involved in the \n     development of transportation projects from the early \n     planning phase and continuing through the environmental \n     permitting and construction phases. The multiagency team \n     should include one or more representatives from each federal \n     resource agency with decisionmaking and permit authority. \n     Team members should commit to involvement in the early \n     planning, environmental document preparation, permit review \n     and issuance, and construction phases of a project. Resource \n     agency representatives should be retained with transportation \n     funds, and team members should be jointly selected by \n     transportation and resource agencies. Transportation projects \n     developed using the multiagency team approach would be \n     expected to be completed within review deadlines outlined in \n     the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 and other relevant \n     state and federal regulatory authorities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, and to the \n     federal Secretary of Transportation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-545.

Perkins Vocational and Technical \n     Education Act of 1998 (Section 2301 of Title 20 of the United \n     States Code) has been a significant source of funding for \n     career and technical education programs in California's high \n     schools, regional occupational centers and programs, adult \n     education, and community colleges; and\n       Whereas, California's career and technical education \n     programs educate approximately three million high school and \n     adult students annually in state-of-the-art technology and \n     advanced careers, preparing them to become productive, \n     contributing citizens in a rapidly changing economy; and\n       Whereas, career and technical education is composed of \n     rigorous, demanding coursework that enhances student academic \n     achievement by applying core academic skills; and\n       Whereas, eighty-five percent of students who complete \n     career and technical education programs go on to receive high \n     school diplomas; and\n       Whereas, participation in these programs reduces dropout \n     rates by approximately 35 percent; and\n       Whereas, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical \n     Education Act of 1998 has supported professional development \n     for career and technical educators; including, the \n     integration of State Board of Education adopted academic \n     standards into career and technical education courses, \n     training in new and emerging technologies, and effective, \n     research-based instructional strategies; and\n       Whereas, the Carl D.

A bill to provide that no funds may be expended by the \nUnited States Trade Representative to negotiate data exclusivity \nprovisions for certain pharmaceutical products; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nregarding the way the trade policies of the United States affect the \nability of developing countries to access to generic drugs.\n  The bill addresses concerns that this Administration, through the \nUnited States Trade Representative, is pursuing policies that will make \nit even more difficult for developing countries to gain access to the \ndrugs they need, particularly generics, to treat their public health \nproblems like TB, HIV/AIDS and malaria. This is just wrong.\n  The policies the Administration seeks to put in place are data \nexclusivity provisions. Such provisions tend to benefit drug \nmanufacturers. As reported in The Wall Street Journal and elsewhere, \nwhen these provisions are included trade agreements they essentially \nbar countries from being able to get more affordable generic drugs for \na period of time, usually five years.\n  Trade agreements should be about promoting trade. People in \ndeveloping\n\n[[Page S10848]]\n\nnations who are suffering from such epidemic diseases should not be \ndenied access to affordable medicines because of trade agreements.\n  The purpose of what is known as the Doha Declaration was to clarify \nthat trade rules on intellectual property would not interfere with the \nability of developing countries to take measures to protect public \nhealth. The legislation I am introducing today would prohibit USTR from \nspending any funds in order to impose data exclusivity for drugs used \nto treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or other epidemics, or needed in \ncircumstances of extreme urgency, or national emergency.\n  I am not one to trample on the need to protect trade secrets, but I \ncannot condone policies that inhibit developing countries from being \nable to address their own public health needs. In today's world, it is \nshortsighted to think that infectious diseases cannot cross borders. By \nallowing developing countries access to generic drugs, we not only help \nimprove health in those nations, we also help ourselves control these \ndebilitating and often deadly diseases.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2944\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LIMITATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, funds appropriated or otherwise obligated to the United \n     States Trade Representative may not be expended to negotiate \n     data exclusivity provisions with any country with respect to \n     public health pharmaceutical products or to require actions \n     of another country which interfere with a country's access to \n     public health pharmaceutical products.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Data exclusivity provision.--The term ``data \n     exclusivity provision'' means a provision that restricts for \n     a set period of time a country from approving for sale \n     generic public health pharmaceutical products based on \n     original clinical data of public health pharmaceutical \n     products previously approved for sale.\n       (2) Public health pharmaceutical products.--The term \n     ``public health pharmaceutical products'' means any patented \n     pharmaceutical product, or pharmaceutical product \n     manufactured through a patented process, needed to treat HIV/\n     AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, or other epidemics, or needed in \n     circumstances of extreme urgency or national emergency in \n     accordance with the Decision of the General Council of 30 \n     August 2003 on the Implementation of Paragraph Six of the \n     DOHA Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health and \n     the WTO General Council Chairman's statement accompanying the \n     Decision (JOB(03)/177, WT/GC/M/82) (collectively known as the \n     ``TRIPS/health solution'').\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2945. A bill to permanently eliminate a procedure under which the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives can waive \nprohibitions on the possession of firearms by convicted felons, drug \noffenders, and other disqualified individuals; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator \nLautenberg, to introduce legislation to help ensure that convicted \nfelons are not permitted to legally possess dangerous weapons. The bill \nwould eliminate a discredited program under which convicted felons can \napply to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, ATF, to seek a \nwaiver that allows them to possess firearms or explosives.\n  Under Federal law, those convicted of felonies generally are \nprohibited from possessing firearms. However, ATF is authorized to \ngrant a waiver from this prohibition if it believes that an individual \nis not likely to act in a manner that threatens public safety.\n  Interestingly, this waiver authority was enacted not to permit common \ncriminals to obtain guns, but to assist a company called Winchester, \nwhich manufactures firearms. Winchester's parent company, Olin \nMathieson Chemical Corporation, had been convicted of a felony \ninvolving a kickback scheme. As a result, Winchester was legally \nprohibited from shipping firearms in interstate commerce. The provision \nwas approved to allow Winchester to stay in business.\n  Because the provision was drafted broadly, however, the waiver \nprovision applied to common criminals. Originally, waivers could not be \ngranted to those convicted of firearms offenses. But in 1986, Congress \nexpanded the law to allow even persons convicted of firearms offenses, \nand those involuntarily committed to a mental institution, to apply for \na waiver.\n  Between 1981 and 1991, ATF processed more than 13,000 applications. \nThese applications required some of ATF's best agents to abandon their \nlaw enforcement responsibilities and instead conduct extensive \ninvestigations on behalf of convicted felons. In the late 1980's, the \ncost of handling these petitions worked out to about $10,000 for each \nwaiver granted--costs borne by ordinary taxpayers.\n  The Violence Policy Center investigated 100 cases in which a \nconvicted felon had been allowed to legally possess firearms. In 41 \npercent of those cases, the felon had been convicted of a crime of \nviolence, or a drug or firearms offense. The crimes of violence \nincluded several homicides, sexual assaults and armed robberies.\n  Between 1981 and 1991, 5600 waivers were granted. In many cases, \nthose who regained their gun privileges later used their guns to commit \nserious crimes, such as attempted murder, rape, kidnapping, and child \nmolestation.\n  This program makes no sense. It is not fair to taxpayers, who must \nfoot the bill for ATF investigations. It is not fair to ATF agents, who \nhave much more important things to do. And, most importantly, it is not \nfair to the public, whose safety is put at risk when convicted felons \nare allowed to carry guns.\n  Fortunately, there has long been bipartisan support for blocking the \nprogram. Since 1992, Congress has prohibited the use of appropriated \nfunds to implement it, and President Bush's budget proposes that the \nprohibition be retained. Yet funding bans in appropriations bills are \nstopgap measures that are effective for only a single fiscal year. It \nis time to eliminate the waiver program permanently.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2945\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide additional protections for recipients of \nthe earned income tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Taxpayer Abuse \nPrevention Act. Earned income tax credit (EITC) benefits intended for \nworking families are increasingly being reduced by the growing use of \nrefund anticipation loans, which typically carry triple digit interest \nrates. According to the Brookings Institution, an estimated $1.9 \nbillion intended to assist low-income families was received by \ncommercial tax preparers and affiliated national banks to pay for tax \nassistance, electronic filing of returns, and high-cost refund loans in \n2002. The interest rates and fees charged on refund anticipation loans \n(RALs) are not justified\n\n[[Page S10849]]\n\nfor the short length of time that these loans cover and the minimal \nrisk they present. These loans carry little risk because of the Debt \nIndicator program. The Debt Indicator (DI) is a service provided by the \nInternal Revenue Service that informs the lender whether or not an \napplicant owes Federal or State taxes, child support, student loans, or \nother government obligations, which assists the tax preparer in \nascertaining the applicant's ability to obtain their full refund so \nthat the RAL is repaid. The Department of the Treasury should not be \nfacilitating these predatory loans that allow tax preparers to reap \noutrageous profits by exploiting working families.\n  Unfortunately too many working families are susceptible to predatory \nlending because they are left out of the financial mainstream. Between \n25 and 56 million adults are unbanked, or not using mainstream, insured \nfinancial institutions. The unbanked rely on alternative financial \nservice providers to obtain cash from checks, pay bills, send \nremittances, utilize payday loans, and obtain credit. Many of the \nunbanked are low- and moderate-income families that can ill afford to \nhave their earnings unnecessarily diminished by their reliance on these \nhigh-cost and often predatory financial services. In addition, the \nunbanked are unable to save securely to prepare for the loss of a job, \na family illness, a down payment on a first home, or education \nexpenses.\n  My bill will protect consumers against predatory loans, reduce the \ninvolvement of the Department of the Treasury in facilitating the \nexploitation of taxpayers, and expand access to opportunities for \nsaving and lending at mainstream financial services.\n  My bill prohibits refund anticipation loans that utilize EITC \nbenefits. Other Federal benefits, such as Social Security, have similar \nrestrictions to ensure that the beneficiaries receive the intended \nbenefit.\n  My bill also limits several of the objectionable practices of RAL \nproviders. My legislation will prohibit lenders from using tax refunds \nto collect outstanding obligations for previous RALs. In addition, \nmandatory arbitration clauses for RALs that utilize federal tax refunds \nwould be prohibited to ensure that consumers have the ability to take \nfuture legal action if necessary in the future.\n  I am deeply troubled that the Department of the Treasury plays such a \nprominent role in the facilitation and subsequent promotion of refund \nanticipation loans. In 1995, the use of the DI was suspended because of \nmassive fraud in e-filed returns with RALs. After the program was \ndiscontinued, RAL participation declined. The use of the DI was \nreinstated in 1999, according to H Block, to ``assist with screening \nfor electronic filing fraud and is also expected to substantially \nreduce refund anticipation loan pricing.'' Although RAL prices were \nexpected go down as a result of the reinstatement of the DI, this has \nnot occurred. The Debt Indicator should once again be stopped. The DI \nis helping tax preparers make excessive profits of low- and moderate-\nincome taxpayers who utilize the service. If the Debt Indicator is \nremoved, then the loans become riskier and the tax preparers may not \naggressively market them among EITC filers. The IRS should not be \naiding efforts that take the earned benefit away from low-income \nfamilies and allow unscrupulous preparers to take advantage of low-\nincome taxpayers. My bill terminates the DI program. In addition, my \nbill removes the incentive to meet Congressionally mandated electronic \nfiling goals by facilitating the exploitation of taxpayers. My bill \nwould prevent any electronically filed tax returns that resulted in tax \nrefunds that were distributed by refund anticipation loans from being \ncounted towards the goal established by the IRS Restructuring and \nReform Act of 1998 that the IRS have at least 80 percent of all returns \nfiled electronically by 2007.\n  My bill also expands access to mainstream financial services. \nElectronic Transfer Accounts (ETA) are low-cost accounts at banks and \ncredit unions that are intended for recipients of certain Federal \nbenefit payments. Currently, ETAs are provided for recipients of other \nfederal benefits such as Social Security payments. My bill expands the \neligibility for ETAs to include EITC benefits. These accounts will \nallow taxpayers to receive direct deposit refunds into an account \nwithout the need for a RAL.\n  Furthermore, my bill would mandate that low- and moderate-income \ntaxpayers be provided opportunities to open low-cost accounts at \nfederally insured banks or credit unions via appropriate tax forms. \nProviding taxpayers with the option of opening a bank or credit union \naccount through the use of tax forms provides an alternative to RALs \nand provides immediate access to the opportunities found at banks and \ncredit unions.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Bingaman and Senator Durbin \nfor cosponsoring the legislation. I also thank Representative Jan \nSchakowsky for introducing the companion legislation in the other body. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the Taxpayer Abuse Prevention \nAct be printed following my remarks. I also ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of a support letter from the Association of Community \nOrganizations for Reform Now, the Children's Defense Fund, the Consumer \nFederation of America, Consumers Union, and the National Consumer Law \nCenter, be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2947\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The Association of Community \n     Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), Children's Defense \n     Fund, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, and \n     National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income \n     clients), write to support your bill, the ``Taxpayer Abuse \n     Prevention Act.'' By prohibiting lenders from making loans \n     against the Earned Income Tax Credit, this bill would greatly \n     reduce the scope of abuses caused by refund anticipation \n     loans (RALs), which carry effective annualized interest rates \n     of about 70% to over 700%.\n       As you know, over 55% of consumers who receive RALs are \n     beneficiaries of the Earned Income Tax Credit. In 2002, EITC \n     recipients paid about $749 million in loan and \n     ``administrative'' fees for RALs. These fees divert hundreds \n     of millions of EITC dollars, paid out of the U.S. Treasury, \n     into the coffers of multimillion dollar commercial \n     preparation chains and big banks. It's time to stop lenders \n     from making high cost, abusive loans using the precious \n     dollars intended to support working poor families.\n       Furthermore, we support the ``Taxpayer Abuse Prevention \n     Act'' for its provisions that halt several of the most \n     egregious practices of RAL lenders, such as seizing \n     taxpayers' tax refunds as a form of debt collection and \n     slipping in mandatory arbitration clauses, which leave RAL \n     consumers without their day in court. Moreover, we appreciate \n     the termination of the IRS Debt Indicator program, which \n     would stop the IRS's practice of sharing taxpayer's personal \n     financial information in order to make RALs more profitable \n     for lenders. Finally, we applaud the provisions of the bill \n     that support linking unbanked taxpayers with bank accounts, \n     such as the provision to permit them to open Electronic \n     Transaction Accounts to receive federal tax refunds.\n       Thank you again for all your efforts to combat taxpayer \n     abuse by the RAL industry.\n           Sincerely,\n     Maude Hurd,\n       National President, Association of Community Organizations \n     for Reform Now.\n     Jean Ann Fox,\n       Director of Consumer Protection, Consumer Federation of \n     America.\n     Chi Chi Wu,\n       Staff Attorney, National Consumer Law Center.\n     Deborah Cutler-Ortiz,\n       Director of Family Income, Children's Defense Fund.\n     Shelley Curran,\n       Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2950. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprohibit payments to States under the medicaid program for redispensing \nprescription drugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nclose a gaping loophole in the Medicaid law that allows pharmacies to \ndouble bill the Medicaid program for prescription drugs.\n  As you may know, many States are now encouraging or requiring health \ncare facilities to return unused prescription drugs for Medicaid \npatients to pharmacies for re-dispensing as a way to save money. These \ndrugs go unused because a nursing home patient has died, the \nprescription was incorrect, or the patient no longer needs the drugs.\n  Certainly, we should encourage states and pharmacies to re-dispense \nrather than simply discard these prescription drugs. However, while \nsome States, including Connecticut, Missouri, and Texas, have laws that \nrequire pharmacies that re-stock drugs for re-dispensing to credit the \nState Medicaid program, many, including New Jersey, do not. This has \nresulted in pharmacy companies double charging Medicaid--for the sale \nand resale--of the restocked drugs.\n  We have an obligation to close this loophole. At a time in which all \n50 States are proposing cuts to their Medicaid programs because of \nskyrocketing costs and the burden of these costs on the Federal \nGovernment continues to grow, we must eliminate such wasteful spending.\n  The absence of any Federal or State law or regulation prohibiting \nthis practice has left our courts with no option but to allow this \npractice to continue. For example, a recent Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals decision found that a New Jersey pharmacy company, Omnicare, \nhad indeed double charged the State's Medicaid program when it charged \nMedicaid twice for the sale and resale of restocked drugs. Because \nthere was no State or Federal law prohibiting such double charges, \nhowever, the court could not assess penalties against the company. \nWriting for the court, Judge Jane Roth said, ``We are constrained by a \nlack of a regulation. We believe that Congress and/or the New Jersey \nlegislature might serve Medicaid well if this lack of regulation were \ncorrected.''\n  My legislation will close this loophole by prohibiting federal \nreimbursement for any prescription drugs that have been re-stocked. \nRecognizing that pharmacies that restock prescription drugs incur costs \nin verifying the integrity of the drugs and placing them back into the \npharmacy's inventory, my legislation allows states to provide \nreasonable reimbursements to pharmacies for these costs.\n  In closing, I want to state that I am open to working with the \nAdministration to close this loophole. I think that the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid have the authority to close this loophole and I \nhope that they will take immediate action to address this problem. This \npractice of double billing is nothing short of fraud. Congress and the \nAdministration have a duty to safeguard the Medicaid program from such \nfraud, waste, and abuse. I urge my colleagues to join me in the effort \nto do just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2950\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10851]]\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON PAYMENT FOR REDISPENSING \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1903(i) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396b(i)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (20), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; or''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(21) with respect to any amount expended for redispensing \n     a prescribed drug, other than in accordance with guidance of \n     the Secretary that--\n       ``(A) specifies the circumstances under which redispensing \n     of a prescribed drug shall be permissible; and\n       ``(B) allows for a reasonable restocking fee that takes \n     into account the costs of inspection and inventory processes \n     for redispensing.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     take effect on the first day of the first fiscal year quarter \n     that begins after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Paiute Land \nAdjustments Act. This bill would authorize the Secretary of the \nInterior to convey or transfer four small Paiute trust land parcels \ntotaling about five acres. My introduction of this bill at the closing \nof the 108th Congress is to show my support to the Paiute Tribe, the \ncity of Richfield, UT and to Congressman Chris Cannon's companion \nmeasure, H.R. 3982, which has passed the House and has been held at the \ndesk in the Senate.\n  There are, however, some minor aspects of H.R. 3982 which I believe \nmerit some clarification and may even require future technical \namendments. The bill I am introducing today reflects some of the minor \nchanges that have been requested by the Senate Indian Affairs \nCommittee, and my introduction of the bill is also an effort to get \nthose clarifications on record.\n  I do strongly support the passage of H.R. 3982, and I am working with \nChairman Ben Nighthorse Campbell of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee \nand Senate leadership to secure its final passage before the close of \nthis Congress.\n  The Paiute Land Adjustments Act would allow the Paiute Indian Tribe \nof Utah to convey at fair market value three acres of trust land to the \ncity of Richfield, UT. This land transfer would allow expansion of the \nRichfield Municipal Airport and provide the Tribe with proceeds to \npurchase land that has economic development potential.\n  The city of Richfield approached the tribe about acquiring this \nparcel of land adjacent to the airport runway. The tribe agreed and the \nPaiute Tribal Council passed Resolution 01-36, unanimously agreeing to \nthe conveyance of this parcel of land to the city. In 1974, the private \nnonprofit Utah Paiute Tribal Corporation acquired the three-acre parcel \nof land in fee for the purpose of economic development. With the \npassage of the Paiute Indian Tribe Restoration Act in 1980, the land \nwas placed into trust. The land has not been used by the tribe for more \nthan 20 years. It is not contiguous to the Paiute's Reservation and for \nnearly 30 years now has had no economic development potential. The \ntribal resolution expresses the Paiute's desire to accept the city's \noffer to purchase the land at fair market value and serves as the \nrequest to the Secretary of the Interior to convey the trust land. \nHowever, only an act of Congress may authorize this land conveyance.\n  The Paiute Land Adjustments Act would also transfer three trust land \nparcels, each an acre or less in size, from the tribe to its Kanosh and \nShivwits Bands. All parcels would remain in trust status. The first \nparcel of one acre would be transferred from land held in trust by the \nUnited States for the Paiute Tribe to land held in trust for the Kanosh \nBand. This parcel is surrounded by 279 acres of land that is either \nowned by the Konosh Band or held in trust for the Konosh Band. For more \nthan 20 years, the sole use of this land has been for the Kanosh Band \nCommunity Center. The second parcel, two-thirds of an acre in size, \nwould also be transferred from the tribe to the Kanosh Band. The land \nhas been used exclusively by the Kanosh Band. It was originally \nintended that the land be taken in trust for the Kanosh Band in 1981 \nunder the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Restoration Act. However, through \nan administrative error, the land was mistakenly placed in trust for \nthe tribe. By way of several Band resolutions, the Kanosh Band has \nformally requested correction of this error.\n  The third parcel of land, less than an acre in size, would be \ntransferred from the tribe to be held in trust for the Shivwits Band. \nThe land already is surrounded by several thousand acres of land held \nin trust for the Shivwits Band, and its sole use has been for the \nShivwits Band Community Center.\n  Finally, the bill would eliminate the word ``city'' from the current \nofficial name of the ``Cedar City Band of Paiute Indians,'' a name \nwhich has never been used by the Band or residents of southwestern \nUtah. Thus, the bill makes clear that any reference in a law, map, \nregulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to \nthe ``Cedar City Band of Paiute Indians'' shall be deemed to be a \nreference to the ``Cedar Band of Paiute Indians.''\n  I would like to make part of the record some clarifications with \nregard to this bill. This bill has language that would allow the city \nof Richfield to purchase land from the tribe and direct the payment \ndirectly to the tribe without the funds being funneled through the \nDepartment of the Interior. I support that provision. The bill also has \na provision that would make land acquired by the tribe after February \n17, 1984, be made part of the reservation. This is an effort to clarify \nthat lands already in possession of the tribe should be part of the \nreservation. It is not an effort to ensure that every parcel of land \npurchased by the tribe in the future be made part of the reservation \nwithout regard to the parcel's location or proximity to the existing \nreservation. I would also like to clarify that nothing in this \nlegislation authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make land \nconveyances for any tribe or band without their official consent to \nsuch a conveyance.\n  This bill will cost U.S. taxpayers nothing, but it will solve the \ndilemma that the City of Richfield faces as it works to make its \nairport meet the needs of the citizens of southwestern Utah. Equally \nimportant is the fact that this bill will allow the Paiute Tribe to use \nthe proceeds from the land sale to acquire land with economic \ndevelopment potential to facilitate the self-determination of the \ntribe. The bill also takes care of non-controversial land adjustments \nand technical corrections. The bill is supported by the Paiute Tribe, \nits Bands, and the people of southwestern Utah residing nearby. That is \nwhy I am introducing this legislation that would convey or transfer \nthese four small Paiute trust land parcels.\n  Finally, I offer my congratulations and best wishes to the Paiute \nIndian Tribe of Utah. At the tribe's Annual Restoration Gathering over \nthe weekend of June 12, the Paiutes celebrated the 24th anniversary of \ntheir restoration as a tribe. The Federal trust relationship with the \ntribe was restored in 1980 upon enaction of the Paiute Indian Tribe \nRestoration Act, which I sponsored.\n  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address this issue today, \nand I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 3982 during the \n108th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 2953. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nCoordinated Environmental Health Network, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce today a bill to \nauthorize the development of the Coordinated Environmental Health \nNetwork. I am pleased to have Senators Chafee and Reid as cosponsors.\n  Environmental public health tracking of chronic diseases began in FY \n2002 when the CDC awarded $17 million to 17 states and 3 local health \ndepartments to develop the Program and establish 3 Centers of \nExcellence. These funds were for capacity building and demonstration \nprojects over 3 years. Efforts included correlation of asthma in young \nadults to air pollution from traffic exhaust or indoor air quality in \nschools, correlation of adverse pregnancy outcomes and air pollution \nmeasurements, PCBs in water supplies, etc and biomonitoring for blood \nlead and hair mercury with exposure databases. In FY 2003, CDC awarded \n$18.5 million to continue this program and expand to three additional \nstates as in Florida to link statewide surveillance systems for asthma, \nautism, mental retardation, cancers, and birth defects\n\n[[Page S10852]]\n\nwith EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, statewide air monitoring data, and \ndata from the statewide well water surveillance program. 24 states now \nhave efforts to track asthma. FY 2004 funding reached $27 million, and \nan additional $28 million pending in the Fiscal Year 2005 Labor-Health \nand Human Services-Education Appropriations bill.\n  Our bill would build on these efforts, and would eventually cover all \npriority chronic conditions including birth defects, developmental \ndisabilities (such as cerebral palsy, autism, and mental retardation), \nasthma and chronic respiratory diseases, neurological diseases, such as \nParkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, and \nautoimmune diseases such as Lupus. It would also eventually reach as \nmany of the States as possible; already the EPA and DHHS (CDC) have \nsigned a Memorandum of Understanding to coordinate exposure databases \nwith the CDC's nationwide chronic disease tracking network and the \nState grantees.\n  Our current public health surveillance systems were developed when \nthe major threats to health were infectious agents. Currently, 50 \ninfectious diseases are tracked on a national basis. However, chronic \ndiseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease are now the \nnation's number one killers, and there is evidence that rates of some \nchronic diseases and conditions are rising. More than 1.3 million new \ncancer cases were diagnosed in 2003. One in 33 U.S. babies born has a \nbirth defect, and about 17 percent of children under 18 years of age \nhave a developmental disability. In 2001, an estimated 31.3 million \nAmericans reported having been diagnosed with asthma during their \nlifetime, and 14 million adults reported physician-diagnosed chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. Chronic diseases cost Americans \n$750,000,000,000 in health care expenses and lost productivity and \naffect 100 million Americans. Yet our systems for tracking chronic \ndiseases are woefully underdeveloped.\n  All across our nation are communities where disease clusters such as \nbirth defects, cancers and asthma raise questions about the role of \nenvironmental factors in chronic diseases. In order to improve the \nhealth of our nation and lower health care costs, we need to develop \nthe infrastructure to study the relationship between environment and \nchronic disease.\n  The Coordinated Environmental Health Network Act would create the \ninfrastructure necessary to collect, analyze, and report data on the \nrate of disease and the presence of relevant environmental factors and \nexposures. The Network would also coordinate national, State, and local \nefforts to bolster our public health system's capacity to investigate \nand respond aggressively to environmental exposures that threaten \nhealth. In addition, the Coordinated Environmental Health Network will \nalert health officials when there is a sudden increase in any disease \nor condition, including those associated with a biological or chemical \nattack.\n  Once fully operational, the network will coordinate national, state, \nand local efforts to inform communities, public health officials, \nresearchers, and policymakers of potential environmental health risks, \nand to integrate this information with other parts of the public health \nsystem.\n  The Coordinated Environmental Health Network Act is supported by the \nTrust for America's Health, American Public Health Association, \nCitizens for a Cleaner Environment, March of Dimes, American Lung \nAssociation, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, The Breast Cancer \nFund, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and many others.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2953\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coordinated Environmental \n     Health Network Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) approximately 7 out of every 10 deaths in the United \n     States are attributable to chronic diseases;\n       (2) with 100,000,000 people suffering from chronic diseases \n     each year, and $750,000,000,000 lost in health care costs as \n     a result, the national cost of chronic disease is extremely \n     high and must be appropriately addressed;\n       (3) the rates of many chronic diseases, including asthma, \n     some birth defects, cancers, and autism, appear to be \n     increasing;\n       (4) there is a growing amount of evidence that \n     environmental factors are strongly linked with specific \n     chronic disease;\n       (5) a major gap in critical knowledge exists regarding the \n     prevalence and incidence of chronic diseases;\n       (6) States, local communities, territories, and Indian \n     tribes need assistance with public health efforts that would \n     lead to prevention of chronic disease, including the \n     establishment and maintenance of necessary infrastructure for \n     disease and environmental hazard exposure surveillance; and\n       (7) a Coordinated Environmental Health Network will help \n     target resources to areas of chronic disease prevention most \n     in need.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) develop, operate, and maintain a Coordinated \n     Environmental Health Network, State Environmental Health \n     Networks, and rapid response capabilities so that the Federal \n     Government, States, local governments, territories, and \n     Indian tribes can more effectively monitor, investigate, \n     respond to, research, and prevent increases in the incidence \n     and prevalence of certain chronic diseases and relevant \n     environmental and other risk factors;\n       (2) provide information collected through the Coordinated \n     and State Environmental Health Networks to government \n     agencies, public health practitioners and researchers, policy \n     makers, and the public;\n       (3) expand and coordinate among existing surveillance and \n     data collection systems and other infrastructure for chronic \n     diseases and relevant environmental, and other risk factors, \n     including those relevant to bioterrorism;\n       (4) improve coordination between the areas of public \n     health, environmental protection, and chemical, radiological \n     and biological terrorism; and\n       (5) provide necessary support to ensure the availability of \n     a sufficient number of well-trained environmental health and \n     public health personnel to participate and provide leadership \n     in the development and maintenance of the Coordinated and \n     State Environmental Health Networks.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the exchange of certain land in Grand \nand Uintah Counties, Utah, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. Bennett. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Utah \nRecreational Land Exchange Act of 2004, together with my colleague \nSenator Hatch. This legislation will ensure the protection of critical \nlands along the Colorado River corridor in southeastern Utah and will \nhelp provide important funding for Utah's school children. In Utah we \ntreasure the education of our children. A key component of our \neducation system is the 3.5 million acres of school trust lands \nscattered throughout the State. These lands are dedicated to the \nsupport of public education. Revenue from Utah school trust lands, \nwhether from grazing, forestry, surface leasing or mineral development, \nis placed in the State School Fund. This fund is a permanent income \nproducing endowment created by Congress upon statehood to fund public \neducation. Unfortunately, the majority of these lands are trapped \nwithin federal ownership patterns that make it impossible for \nresponsible development. It is critical to both the state of Utah and \nthe Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that we consolidate their \nrespective lands to ensure that both public agencies are permitted to \nfulfill their mandates.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is yet another chapter in \nour State's long history of consolidating these State lands for the \nfinancial well being of our education system. These efforts serve a \ndual purpose as they help the Federal land management agencies to \nconsolidate federal lands in environmentally sensitive areas that can \nthen be reasonably managed. We see this exchange as a win-win solution \nfor the State of Utah and its school children, as well as the \nDepartment of the Interior as the caretaker of our public lands.\n  Beginning in 1998 Congress passed the first major Utah school trust \nland exchange which consolidated hundreds of thousands of acres. Again \nin 2000, Congress enacted an exchange consolidating another 100,000 \nacres. I was proud to be instrumental in those efforts, and the bill we \nare introducing today is yet another step in the long journey toward \ngiving the school children the deal they were promised in 1896 when \nUtah was admitted to the Union.\n  The School Trust of Utah currently owns some of the most spectacular \nlands in America, located along the Colorado River in southeastern \nUtah. This legislation will ensure that places like Westwater Canyon of \nthe Colorado River, the world famous Kokopelli and Slickrock biking \ntrails, some of the largest natural rock arches in the United States, \nwilderness study areas, and viewsheds for Arches National Park will be \ntraded into Federal ownership and for the benefit of future \ngenerations. At the same time, the school children of Utah will receive \nmineral and development lands that are not environmentally sensitive, \nin locations where responsible development makes sense. This will be an \nequal value exchange, with approximately 40,000 acres exchanged on \neither side, with both taxpayers and the school children of Utah \nreceiving a fair deal. Moreover, the legislation establishes a \nvaluation process that is transparent to the public, yet will ensure \nthe exchange process occurs in a timely manner.\n  This legislation represents a truly collaborative process. We have \nconvened all of the players to give us input into this legislation: \nlocal government, the State, the recreation community, the \nenvironmental community and other interested parties. At the same time \nwe are working closely with the Department of Interior. We introduce \nthis bill at this late date in this Congress to begin the legislative \nportion of our efforts. The state has been working with all of these \ngroups over the past year at a grass-roots level to address concerns. \nAs with all legislation this will be a perfecting process and \nintroduction today marks the beginning of our efforts to work with the \nappropriate committees and the Department of Interior to craft a \nproduct over the next few months that will be ready to move at the \nbeginning of the next Congress.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support our efforts to fund the \neducation of our children in Utah and to protect some of this Nation's \ntruly great lands. I urge support of the Utah Recreational Land \nExchange Act of 2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 2956. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to direct the \nSecretary of Defense to carry out a program to provide a support system \nfor members of the Armed Forces who incur severe disabilities; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill of great \nimportance to our most severely injured troops who are carrying the \nbattle to the terrorists. This legislation will assist the Department \nof Defense by granting reprogramming authority to the Army to transfer \nfunds to the Army's Disabled Soldier Support System (DS3) and by \nexpanding the program to cover all the Armed Services.\n  The Disabled Soldier Support System this legislation will support was \nestablished just this year by the former Vice Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, General George W. Casey, who realized after visiting severely \nwounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Hospital that more support was \nneeded to help these soldiers make the transition from military to \ncivilian life.\n  The program the Army currently has in place is budgeted for $ one \nmillion and has a staff of less than 10 people. It is reported to have \nhelped over 200 soldiers but we have a much larger group of seriously \nwounded troops that need our help. Of the nearly 7,000 troops who have \nbeen wounded approximately 57 percent were so severely injured that \nthey will not be able to return to active duty.\n  The Administration is doing all it can but we know that the \nbureaucracy is sometimes slow to respond and react rapidly to changing \nconditions. The Army is not the only Service Component with a growing \npatient load. That is why this legislation will expand this worthy \nprogram to all branches of the Armed Services.\n  The patriots who are wounded while serving in support of our defense \ndeserve the best care and assistance this Nation can deliver. That is \nwhy I am honored to submit this legislation today. It is my hope that \nmy colleagues will put their full support behind this legislation and \nfind a way to get it passed when we return later this year.\n  I thank my co-sponsors Senator's Kennedy, Burns and Nelson of Florida \nalong with Congressman ``Dutch'' Ruppersberger who introduced this \nlegislation in the House in early September and Steve Robinson, \nNational Gulf War Resource Center, who referred Congressman \nRuppersberger to my office.\n\n[[Page S10856]]\n\n  While the current debate continues regarding U.S. foreign policy \nthere is no debate about doing all that is necessary to help our troops \nprevail on the battlefield--or to help those who are severely wounded \non the field of battle to recover and make the transition from military \nto civilian life.\n  As the Chairman of VA-HUD I continue to work with my distinguished \ncolleague Senator Mikulski to make the transition from the military \nsupport system to the VA support system as seamless as possible. This \nlegislation will help improve the support system in the Department of \nDefense and make the work we are doing with the VA that much easier.\n  This legislation is vital for the welfare of our troops, their loved \nones and families, and for the Department of Defense and the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. That is why I hope my colleagues will support this \nbill and work to get it passed before years end.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2957. A bill to encourage the promotion of democracy, free, fair, \nand transparent elections, and respect for human rights and the rule of \nlaw in Ukraine, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the \nUkraine Democracy and Fair Elections Act of 2004, designed to promote \nfree, fair and transparent elections in Ukraine. Like the United \nStates, Ukraine is currently in the midst of a presidential election \ncampaign. There is, however, one glaring contrast--all indications are \nthat the campaign in Ukraine is not fair, not free and not transparent.\n  The U.S. government has sent a number of high level officials to \nUkraine to tell retiring President Kuchma and Ukraine's Prime Minister \nViktor Yanukovych--who is Kuchma's endorsed presidential candidate--\nthat free and fair elections are essential to Ukraine's standing with \nthe United States. Similarly, European governments have called upon \nUkraine to hold free and fair elections. But, unfortunately, it appears \nthat abuses of Ukraine's campaign laws are rapidly escalating.\n  Ukrainian government officials have continued, without pause, an \naggressive offensive against their opposition. Together with oligarch \nbeneficiaries of the Kuchma-Yanukovych government they have denied the \nopposition access to national media, they have intimidated campaign \nworkers and opposition supporters at work and at home, they have tried \nto prohibit opposition assemblies, and have stopped buses on the way to \nopposition rallies. They make a mockery of Ukrainian laws by using \ngovernment resources to promote the Yanukovych candidacy, and they are \naggressively manipulating Ukrainian election laws to ensure that they \ncontrol the election commission at each of the 40,000 polling place in \nthe country.\n  What is at stake here is the future of democracy and perhaps \nindependence in Ukraine as well as significant United States national \ninterests in a region that we helped liberate from Communist tyranny \njust 15 years ago.\n  The legislation that I am introducing would prevent senior government \nofficials, who are personally involved in suppressing free and fair \nelections in Ukraine, from obtaining visas to the United States, and \nwould seize the assets of these corrupt officials, unless the U.S. \nPresident certifies the elections as free and fair. The objective is to \ntarget directly those individuals responsible for the corruption, not \nthe Ukrainian people as a whole. I would note that similar legislation \nhas been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative \nDana Rohrabacher of California.\n  I hope this will send a clear message that we stand with the free and \ndemocratic people of Ukraine, but not with those who would pervert \ndemocracy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida:\n  S. 2960. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to establish a \ntraffic incident management program; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that calls for a small Federal commitment that would make a \nhuge impact on the daily lives of all Americans. This legislation, the \nRush Hour Congestion Relief Act, authorizes $1 billion per year over \nthe next 6 years, which can make a major dent in the amount of time we \nsit in traffic everyday.\n  In February, the Senate approved a six-year highway reauthorization \nbill, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation \nEquity Act of 2004, SAFETEA, which authorized $318 billion through 2009 \nfor the Federal highway and transit program. I voted against the bill \nfor many reasons, but the main reason I could not support the \nlegislation is that the bill did not meet the funding levels identified \nby the U.S. Department of Transportation's needs assessment. The USDOT \nidentified a $375 billion Federal commitment as necessary to maintain \nthe current condition and level of congestion on our highways. Just \nmaintain, not improve.\n  Additionally, SAFETEA did not contain any specific programs to target \ncongestion relief. SAFETEA targets funding to construction to add \nhighway capacity. Although adding capacity to our highway and transit \nsystem is very important, we will never build our way out of \ncongestion. We must also look at ways to operate and manage the current \nsystem and use resources more efficiently. We must focus on managing \nthe demand on our road network, especially in larger urban areas, \nthrough innovative approaches and use of new technology. A combination \nof operational improvements, including freeway ramp metering, traffic \nsignal coordination, traveler information and incident management can \naccomplish major improvements in daily travel with a small price tag.\n  Now it looks as though a 6-year highway bill reauthorization will not \nbe completed this year and the 109th Congress will have to start the \nprocess from scratch. This is a golden opportunity for the Senate to \nreview the SAFETEA bill and support positive changes to target more \nfunds to congestion relief.\n  Mr. President, according to the Texas Transportation Institute, TTI, \nat Texas A University, which conducts an annual Urban Mobility Report \nto study the state of America's urban transportation networks, gridlock \ncost Americans $63 billion in 2002 in wasted fuel and lost time. This \nis a significant loss that burdens families, individuals, and \nbusinesses. More than 2 in 5 adults report that congestion is a problem \nin their community. This number is even higher in major cities.\n  Such concern is not surprising, considering that the average resident \nof many cities in my state experience some of the worst congestion. \nEvery year a typical resident of Miami and Orlando will lose over 51 \nhours stuck in traffic. Lost time and wasted fuel will cost each of \nthese Floridians over $900. In 1982, only 11 hours were lost. This is \nnot only a Florida problem. Nor is it only a problem here in Washington \nDC, or in New York City or Chicago. Even in small urban areas, delay \nduring peak traveling hours grew 200 percent in the past 20 years. \nAcross the country, residents of smaller cities like Pensacola, \nCharleston, and Colorado Springs could save hundreds of dollars by \nmaking our current road system more efficient.\n\n  The Rush Hour Congestion Relief Act of 2004 would establish a Federal \nincident management program to provide funding to states for regional \nprojects to mitigate the effects of traffic congestion on our roads.\n  Incident management programs would save taxpayers money by allowing \nour roadways to operate at a more optimal level. When a stalled vehicle \nor traffic accident blocks a lane of traffic, our roads are not \noperating efficiently. The Federal Highway Administration estimates \nthat every blocked lane creates an average of four minutes of traffic \ndelay. Furthermore, up to one-third of traffic accidents are secondary \nto earlier incidents. What this means is that incidents that are not \ncleared quickly run a higher risk of causing more accidents and \nincreasing delay even further. Results find that 55 percent of \ncongestion in urban areas and 100 percent of congestion in rural areas \nare caused by incidents such as traffic accidents and stalled vehicles.\n  Incident management programs vary across the country, but include the \ncooperative effort of multiple agencies, such as city and county \ngovernments, regional planning councils, local police and firefighters, \nHAZMAT teams and\n\n[[Page S10857]]\n\nemergency medical services to detect and verify incidents, manage the \nscene, and clear the obstruction in a safe manner. In many cases the \nincident management patrols are the first to arrive on the scene of an \naccident, and they coordinate Emergency Medical Services, tow trucks, \nlaw enforcement and other service providers. Additionally, they are \nable to funnel information to a central traffic command, which can \nprovide important real-time information to the traveling public.\n  Some incident management programs offer needed assistance to \ntravelers by providing services such as a free gallon of gas, changing \na flat tire, a cell phone call, water for an overheated radiator, and \ncharging a dead battery. In Florida, one way that we have addressed \nincident management is through a program called Road Rangers. Road \nRanger trucks continuously rove the expressways looking for stranded \nmotorists, debris, traffic accidents or other incidents. In 2002, this \nprogram utilized 83 vehicles and performed 279,525 service assists.\n  This bill would authorize $1 billion per year through 2010, from the \nHighway Trust Fund to create and improve programs like Road Rangers. \nThe funds would be distributed to the states based on their amount of \nurbanized areas with greater than 300,000 people. The state would then \nbe required to allocate the funds to those targeted urban areas. There \nare roughly 100 urbanized areas with a population of 300,000 or higher \nin 42 states. Urban areas would be required to develop an incident \nmanagement plan before receiving direct funding for their program. This \nway, all of the stakeholders in a region will have an opportunity to \nparticipate in the design and operation of the incident management \nprogram. The only way it can work is with regional cooperation. The \nRush Hour Congestion Relief Act of 2004 would fund initiatives like the \ncurrent pilot program in Orlando to provide radio and \ntelecommunications equipment to enhance coordination between Florida \nHighway Patrol and Road Rangers. It will also provide needed funding \nfor incident management training. In 2001, 59 percent of all police \ncasualties occurred during a response to a traffic incident. Funding \nunder this bill would give first responders the tools and training \nnecessary to reduce that risk.\n\n  I am proud to introduce this bill today because incident management \nworks. According to the TTI, incident management has already reduced \ndelay on our roads by 170 million hours. Had we employed these programs \nto all of our congested highways, American would have spent 239 million \nless hours on the road. To put this into perspective, it would take the \nconstruction of over 200 miles of a six-lane highway to achieve the \nsame level of time savings.\n  Not only are these programs effective, they save far more than they \ncost. In States like Minnesota, annual savings from incident management \nwas estimated at $1.4 million, while program operations amounted to \nonly $600,000. In Denver, their Courtesy Patrol program has been \nestimated to save 10.5 to 16.9 times more than it cost. Although adding \ncapacity to our highway and transit network is important, it is very \nexpensive and takes many years to complete. This approach provides a \nreal solution, which will make a huge impact on congestion in a short \namount of time.\n  Finally, the Rush Hour congestion Relief Act is supported by our \nnation's local governments, Metropolitan Planning Organizations, and \ntransit providers, who are on the front lines of the daily congestion \nbattle. The act has been endorsed by the National Association of \nCounties, National League of Cities, National Association of Regional \nCouncils, Association for Commuter Transportation, and the Surface \nTransportation Policy Project.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort to ensure safe and \nopen roads.\n  I ask unanimous consent, that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2960\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to clarify and \nreaffirm State and local authority to regulate the placement, \nconstruction, and modification of personal wireless services \nfacilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as in years past, I am offering today two \npieces of legislation that would close a loophole in the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act, and as in years past I am pleased that I am \njoined by Senators Jeffords and Dodd.\n  The catalog of complaints about the 1996 act continues to grow, and \nas it becomes more apparent that this flawed statute is in need of \nrepair, I grow ever more proud that I was one of five Senators to have \nvoted against that law.\n  In the coming Congress, we will be revisiting the 1996 Act. While we \nshould rightly examine the various provisions related to telephone \ncompetition, broadband, and subscriber television rates, there are \nother important issues that we need to address.\n  The 1996 Telecommunications Act contained a provision that allowed \nthe Federal Communications Commission to preempt the decisions of local \nauthorities as to the placement of cell phone towers. In 1997, the \nFederal Communications Commission seized on the legislative loophole, \nproposing an expansive new rule that prevented State and local zoning \nlaws from regulating the placement of cellular and broadcast towers \nbased on environmental considerations, aviation safety, or other \nlocally determined matters. Local and State governments were no longer \nempowered to shape the appearance of their communities.\n  I fought this proposed rule and was joined by many Vermonters, \nincluding former-Governor Dean, the Vermont Environmental Board, \nmayors, zoning officials, and numerous others. We took our case to the \nSupreme Court and filed an amicus brief, arguing that the preemption of \nthat local power to regulate land use was a clear violation of the U.S. \nConstitution. It is unfortunate that the Court would not hear that \ncase. It is time to give that control back to the local governments by \nenacting my legislation.\n  The two bills that we are reintroducing today will not tip the \nscales, but they will even them out a bit. They will allow local \nofficials to use State and local regulations to work with the Federal \nGovernment in order to develop the best solutions for the placement of \ncell phone and broadcast towers.\n  Communities across the country understand the growing demand for \ncellular services will result in new towers, and they welcome the \nimprovement in service that this increased infrastructure will bring. \nHowever, they also want to make sure that their towns do not become \nlittle more than pincushions for new cellular towers. These goals are \nnot mutually exclusive.\n  I thank again Senator Jeffords and Senator Dodd, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in supporting this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of these two bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2963\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Control of Broadcast \n     Towers Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The placement, construction, and modification of \n     broadcast transmission facilities near residential \n     communities and facilities such as schools can greatly reduce \n     the value of residential properties, destroy the views from \n     properties, produce radio frequency interference, raise \n     concerns about potential long-term health effects of such \n     facilities, and reduce substantially the desire to live in \n     the areas of such facilities.\n       (2) States and local governments have traditionally \n     regulated development and should be able to exercise control \n     over the placement, construction, and modification of \n     broadcast transmission facilities through the use of zoning \n     and other land use regulations relating to the protection of \n     the environment, public health and safety, and the general \n     welfare of the community and the public.\n       (3) The Federal Communications Commission establishes \n     policies to govern interstate and international \n     communications by television, radio, wire, satellite, and \n     cable. The Commission ensures compliance of such activities \n     with applicable Federal laws, including the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the National Historic \n     Preservation Act, in its decision-making on such activities.\n       (4) The Commission defers to State and local authorities \n     which regulate the placement, construction, and modification \n     of broadcast transmission facilities through the use of \n     zoning, construction and building, and environmental and \n     safety regulations in order to protect the environment and \n     the health, safety, and general welfare of communities and \n     the public.\n       (5) On August 19, 1997, the Commission issued a proposed \n     rule, MM Docket No. 97-182, which would preempt the \n     application of most State and local zoning, environmental, \n     construction and building, and other regulations affecting \n     the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast \n     transmission facilities.\n       (6) The telecommunications industry and its experts should \n     be expected to have access to the best and most recent \n     technical information and should therefore be held to the \n     highest standards in terms of their representations, \n     assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to confirm that \n     State and local governments are the appropriate entities--\n       (1) to regulate the placement, construction, and \n     modification of broadcast transmission facilities consistent \n     with State and local zoning, construction and building, \n     environmental, and land use regulations;\n       (2) to regulate the placement, construction, and \n     modification of broadcast transmission facilities so that \n     their placement, construction, or modification will not \n     interfere with the safe and efficient use of public airspace \n     or otherwise compromise or endanger the health, safety, and \n     general welfare of the public; and\n       (3) to hold accountable applicants for permits for the \n     placement, construction, or modification of broadcast \n     transmission facilities, and providers of services using such \n     facilities, for the truthfulness and accuracy of \n     representations and statements placed in the record of \n     hearings for such permits, licenses, or approvals.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON ADOPTION OF RULE REGARDING PREEMPTION \n                   OF STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER BROADCAST \n                   TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal \n     Communications Commission shall not adopt as a final rule or \n     otherwise directly or indirectly implement any portion of the \n     proposed rule set forth in ``Preemption of State and Local \n     Zoning and Land Use Restrictions on Siting, Placement and \n     Construction of Broadcast Station Transmission Facilities'', \n     MM Docket No. 97-182, released August 19, 1997.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND \n                   MODIFICATION OF BROADCAST TRANSMISSION \n                   FACILITIES.\n\n       Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 340.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Control of Cellular \n     Towers Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The placement, construction, and modification of \n     personal wireless services facilities (also known as wireless \n     facilities) near residential communities and facilities such \n     as schools can greatly reduce the value of residential \n     properties, destroy the views from properties, produce radio \n     frequency interference, raise concerns about potential long-\n     term health effects of such facilities, and reduce \n     substantially the desire to live in the areas of such \n     facilities.\n       (2) States and local governments have traditionally \n     regulated development and should be able to exercise control \n     over the placement, construction, and modification of \n     wireless facilities through the use of zoning and other land \n     use regulations relating to the protection of the \n     environment, public health and safety, and the general \n     welfare of the community and the public.\n       (3) The Federal Communications Commission establishes \n     policies to govern interstate and international \n     communications by television, radio, wire, satellite, and \n     cable. The Commission ensures the compliance of such \n     activities with a variety of Federal laws, including the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the National \n     Historic Preservation Act, in its decision-making on such \n     activities.\n       (4) Under section 332(c)(7)(A) of the Communications Act of \n     1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(A)), the Commission defers to State \n     and local authorities that regulate the placement, \n     construction, and modification of wireless facilities through \n     the use of zoning and other land use regulations.\n       (5) Alternative technologies for the placement, \n     construction, and modification of wireless facilities may \n     meet the needs of a wireless services provider in a less \n     intrusive manner than the technologies proposed by the \n     wireless services provider, including the use of small towers \n     that do not require blinking aircraft safety lights, break \n     skylines, or protrude above tree canopies.\n       (6) It is in the interest of the Nation that the \n     requirements of the Commission with respect to the \n     application of State and local ordinances to the placement, \n     construction and modification of wireless facilities (for \n     example WT Docket No. 97-192, ET Docket No. 93-62, RM-8577, \n     and FCC 97-303, 62 FR 47960) be modified so as--\n       (A) to permit State and local governments to exercise their \n     zoning and other land use authorities to regulate the \n     placement, construction, and modification of such facilities; \n     and\n       (B) to place the burden of proof in civil actions, and in \n     actions before the Commission and State and local authorities \n     relating to the placement, construction, and modification of \n     such facilities, on the person that seeks to place, \n     construct, or modify such facilities.\n       (7) PCS-Over-Cable, PCS-Over-Fiber Optic, and satellite \n     telecommunications systems, including Low-Earth Orbit \n     satellites, offer a significant opportunity to provide so-\n     called ``911'' emergency telephone service throughout much of \n     the United States without unduly intruding into or effecting \n     the environment, public health and safety, and the general \n     welfare of the community and the public.\n       (8) The Federal Aviation Administration must rely upon \n     State and local governments to regulate the placement, \n     construction, and modification of telecommunications \n     facilities near airports or high-volume air traffic areas \n     such as corridors of airspace or commonly used flyways. The \n     proposed rules of the Commission to preempt State and local \n     zoning and other land-use regulations for the siting of such \n     facilities will have a serious negative impact on aviation \n     safety, airport capacity and investment, the efficient use of \n     navigable airspace, public health and safety, and the general \n     welfare of the community and the public.\n       (9) The telecommunications industry and its experts should \n     be expected to have access to the best and most recent \n     technical information and should therefore be held to the \n     highest standards in terms of their representations, \n     assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To repeal certain limitations on State and local \n     authority regarding the placement, construction, and \n     modification of personal wireless services facilities under \n     section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 332(c)(7)).\n       (2) To permit State and local governments--\n       (A) to regulate the placement, construction, or \n     modification of personal wireless services facilities with \n     respect to their impacts on land use, including radio \n     frequency interference and radio frequency radiation, in \n     order to protect the environment, public health and safety, \n     and the general welfare of the community and the public;\n       (B) to regulate the placement, construction, and \n     modification of personal wireless services facilities so that \n     they will not interfere with the safe and efficient use of \n     public airspace or otherwise compromise or endanger the \n     public health and safety and the general welfare of the \n     community and the public; and\n       (C) to hold accountable applicants for permits for the \n     placement, construction, or modification of personal wireless \n     services facilities, and providers of services using such \n     facilities, for the truthfulness and accuracy of \n     representations and statements placed in the record of \n     hearings for permits, licenses, or approvals for such \n     facilities.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, \n                   CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF PERSONAL \n                   WIRELESS SERVICES FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) Limitations on State and Local Regulation of \n     Facilities.--Subparagraph (B) of section 332(c)(7) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking clause (iv);\n       (2) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and\n       (3) in clause (iv), as so redesignated--\n       (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``may, within 30 \n     days'' and all that follows through the end of the sentence \n     and inserting ``may commence an action in any court of \n     competent jurisdiction. Such action shall be commenced within \n     30 days after such action or failure to act unless the State \n     concerned has established a different period for the \n     commencement of such action.''; and\n       (B) by striking the third sentence and inserting the \n     following: ``In any such action in which a person seeking to \n     place, construct, or modify a personal wireless services \n     facility is a party, such person shall bear the burden of \n     proof, regardless of who commences such action.''.\n       (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule Regarding Relief From \n     State and Local Regulation of Facilities.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, the Federal Communications \n     Commission shall not adopt as a final rule or otherwise \n     directly or indirectly implement any portion of the proposed \n     rule set forth in ``Procedures for Reviewing Requests for \n     Relief From State and Local Regulation Pursuant to Section \n     332(c)(7)(B)(v) of the Communications Act of 1934'', WT \n     Docket No. 97-192, released August 25, 1997.\n       (c) Authority Over Placement, Construction, and \n     Modification of Facilities.--Such section 332(c)(7) is \n     further amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D); \n     and\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new \n     subparagraph (C):\n       ``(C) Additional limitations.--\n       ``(i) Authority to require least intrusive facilities.--\n\n       ``(I) In general.--A State or local government may deny an \n     application to place, construct, or modify personal wireless \n     services facilities on the basis that alternative \n     technologies, delivery systems, or structures are capable of \n     delivering a personal wireless services signal comparable to \n     that proposed to be delivered by such facilities in a manner \n     that is less intrusive to the community concerned than such \n     facilities.\n       ``(II) Considerations.--In determining under subclause (I) \n     the intrusiveness of technologies, delivery systems, or \n     structures for personal wireless services facilities, a State \n     or local government may consider the aesthetics of such \n     technologies, systems, or structures, the environmental \n     impact of such technologies, systems, or structures, and the \n     radio frequency interference or radiation emitted by such \n     technologies, systems, or structures.\n       ``(III) Burden of proof.--In any hearing for purposes of \n     the exercise of the authority\n\n[[Page S10860]]\n\n     in subclause (I), the burden shall be on the applicant.\n\n       ``(ii) Radio interference.--A State or local government may \n     regulate the location, height, or modification of personal \n     wireless services facilities in order to address the effects \n     of radio frequency interference caused by such facilities on \n     local communities and the public.\n       ``(iii) Authority to require studies and documentation.--No \n     provision of this Act may be interpreted to prohibit a State \n     or local government from--\n\n       ``(I) requiring a person seeking authority to place, \n     construct, or modify personal wireless services facilities to \n     produce--\n\n       ``(aa) environmental, biological, and health studies, \n     engineering reports, or other documentation of the compliance \n     of such facilities with radio frequency exposure limits, \n     radio frequency interference impacts, and compliance with \n     applicable laws, rules, and regulations governing the effects \n     of such facilities on the environment, public health and \n     safety, and the general welfare of the community and the \n     public; and\n       ``(bb) documentation of the compliance of such facilities \n     with applicable Federal, State, and local aviation safety \n     standards or aviation obstruction standards regarding objects \n     effecting navigable airspace; or\n\n       ``(II) refusing to grant authority to such person to place, \n     construct, or modify such facilities within the jurisdiction \n     of such government if such person fails to produce studies, \n     reports, or documentation required under subclause (I).\n\n       ``(iv) Construction.--Nothing in this subparagraph may be \n     construed to prohibit or otherwise limit the authority of a \n     State or local government to ensure compliance with or \n     otherwise enforce any statements, assertions, or \n     representations filed or submitted by or on behalf of an \n     applicant with the State or local government for authority to \n     place, construct, or modify personal wireless services \n     facilities within the jurisdiction of the State or local \n     government.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2966. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a nonrefundable tax credit against income tax for individuals who \npurchase a residential safe storage device for the safe storage of \nfirearms; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Child Safety and \nHome Protection Act of 2004, to provide a limited tax credit for \nindividuals who purchase a gun safe to store firearms in their homes. \nUnder this legislation, taxpayers would receive a 25 percent credit up \nto $250 for the cost of purchasing, shipping, and installing a gun \nsafe.\n  We have seen passionate debates in the Senate on political issues \ninvolving guns, but there is no dispute about the importance of \npreventing firearms accidents and theft. We all want to make sure guns \ndo not fall into the hands of people who would mishandle them and cause \naccidental harm, or who intend to abuse them for criminal purposes. \nResponsible gun owners share those concerns and take safety issues \nseriously.\n  The firearms industry has responded by offering a variety of devices \ndesigned to enhance secure storage and safe use of firearms. Gun safes \nhave demonstrated their effectiveness in stopping unauthorized access \nto their contents, not only protecting valuable guns but also \npreventing their accidental or criminal misuse.\n  With more than 200 million privately-owned firearms in the United \nStates, this Nation clearly has an interest in encouraging safe gun \nstorage. The Child Safety and Home Protection Act of 2004 serves that \ngoal by allowing individuals to keep a little bit of their own hard-\nearned dollars to make a key investment in gun safety through the \npurchase and installation of a gun safe.\n  I say to all my colleagues: If you believe, as I do, that the right \nto keep and bear arms carries with it a responsibility to use firearms \nsafely and lawfully, I hope you will join me in supporting this \nimportant measure to promote secure gun storage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2966\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the implementation of a Green \nChemistry Research and Development Program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation, ``The Green Chemistry Research and Development Act,'' with \nSenator Rockefeller. Green chemistry is a science-based approach to \npollution prevention, seeking to reduce the chemical impact on the \nenvironment by developing non-toxic technology. The American chemical, \npharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as the American \nChemical Society, support this legislation, which\n\n[[Page S10861]]\n\npromises to speed the development of environmentally benign chemical \ntechnology. I would like to request that a letter in support of this \nlegislation from Dr. Michael J. Eckardt, Vice President for Research at \nthe University of Maine, be printed in the Record\n  Green chemistry research and development improves technology used in \nindustrial procedures and promotes the design of safer chemicals, the \nuse of sustainable resources, the use of biotechnology alternatives to \nchemistry-based solutions, and an understanding of the chemical aspects \nof renewable energy. Clearly, there is a need to promote this emerging \nfield, still relatively unknown, which furnishes both economic and \nenvironmental rewards--proving that the two are not, in fact, mutually \nexclusive.\n  The legislation establishes a Green Chemistry Research and \nDevelopment Program to promote and coordinate Federal green chemistry \nresearch, development, demonstration, education, and technology \ntransfer activities, through an interagency working group consisting of \nthe National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental \nProtection Agency. The program would provide sustained support through \nmerit-based competitive research grants, research and development \npartnerships between universities, industry and nonprofit \norganizations, and research and development conducted at federal \nlaboratories.\n  Green chemistry R & D benefits all regions of our country, but let me \nshare with you an example of how one company, Correct Deck, located in \nBiddeford, Maine, has successfully used green chemistry technology to \ngrow its business. As you may know, the Environmental Protection Agency \nhas issued a stricter arsenic regulation due to concerns about the \npublic health effects posed by the chemical, which is commonly found in \nwood that has been treated to repel insects before being used for \nconstructing outdoor decks and playground equipment. These EPA \nregulations will take effect in 2006. Correct Deck, taking advantage of \na technology brought about through green chemistry research and \ndevelopment, manufactures a wood composite--a blend of sawdust and \nplastic--that closely resembles the boarding used on wood decks. Yet \nthis composite does not splinter, requires less maintenance than wood, \nis not susceptible to termites, and most importantly, contains no \nharmful chemicals. By staying ahead of the curve, Correct Deck has seen \nsales of its wood composite skyrocket, and has since been striving to \nmeet the ballooning demand for non-arsenic treated products for decks. \nThus an environmental benefit also proves profitable.\n  The breadth of green chemistry's positive impact on our lives extends \nfar beyond decks. Also in the process of development are next-\ngeneration pesticides that target specific insects while avoiding harm \nto other species, and, through steadfast commitment to avoiding \nenvironmental harm, are designed to degrade into harmless materials \nafter serving their purpose, rather than dangerously persisting in the \nenvironment. Green chemistry R & D is also discovering methods for \nusing carbon dioxide as a feedstock for industrial processes, rather \nthan as a harmful byproduct, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I could continue, but the windfalls are just too many to enumerate \nhere. From removing public health threats, to enhancing worker safety, \nto contributing to the battle against human-induced global warming, the \nmultiple benefits of green chemistry research and development are truly \nexciting, which is why this legislation has strong support from both \nenvironmentalists and the chemical industry. One of many chemical \ncompany executives singing the praises of green chemistry R & D, David \nBuzzelli of Dow Chemical Company aptly stated, ``Green chemistry \ntechnology is testament that when we merge our environmental commitment \nwith innovative chemistry, we can create results that benefit our \ncustomers and society.''\n  My colleagues, by passing this bipartisan legislation and thereby \ncoordinating and supporting ongoing green chemistry research and \ndevelopment, we speed these benefits along to all Americans by acting \nboth as stalwart environmental stewards and innovative supporters of \nenvironmentally friendly industrial processes. I strongly urge you to \nsupport this legislation--and to consider the business opportunities \nand environmental benefits that the promising field of green chemistry \ncould bring to your respective states.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The University of Maine,\n\n                                    Orono, ME, September 13, 2004.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: We request your support for legislation \n     pending in the Senate to provide for the implementation of a \n     green chemistry research and development program. The \n     University of Maine is a member of the New England Green \n     Chemistry Consortium and we are working with several \n     businesses in Maine to introduce green chemistry \n     manufacturing techniques and processes to improve \n     manufacturing productivity and help the environment. Federal \n     investments in green chemistry research and development would \n     support the University's efforts to advance green chemistry \n     practices in Maine and the New England states.\n       As you may know, on April 21, 2004 the House of \n     Representatives passed HR 3970, the Great Chemistry Research \n     and Development Act. The bill was referred to the Senate \n     Commerce Committee on April 22. We request your support for \n     this legislation in the Senate.\n       Federally funded research at the University of Maine on \n     green chemistry technologies would enhance our work in the \n     area of natural resource processing. Specifically, UM would \n     expand work on interfacial aspects of polymeric based \n     composite materials, including primarily paper, and wood \n     composites. The paper industry would benefit from development \n     of solvent free release coatings, coatings for solvent free \n     inks, and water based gravure printing. UM would also expand \n     its work to help Maine's emerging extruded wood/thermoplastic \n     composites industry develop new water based coatings and \n     adhesive systems to replace current solvent based methods and \n     chemistries that involve formaldehyde.\n       Thank you for considering this request and for your \n     continued support for research at the University of Maine.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                        Michael J.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Jack \nReed in introducing the ``Emergency Flu Response Act of 2004.'' I \ncommend him for his leadership on this important issue. I also commend \nour colleagues, Senator Bayh and Senator Craig, for their thoughtful \nproposal.\n  The Emergency Flu Response Act gives the nation's health agencies the \ntools they need to respond to the current shortage of flu vaccine, to \nprotect the public health from the danger of influenza and to maximize \nthe value of our reduced vaccine stocks.\n  During last year's flu season, we experienced unprecedented public \ndemand for the flu vaccine. Fears that last year's flu strain was more \nvirulent than those of previous years fueled the public's demand and \nresulted in the administration of all 87 million doses produced. \nAnticipating a similar demand for this upcoming flu season, the two \ncompanies that manufacture the flu vaccine planned to produce 100 \nmillion doses for the United States.\n  On Tuesday, one of those companies lost its license due to \nmanufacturing concerns and is unable to ship approximately 48 million \ndoses. In one day, America lost about half the country's supply of the \nflu vaccine--and fifteen States have lost their entire supply of \ninfluenza vaccine for adults.\n  Clearly, Congress should take action to strengthen the Nation's \nsupply of flu vaccine. My colleagues, Senator Bayh and Senator Craig, \nhave offered thoughtful proposals on strengthening the flu vaccine \nsupply in future years, and these proposals merit careful consideration \nby Congress. Many members of our Health committee have also shown great \nleadership on vaccine issues.\n  Due to the long period of time necessary to produce more vaccine, \nhowever, measures to increase the supply of new vaccine will have \nlittle effect on the current shortage.\n  We must make every effort to see whether additional flu vaccine can \nbe found. The bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto seek to purchase additional vaccines available in Europe, Canada or \nJapan, and directs the FDA to review those vaccines using the flexible \nand expedited review process provided under the Project BioShield \nlegislation. We should also provide NIH with the resources and the \nclear direction to determine whether existing flu vaccine stocks can be \ndiluted and still retain their effectiveness. NIH provided a valuable \nservice to the nation by conducting similar studies with smallpox \nvaccine.\n  These measures may increase the effective supply of vaccine available \nto the nation, but even these measures may not be sufficient to meet \nthe nation's needs. With flu season imminent, Congress must take steps \nimmediately to give our health agencies the resources and authority \nthey need to make best use of the supply currently available.\n  Our health professionals should make sure that those most at risk for \ncomplications from flu get vaccinated first. We must learn from the \nlessons from last year's flu season and use that knowledge to ensure \nthat at Americans at highest risk have priority access to the flu shot.\n  We must act quickly. We know that there are 54 million doses \navailable and we need to ensure that every one of them reaches those at \nhighest risk of complications from flu. The bill provides funding for \nstates to develop plans to effectively distribute vaccines to high \npriority groups. It also requires the tracking of available vaccines, \nso that doses can be directed to those who need it most.\n  Many employers contract directly with vaccine manufacturers to \nprovide a supply of vaccines for their workforce. Our bill establishes \na vaccine clearinghouse to facilitate the voluntary donation of vaccine \nfrom individuals or companies with employees at low risk of infection \nto individuals at high risk. Further, this bill gives HHS the ability \nto purchase vaccine back from employers and wholesalers for \nredistribution.\n  The Federal government should set an example of good vaccination \npractices. Our bill requires Federal Departments and the Attending \nPhysician of the Capitol to abide by CDC recommendations on who should \nreceive vaccine. If Members of Congress and their staffs cannot reserve \nflu vaccine for those most in need, how can we ask the American public \nto do so?\n  We must also learn from Canada's experience with the SARS outbreak in \nToronto last year. During that outbreak, many people were forced to \nremain home from work to prevent the spread of SARS. Some lost their \nwages during that time, and some even lost their jobs. Even more \nworrisome is that some people ignored the quarantine orders out of fear \nof repercussions at work. Our bill will assure that those who lose \nwages in complying with a Federal or State quarantine order will be \nfully compensated, and will be protected from losing their employment \nor related benefits.\n  Finally, we must recognize that voluntary measures may not be enough \nto\n\n[[Page S10864]]\n\navert a crisis. For this reason, the legislation gives HHS emergency \nauthority to require that vaccine supplies be administered to those in \nhighest need if it determines that voluntary measures have failed, and \nthat to do otherwise would pose a significant danger to the public \nhealth.\n  Let's not let history repeat itself. We need to be prepared for flu \nvaccine shortages and influenza pandemics in the future, and we need to \nrespond effectively to the current shortage. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the ``Emergency Flu Response Act of 2004.'' We face a crisis, \nand Congress should not delay in enacting this needed legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10864-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10864-S10865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 142--RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANT \n  ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN SINCE THE \n    EMERGENCY LOYA JIRGA WAS HELD IN JUNE 2002 IN ESTABLISHING THE \n FOUNDATION AND MEANS TO HOLD PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ON OCTOBER 9, 2004\n\n  Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Biden, Mr. Leahy, Mr. McCain, \nMr. Sununu, and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

The world and the \n     United States stand with [the people of Afghanistan] as \n     partners in their quest for peace and prosperity and \n     stability and democracy.'';\n       Whereas the independent Joint Electoral Management Body in \n     Afghanistan and thousands of its staff throughout Afghanistan \n     have worked to register voters and organize a fair and \n     transparent election process despite violent and deadly \n     attacks on them and on the purpose of their work;\n       Whereas more than 10,500,000 Afghans have been reported \n     registered to vote, demonstrating great courage and a deep \n     desire to have a voice in the future of Afghanistan, and more \n     than 40 percent of those reported registered to vote are \n     women;\n       Whereas the presidential election campaign in Afghanistan \n     officially began on September 7, 2004 and 18 candidates, \n     including one woman, are seeking the presidency;\n       Whereas on October 9, 2004, the people of Afghanistan will \n     vote in the first direct presidential election, at the \n     national level, in Afghanistan's history at 5,000 polling \n     centers located throughout Afghanistan, as well as polling \n     centers in Pakistan and Iran;\n       Whereas the United States, the European Union, the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the \n     Asian Network for Free Elections will send monitors and \n     support teams to join the more than 4,000 domestic election \n     observers in Afghanistan for the presidential election;\n       Whereas the United States and many international partners \n     have provided technical assistance and financial support for \n     elections in Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), \n     led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and \n     coalition forces will join the Afghan National Army and \n     police in Afghanistan to help provide security during the \n     presidential election: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the United States applauds the steadfast commitment of \n     the people of Afghanistan to achieve responsive and \n     responsible government through democracy;\n       (2) the United States strongly supports self-government and \n     the protection of human rights and freedom of conscience for \n     all men and women in Afghanistan; and\n       (3) the United States remains committed to a long-term \n     partnership with the people of Afghanistan and to a peaceful \n     future for Afghanistan.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nrecognizing the landmark Presidential elections that will take place in \nAfghanistan this Saturday, October 9, 2004.\n  My colleagues Senators Lugar, R-IN, Biden, D-DE, Leahy, D-VT, McCain, \nR-AZ, Sununu, R-NH and Dodd, D-CT, join me as original co-sponsors of \nthis resolution.\n  The Government and people of Afghanistan deserve our praise and \nrecognition for their achievements since the emergency Loya Jirga of \nJune 2002. The process leading to this historic election has not always \nbeen easy. Warlords and Taliban members have sought to intimidate \nvoters and disrupt the process. But the government of President Hamid \nKarzai and the people of Afghanistan have not been deterred. More than \n10.5 million Afghan citizens have been reported registered to vote, \nreflecting the courage and commitment of Afghans to a democratic \nfuture. Over forty per cent of those registered are women.\n  The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002, PL 107-327, authorized \nthe United States Government to provide $3.3 billion in political, \neconomic and security assistance to Afghanistan. It also expressed the \nU.S. Congress's support for the development of democratic institutions \nand a fully representative government in Afghanistan that respects \nreligious freedom and the rights of women. The presidential election \nthis week is a critical benchmark for America's commitment to a long-\nterm partnership with Afghanistan for responsible governance and a more \npeaceful future.\n  America's interests in Afghanistan are linked to our wider regional \nobjectives in the war on terrorism, and in promoting security and more \nopen political and economic systems throughout the Greater Middle East \nand Central Asia.\n  President Bush said on June 15, 2004, that ``the world and the United \nStates stand with [the people of Afghanistan] as partners in their \nquest for peace and prosperity and stability and democracy.''\n  I ask the Senate to recognize the historic achievement of the Afghan \npeople in holding presidential elections this week, and to join the co-\nsponsors of this resolution and me in expressing our continued support \nfor the people of Afghanistan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 143--RECOGNIZING COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION OF \n                 PUBLIC ACCESS DEFIBRILLATION PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Frist, and Ms. Collins) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 143\n\n       Whereas coronary heart disease is the single leading cause \n     of death in the United States;\n       Whereas every two minutes, an individual suffers from \n     cardiac arrest in the United States, and 250,000 Americans \n     die each year from cardiac arrest out of hospital;\n       Whereas the chance of survival for a victim of cardiac \n     arrest diminishes by ten percent each minute following sudden \n     cardiac arrest;\n       Whereas 80 percent of cardiac arrests are caused by \n     ventricular fibrillation, for which defibrillation is the \n     only effective treatment;\n       Whereas 60 percent of all cardiac arrests occur outside the \n     hospital, and the average national survival rate for an out-\n     of-hospital victim of cardiac arrest is only five percent;\n       Whereas automated external defibrillators (AEDs) make it \n     possible for trained non-medical rescuers to deliver \n     potentially life-saving defibrillation to victims of cardiac \n     arrest;\n       Whereas public access defibrillation (PAD) programs train \n     non-medical individuals to use AEDs;\n       Whereas communities that have established and implemented \n     PAD programs that make use of AEDs have achieved average \n     survival rates as high as 50 percent for those individuals \n     who have suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;\n       Whereas successful PAD programs ensure that cardiac arrest \n     victims have access to early 911 notification, early \n     cardiopulmonary resuscitation, early defibrillation, and \n     advanced care;\n       Whereas schools, sports arenas, large hotels, concert \n     halls, high-rise buildings, gated communities, buildings \n     subject to high-security, and similar facilities can benefit \n     greatly from the use of AEDs as part of a PAD program, since \n     it often takes additional and therefore critical time for \n     emergency medical personnel to respond to victims of cardiac \n     arrest in these areas;\n       Whereas widespread use of defibrillators could save as many \n     as 50,000 lives nationally each year;\n       Whereas the Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998 (Public \n     Law 105-170; 49 U.S.C. 44701 note) authorized AEDs to be \n     carried and used aboard commercial airliners;\n       Whereas the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 2000 (Public Law \n     106-505; 42 U.S.C. 238p-238q)\n\n[[Page S10865]]\n\n     provided for the placement of AEDs in Federal office \n     buildings;\n       Whereas the Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act (Public \n     Law 106-505, 42 U.S.C. 254c note) increased access to AEDs in \n     rural communities;\n       Whereas the Community Access to Emergency Defibrillation \n     Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-188; 42 U.S.C. 244-245) \n     authorized the development and implementation of PAD \n     projects; and\n       Whereas the Automatic Defibrillation in Adam's Memory Act \n     authorizes the use of grant funds to establish an information \n     clearinghouse to provide information to increase public \n     access to defibrillation in schools: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the growing number of community activists, \n     organizations, and municipal governments leading the national \n     effort to establish public access defibrillation (PAD) \n     programs; and\n       (2) encourages the continued development and implementation \n     of PAD programs in schools, sports arenas, NASCAR race \n     tracks, large hotels, concert halls, public housing, high-\n     rise buildings, gated communities, buildings subject to high-\n     security, and similar facilities to increase the survival \n     rate for victims of cardiac arrest.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Resolution that \nwould recognize the value and importance of automated external \ndefibrillators (AEDs) in our Nation's communities. It is an important \nResolution that sends a message of support to our communities, \nneighborhoods, schools and businesses.\n  For my colleagues who do not know, AEDs or automated external \ndefibrillators, are devices that, when used properly, administer an \nelectric shock through the chest wall to the heart. These devices are \nused on people who are suffering from heart attacks or have gone into \nfull cardiac arrest.\n  Many of my colleagues may have seen these devices in airports or in \nother public spaces such as stadiums or shopping malls. They have been \nmade widely visible and available because, according to the American \nHeart Association, ``AEDs strengthen the chain of survival. They can \nrestore a normal heart rhythm in sudden cardiac arrest victims.''\n  What makes AEDs so valuable to our communities is that they are \nextremely effective and they are easy to use. A microprocessor, which \nis embedded in the AEDs analyzes a person's heart rhythm and determines \nwhether an electrical shock is necessary to restore normal heart \nfunction. The American Heart Association makes clear the value of \nhaving access to AEDs--``When a person suffers a sudden cardiac arrest, \nfor each minute that passes without defibrillation, their chance of \nsurvival decreases by 7 to 10 percent.'' Fortunately, many communities \nhave realized the benefit of AEDs and have begun creating Public Access \nDefibrillation programs (PADs). There are a number of Public Access \nDefibrillation programs throughout our country, and I'm happy to say a \nfew of them are in Ohio.\n  These State, local and community PAD programs are a valuable asset \nbecause they ensure that automated external defibrillation accessible \nand available to cardiac arrest victims in the community and provide \nappropriate training in performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and \nthe use of automated external defibrillators.\n  This resolution simply recognizes the Public Access Defibrillator \nprograms for all of their good work to make it possible for communities \nto access these life-saving devices. My resolution also encourages the \ncontinued creation of PADs so that more people, in more places, have \naccess to AEDs.\n  Finally, my Senate colleagues and I have long supported automatic \nexternal defibrillators and their increased use in communities, \nparticularly rural communities. In fact, just this year, the Senate \nLabor Health and Human Services Appropriations subcommittee provides \n$10,933,000 for rural and community access to emergency devices. This \nfunding provides grants to expand placement of automatic external \ndefibrillators and to provide for training.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution, to pass this \nresolution, and to encourage the continued development of Public Access \nDefibrillator (PAD) programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10865-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4043.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Native Hawaiian Government \n     Reorganization Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States;\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian \n     archipelago that is now part of the United States, are \n     indigenous, native people of the United States;\n       (3) the United States has a special political and legal \n     responsibility to promote the welfare of the native people of \n     the United States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (4) under the treaty making power of the United States, \n     Congress exercised its constitutional authority to confirm \n     treaties between the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii, \n     and from 1826 until 1893, the United States--\n       (A) recognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) accorded full diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii; and\n       (C) entered into treaties and conventions with the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, \n     1849, 1875, and 1887;\n       (5) pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 \n     Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United States set aside \n     approximately 203,500 acres of land to address the conditions \n     of Native Hawaiians in the Federal territory that later \n     became the State of Hawaii;\n       (6) by setting aside 203,500 acres of land for Native \n     Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Hawaiian Homes Commission \n     Act assists the members of the Native Hawaiian community in \n     maintaining distinct native settlements throughout the State \n     of Hawaii;\n       (7) approximately 6,800 Native Hawaiian families reside on \n     the Hawaiian Home Lands and approximately 18,000 Native \n     Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands are on a waiting list to receive assignments of \n     Hawaiian Home Lands;\n       (8)(A) in 1959, as part of the compact with the United \n     States admitting Hawaii into the Union, Congress established \n     a public trust (commonly known as the ``ceded lands trust''), \n     for 5 purposes, 1 of which is the betterment of the \n     conditions of Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) the public trust consists of lands, including submerged \n     lands, natural resources, and the revenues derived from the \n     lands; and\n       (C) the assets of this public trust have never been \n     completely inventoried or segregated;\n       (9) Native Hawaiians have continuously sought access to the \n     ceded lands in order to establish and maintain native \n     settlements and distinct native communities throughout the \n     State;\n       (10) the Hawaiian Home Lands and other ceded lands provide \n     an important foundation for the ability of the Native \n     Hawaiian community to maintain the practice of Native \n     Hawaiian culture, language, and traditions, and for the \n     survival and economic self-sufficiency of the Native Hawaiian \n     people;\n       (11) Native Hawaiians continue to maintain other distinctly \n     native areas in Hawaii;\n       (12) on November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the ``Apology Resolution'') was \n     enacted into law, extending an apology on behalf of the \n     United States to the native people of Hawaii for the United \n     States' role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (13) the Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States and \n     further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never \n     directly relinquished to the United States their claims to \n     their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national\n\n[[Page S10866]]\n\n     lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum;\n       (14) the Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President--\n       (A) to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of \n     the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) to support reconciliation efforts between the United \n     States and Native Hawaiians; and\n       (C) to consult with Native Hawaiians on the reconciliation \n     process as called for in the Apology Resolution;\n       (15) despite the overthrow of the government of the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their \n     separate identity as a distinct native community through \n     cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give \n     expression to their rights as native people to self-\n     determination, self-governance, and economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (16) Native Hawaiians have also given expression to their \n     rights as native people to self-determination, self-\n     governance, and economic self-sufficiency--\n       (A) through the provision of governmental services to \n     Native Hawaiians, including the provision of--\n       (i) health care services;\n       (ii) educational programs;\n       (iii) employment and training programs;\n       (iv) economic development assistance programs;\n       (v) children's services;\n       (vi) conservation programs;\n       (vii) fish and wildlife protection;\n       (viii) agricultural programs;\n       (ix) native language immersion programs;\n       (x) native language immersion schools from kindergarten \n     through high school;\n       (xi) college and master's degree programs in native \n     language immersion instruction;\n       (xii) traditional justice programs, and\n       (B) by continuing their efforts to enhance Native Hawaiian \n     self-determination and local control;\n       (17) Native Hawaiians are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources;\n       (18) the Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future generations of Native Hawaiians their \n     lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural identity in \n     accordance with their traditions, beliefs, customs and \n     practices, language, and social and political institutions, \n     to control and manage their own lands, including ceded lands, \n     and to achieve greater self-determination over their own \n     affairs;\n       (19) this title provides a process within the framework of \n     Federal law for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise their \n     inherent rights as a distinct, indigenous, native community \n     to reorganize a Native Hawaiian governing entity for the \n     purpose of giving expression to their rights as native people \n     to self-determination and self-governance;\n       (20) Congress--\n       (A) has declared that the United States has a special \n     responsibility for the welfare of the native peoples of the \n     United States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) has identified Native Hawaiians as a distinct group of \n     indigenous, native people of the United States within the \n     scope of its authority under the Constitution, and has \n     enacted scores of statutes on their behalf; and\n       (C) has delegated broad authority to the State of Hawaii to \n     administer some of the United States' responsibilities as \n     they relate to the Native Hawaiian people and their lands;\n       (21) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special political and legal relationship with the Native \n     Hawaiian people through the enactment of the Act entitled, \n     ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii \n     into the Union'', approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; \n     73 Stat. 4), by--\n       (A) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held as a public trust for 5 purposes, 1 of which is \n     for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians; and\n       (B) transferring the United States' responsibility for the \n     administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of \n     Hawaii, but retaining the authority to enforce the trust, \n     including the exclusive right of the United States to consent \n     to any actions affecting the lands that comprise the corpus \n     of the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42) that are \n     enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting \n     the beneficiaries under the Act;\n       (22) the United States has continually recognized and \n     reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the aboriginal, indigenous, native people who \n     exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands;\n       (B) Native Hawaiians have never relinquished their claims \n     to sovereignty or their sovereign lands;\n       (C) the United States extends services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their unique status as the indigenous, native \n     people of a once-sovereign nation with whom the United States \n     has a political and legal relationship;

I understand S. 2949 is at the desk, and I ask for its \nfirst reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2949) to amend the Low-Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Act of 1981 to reauthorize the Act, and for other \n     purposes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this legislation reauthorizes the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by 13 other Senators: the Junior Senator from \nMaine, Mrs. Collins, the Senior from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, \nthe Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kennedy, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, the Senator from Maryland, Mr. \nSarbanes, the Senior Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, the Senator from \nNew York, Mr. Schumer, the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, and the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee.\n\n[[Page S10879]]\n\n  Funding authorization for this critically important program \ntechnically expires at the end of fiscal year 2004. In a regular year, \nthe fiscal year ends on September 30, a date that has already passed. \nRight now, our Government is operating under a temporary extension of \nthe fiscal year 2004 budget that expires on November 20, 2004. Today, \nthe Federal Government released money for the first quarter of 2005 at \nthe old fiscal year 2004 funding levels. I know that the states are \ngrateful to have this additional money in hand. We must do something \nnow to ensure that this vital program is reauthorized at a higher \nfunding level right away, so that we can provide America's low income \nfamilies the extra help they need this winter to pay their home heating \nbills. Who knows now, when we will finish appropriations for fiscal \nyear 2005? We may finish our appropriations legislation in December or \nJanuary, and we seem headed down that path.\n  The bill my colleagues and I introduce today sends the right message \nto concerned constituents already worried about about how they will \nafford to heat their homes in the face of reported higher home heating \ncosts in the next few months. With this bill we say even if Congress \ncontinues to extend last fiscal year's appropriations level or pass a \nnew one, the Senate will increase the amount of money that can be put \ntoward the LIHEAP program.\n  Fortunately, we know we have support in the Senate for the \nlegislation my colleagues and I introduce today. On February 12, 2004, \nthe Senate passed S. 1786 unanimously. S. 1786 is a bill to extend the \nCommunity Services Block Grant Act. Included in Title II, Section 202 \nof that bill is a provision that would provide an annual LIHEAP funding \nauthorization of $3.4 billion in each of FY2004-FY2006 and at such sums \nas necessary through FY2010. This bill is identical to Section 202 of \nS. 1786. Given that it has moved unanimously in the past, it is my hope \nthat the bill I introduce today can pass quickly and become law.\n  Why is this bill important, Mr. President? First, authorizing LIHEAP \nat a higher funding level would mean that a subsequent appropriations \nbill could add more funds to LIHEAP for this winter's heating season. \nAll of the fiscal year 2004 appropriation for LIHEAP has been released, \na total of $1.7 billion in regular funds and $99 million in contingency \nfunds, and we've funded the first quarter of 2005 at that same funding \nlevel. Even if we wanted to add more money for LIHEAP this winter, Mr. \nPresident, Congress is running close to the total authorized limit for \nthe program. Under current law, Congress can only give can only give \nLIHEAP up to $600 million in contingency funds, and $2 billion in \nannual regular funding. We are about to head into what is likely to be \na cold winter with high fuel cost having nearly hit our credit limit in \nthe amount we can spend on the LIHEAP program. That is wrong. It is \npoor financial planning and it does a grave injustice to the families \nthat are counting on us, especially when we know fuel costs are going \nto be high this winter. We should make certain that we can give the \nLIHEAP program the money it needs, and do so now.\n  Second, this bill is important our constituents face an uncertain and \nfrightening future with respect to energy costs. We should not continue \nto fund LIHEAP at last year's level when we know that costs are \nincreasing. In Vermont, my state's fuel assistance programs are now \nreceiving calls from constituents on fixed incomes that have fallen \nbehind on their fuel payments and are concerned about making ends meet. \nVermont's first deadline for applications for fuel assistance was \nAugust 31, 2004, and payments are not expected to reach eligible \napplicants until November. In response to this first deadline, my state \nreceived 1,800 more applications than last year. Vermont's increase in \nassistance applications reflects the increased heating costs throughout \nthe Northeast and Midwest. Almost daily, newspapers are reporting on \nthe effect of higher energy costs for consumers in these regions this \nwinter. The Energy Information Administration released its winter \nforecast this week. They forecast that heating costs will increase, and \nheating a home with oil in particular will go up by more than 28% \ncompared to a year ago and will cost an average of more than $1,300. \nCompared to average heating costs from 1998 to 2000, expenditures this \nwinter are expected to be 45 percent higher for heating oil.\n  Vermont is not alone. The costs for all heating fuels will be greater \nthan last year throughout New England and the Midwest. Natural gas will \ncost 11% more than it did last year, and propane will cost 17% more. \nThis may be our last opportunity to act before the onset of cold \nweather in New England and the Midwest. Families and businesses who \nface a heating crisis this winter deserve our help. Again, I think my \ncolleagues, and I urge swift passage of this bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask for its second reading, and in order to place the \nbill on the calendar under rule XIV I object to further proceeding on \nthis matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The bill will be read the second time on the next legislative day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/08/senate-section/article/S10879-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      AMENDING THE LIVESTOCK MANDATORY PRICE REPORTING ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

MODIFICATION OF DEFINITION OF MINORITY GROUP MEMBER \n                   FOR PURPOSES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON MINORITY \n                   VETERANS.\n\n       Subsection (d) of section 544 is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(d) In this section, the term `minority group member' \n     means an individual who is--\n       ``(1) American Indian or Alaska Native;\n       ``(2) Asian;\n       ``(3) Black or African American;\n       ``(4) Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; or\n       ``(5) of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on a \nsubstitute amendment I propose to make to S. 2486, the Veterans' \nBenefits Improvements Act of 2004, as part of my request that the bill, \nas so amended, be approved by the Senate. The underlying bill, S. 2486, \nwas reported by the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs on July 20, \n2004, and is explained in detail in Senate Report 108-352. My comments \nat this time are limited to explaining how the proposed substitute \namendment, which reflects a bipartisan agreement between Senate and \nHouse Veterans' Affairs Committees on issues related to veterans' non-\nmedical benefits and services, differ from the provisions of S. 2486, \nas reported.\n  Almost all of the provisions set forth in S. 2486, as reported, are \nincluded in the substitute agreement that I present to the Senate \ntoday. Changes made, for the most part, simply reflect provisions that \nthe House has approved which are acceptable to the Senate. There is, \nhowever, one notable excision of material from the Committee-reported \nbill: a provision crafted by Committee Member Zell Miller that would \nhave increased educational assistance benefits for Reserves who are \nactivated for extended periods. That provision is not included in the \nsubstitute amendment. Similar legislation, however, is in the offing \nvia another legislative vehicle.\n  After S. 2486 was reported by the Veterans' Committee, the President \nrequested that the Armed Services Committees, in the course of their \nconferencing on the Fiscal Year 2005 Defense Authorization bill, \napprove enhancements to educational assistance benefits that are \nsubstantially the same as those which are included in S. 2486, as \nreported. I have been given every indication that the President's \nproposal will be included in the conference agreement on the Defense \nAuthorization bill. Expecting this to be the case, Senator Miller's \nprovision--a provision that was a centerpiece of the Committee-reported \nbill--has been laid aside. In its place, the substitute amendment \nincludes a provision that would increase benefits to the neediest \nsurvivors of service members who are killed in combat or who \nsubsequently die from service-related injuries or illnesses.\n  Under current law, the surviving spouse of a service member who is \nkilled in service is eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation \n(DIC) benefits. The new provision, which is drawn from a provision \ncontained in a bill, S. 1132, that I introduced last year, would \nprovide, for a two-year period, an additional $250 per month of DIC to \na surviving spouse who has dependent children. VA estimates that \napproximately 27 percent of service members killed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan are survived by spouses who have at least one dependent \nchild. These survivors need an additional measure of help; the \nsubstitute amendment would provide it.\n  The substitute amendment also makes substantial improvements, \nauthored by the House, to VA educational assistance benefits provided \nto service members and veterans who pursue apprenticeship and on-the-\njob training programs. VA programs for supporting those who pursue such \nopportunities have not been updated for over 50 years. These amendments \nare overdue. I applaud Chairman Chris Smith, the author of these \nprovisions, for his efforts to expand employment and training \nopportunities afforded to veterans.\n  There are many other fine additions to the reported bill contained in \nthe substitute amendment. They include provisions to strengthen the \noversight of VA fiduciaries, to enhance the Servicemembers Civil Relief \nAct and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, \nand to improve on a myriad of other veterans' benefits and services. I \nencourage my colleagues to read the accompanying Explanatory Statement, \nwhich I ask be printed in the Record, for a better accounting of these \nworthy items.\n  This legislation will affect positively the lives of many deserving \nservice members, veterans, and survivors. It merits the support of my \ncolleagues. I request that support.\n  I yield the floor and I request the unanimous consent of the Senate \nthat the ``Explanatory Statement'' that accompanies this statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Explanatory Statement on Senate Amendment to Senate Bill S. 2486, as \n                                Amended\n\n       S. 2486, as amended, the ``Veterans Benefits Improvement \n     Act of 2004,'' reflects a Compromise Agreement reached by the \n     Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs (the \n     Committees) on the following bills reported during the 108th \n     Congress: S. 2485, as amended; S. 2486, as amended; and S. \n     1132, as introduced (Senate Bills); H.R. 1716, as amended; \n     H.R. 3936; H.R. 4175, as amended; H.R. 4345; and H.R. 4658, \n     as amended (House Bills).\n       The Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs have \n     prepared the following explanation of S. 2486, as further \n     amended (Compromise Agreement). Differences between the \n     provisions contained in the Compromise Agreement and the \n     related provisions of S. 2485, as amended; S. 2486, as \n     amended; S. 1132, as introduced; H.R. 1716, as amended; H.R. \n     3936; H.R. 4175, as amended; H.R. 4345; and H.R. 4658, as \n     amended; are noted in this document, except for clerical \n     corrections, conforming changes made necessary by the \n     Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, and \n     clarifying changes.\n\n                  TITLE I--VETERANS EARN AND LEARN ACT\n\n\nMODIFICATION OF BENEFIT ENTITLEMENT CHARGES FOR CERTAIN ON-JOB TRAINING \n                                PROGRAMS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3687 of title 38, United States Code, charges the \n     Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty and Selected Reserve programs' \n     entitlement usage based on the actual ``dollars used'' of \n     monthly VA payment amounts. The entitlement charge under the \n     Vietnam-era and survivors' and dependents' educational \n     assistance programs is based on the time spent in certain \n     training programs.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 102 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would modify the \n     manner in which VA on-job training and apprenticeship benefit \n     entitlement is charged under the MGIB, Vietnam-era and \n     survivors' and dependents' programs. The modification would \n     charge entitlement usage for all programs based on ``dollars \n     used'' rather than time spent in training. This provision \n     would take effect one year after date of enactment.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 102 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language with an effective\n\n[[Page S10885]]\n\n     date of months beginning after September 30, 2005.\n\n\n INCREASE IN BENEFIT FOR INDIVIDUALS PURSUING APPRENTICESHIP OR ON-JOB \n                                TRAINING\n\n     Current Law\n       Sections 3032 and 3233 of title 38, United States Code, and \n     Section 16131 of title 10, United States Code, state that \n     beneficiaries pursuing full-time apprenticeship or on-job \n     training programs will receive 75 percent of the monthly \n     educational assistance benefit for the first six months of \n     training, 55 percent for the second six months of training \n     and 35 percent for the subsequent months.\n       Section 3687 of title 38, United States Code, states that \n     beneficiaries receiving full-time VA monthly Survivors' and \n     Dependents' Educational Assistance allowances payable to \n     individuals pursuing full-time apprenticeship or on-job \n     training programs will receive, as of October l, 2004, $585 \n     for the first six months of training, $438 for the second six \n     months of training, $291 for the third six months, and $147 \n     for the remainder of the program.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 104 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would increase by 10 \n     percent the full-time VA monthly educational assistance \n     allowance payable to individuals pursuing a full-time \n     apprenticeship or on-job training program. For the first six \n     months of training, the percentage of the monthly benefit \n     would increase to 85 percent; for the second six months of \n     training, to 65 percent; and for subsequent months to 45 \n     percent. These percentage increases would apply to the \n     Montgomery Gl Bill Active Duty and Selected Reserve programs, \n     and the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance \n     program. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational \n     Assistance program would increase to $650 for the first six \n     months of training, $507 for the second six months of \n     training and $366 for the third six months. This provision \n     would be in effect from October 1, 2005 through September 30, \n     2010.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 103 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House language, but the 10 percent increase would take \n     effect October 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007.\n\n\n             AUTHORITY FOR COMPETENCY-BASED APPRENTICESHIPS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3672 of title 38, United States Code, currently \n     allows payment of VA educational assistance benefits for \n     time-based apprenticeships.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 105 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would authorize VA to \n     pay educational assistance benefits to veterans participating \n     in approved programs of competency-based apprenticeships; \n     this new authority is in addition to time-based \n     apprenticeships. In the case of a competency-based \n     apprenticeship registered with the Secretary of Labor, this \n     provision requires VA to consider Department of Labor \n     standards in determining the appropriate length and structure \n     of the competency-based apprenticeship. This section would \n     also direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to use up to $3 \n     million to develop the computer systems and procedures needed \n     to carry out section 105(a), 102, 103, and 104 of the bill.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 104 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language. The Committees note that this provision \n     acknowledges competency-based apprenticeships but does not \n     require employers to use them in lieu of time-based \n     apprenticeships. In today's workplace, apprenticeship \n     programs are time-based or competency-based, or a combination \n     of the two. Lastly, the Committees note that apprenticeships \n     offered in industries that elect not to register them with \n     the Department of Labor, but are approved by a State \n     approving agency or VA, would continue to serve as legitimate \n     training opportunities for veterans.\n\n\nTEN-YEAR EXTENSION OF DELIMITING PERIOD FOR SURVIVORS' AND DEPENDENTS' \n EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR SPOUSES OF MEMBERS WHO DIES ON ACTIVE DUTY\n\n     Current Law\n       Chapter 35 of title 38, United States Code, entitles the \n     surviving spouse of a servicemember or veteran who died of a \n     service-connected injury, or the spouse of a veteran who is \n     rated by VA as totally and permanently disabled as the result \n     of a service connected disability, to educational assistance \n     provided by the Secretary. An eligible spouse is entitled to \n     use such educational assistance during a ten-year period \n     beginning on either: (1) the date the person became eligible \n     by reason of the servicemember's or veteran's service-\n     connected death, or (2) the date on which the veteran was \n     rated by VA as totally and permanently disabled as the result \n     of a service-connected injury. A spouse may be eligible for \n     two ten-year eligibility periods as the result of two \n     distinct qualifying events. A spouse who is entitled to two \n     eligibility periods will not have a subsequent period of \n     eligibility reduced by any earlier period.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 203 of S. 2486, as amended, would extend chapter 35 \n     educational assistance eligibility from 10 to 20 years for a \n     surviving spouse of any person who died on active duty.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 105 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n     AVAILABILITY OF EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS FOR PAYMENT FOR NATIONAL \n   ADMISSIONS EXAMS AND NATIONAL EXAMS FOR CREDIT AT INSTITUTIONS OF \n                            HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n     Current Law\n       Sections 3452(b) and 3501(a)(5) of title 38, United States \n     Code, define the term ``program of education'' to generally \n     include a required course, or combination of courses, that \n     lead to an identified educational, professional, or \n     vocational objective. A ``program of education'' also \n     includes licensing or certification tests that are generally \n     required to enter into, maintain, or advance in a vocation or \n     profession. Section 3002(3) of title 38, United States Code, \n     expands the definition of ``program of education'' provided \n     in 3452(b) to include preparatory courses for a test required \n     or used for admission to an institution of higher education \n     or graduate school.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 204 of S. 2486, as amended, would authorize VA to \n     provide educational assistance benefits to reimburse eligible \n     beneficiaries for the cost of certain national tests required \n     for admission to institutions of higher learning or graduate \n     schools and for national tests that can qualify veterans for \n     receipt of college credit.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 106 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language, but adds the College Level Examination Program \n     (CLEP) as an example of a test for which educational \n     assistance benefits may be used.\n\n\nREQUIREMENT FOR COORDINATION OF DATA AMONG THE DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS \n      AFFAIRS, DEFENSE, AND LABOR WITH RESPECT TO ON-JOB TRAINING\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 107 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would require certain \n     coordination of information among the Departments of Veterans \n     Affairs, Defense, and Labor with respect to on-job training \n     and apprenticeship programs. First, at the time of a \n     servicemember's separation from active duty, the Secretary of \n     Defense would be required to furnish the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs with information concerning each registered \n     apprenticeship pursued by the servicemember during his or her \n     active duty service. Second, it would require the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs, in coordination with the Secretary of \n     Labor, to encourage and assist States and private \n     organizations to accord credit to servicemembers for skills \n     in any related apprenticeship the servicemember may pursue in \n     civilian life.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 107 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n    PILOT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ON-JOB BENEFITS TO TRAIN DEPARTMENT OF \n                  VETERANS AFFAIRS CLAIMS ADJUDICATORS\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 106 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a pilot program to \n     furnish structured on-job training and on-job training \n     benefits to claims adjudicators training in its disability \n     compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC), \n     and pension programs. The Secretary would be required to \n     submit reports concerning continuation and expansion of the \n     pilot program.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 108 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House language, but authorizes the Secretary to establish \n     a pilot program to furnish formal, structured on-job \n     training/benefits to claims adjudicators at the Secretary's \n     discretion, and not by statutory mandate. The Committees note \n     that one of VA's four regional offices that adjudicate \n     educational assistance claims already offer such formal, \n     structured on job training.\n\n\n COLLECTION OF PAYMENT FOR EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE UNDER MONTGOMERY GI \n    BILL FROM MEMBERS OF THE SELECTED RESERVE CALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY\n\n     Current Law\n       Sections 3011(b) and 3012(c) require that for a \n     servicemember to be eligible for Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) \n     educational assistance benefits, the servicemember's active \n     duty pay must be reduced by $100 for each of the first 12 \n     months that the individual is entitled to such pay. The \n     Secretary of Defense (or, in cases involving the activation \n     of U.S. Coast Guard personnel, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security) is responsible for the collection of the $1,200 \n     payment.\n\n[[Page S10886]]\n\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 201 of S. 2486, as amended, would permit the \n     Secretary of Defense (or, in cases involving the activation \n     of U.S. Coast Guard personnel, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security) to collect an activated Selected Reserve member's \n     $1,200 payment before the servicemember commences use of MGIB \n     educational assistance benefits.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 109 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language with the requirement that the servicemember furnish \n     a $1,200 payment not later than 1 year after completion of \n     the 2 years of active duty.\n\n                      TITLE II--EMPLOYMENT MATTERS\n\n             Subtitle A--Employment and Reemployment Rights\n\n\n   TWO-YEAR PERIOD OF CONTINUATION OF EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE \n                                COVERAGE\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 4317(a)(1)(A) of title 38, United States Code, \n     allows servicemembers covered under the Uniformed Services \n     Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) to \n     elect to continue employer-provided health coverage for up to \n     18 months while on active duty, provided the servicemember \n     pays up to 102 percent of the premium.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 201 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would increase from \n     18 months to 24 months the maximum period of employer-\n     provided health coverage that an employee covered by USERRA \n     may elect to continue. The coverage would become effective on \n     the first day of the servicemember's absence from employment \n     following the date of enactment of this provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 201 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n                REINSTATEMENT OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 4332 of title 38, United States Code, formerly \n     required that the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with \n     the Office of Special Counsel and the U.S. Attorney General, \n     provide annual reports to Congress on the disposition of \n     cases filed under USERRA. This requirement expired on \n     February 1, 1996.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 202 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would reinstate a \n     requirement that the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with \n     the Office of Special Counsel and the U.S. Attorney General, \n     provide annual reports to Congress on the disposition of \n     cases filed under USERRA, effective February 1, 2005.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 202 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\nREQUIREMENT FOR EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE NOTICE OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES UNDER \n                                 USERRA\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 211 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would require \n     employers to provide notice to employees of the rights, \n     benefits and obligations under USERRA. Section 211 would also \n     require the Department of Labor to make available to \n     employers, within 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     provision, the text of the notice.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 203 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n  DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR REFERRAL OF USERRA CLAIMS AGAINST FEDERAL \n               AGENCIES TO THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL COUNSEL\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 4322 of title 38, United States Code, provides that \n     an individual who believes his or her USERRA rights have been \n     violated by a Federal executive agency may file a complaint \n     with the Secretary of Labor to investigate such complaint. If \n     the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve the complaint, \n     then in accordance with section 4324 of title 38, United \n     States Code, the individual may request that the Secretary of \n     Labor refer the complaint to the Office of Special Counsel \n     (OSC) for resolution before the Merit Systems Protection \n     Board.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 212 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) to \n     carry out a three-year demonstration project on enforcement \n     of USERRA rights for Federal executive branch employees. The \n     demonstration project would allow certain individuals who \n     allege a Federal executive agency has violated their USERRA \n     rights to file a complaint with OSC. For the OSC \n     demonstration project, USERRA cases involving Federal \n     agencies would be selected by the terminal digit of the \n     claimant's social security number or, if there is no social \n     security number, the claimant's case number. Cases with odd \n     terminal digits would be sent directly to OSC. The \n     Comptroller General of the United States would be required to \n     conduct periodic evaluations of the demonstration project and \n     submit to Congress a final report.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 204 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language. While this demonstration project would be limited \n     to USERRA cases involving Federal executive agency employees, \n     the Committees intend to examine further USERRA education \n     and enforcement activities by the Departments of Labor, \n     Justice and Defense to determine whether all claimants are \n     being effectively and efficiently served under the current \n     system.\n\n                       Subtitle B--Other Matters\n\n\nREPORT OF EMPLOYMENT PLACEMENT, RETENTION, AND ADVANCEMENT OF RECENTLY \n                        SEPARATED SERVICEMEMBERS\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 206 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would direct the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs to contract for a report within \n     180 days of enactment on employment placement, retention, and \n     advancement of recently-separated veterans.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 211 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language. The requirement that the contract be entered into \n     within 180 days of enactment was deleted. Nonetheless, the \n     Committees expect the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter \n     into such a contract promptly.\n\n                      TITLE III--BENEFITS MATTERS\n\n\nADDITIONAL DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION FOR SURVIVING SPOUSES \n                        WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1311(a) of title 38, United States Code, prescribes \n     the payment of dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) to \n     the surviving spouse of a veteran or servicemember who dies \n     as a result of a service-connected disability. Section \n     1311(b) provides for an additional amount of DIC to be paid \n     for each of the surviving spouse's children who are under the \n     age of 18.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 4 of S. 1132, as introduced, would provide for a \n     $250 monthly increase in DIC payments for a surviving spouse \n     with children below the age of 18. Such payments would be \n     authorized during the 5-year period following the service-\n     connected death of the servicemember or veteran. Such \n     payments would cease when all children of a surviving spouse \n     reach age 18.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 301 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language, except that the $250 monthly increase in DIC would \n     only be authorized during the 2-year period following the \n     application for such benefit. The Committees intend that when \n     the Secretary notifies a DIC recipient of the additional \n     benefit provided by this section, such notice shall clearly \n     indicate that this is a transitional benefit which is limited \n     to two years.\n\n\n    OFFSET OF VETERANS' DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND DEPENDENCY AND \n      INDEMNITY COMPENSATION FROM AWARDS UNDER RADIATION EXPOSURE \n                          COMPENSATION PROGRAM\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, a veteran who first applies for and \n     receives an award under the compensation program administered \n     by the Department of Justice pursuant to the Radiation \n     Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), Public Law 101-426, is \n     prohibited from receiving benefits from the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs. However, a veteran who applies for VA \n     benefits first may then apply for the RECA award, subject to \n     an offset by the Department of Justice of the amounts \n     received from VA.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 202 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would repeal the bar \n     that prevents a veteran or survivor from applying for VA \n     benefits if the individual had previously received \n     compensation from the Department of Justice's RECA program. \n     The bill would allow individuals to receive VA compensation \n     or dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) benefits to \n     which they are entitled. However, VA would be required to \n     withhold compensation or DIC payments until the amount of the \n     RECA award has been deducted. This provision is effective for \n     compensation or DIC benefits paid after March 26, 2002. This \n     is the date regulations providing for a presumption of \n     service-connection for certain radiation-related disabilities \n     were established.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 302 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n[[Page S10887]]\n\n EXCLUSION OF LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS FROM CONSIDERATION AS INCOME FOR \n                       VETERANS' PENSION PURPOSES\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1503(a) of title 38, United States Code, requires \n     VA in determining eligibility for death pension benefits to \n     consider annual income, including all payments of any kind or \n     from any source.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 203 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would exclude life \n     insurance proceeds from consideration of income for death \n     pension benefits.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 303 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n CERTAIN SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITY BENEFITS AUTHORIZED FOR PERSONS \n  DISABLED BY TREATMENT OR VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PROVIDED BY THE \n                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1151(a) of title 38, United States Code, authorizes \n     disability compensation or dependency and indemnity \n     compensation for veterans and their dependents who are \n     injured or die as a result of negligent VA medical treatment, \n     or in VA-sponsored rehabilitation or training. Under the \n     decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit in Kilpatrick v. Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs, 327 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2003), veterans disabled \n     under section 1151 are eligible for specially adapted housing \n     allowances under chapter 21 of title 3 8, United States Code. \n     Section 1151 (b) prohibits the receipt of VA compensation \n     benefits or DIC (for amounts attributable to loss of \n     consortium or society) where an individual, on or after \n     December 1, 1962, receives a judgment against, or settlement \n     or compromise payment from, the United States, until an \n     amount equal to any judgment against, or settlement or \n     compromise payment from the United States is recouped.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 205(a) of H.R. 1716, as amended, would allow \n     veterans and dependents who are injured as a result of \n     negligent VA medical treatment or rehabilitation or \n     training to qualify for vocational rehabilitation \n     benefits, in addition to specially adapted automobile and \n     adaptive equipment grants. Section 205(b) would provide \n     that where a judgment, settlement or compromise of a claim \n     is offset against benefits provided by the Secretary, such \n     offset would be applied only to the comparable benefit.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 304 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House language, but omits eligibility for vocational \n     rehabilitation benefits. Section 205(c) is amended to provide \n     that in the event that a judgment, settlement or compromise \n     specifically designates a portion of such award for housing \n     or automobile benefits such as those provided under Chapters \n     21 or 39, and the beneficiary later applies for benefits \n     under Chapter 21 or 39, benefits under those chapters would \n     be reduced by the amount of benefits specifically designated \n     in the judgment, settlement or compromise. Any amounts in \n     excess of those permitted under Chapter 21 or 39 would be \n     offset against benefits paid under Chapter 11.\n\n\n                    effective date of death pension\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 5110(d) of title 38, United States Code, provides \n     that an award based on a death pension claim received more \n     than 45 days after the veteran's death can be effective no \n     earlier than the date of the claim. If the application is \n     received within 45 days of the veteran's death, then the \n     effective date of the death pension award is the first day of \n     the month in which the death occurred.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 204 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would repeal the 45-\n     day rule for the effective date of death pension. Therefore, \n     a claim for death pension received within one year from the \n     date of the veteran's death would be effective the first day \n     of the month in which the death occurred.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 305 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n  codification of administrative actions relating to presumptions of \n     service connection for veterans exposed to ionizing radiation\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1112(c)(2) of title 38, United States Code, lists \n     16 diseases that VA presumes are related to exposure to \n     ionizing radiation. In addition to the 16 listed in statute, \n     VA regulations list an additional five diseases: bone cancer, \n     brain cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. \n     Servicemembers who participated in certain radiation-risk \n     activities, as defined in section 1112(c)(3)(B), benefit from \n     the presumption of service-connection to ionizing radiation.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 201 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would add bone \n     cancer, brain cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian \n     cancer to the statutory list of those diseases presumed to be \n     related to ionizing radiation exposure during participation \n     in certain radiation-risk activities. Section 201 would also \n     codify additional locations where radiation-risk activities \n     occurred for purposes of determining which veterans qualify \n     for the presumption of service-connection of certain diseases \n     related to ionizing radiation exposure.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 306 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n                       TITLE IV--HOUSING MATTERS\n\n\n  authority to provide specially adapted housing to certain disabled \n                                veterans\n\n     Current Law\n       Chapter 21 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes the \n     Secretary to provide grants to adapt or acquire suitable \n     housing for certain severely disabled veterans.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 302 of H.R. 1716, as amended, would extend \n     eligibility for specially adapted housing grants to veterans \n     with permanent and total service-connected disabilities due \n     to the loss, or loss of use, of both arms at or above both \n     elbows.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 401 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n                    transitional housing amendments\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2051 of title 38, United States Code, establishes \n     the general authority governing loan guarantees for \n     multifamily transitional housing.

The VA ARM program was in force \n     from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1995.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 102 of S. 2486, as amended, would reinstate the VA \n     ARM program and extend its authorization through fiscal year \n     2011.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 404 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language but would extend the VA ARM program authorization \n     through fiscal year 2008.\n\n\n    EXTENSION AND IMPROVEMENT OF AUTHORITY FOR GUARANTEE OF HYBRID \n                       ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3707A of title 38, United States Code, authorizes \n     VA, during fiscal years 2004\n\n[[Page S10888]]\n\n     and 2005, to guarantee hybrid adjustable rate mortgage \n     (hybrid ARM) loans. Annual interest rate adjustments on VA-\n     guaranteed hybrid ARM loans are subject to a maximum increase \n     or decrease of one percentage point and are limited over the \n     term of the mortgage to a maximum increase of five percentage \n     points above the initial fixed rate of interest.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 103 of S. 2486, as amended, would extend the \n     authority of VA to guarantee hybrid ARM loans through fiscal \n     year 2011. For hybrid ARM loans with fixed periods of \n     interest of less than 5 years, the initial and subsequent \n     annual interest rate adjustments would be limited to one \n     percentage point. For hybrid ARM loans with an initial rate \n     of interest fixed for 5 years or more, section 103 would give \n     VA the authority to set an appropriate interest rate cap for \n     the initial interest rate adjustment. Annual adjustments \n     thereafter would be subject to a one percentage point cap. \n     Finally, section 103 would require VA to prescribe the \n     maximum number of percentage points above the initial fixed \n     rate of interest that would limit, over the term of a hybrid \n     ARM mortgage, interest rate adjustments.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 405 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language but would extend the VA hybrid ARM program through \n     fiscal year 2008.\n\n\nTERMINATION OF COLLECTION OF LOAN FEES FROM VETERANS RATED ELIGIBLE FOR \n           COMPENSATION AT PRE-DISCHARGE RATING EXAMINATIONS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3729(a) of title 38, United States Code, requires \n     VA to collect a fee from each person obtaining a housing loan \n     guaranteed by VA. Section 3729(c) prohibits the collection of \n     loan fees from veterans who are receiving VA disability \n     compensation. Disability compensation may only be paid upon \n     an active duty servicemember's discharge from service.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 104 of S. 2486, as amended, would allow a \n     servicemember who is rated eligible to receive disability \n     compensation as a result of a pre-discharge medical \n     examination to qualify for a waiver of the VA home loan \n     funding fee.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 406 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n  THREE-YEAR EXTENSION OF NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PILOT \n                                PROGRAM\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3761 of title 38, United States Code, establishes \n     the general authority governing a pilot program for housing \n     loans to Native Americans residing on tribal lands.

Such inquiry or investigation would be \n     conducted through, to the extent practicable, a face-to-face \n     interview, review of a credit report issued within one year \n     of the fiduciary's proposed appointment, and the furnishing \n     of any bond that may be required by the Secretary. \n     Additionally, the Secretary would be required to request \n     information on whether that person has been convicted of any \n     offense under Federal or State law resulting in imprisonment \n     for more than one year. If the proposed fiduciary has been \n     convicted of such an offense, the Secretary may certify \n     the person as a fiduciary only if the Secretary makes a \n     specific finding of rehabilitation and finds that the \n     proposed fiduciary is an appropriate one to act as the \n     fiduciary for the beneficiary.\n       In cases of a parent or step-parent of a minor beneficiary \n     (natural or adopted), spouse or parent of an incompetent \n     beneficiary, a person who has been appointed by a court of \n     competent jurisdiction, or a person appointed to manage an \n     estate where the annual amount of veterans benefits to be \n     managed does not exceed $3,600 (adjusted for annual cost-of-\n     living increases), the Secretary may certify the potential \n     fiduciary on an expedited basis.\n       If needed to protect the assets of the beneficiary when a \n     determination of incompetence is being made or appealed, or a \n     fiduciary is appealing a determination of misuse of veteran's \n     benefits, the Secretary would have the authority to appoint a \n     temporary fiduciary, for a period not to exceed 120 days. If \n     a final decision has not been made within 120 days of the \n     appointment of the temporary fiduciary, the Secretary would \n     not be able to continue the temporary appointment without a \n     court order for the appointment of a guardian, conservator, \n     or similar legal fiduciary.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 502 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language with modifications. Language requiring a specific \n     finding of rehabilitation before a person with a prior felony \n     conviction may be appointed to serve as a fiduciary is \n     omitted. The Committees intend that the Secretary have \n     discretion in determining when such a person would be an \n     appropriate person to serve as a fiduciary. The Committees \n     expect the Secretary to consider such factors as the length \n     of time since the conviction, the nature of the offense, the \n     relationship of the proposed fiduciary to the beneficiary, \n     and other factors which would demonstrate the appropriateness \n     of the appointment.\n\n\n                   misuse of benefits by fiduciaries\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 303 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would, if the \n     Secretary or a court of competent jurisdiction determines the \n     fiduciary misused some or all of the veterans' benefits, \n     prohibit a fiduciary from collecting a fee from a beneficiary \n     for any month benefits were misused. Additionally, any fee \n     collected would be considered to be misused.\n       Any fiduciary, except a Federal, State or local government \n     agency, would be liable for the amount misused, and that \n     amount would be treated as an erroneous payment to the 18 \n     fiduciary for purposes of laws pertaining to the recovery of \n     overpayments. The misappropriated amount would be recovered \n     in the same manner as any other debt due the United States, \n     and the Secretary would repay to the beneficiary or the \n     beneficiary's successor fiduciary, an amount equal to the \n     recovered amount.\n       In the event the misused benefits are due to the \n     Secretary's negligent failure to investigate or monitor the \n     fiduciary, the Secretary would be liable to reissue all the \n     benefits. Examples of failure to monitor a fiduciary \n     adequately would include the Secretary's failing to review, \n     in a timely manner, a fiduciary's accounting; failing to act \n     in a timely manner when notified of allegations of misuse; \n     and any other case when actual negligence is shown. In any \n     case, a fiduciary who is (1) not an individual (i.e., an \n     agency) or (2) is an individual who, for any month during a \n     period when misuse occurs, serves ten or more individuals who \n     are beneficiaries under title 38, United States Code, the \n     Secretary would also reissue benefits. When the Secretary \n     reissues a benefit payment, the Secretary is directed to make \n     a good-faith effort to recoup the funds from the fiduciary to \n     which the original payment was made.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 503 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language with modifications. The Committees have omitted \n     language authorizing the Secretary to make a finding of \n     misuse and treat the portions of benefits misused as \n     erroneous payments to the fiduciary. Also omitted is language \n     authorizing the Secretary to impose liability upon the \n     fiduciary and recover misused funds in the same manner as any \n     other debt owed to the United States. In addition, the \n     Committees have omitted the provision that would have made a \n     determination by the Secretary that a fiduciary has misused \n     benefits a decision of the Secretary for purposes of section \n     511(a) of title 38, United States Code. The Committees \n     recognize that it is the duty of the Federal government to \n     recover misused funds and expect that VA and other government \n     agencies will make every effort to recover misused funds. \n     However, at this time, the Committees need to assess further \n     the appropriateness of requiring a fiduciary accused of \n     misuse by the Secretary to appeal such a finding in the \n     appeals venue\n\n[[Page S10889]]\n\n     established for adjudicating veterans' entitlement claims.\n       The Committees have also amended the provision requiring \n     the Secretary to reissue benefits when the Secretary has \n     negligently failed to monitor or investigate a fiduciary. In \n     particular, the Committees have specified that a timely \n     review of a scheduled accounting or investigation of misuse \n     is one that occurs within 60 days of the scheduled accounting \n     or notification of alleged misuse.\n\n\n       additional protections for beneficiaries with fiduciaries\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 304 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to conduct periodic onsite reviews of any person or \n     agency located in the United States that serves as a \n     fiduciary to more than 20 beneficiaries and who administers a \n     total annual amount of benefits administered of $50,000 or \n     more (to be adjusted annually to reflect cost-of-living \n     adjustments). Additionally, the Secretary would be authorized \n     to require a fiduciary to file a report or accounting of \n     disbursement of benefits in accordance with regulations \n     prescribed by the Secretary. In the event a fiduciary fails \n     to file the requested report, the Secretary would be \n     authorized to require a fiduciary to appear in person at a VA \n     regional office to receive payment.\n       In the event the Secretary determines a fiduciary converts \n     a payment for some use other than for use on the \n     beneficiary's behalf, the Secretary would be authorized to \n     assess, in addition to any other penalty that may be \n     prescribed by law, a civil monetary penalty of not more than \n     $5,000 per conversion. Such person would also be subject to \n     an assessment by the Secretary of not more than twice the \n     amount of any payments converted.\n       Additionally, any Federal court, when sentencing a \n     defendant convicted of an offense arising from the misuse of \n     benefits, could have ordered, in addition to or in lieu of \n     any other penalty authorized by law, that the defendant make \n     restitution to the Department and the court would have been \n     required to state on the record the reasons for not ordering \n     restitution, or only ordering partial restitution. Any \n     amounts received or recovered would be available to defray \n     the expenses incurred by the VA's Office of Inspector General \n     for the inquiry or investigation of fiduciaries.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 504 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language with modifications. The title of new section 5509, \n     of title 38, United States Code, has been changed to reflect \n     more accurately the requirements of that section. The \n     provision for imposition of civil monetary penalties has been \n     omitted. The Compromise Agreement omits provisions allowing \n     amounts received in excess of benefit restitution to be made \n     available to the Office of the Inspector General.\n\n\n                             annual report\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 305 of H.R. 4658, as amended, would require the \n     Secretary to include in the ``Annual Benefits Report of the \n     Veterans Benefits Administration'' or the ``Secretary's \n     Annual Performance and Accountability Report'' information \n     concerning fiduciaries who have been appointed to receive \n     benefits. The required report would include: (1) the number \n     of beneficiaries in each category (veteran, surviving spouse, \n     child, adult disabled child or parent); (2) the types of \n     benefit being paid (compensation, pension, dependency and \n     indemnity compensation, death pension or benefits payable to \n     a disabled child under chapter 18 of title 38, United States \n     Code); (3) the total annual amounts and average annual \n     amounts of benefits paid to fiduciaries for each category and \n     type of benefit; (4) the number of fiduciaries who are the \n     spouse, parent, step-parent, legal custodian, court-appointed \n     fiduciary, institutional fiduciary, custodian-in-fact and \n     supervised direct payee; (5) the number of cases in which the \n     fiduciary was changed by the Secretary because of a finding \n     that benefits had been misused; (6) how such cases of misuse \n     of benefits were addressed by the Secretary; (7) the final \n     disposition of such cases of misuse of benefits, including \n     the number and dollar amount of any civil or criminal \n     penalties imposed; and (8) such other information as the \n     Secretary considers appropriate.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 505 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language with modifications. Additional reporting \n     requirements concerning cases referred to the Office of the \n     Inspector General and the amounts of money recovered by the \n     government have been added. Language referring to civil or \n     criminal penalties has been omitted.\n\n                   TITLE VI--MEMORIAL AFFAIRS MATTERS\n\n\n  designation of prisoner of war missing in action national memorial, \n           riverside national cemetery, riverside, california\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no applicable current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 122 of S. 2485 would designate the Prisoner of War/\n     Missing in Action National Memorial at the Riverside National \n     Cemetery in Riverside, California.

Section 2 would also require that not later than \n     90 days after the date of enactment of this provision, the \n     Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and \n     the Administrator of General Services submit to the House and \n     Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs and Armed Services a \n     joint report on the feasibility of locating a new Veterans \n     Courthouse and Justice Center at an appropriate Pentagon \n     Reservation site.\n\n\neducational assistance under the montgomery gi bill for members of the \nselected reserve who aggregate two or more years of active duty service \n                      during any five-year period\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3012 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide Chapter 30 \n     educational assistance benefits to an individual who, after \n     June 30, 1985, first enters on active duty and has his or her \n     pay reduced by $100 per month for the first 12 months of \n     active duty and serves at least two continuous years on \n     active duty.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 202 of S. 2486, as amended, would grant entitlement \n     to Chapter 30 educational assistance benefits to an \n     individual in the Selected Reserve who, during any five-year \n     period beginning on or after September 11, 2001, and ending \n     on June 30, 2008, serves an aggregate of two years of active \n     duty service. The activated Selected Reserve member would be \n     required to make a $1,200 contribution within one year of \n     completing two years of aggregate active duty service.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n\n  modification of definition of minority group member for purposes of \n                advisory committee on minority veterans\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 544 of title 38, United States Code, establishes an \n     Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans. For purposes of that \n     section of law the term ``minority group members'' includes \n     veterans who are: Asian American; Black; Hispanic; Native \n     American (including American Indian, Alaskan Native, and \n     Native Hawaiian); or Pacific-Islander American.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 303 of S. 2486, as amended, would amend the \n     definition of ``minority group member'' to conform to the new \n     Race and Ethnic Standards used in Federal statistical \n     reporting and in the 2000 United States Census. Specifically, \n     section 303 would redefine the categories of minority group \n     members making the following changes: substituting ``Asian'' \n     for ``Asian American;'' ``Black or African American'' for \n     ``Black;'' ``Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish Origin'' for \n     ``Hispanic;'' and ``American Indian or Alaska\n       Native'' and ``Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander'' \n     for ``Native American (including American Indian, Alaskan \n     Native, and Native Hawaiian).''\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n\n    increase in rates of disability compensation and dependency and \n                         indemnity compensation\n\n     Current Law\n       Current law does not require an annual cost-of-living \n     adjustment to veterans' and survivors' disability \n     compensation.\n     Senate Bill\n       S. 2483 contains a similar provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 2 of H.R. 4175 would provide, effective December 1, \n     2004, a cost-of-living adjustment to the rates of disability \n     compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities \n     and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for \n     survivors of certain service-connected disabled veterans. The \n     percentage increase would be equal to the percentage increase \n     for benefits provided under the Social Security Act.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       The Committees expect that a veterans' cost-of-living \n     adjustment effective December 1, 2004, will be considered in \n     another bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, as ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I urge my colleagues to continue to \nsupport our veterans and their families by passing the Veterans \nBenefits Improvement Act of 2004.\n  This bill, which I shall call the Compromise Agreement, is the final \nversion of a veterans omnibus bill. The Compromise Agreement will \nimprove and expand a host of veterans benefits, including: survivors \nbenefits for spouses with dependent children; housing benefits; and \neducational benefits for Guard and Reserve members, veterans, and \nspouses of veterans killed on active duty.\n  It is very appropriate that at a time when our airmen, soldiers, \nsailors and marines are in harm's way, that we remember the sacrifices \nthat those before them have made on behalf of this great Nation by \nimproving and expanding veterans benefits for our Nation's bravest and \ntheir families.\n  I will briefly highlight some of the more important provisions, and \nthen ask that my colleagues direct their attention to the Joint \nExplanatory Statement for further explanation of the proposed \nlegislation.\n  Dependency and indemnity compensation is a monthly benefit paid to \neligible survivors of servicemembers who died on active duty, and of \ncertain veterans. A larger monthly benefit is paid to surviving spouses \nwith children under the age of 18. Under this legislation, dependency \nand indemnity compensation for survivors, with dependent\n\n[[Page S10892]]\n\nchildren, of spouses killed on active duty would be increased by $250 a \nmonth, for 2 years, beginning on the date when entitlement to benefits \nbegins. A VA contracted study found that spouses with children had a \nhigher level of unmet need than spouses without children. This \nprovision is included to further aid the transition of surviving \nspouses with dependent children. We must make every effort to make \ncertain that the families of servicemembers who paid the ultimate \nsacrifice have their needs met.\n  Owning a home of one's own is the American Dream. This legislation \nwould make that dream a reality for more of our veterans by increasing \nthe maximum amount of the VA home loan guaranty. The current VA loan \nlimit of $240,000 restricts beneficiaries from using the guaranty \nbecause it is insufficient to cover median housing prices in many parts \nof the Nation. Section 403 of the Compromise Agreement would increase \nthe maximum VA loan amount to $333,700. It would also index the loan \nlimit to 25 percent of the conforming loan limit for a single-family \nresidence as set by Freddie Mac. This would allow the loan limit to \ncontinue to rise with the cost of housing inflation automatically. This \nchange, coupled with the reinstatement of the VA adjustable rate \nmortgage loan program and improvement of the hybrid adjustable rate \nmortgage loan program will allow many more veterans to be able to \npurchase a home.\n  The second half of the American Dream is a college education. \nEducational assistance is provided to the surviving spouse of a \nservicemember or veteran who died of a service-connected injury, or the \nspouse of a veteran who is rated by VA to be totally and permanently \ndisabled. The spouse has 10 years to use the entitlement. However, many \nsurviving spouses, during this difficult transitional period, are busy \nraising children and working making it impossible to use the education \nbenefit. This legislation would give an additional 10 years to the \nsurviving spouse of a servicemember who died of a service-connected \ndisability to use the benefit.\n  Under current law, a member of the Selected Reserve or National Guard \nmust contribute a non-refundable $1,200 in order to participate in the \nMontgomery GI Bill education program. However, a member of the Selected \nReserve must spend 1 year on active duty before being eligible for the \nprogram. Section 109 of the committee bill would create flexibility and \nallow the Montgomery GI Bill participation fee to be collected not \nlater than 1 year after the completion of 2 years of active duty, \nensuring that the Reserve or Guard has become eligible by satisfying \nthe service requirement.\n  With the costs of attending college rising, it is important that we \ndo as much for our veterans as possible so that they may reach their \nacademic objectives. This legislation would allow VA to reimburse \neligible beneficiaries for the cost of certain national admission \ntests, such as the Law School Admission Test, Graduate Record Exam, \nGraduate Management Admission Test, and Scholastic Aptitude Test, and \nfor course credit at institutions of higher learning, such as the \nAdvanced Placement Exam and College-Level Examination Program.\n  In keeping with this committee's continuing effort to aid veterans in \nattaining appropriate education and employment opportunities, this \nlegislation improves the full-time apprenticeship and on-job training \nprograms under the MGIB. Section 103 of the Compromise Agreement, for \nmore than a 2-year period, would increase the full-time VA monthly \neducational assistance allowance payable to individuals participating \nin these training programs. For the first 6 months of training, the \nmonthly benefit would increase to 85 percent from 75 percent; for the \nsecond 6 months, 65 percent from 55 percent; and the remainder of \nmonths, 45 percent from 35 percent. Additionally, Section 104 of the \nCompromise Agreement authorizes VA to pay educational benefits to \nveterans participating in competency-based apprenticeships, in addition \nto time-based apprenticeships, bringing the VA program in line with the \nway most apprenticeship programs are structured today.\n  These provisions show our veterans America's continuing unwavering \nsupport of the service and sacrifice that they have made on behalf of \nthis country. Particularly at a time when we are at war, we must ensure \nour servicemembers that we will fulfill the commitment promised by \nAbraham Lincoln, ``to care for him that shall have borne the battle and \nfor his widow and his orphan.''\n  In conclusion, I would like to specifically thank Senator Specter and \nhis benefits staff for their work on this comprehensive bill, \nspecifically Bill Tuerk, Jon Towers and Chris McNamee, and my staff, \nBuddy Menn, Mary Schoelen, Dahlia Melendrez, Ted Pusey, Amanda Krohn, \nand Tandy Barrett, who recently left the committee, for all of their \nhard work in helping to put this legislation together. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation on behalf of America's veterans \nand their families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord following this statement.\n  Mr. FRIST.
