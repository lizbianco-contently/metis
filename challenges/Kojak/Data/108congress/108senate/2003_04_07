We live in a world where moral \nconfusion is encouraged by some who wave the wishful wand of relativism \nand behold, nothing is truth or lie, good or evil. Thus is swallowed \nthe tempter's ancient bait to be ``as gods''--setting rules that suit, \nobliterating those that don't, reducing all to a mere matter of \nopinion.\n  Thy word, O God, is still truth not opinion. Those who delight in thy \nlaw, as the first Psalm tells us, flourish like a fruitful tree. Their \nway is known to Thee. The evil are not so. Their path peters out.\n  Teach us, O Lord, that Thy very nature is the truth of things. Before \nThee no lie can last. Show us that the proof of truth is its ultimate \nconsequences in rejoicing, not regret; in the spirit's freedom, not in \nself-forged chains; in vision, not venality; in a purpose that enlarges \nlife, not in soul-destroying cynicism.\n  O God, grant grace to this great Nation as it strives in a noble \ncause to bring liberty and may we all be blessed with desire for such \ntruth as makes and keeps us free indeed. Let the lode-star of Truth be \nthe beacon to guide these Senators on their paths of decision, as \nindividually they get their daily bearings, and collectively think and \nact in good faith for the benefit of this people and the world. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4883-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4883-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period for \nmorning business until the hour of 5 p.m. As we have done previously, \nthe first hour of today's morning business will be devoted to \nexpressions in support of our Armed Forces personnel in Iraq. At 5 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate will proceed to the first rollcall vote of the week. \nThe vote will be on the confirmation of Cormac Carney to be U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Central District of California. Although this \nwill be the 15th judge confirmed this year, I am concerned that the \nSenate has only acted on two circuit court nominations. There are six \ncircuit nominations on the calendar and 11 additional nominations in \ncommittee.\n  Following the scheduled 5 p.m. vote, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the next circuit court nomination on the calendar, the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nFifth Circuit. There are Members on both sides of the aisle who will \nprobably want to speak in relation to this nominee, and I hope some \nMembers will be available to give their remarks this evening.\n  On Tuesday, in addition to the judicial nomination mentioned, the \nSenate is expected to consider the CARE legislation under the consent \nagreement reached last week. I expect the Senate would begin the bill \non Tuesday and finish the remaining debate and votes on Wednesday.\n  This week we are still trying to reach agreements with respect to the \nFISA bill, the Foreign Intelligence Service Act, the bioshield bill, a \nPOW resolution, as well as any additional nominations that can be \ncleared. We will also be considering the budget and supplemental \nconference reports this week as they become available.\n  This is our last legislative week prior to the April recess and all \nMembers should be prepared for a full week as we attempt to finish a \nnumber of outstanding issues. I thank all Members in advance for their \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the majority leader finishes, I ask \nhim are we going to vote on the California judge today, and then did he \nsay he is going to go to Owen next?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader is going to move to that tonight?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, we will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4883-6", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4883-S4884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly, before turning to my \ncolleagues, I want to recognize the commitment and sacrifice of \nTennessee citizen soldiers. One thousand Tennessee National Guard \ntroops and airmen have been deployed to participate in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. Another 3,000 have been activated and await deployment. These\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\nmen and women leave full-time jobs and their families to serve their \ncountry and protect our liberty. I want to very directly say, thank \nyou. They are absolutely critical to the success of our mission in \nIraq. Thanks to their bravery, their boldness, their courage--and that \nis more than 300,000 men and women of the American military in Iraq--we \nwill prevail.\n  The 101st Airborne continues to make Tennessee and the United States \nof America proud. In Najaf, the 101st has helped return the city to \nnormalcy by restoring water and electricity and will very soon \nparticipate in the delivery of humanitarian aid. They have also \ncaptured a senior Iraqi intelligence officer there.\n  The 101st helped to secure and continues to protect Baghdad \nInternational Airport. The first American aircraft landed at the \nairport yesterday.\n  In Karbala, the 101st Airborne overwhelmed the enemy. All Iraqi \ntroops either fled or were killed. After cheers and waves from \nthousands of residents, citizens tore down a 25-foot bronze statue of \nSaddam Hussein.\n  Lastly, as quoted in this morning's Washington Post, MG David \nPetraeus told a rifle company while awarding two Purple Hearts:\n\n       There is no greater commitment than that which is made by \n     putting the American infantryman on the ground. You've really \n     walked point for our Nation in this particular battle and \n     this part of the campaign. You've performed brilliantly in \n     countless ambiguous situations.\n\n  I close in saying thanks, thanks to those Tennessee citizen soldiers \nand citizen soldiers from all across the country, the National Guard \ntroops and airmen, and thanks to all of our military personnel in Iraq \nand their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4884-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak under morning business \nthat we set aside to salute our troops in Iraq. Initially, the plan \nthat was put together by the military leadership was criticized, but \ntoday it is heralded as one of the great military strategies put \ntogether and will probably go down in the annals of military strategy. \nA number of individuals throughout the country are writing comments \nabout our troops in Iraq.\n  I have an article written by Rick Atkinson, Washington Post Foreign \nService, Thursday, April 3, 2003. It reads:\n\n       An enthusiastic welcome for U.S. forces in Najaf turned \n     jubilant today, as several thousand Iraqis braved sporadic \n     firefights for what one Special Forces officer described as \n     ``the Macy's Day parade,'' applauding a U.S. patrol that \n     pushed close to a religious shrine at the center of the city.\n       Four days after encircling Najaf, the 101st Airborne \n     Division tightened the occupation today.\n       Three infantry battalions rolled through the streets, \n     including neighborhoods around the venerated tomb of Ali, \n     son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad.\n       Fourteen M1 Abrams tanks clanked up and down the southern \n     boulevards, and another brigade of several thousand troops \n     cinched the cordon on the north, seizing arms caches and \n     swapping fire with elusive gunmen who are now believed to \n     number no more than a few score.\n       In the midst of the fighting, a U.S. patrol approached \n     Ali's tomb attempting to contact local clerics but were met \n     instead by a crowd. Lt. Col. Chris Hughes, a battalion \n     commander in the 1st Brigade, said, ``We waited about an hour \n     and a half, and the hair on the back of my neck began to \n     stand up. The crowd got bigger and bigger, so we pulled back \n     out. But it was like the liberation of Paris.''\n\n  I state our troops have been mindful of the Iraqi culture during the \npush north toward Baghdad. Our soldiers have been helping guard a \nreligious shrine in southern Iraq. The temple is called the Temple of \nZiggurat and was built 4,000 years ago. Many know the site as the \nbirthplace of Abraham. This is just one example of the way our men and \nwomen were respectful of the rich heritage of the Iraqi people and \ncommitted to helping them preserve their legacy.\n  I have a picture of a small Iraqi child giving a thumbs-up to our \nAmerican soldiers because he recognizes the great job our men and women \nare doing in Iraq and recognizes the fact it is his freedom we are \ntalking about. They are fighting not only to protect America but to \nprovide an environment where freedom will thrive in a new Iraq.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to continue to talk a bit \nabout the most important item before us, the issue most of us have on \nour minds, and that is our forces in Iraq, the efforts that are being \nmade there and the reasons for those efforts. Certainly, at this time \nall of us are thinking about that.\n  No one has ever said that this fight would be easy. Now that our \ntroops are in Baghdad, we acknowledge that perhaps the toughest part of \nthe war to disarm Saddam Hussein is likely still ahead of us. But so \nfar Operation Iraqi Freedom certainly has been a tremendous success, \nand I think all of us share in pride at the actions of our men and \nwomen who are there and our leaders who have caused these actions to \ntake place and have managed them. Our Operation Iraqi Freedom has been \na tribute to the skills of the men and women in uniform and their \nleadership.\n  I spent some time this morning with a group of fourth graders. These \nyoungsters have a pretty good idea of what is going on in Iraq and, to \nsome extent, why we are there. Obviously, they have been talking with \ntheir parents. Obviously, they have been watching TV. But I thought it \nwas amazing how much these young kids seemed to understand. I thought \nthat was great.\n  Certainly our hearts break for every life that is lost and every soul \nmissing on the battlefield. We thank our stars that the losses so far \nhave been relatively light. That, of course, doesn't make it any easier \nfor the families who have suffered the losses.\n  In less than 3 weeks, our aircraft have seized control of the skies. \nOur soldiers and marines and special forces control the bulk of the \ncountry. In less than 3 weeks, our troops are showering in Saddam's \nPresidential Palace in the capital city of Baghdad. In the blitz to \nBaghdad, our troops have taken more than 4,500 Iraqi prisoners. These \nprisoners are being seen by officials from the International Committee \nof the Red Cross to ensure they are treated within the guidelines of \nthe Geneva Convention. Saddam has been holding American prisoners for \nmore than 2 weeks and has yet to grant the Red Cross access to them.\n  Our forces have been treating the wounds of countless innocent Iraqis \ncaught in the crossfire. Our forces delivered relief to Iraqi citizens \nthrough its southern cities, removing deadly mines that prevented ships \nfrom docking. Our troops are safeguarding their ports and their oil \nwells for the time being.\n  I think it is amazing that our military has had such an impact and \nhas yet been able to focus it away from the civilians. Obviously, there \nare accidents and there are losses but relatively few. That is most \ndifficult in this kind of situation.\n  Just days ago there were naysayers who said Operation Iraqi Freedom \nwas failing. Now most of the conversation is about what we are going to \ndo after the combat is over. It is very difficult. Imagine what these \nnaysayers might have said on D-Day, Okinawa, Saipan, Chosin, Yorktown, \nGettysburg, or a host of other battles in our history and how their \ncommentaries might have influenced America's support in the war.\n  I sincerely hope--and I believe--that the American people are not as \nfainthearted or impatient as some would argue. We are in the 19th day \nof a war.\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\nThat is pretty short. Hopefully, it will be over soon. But those who \nbecame very impatient after 5 or 6 days--certainly that was \nnot realistic. I suppose maybe we had the notion from the gulf war that \nit would not last at all. I think we should be very pleased and very \nproud at the amount of time it has taken and the progress that has been \nmade.\n\n  In a war, as members of our Armed Forces know well, the enemy can \nreact differently than we predict. It is interesting some have talked \nabout the weaknesses of the planning, that it didn't go the way it was \nplanned. Of course it didn't. In a war things never go just the way \nthey were planned. But the plans, obviously, have been good to be so \nsuccessful. On the battlefield, of course, the enemy has a vote.\n  Our troops are learning on the go and adapting quickly to the \nchanging battlefields. They are rooting out death squads that blend in \nwith the Iraqi population in the countryside. Our troops are dealing \nwith car bombers who kill themselves in order to harm soldiers. These \nsuicide and homicide attacks, of course, can be indiscriminate and have \nthe potential to kill many innocent Iraqi civilians. It is also a \ndemonstration of how violence has changed over time. I guess things \nwill never be the same after 11 September. Who would have imagined \nthose things could take place. So we have a different kind of combat, \neven in war.\n  As our fight against Saddam Hussein's regime unfolds, I urge all \nAmericans to continue to have patience and support of our Commander in \nChief. Our victory is certain as is our continuing support for our \ntroops.\n  This regime is corrupt. Its leaders are morally bankrupt. The \nsavagery his death squads and car bombers are showing is not a tactic \nbut a symptom of a dying regime in the throes of its own demise.\n  As we focus on the days ahead, continuing to show our firm resolve to \nremove this tyrant and his regime and to accomplish the goal for which \nwe set out--and that is to disarm Saddam Hussein--I particularly wish \nto comment for a moment on the contribution of the National Guard in \nvarious States.\n  In my State, the Wyoming National Guard has certainly made a \ncontribution of which we are all very proud. Obviously, the National \nGuard consists of citizen soldiers and airmen who serve our country \nwith great pride and professionalism.\n  The first Federal mobilization of a Wyoming Army National Guard unit \ncame in 1898 with the Spanish-American War. Since then, and with the \ncreation of the Wyoming Air Guard after the Second World War, units \nhave served and participated in a variety of different theaters. These \ninclude the Korean war, Desert Storm, Bosnia, and now of course \nOperation Enduring Freedom.\n  Currently, the Wyoming National Guard has 20 percent of its personnel \nactivated in vital missions throughout the world. We have the smallest \npopulation of any State in the Union, so of course our people are \ngreatly missed--as they are in other places. Our local employers have \nbeen supportive of people who have been deployed, and we have had a \ngood deal of deployment for a good long time, in fact. I am very proud \nof the men and women in my State who have answered the call to service \nand eagerly joined the ranks of the National Guard. People willing to \njoin have increased in numbers since the war with Iraq has begun.\n  Not along ago, Brigadier General Dillon, Assistant Adjutant General \nof the Army, said to soldiers upon deployment:\n\n       You are now on the first string and you don't ride the \n     bench for long.\n\n  I suspect the National Guard is even more important than it has been \nin the past. As we get more and more technical in the regular, full-\ntime Army and Marine Corps, when there is a call for numbers, of \ncourse, then we have to turn to the Guard and to the Reserve.\n  We all join in extending our thanks and gratitude to these people and \nto their families for doing what they are doing and doing it so well; \nto leave their jobs, to leave their families, to change their lives. \nThis is a source of great pride that my State can consistently produce \nindividuals to meet these challenges. They have done a great job. There \nis an article in one of our local newspapers that highlights some of \nthese family members. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Casper Star-Tribune, Apr. 6, 2003]\n\n               Wyomingites Aboard U.S.S.

ARTHUR GUYTON\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, our State of Mississippi lost one of its \nfinest citizens when Dr. Arthur Guyton was killed in an automobile \naccident on Thursday, April 3. He was a preeminent cardiovascular \nphysiologist whose ``Textbook of Medical Physiology'' is the best known \nand most widely used medical school textbook in the world.\n  His research on hypertension and heart function was performed at the \nUniversity of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson and is the basis \nfor the level of mankind's knowledge of these subjects today. He was a \ngraduate of the University of Mississippi and the Harvard Medical \nSchool.\n  He published his textbook in 1956, which was largely a compilation of \nthe lecture notes he used when he was teaching physiology in the early \n1950s at the University of Mississippi in Oxford.\n  He and his wife Ruth are the parents of 10 children who are all \nphysicians and engaged in the practice of medicine. Some are working at \nsuch leading medical centers as Duke and Johns Hopkins. Dr. Guyton's \nfather was also a medical doctor who practiced in Oxford, MS, and was \ndean of the Ole Miss Medical School. No family in America is more \nprominent in the field of medicine.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with this distinguished family. We \nextend to them our sincerest condolences and the thanks of a grateful \nnation for their continuing contributions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article \npublished in the Clarion-Ledger newspaper in Jackson MS, on April 4 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            World-renowned Miss. Doctor Killed in Car Crash\n\n                           (By Thyrie Bland)\n\n       Dr. Arthur C. Guyton, a world-renowned physiologist and \n     author of the most widely used textbook on physiology, was \n     killed Thursday in a two-vehicle accident in Pocahontas, \n     officials said.\n       Guyton's wife, Ruth, who was driving, was in critical \n     condition Thursday night at the\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\n     University of Mississippi Medical Center, where her husband \n     was a founding father.\n       The Guytons' van collided with a car driven by Marjorie \n     Guthrie, of Yazoo City, shortly before 4 p.m. on U.S. 49 \n     North in Hinds County, said Warren Strain, a spokesman for \n     the state Department of Public Safety. Guthrie's condition \n     was unavailable.\n       Guyton, 83 of Jackson, leaves behind 10 children--all \n     doctors--and a legacy of research.\n       The modest physician's hallmark discovery was proving that \n     blood flow is regulated by the body's billions of capillaries \n     and not by the heart, as long thought.\n       ``It's just a loss of a giant of the 20th century,'' said \n     Dr. Wallace Conerly, UMC's chief executive officer. ``Still \n     today, what most of us know about hypertension and congestive \n     heart failure, that man did it.''\n       An Oxford native, he worked most of his life as a teacher \n     and researcher at UMC, where he was chair of the department \n     of physiology and biophysics for 41 years. He authored the \n     Textbook of Medical Physiology.\n       ``I used his textbook to get through Tulane Medical School \n     in 1956,'' Conerly said.\n       Guyton retired in 1989 at age 69 from UMC with a gala \n     dubbed Arthur Guyton Day by the state and city.\n       ``He still came to the office almost everyday,'' said \n     Barbara Austin, a UMC spokeswoman. ``He still taught \n     classes.''\n       Guyton, partially paralyzed from polio at age 27, designed \n     a motorized wheelchair, special hoist and walking brace for \n     which he later earned a Presidential Citation.\n       ``My father came from a farm and gave us our goals,'' \n     Guyton told The Clarion-Ledger in 1989. ``My mother had been \n     a teacher and a missionary in China where she taught physics \n     and math, so we could always ask her the scientific \n     questions.''\n       Heralded with more than 50 national and international \n     awards in medicine, Guyton always was quick to skip over his \n     own accomplishments to compliment his wife and children. He \n     married Ruth Weigel in 1943 after the two met during a \n     bicycle ride.\n       The cause of the accident is under investigation, Strain \n     said.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

MARY JANE OGILVIE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Tuesday, April 1, Mary Jane Ogilvie, the \nbeloved wife of the Rev. Dr. John Lloyd Ogilvie, passed away. A light \nhas gone out in the lives of the many people who were touched by her \nlove, her dedication, and her compassion.\n  Rev. Dr. John Lloyd Ogilvie, who served as the Senate Chaplain from \nMarch 3, 1995, until just this past month, was an unfailing source of \nsupport on many occasions to many of us in this Chamber, as well as to \nour families and our staff. He has been a compassionate spiritual \nadvisor and a personal counselor during some of the most dangerous and \ntrying times in the history of the Senate, including the horror of \nSeptember 11 and the anthrax attack a few weeks later. I think it is \nfair to say that his unstinting service was heightened by, and a \nreflection of, the equal strength and understanding of Mrs. Ogilvie in \ntheir many years together.\n  From what I know and understand, Mrs. Ogilvie was a kind, gentle \nwoman, who exhibited indomitable courage and determination. Having \ndealt with illness in her own life, she was a source of inspiration and \ncomfort in the lives of others. She was a petite woman, but her size \nbelied a remarkable tenacity and will. Mrs. Ogilvie understood \nsuffering, and she reached out to lessen the suffering of others. She \nwas one of those special individuals who made life better and happier \nfor all those who knew her.\n  Mrs. Ogilvie did not seek the limelight. Her own effervescence and \nlove for her husband and family and friends offered light enough. I am \nsure that those who grieve for her now will be comforted by the quiet \nmemory of her shining, luminous life.\n  Dr. Ogilvie will miss her. He will miss her very much. My own wife, \nErma, and I extend to Dr. Ogilvie and his children--Scott, Heather, and \nAndrew--our deepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathies.\n\n     Sometimes at eve when the tide is low,\n     I shall slip my mooring and sail away,\n     With no response to the friendly hail\n     Of kindred craft in the busy bay;\n     In the silent hush of the twilight pale,\n     When the night stoops down to embrace the day\n     And the voices call o'er the waters flow--\n     Sometimes at evening when the tide is low\n     I shall slip my moorings and sail away.\n\n     Through the purple shadows that darkly trail\n     O'er the ebbing tide of the Unknown Sea,\n     I shall fare me away, with a dip of sail\n     And a ripple of waters to tell the tale\n     Of a lonely voyager sailing away\n     To Mystic Isles where at anchor lay\n     The crafts of those who have sailed before\n     O'er the Unknown Sea to the Unknown Shore.\n\n     A few who have watched me sail away\n     Will miss my craft from the busy bay;\n     Some friendly barks that were anchored near,\n     Some loving hearts that may heart held dear,\n     In silent sorrow will drop a tear.\n     But I shall have peacefully furled my sail\n     In moorings sheltered from storm or gale,\n     And greeted the friends who have sailed before\n     O'er the Unknown Sea to the Unseen Shore.\n\n  This bit of verse from Lizzie Clark Hardy I recall today in memory of \nMrs. Ogilvie, and our dear friend the former Chaplain, Dr. Ogilvie.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I also rise to express Lilibet's and my \nsympathy over the loss of a close friend, Mary Jane Ogilvie. As the \nwife of Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie, our Senate Chaplain, Mary Jane was a friend \nto many and always offered an attentive ear and an open heart to all of \nus in the Senate family. Her high spirit and quiet strength endeared \nher to all who knew her.\n  Mary Jane was a remarkable woman. Having battled cancer, she \ncounseled others living with cancer. She devoted countless hours to \nraising awareness and funding for cancer research. She raised a \nmagnificent family . . . which is her legacy. Lilibet and I cherished \nour friendship with Mary Jane. We will miss her, but we will be renewed \nand enhanced by the time we had with Mary Jane. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with Lloyd and the Ogilvie family.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from West Virginia \nthat no one in the Senate is better able to express the interests not \nonly of the Senator from West Virginia but for the Senate as a whole on \nmatters of the type he talked about. Senator Byrd spoke of Reverend \nOgilvie and his wife and what they both contributed to life in the \nSenate. I echo his comments and say that we miss Reverend Ogilvie and \nhis wife, and we grieve for her passing. I thank Senator Byrd for \ncalling the attention of the Senate to it today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4887-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4887-S4890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DROWNING IN TRADE DEFICITS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I will speak about trade. On \noccasion, I have come to talk about our problems in international trade \nbecause it relates to the center of the issues we need to be concerned \nabout with respect to our country's economy; and that is jobs, a \ngrowing economy that produces good jobs that pay well, that expands \nopportunities for the American people. Yet our trade strategy in this \ncountry has been a bankrupt trade strategy for a long while.\n  I will use a chart to describe what I am talking about. The current \ntrade strategy in America is producing nothing but red ink, and not \njust a small amount of red ink, but we are literally drowning in trade \ndeficits. This is the merchandise trade deficit in this country. These \nare trade deficits that are completely out of control. Last year, there \nwas $470 billion in trade deficits.\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\n  April 1 was April Fools Day, and that is the day the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative released its 2003 report on trade barriers. This is the \n2002 report. The 2003 report is not yet available in hard copy, but I \nam told it is as thick and as voluminous as the 2002 report. It \ndescribes the trade barriers that we find overseas and around the world \nfor American goods produced by American workers in American factories. \nIt lists country by country and barrier by barrier foreign markets that \nare closed to our products.\n  Frankly, despite all the talk about free trade and expanded trade, \nthere has been very little progress in prying open these markets. Let \nme use one example that demonstrates better than almost any other of \nhow difficult it has been for us to make real progress on these issues. \nI will describe it in the context of our trade with Japan in beef--yes, \nbeef. Fifteen years ago now, we reached a trade agreement with Japan so \nthat American beef could be sold into the Japanese marketplace. That \ntrade agreement provided that for every pound of American beef that \nwent into Japan, there would be a 50-percent tariff. That is after our \nnegotiators reached an agreement. We have a very large trade deficit \nwith Japan, but our negotiators reached an agreement that said at the \nend of this agreement there will now be a 50-percent tariff on every \npound of American beef going into Japan, and then it will reduce over \ntime. But if we get increased quantities into Japan, it will snap back.\n\n  So 15 years after our beef agreement with Japan, and those who \nnegotiated having had a fiesta of sorts on the front pages of all of \nour papers talking about this enormous success that we would now get \nmore American beef into Japan, there is now a 38\\1/2\\-percent tariff, \nand it is about to go back to 50 percent. The USTR report now says that \nJapan plans to increase the tariff to 50 percent because of an increase \nin beef imports this year.\n  The only reason there is an increase in this year is that the \nJapanese consumers are finally starting to eat beef again after mad cow \ndisease was found in Japan some years ago. So Japan decided that a \n38\\1/2\\-percent tariff is not enough. Now it will go back to 50 \npercent, 15 years after we reached an agreement with this country to \ntake more American beef.\n  This chart shows the agreements we have with other countries in terms \nof the balance of trade. My colleagues will see that red represents \ndeficits. We have trade deficits with virtually every major trading \npartner, with the exception of Australia, and we are about to remedy \nthat because we are about to enter into an agreement with Australia. I \nassume they will be able to turn a positive trade balance into a \ndeficit very shortly.\n  It does not matter which agreement we have had, whether it is NAFTA \nor GATT, what we have done is create circumstances where all of our \nmajor trading partners are running trade surpluses with us.\n  I will talk a bit about the country of China. We have major trade \ndeficits with China, with Europe, Canada, Mexico, Korea, and Japan. Are \nthey getting better? No, they are getting much worse. Does it hurt this \ncountry? Of course it does. It means jobs that would have been in this \ncountry to produce goods and services the American people want instead \nexist in other countries. So the jobs that used to represent American \njobs are now belonging to some other country producing those products \nto ship back into this country.\n  Let me talk about trade with China in the context of wheat. I come \nfrom a State that produces beef and wheat so I am naturally interested \nin that. I will discuss other products as well. The U.S. trade official \nin charge of trade with China recently left his job, and he had the \ncourage to say publicly that China has failed miserably to live up to \nits promises that it made on agricultural trade when it joined the WTO \nin November of 2001. In fact, our trade official said the United States \nwould be well justified in filing a WTO case against China. He said the \nevidence of unfair trade by the Chinese is ``undeniable,'' and the \nChinese themselves privately acknowledge they are cheating on \nagricultural trade.\n  The official said the administration did not have the spine to take \naction because the Chinese might be offended. He said the \nadministration was worried that a WTO case would be seen as an in-your-\nface thing to do to China so soon after China joined the WTO.\n  When China joined the WTO in November of 2001, the Chinese agreed to \nsignificantly expand the amount of imported wheat that would come into \nChina at low tariffs. They agreed for 2002 it would set a tariff rate \non imported wheat at 8\\1/2\\ million metric tons. That means 8\\1/2\\ \nmillion metric tons of wheat could enter the Chinese marketplace at low \ntariffs. But according to the Congressional Research Service, Chinese \nimports were less than 8 percent of what we expected to move into \nChina. China was supposed to allow 8\\1/2\\ million metric tons, but it \nimported about 662,000 metric tons, and only 169,000 of that was from \nU.S. producers. How could that be? China's millers increasingly demand \nhigh quality wheat--the wheat we produce, wheat we can produce \nefficiently.\n\n  One explanation is, to import wheat under this Chinese TRQ, a Chinese \nimporter needs a license. The license is granted by the Chinese \ngovernment. The Chinese government decides only 10 percent of the \nlicenses are going to be available to private importers; 90 percent are \nreserved for the Chinese government itself. If the Chinese government \ndecides not to take American wheat into its marketplace, it will not do \nit. That is exactly what they have done. They commit to 8.5 million \ntons of imported wheat and make sure 90 percent will never be brought \ninto the country.\n  I came to the Senate when this happened and quoted a Chinese \nagricultural official in the South Asian Post. For the Chinese \nconsumption they were saying a bilateral agreement will open up trade \nbetween the United States and China. What he said in the South Asian \nPost, do not expect that is what we will accept into China. He said \nthat to the Chinese. But they were telling the Americans a different \nstory.\n  March 17, the USTR official named Bruce Quinn, who was the director \nof the China desk at USTR, now the former director of the China desk, \ntold wheat industry meetings that USTR should file a case against China \nat the WTO. What made Mr. Quinn's comments particularly interesting is \nthey were made on the last week in the job for him. He was moving to \nanother agency. He felt then he could speak freely. He said about the \nChinese government: The Chinese officials have never disagreed with the \nUnited States technical criticism about China administering tariff-free \nquotas. They just make the political argument you have to understand \nChina, China is a special case. He said the inter agency trade policy \nreview gave the ambassador's office the green light to proceed to take \naction against the WTO for China, but too many in the administration \nfeel it is an in-your-face thing to do so soon after joining the WTO. \nSoon after making these comments in the last week on the job, the \nadministration disavowed its comments, saying he was not speaking for \nthe administration, but nobody said Mr. Quinn had said something wrong \nor what he said was wrong.\n  Why should we be reluctant to file a case against China at the WTO if \nevidence of cheating is rampant, so rampant that even the Chinese \ngovernment admits it? Isn't that what the WTO was supposed to provide, \na forum for dealing with unfair and illegal trade practices? If we let \nthe Chinese government or China off the hook in the first year or two \nof this bilateral agreement, what will happen in the future?\n  Some might say this is about wheat and they are not wheatgrowers. For \nthose who might view the proceedings and think we do not grow wheat and \ndo not see it as a big deal selling grain or wheat to China, this is \njust one example of many that represents this monumental trade deficit. \nOur trade deficit in goods this past year was $470 billion. One-fourth \nof that, $103 billion, was with China alone. The deficits of Canada, \n$50 billion. Mexico, $37 billion. And Japan and Europe. Not only do we \nhave deficits with trading partners, but we have deficits in almost \nevery sector of trading: $110 billion deficit in vehicles, $47 billion \ntrade deficit in consumer electronics, $58 billion deficit in clothing.\n  I mention the trade deficit with China. Just to give an example of \nwhat causes much of this, in many cases it is\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\nincompetent trade negotiators on our part. We negotiate a bilateral \nwith China and our trade negotiators agree, after a phase-in with \nrespect to the U.S. and China, we will agree to a 10 times higher \ntariff on U.S. automobiles that we attempt to sell in China than would \nbe imposed on Chinese automobiles in the United States. We say we will \nimpose 2.5 percent on Chinese automobiles that are shipped here and you \nimpose a 25 percent tariff on U.S. automobiles in China. I don't know \nwho would agree to that. Whoever it is does not deserve to be paid by \nthe American taxpayers. It is an incompetent position to engage in \nbilateral negotiations and tie our consumers', our employees' hands \nbehind their back in international trade. We will do that by saying you \ncan go ahead and impose tariffs 10 times the amount of tariffs we would \nimpose on equivalent goods.\n\n  The trade deficit with Canada, similarly, is a deficit that in some \nrespects comes from the Canadians as a result of the trade agreement \nbeing allowed to continue, a Canadian wheat board, which would be \nillegal in this country, a state trading enterprise would be illegal in \nthis country. In Canada, it sells into this marketplace at secret \nprices, undercuts our farmers, and essentially thumbs its nose at \nAmerican officials when they say we want the evidence of selling below \nacquisition costs in our marketplace and, therefore, dumping illegally \nin our marketplace. And the Canadians say, We are sorry; we do not \nintend to disclose anything to you, or any prices in this country.\n  Trade deficit with Europe, $82 billion last year. The WTO was \nsupposed to provide us with a forum to resolve trade disputes. The fact \nis, it has not with respect to Europe. We went to the WTO, got a \ndispute resolution in our favor against Europe dealing with the import \nof U.S. beef to Europe which Europe was preventing. And despite that, \nwe are still not getting U.S. beef into the European marketplace.\n  Trade deficit with Korea, $13 billion in 2002. I spoke before about \ncars from Korea, but let me give an example. We have just received the \n2002 figures for automobile trade with Korea. The Koreans sold 633,000 \nKorean cars in this country. We sold 3,200 in Korea; 633,000 this year \nand 3,200 that way.\n  Now, why we do not sell more vehicles? Take the Dodge Dakota pickup \ntruck. In February of this year, DaimlerChrysler started to sell that \npickup truck in Korea. The Dodge Dakota truck is made in Detroit, \nMichigan. Korea does not manufacture pickups like Dodge Dakotas, so \nDaimlerChrysler thought it had a good potential market in Korea and \nstarted to market the vehicle to small business owners. It was very \nsuccessful. It got orders for 60 pickup trucks in February, another 60 \nin March. That does not sound like much, especially when Korea is \nsending us 633,000 vehicles in a year, but it is a start. At an \nannualized rate that would amount to a 50-percent increase in car \nimports from the U.S. into Korea, into the marketplace just from the \nDodge Dakota pickup alone.\n  Guess what happened? In March, last month, an official with the \nMinistry of Construction and Transportation decided the Dakota pickup \nposed a hazard in the marketplace so he announced the cargo covers on \npickups, on Dodge Dakotas, were illegal and the drivers of those \npickups would be fined if they put a cargo cover on the pickup truck. \nThe newspapers had giant headlines: Government ministry finds Dodge \nDakota covers illegal. Guess what happened? The Korean people got the \nmessage. Korean car purchasers canceled 55 of the 60 orders scheduled \nfor March and now you cannot find a buyer for a Dodge Dakota in Korea, \nwhere in the last couple of months hundreds were lining up. Once again, \nwe discover that trade is not free and it is not fair.\n\n  I have a chart that shows just one example of one sector, and these \nare last year's numbers, but, as I indicated, they are the same as this \nyear, essentially. They ship us all their cars and this represents good \njobs. We cannot get American cars into Korea. Just ask yourself: If the \nAmerican consumers want to buy Hyundais and Daewoos and cars that are \nproduced in Korea to come into this country, should they have the \nright? Absolutely. But what if a Korean wants to buy a Mustang? What if \na Korean wants to buy a Ford Mustang convertible? Should they have that \nopportunity, that right? Do they now? Of course not. The Koreans are \nmaking sure we are not getting American cars into Korea. The result is \nan increased trade deficit, fewer good jobs in this country, and the \nfurther result is nobody seems to care. All they want to do is \nnegotiate another incompetent agreement.\n  One of my feelings about the USTR is they come to this Congress \nasking for fast-track authority, which I think is nuts, saying to \nCongress: Tie your hands behind your back; let us negotiate an \nagreement in secret, and when we bring it to you, you decide by rule \nyou cannot amend it.\n  I think that is plain nuts. Nonetheless, they were able to persuade \nenough people in the Senate and the House.\n  So they have fast-track authority so the next agreement they make \nwith another country, they will bring it to the Congress, take it or \nleave it, no amendments in order. If they hadn't had fast track when \nthey did the United States-Canada agreement, we wouldn't be stuck with \nthe problem we have with the Canadian Wheat Board dumping into our \nmarketplace, cutting into our farmers. But you couldn't offer an \namendment. Who knows what will be in the next agreement they make? But \nwhen they make the agreement with another country, it will come here, \nlikely pass the Senate and House, and the newspapers that support all \nthis will trumpet this as an expansion of trade and it is free trade \nand it is wonderful and everybody--all boats are lifted by it.\n  That is total nonsense. I am in favor of expanded trade and expanded \nopportunity, but I am in favor of trade officials in this country \nhaving a spine and backbone to stand up for the interests of this \ncountry.\n  Should we continue to decide it is our lot in life to compete with \nsomebody who is making 30 cents an hour, working 70 hours a week? \nShould we compete with a 12-year-old working 12 hours a day making 12 \ncents an hour? That happens, by the way. Is that fair competition?\n  That product is produced in any number of countries overseas and then \nshipped to the marketplace in Toledo or Fargo or Manchester or New York \nCity. Is that fair trade? Is that what our producers ought to compete \nagainst? Or should we have some basic standards which say that what we \nfought for for over a century in this country--the right to work in a \nsafe workplace, the right to organize, the right to be paid a fair \nwage, the right not to expect you have to work next to children; all of \nthose rights that were fought for in this country--some people died for \nthem; some people chained themselves to the factory gates for those \nrights--should all those be rights over which producers pole-vault to \nrush to another country to produce and say we don't have to worry about \nthat, we don't have to worry about dumping pollution into the stream or \nthe air, hiring 12-year-old kids, putting them in an unsafe workplace, \nwe can do that because we have the right to do that and we have the \nright to ship our products to our country?\n  They ought not have that right because that is not fair trade. It is \nnot fair competition, and we should not ask American workers and \nproducers to compete against that.\n  There are so many issues to talk about with respect to international \ntrade. In the end, I come back to the notion that it represents the \nstrength of our economy to maintain a strong manufacturing base. No \ncountry will long remain a strong economic power if it does not retain \na basic manufacturing base. Our manufacturing base is very quickly \nmoving from this country to countries where production costs are lower. \nIt is one thing to say we lose in international competition. It is \nquite another to say we are going to set up the competition in a manner \nthat is fundamentally unfair and guarantees you lose.\n  In my judgment, whether it is farmers or manufacturing workers or \ntextile plants, if we can't compete and win against fair competition, \nthen our plants should not make it at all. But the competition ought to \nbe required to be fair.\n  None of these trade agreements require that--none of them. Whether it \nis someone who is ranching out there today, producing cattle for a \nmarket and expecting to be able to move it into Japan without a 50-\npercent tariff or somebody who is raising potatoes in\n\n[[Page S4890]]\n\nthe Red River Valley expecting to be able to move potato flakes into \nKorea without a 300-percent tariff or somebody producing Durham wheat, \nexpecting not to compete against the state cartel in Canada that \nundersells them at secret prices, or, yes, a big automobile company in \nthis country that expects not to have to compete against those who \nproduce elsewhere and keep their markets closed to us--all of those are \nvery serious problems relating to this country's economy and this \ncountry's ability to produce good jobs that pay well for the American \npeople.\n  A $470 billion trade deficit this year--somebody is going to have to \npay that bill. You can make the case--at least economists do--that the \nbudget deficit is money we owe to ourselves. You cannot make that case \nwith the trade deficit. This is money we owe to other countries that \nwill inevitably be repaid with a lower standard of living in this \ncountry. That is why it is important at some point that we pay \nattention to it and view this as a crisis.\n\n  You can't get the editorial pages of the major newspapers to say so. \nYou can't even get an op-ed piece published in the Washington Post \nunless you have a vision about trade that exactly matches theirs and \nthe prevailing view in this town, which is: There are free traders--\nthat is what they say--there are free traders who see beyond the \nhorizon, who have a world view that is learned and is to be commended.\n  Then there are the others and the others are xenophobic isolationist \nstooges who just have never gotten it and understood that things have \nchanged in the world.\n  Those are the two sides. If you are someone who says an unkind word \nat all about this structure of trade agreements that requires us to \ncompete unfairly and allows others to compete unfairly against us, you \ndon't have a chance of having that view expressed in the major \nnewspapers in this country. That is regrettable because that means we \ndon't have an aggressive debate on international trade.\n  The debate should never be about: Is expanding trade something that \nhelps our country and helps others around the world? The debate ought \nto be about as we globalize--and we are globalizing our economies very \nquickly--will the rules of international trade in this global economy \nkeep up with the galloping globalization? The answer to that, until \nnow, regrettably, has been no. The rules have not kept pace, and that \nis why we find ourselves in this position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CARNEY, OF CALIFORNIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n         DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will go \ninto executive session to consider the nomination of Cormac J. Carney, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Cormac J. Carney, of \nCalifornia, to be United States District Judge for the Central District \nof California.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nJudge Cormac Carney, who has been nominated to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Central District of California.\n  Following his graduation from Harvard Law School in 1987, Judge \nCarney entered private practice with the high powered law firm of \nLatham & Watkins. He worked there until 1991. He next worked as an \nassociate for another widely respected law firm, O'Melveny & Myers, \nwhere he became a partner in 1995. He remained at O'Melveny until his \nappointment to the Orange County Superior Court in 2001, where he has \npresided over both criminal and civil matters.\n  Prior to his appointment to the bench, Judge Carney was an \nexceptional business litigator who typically represented Fortune 500 \ncompanies as both plaintiffs and defendants. His areas of expertise \nincluded complex matters such as real estate, partnership, lender \nliability, environmental law, intellectual property, and insurance \ncoverage.\n  Even with a heavy workload and prestigious clients, Judge Carney \ndevoted numerous hours to pro bono work for the disadvantaged. As a \npartner at O'Melveny, he supervised the firm's junior lawyers on pro \nbono cases, which included housing issues, education, civil rights, and \nthe rights of homeless people. Because of the firm's extensive pro bono \nwork, the Orange County Bar Association awarded it the Pro Bono \nServices Award, and the Orange County Public Law Center awarded it the \nLaw Firm of the Year Award.\n  Since his appointment to the bench, Judge Carney has become involved \nwith victims' rights. He currently serves as a member of the Governing \nBoard of Victim Assistance Programs in Orange County. The Board \nprovides support and guidance to all victim assistance programs and \nadvises on procedure and policies relating to operations of victim \ncenters located throughout Orange County.\n  Although Judge Carney has had a stellar legal career, I must note \nthat before he made law his chosen profession he played professional \nfootball, first for the New York Giants and then for the Memphis \nShowboats. The legal profession is fortunate that he ultimately joined \nour ranks, since he has served on both sides of the bench with \ncompassion, integrity, intelligence and fairness. I am confident that \nhe will serve with the same qualities on the Federal district court \nbench.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination \nof Judge Cormac Carney for the Central District of California.\n  Judge Carney is a bright, young judge with truly impressive \ncredentials. Judge Carney graduated cum laude from UCLA, where he \nearned All-American honors as a wide receiver. He attended Harvard Law \nSchool, worked as a partner for the prestigious law firm of O'Melveny & \nMyers, and has served with distinction as a Los Angeles Superior Court \njudge.\n  I am confident he will prove a valuable addition to the bench in the \nSouthern District of California.\n  Today's vote on Judge Carney marks a milestone event for California's \nbipartisan Judicial Advisory Committee, which Senator Barbara Boxer and \nI set up with the White House.\n  Judge Carney is the eighth judge to come out of the advisory \ncommittee. Nearly every one of these judges has passed out of the \ncommittee by a unanimous vote.\n  With Judge Carney's confirmation, the committee will have filled all \nthe current district court vacancies in California.\n  This if the first time in recent memory that all of California's \nauthorized district court judgeships are filled.\n  I would like to give credit to Jerry Parsky and the White House for \nworking constructively with the California Senate delegation in a \nbipartisan manner to get these judgeships filled.\n  The results of the committee's efforts speak for themselves. On \naverage, these eight California judges have received Senate \nconfirmation within 114 days of their nomination.\n  In contrast, during the last year of the Clinton administration, \ndistrict court nominees took an average of 196 days to get confirmed.\n  We have confirmed these nominees efficiently and without rancor. This \nprocess has enabled the best and the brightest legal minds of our state \nto gain admission to the Federal bench.\n  I hope the Senate sees our efforts in California as a model of how \nthe judicial nominations process could work.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Cormac J. Carney, of California, to be\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\nUnited States District Court Judge for the Central District of \nCalifornia? The yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander), the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Allen), the Senator from \nMissouri (Mr. Bond), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from Oregon (Mr. \nSmith), and the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Talent) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Graham), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from \nHawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the \nSenator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Lieberman), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), the Senator \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Miller), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson), the \nSenator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), and the Senator from New York \n(Mr. Schumer) are necessary absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) \nwould each vote ``Aye''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Are there any \nother Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 80, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 126 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--80\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--20\n\n     Alexander\n     Allen\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Corzine\n     Edwards\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Talent\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. With today's confirmation vote on the nomination of Judge \nCormac Carney to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia, Senate Democrats again demonstrate their bipartisanship \ntoward consensus nominees. Judge Carney's confirmation will bring to 16 \nthe number of judicial nominees of President Bush confirmed just this \nyear, with 14 district court nominees and two circuit court nominees \nconfirmed in the first 10 weeks since the reorganization of the Senate. \nThis stands in marked contrast to 1996 when only 17 judicial nominees \nof President Clinton were confirmed all year, and not one of them was \nfor the circuit courts.\n  Last year alone, in an election year, the Democratic-led Senate \nconfirmed 72 judicial nominees, more than in any of the prior 6 years \nof Republican control. Overall, in the prior 17 months I chaired the \nJudiciary Committee, we were able to confirm 100 judges and vastly \nreduce the judicial vacancies that Republicans had stored up by \nrefusing to allow scores of judicial nominees of President Clinton to \nbe considered. Not once did the Republican-controlled Senate consider \nthat many of President Clinton's district and circuit court nominees. \nWe were able to do so despite the White House's refusal to consult with \nDemocrats on circuit court vacancies and many district court vacancies.\n  There is no doubt that the judicial nominees of this President are \nconservation, many of them quite to the right of the mainstream. Many \nof these nominees have been active in conservative political causes or \ngroups. Democrats moved fairly and expeditiously on as many as we could \nconsistent with our obligations to evaluate carefully and thoroughly \nthese nominees to lifetime seats in the Federal courts. Unfortunately, \nmany of this President's judicial nominees have proven to be quite \ncontroversial and we have had serious concerned about whether they \nwould be fair judges if confirmed to lifetime positions. We are pleased \nthat this is not the case with Judge Carney of California.\n  While Republicans frequently point to the 377 judges confirmed for \nPresident Clinton, what they tellingly leave out is that only 245 of \nthem were confirmed during the 6\\1/2\\ years Republicans controlled the \nSenate. That amounts to only 38 confirmations per year when the \nRepublicans last held a majority. In 1999, the Republican majority did \nnot hold a hearing on any judicial nominee until June. Last week, the \nRepublican majority held its seventh hearing including a 32nd judicial \nnominee in the last 2 months. The Senate Judiciary Committee under \nRepublican control operates in two very different ways under very \ndifferent practices and rules depending on the political party of the \nPresident. This year it is acting like a runaway train, operating at \nbreakneck speed and breaking longstanding rules and practices of the \ncommittee to rush through the consideration of lifetime appointees.\n  This year we have had a rocky beginning with a hearing for three \ncontroversial circuit court nominees which caused a great many problems \nthat might have been avoided had the chairman honored the bipartisan \nagreement on controversial nominees and the pace of hearings and votes \nthat has been in place since 1985, for almost 20 years. The chairman's \ninsistence on terminating debate on the Cook and Roberts nominations, \nin clear violation of the committee's express rules that have been \nhonored since 1979, for almost 25 years--is another serious problem. Of \ncourse, with the Estrada nomination, the administration's unwillingness \nto work with the Senate to provide access to documents of the exact \nsame type as have been provided in past nominations for lifetime and \nshort-term appointments has proven to be a significant problem. The \nopposition to the Sutton nomination is also extensive. The \nunprecedented nature of a President re-nominating someone for the same \njudicial position after a defeat in committee has led to the very \ncontroversial Owen nomination pending on the floor with the assent of \nonly the Republicans on the committee. The chairman's decision to hold \na hearing on the controversial Judge Kuhl, despite objections of one of \nher home state Senators, is also problematic and is something that he \nnever did, not once, when there was a Democrat in the White House.\n  Nonetheless, the Senate has proceeded to confirm 116 of President \nBush's judicial nominees, including 16 this year alone and another \ntoday. It was not until September 1999, 9 months into the year, that 16 \nof President Clinton's judicial nominees were confirmed in the first \nsession of the last Congress in which Republicans controlled the Senate \nmajority. At the pace set by Republicans now, we are 6 months ahead of \nthat schedule.\n  The confirmation of Judge Carney will fill the last current vacancy \nin the Federal district courts in California. This nomination is a good \nexample of the kind of bipartisan-supported candidates the President \nought to be sending the Senate. Judge Carney comes to us after being \nunanimously approved by California's Bipartisan Judicial Advisory \nCommittee--a committee established through an agreement Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Boxer reached with the White House. This is one \nof the few bipartisan commissions that the White House has allowed to \nproceed, although the White House has not moved forward with some of \nits bipartisan, qualified recommendations. This California committee \nworks to take the politics out of judicial nominations. It reviews \nqualified, consensus nominees who will serve on the Federal judiciary \nwith distinction. Too often in the last 2 years we have seen the \nrecommendations of such bipartisan panels rejected or stalled at the \nWhite House. Instead, they should be honored and encouraged.\n  Judge Carney has served as a Superior Court Judge in the State of \nCalifornia since 2001. Judge Carney was a\n\n[[Page S4892]]\n\npartner with the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers handling civil matters \nbefore he was appointed to the State court bench in 2001.

Last Congress, led by \na Democratic Senate majority, the Senate confirmed four nominees to the \nFederal district courts in California. Percy Anderson and John Walter \nwere confirmed to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia on April 25, 2002, just 3 months after their initial \nnominations. The Senate also confirmed Robert G. Klausner to be a U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Central District of California on July 18, 2002, \nand Jeffrey S. White to be a U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of California on November 14, 2002. The Senate has now filled \nall seven of the vacancies on the Federal trial courts in California \nthat we inherited.\n\n  Last year, at the urging of Senator Feinstein and the chief judge of \nthe district, we included in the 21st Century Department of Justice \nAppropriations Authorization Act, five additional judgeships for the \nSouthern District of California. We also included an additional \nposition for the Central District of California. By mid-July California \nwill have six important vacancies to be filled. I look forward to \nworking with the Senators from California to proceed, if possible, in \nadvance of July on additional nominations so that these much-needed \nseats can be filled quickly with fair, mainstream nominees. It is \nunfortunate that the President, who has had notice of these upcoming \nvacancies for some time, has not worked with the California Senators \nand their bipartisan commissions to send consensus nominees to the \nSenate.\n  I congratulate Judge Carney, his family, and the Senators from \nCalifornia on his confirmation.\n   Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to express my \nsupport for the nomination of Cormac J. Carney to be U.S. District \nJudge, for the Central District of California. Mr. Carney has the \nknowledge, experience and personal characteristics needed to succeed on \nthe Federal bench.\n  Unfortunately, due to inclement weather, I was unable to return to \nWashington in time for the vote to confirm Mr. Carney, but I would like \nthe Record to reflect that, had I been present, I would have cast my \nvote in favor of his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take just a couple of minutes \nof my leader time to make a statement with regard to a very special \nyoung woman.\n  Throughout America--especially in Native American communities--\nAmericans are grieving the loss in combat of Army PFC Lori Piestewa. \nBut we are also feeling pride for Lori Piestewa's remarkable life.\n  PFC Piestewa was a member of the Army mechanics unit that was \nambushed by Iraqi soldiers on March 23.\n  Her body, and the remains of eight other soldiers, were recovered \nlast week from a hospital in southern Iraq when Special Forces stormed \nthe hospital to rescue another member of the 507th Maintenance Company, \nPFC Jessica Lynch.\n  Private Piestewa is the first Native American woman in the U.S. Armed \nForces ever to die as a result of combat.\n  She was 23 years old. She leaves behind two small children--a 4-year-\nold son and a 3-year-old daughter. . . .\n  She also leaves behind a broken-hearted but proud family--and \ncountless friends.\n  There are more than 12,000 Native Americans serving in our military \ntoday--including many from my State of South Dakota.\n  They and Private Piestewa are part of a noble tradition that too few \nAmericans know much about.\n  It is a tradition that includes heroes like the ``Code Talkers'' of \nWorld War II--the service members from the Lakota, Navajo and other \nIndian nations who developed the only military code that was never \nbroken by the Japanese.\n  The Code Talkers were key to U.S. victories throughout the Pacific \ntheater. Their service helped turn the tide of the war--and saved \nuntold numbers of American lives.\n  Today, Private Piestewa takes her place alongside them as an American \nwho risked everything to protect her land and her people.\n  Over the weekend, memorials began to appear all over the reservation \nnear Tuba City, AZ, where Private Piestewa grew up and where her family \nstill lives.\n  At one of the memorials, someone left a group of red, white, and blue \nballoons. Included in the bunch was one green balloon, the team color \nfor Tuba City High School, where Lori Piestewa had been a softball star \nand a junior ROTC commander.\n  On May 24, Private Piestewa will be honored at another memorial. Red \nrose petals will be place in her honor in the reflecting pool of the \nWomen in Military Service for American Memorial at Arlington National \nCemetery.\n  When I heard about the memorials to Private Piestewa, I thought of \nanother cemetery--at Wounded Knee, on the Pine Ridge reservation in \nSouth Dakota.\n  I remember the first time I visited it. As I walked toward the \ncemetery, I was surprised to see little American flags dotting many of \nthe graves. When I got close enough to read the headstones, I could see \nthat many of the people there were veterans.\n  Some--like Private Piestewa--had died in the service. Others had died \nyears after they took off the uniform. But they wanted it recorded on \ntheir graves: This person loved this Nation.\n  I have never seen a more profound expression of American patriotism.\n  The thoughts and prayers of our Nation are with the family and \nfriends of PFC Lori Piestewa.\n  She was an American hero. We are deeply grateful to her for her \nservice and sacrifice--and to all Native Americans who are serving, and \nhave served, our Nation in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished minority \nleader for this very sensitive and very important statement about this \nwonderful person. As someone who belongs to a family which has lost my \nolder brother, and lost a brother-in-law--an older brother in the \nSecond World War, and brother-in-law in Vietnam--and then have another \nbrother-in-law who is suffering tremendously from his war wounds, who \nfought both in the Inchon Reservoir in Korea and also in Vietnam, I \nhave to say these are the greatest of all Americans. I really \nappreciate his sensitivity in delivering this message for the Senate \nhere today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4892-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4892-S4894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF PRISCILLA RICHMAN OWEN, OF TEXAS, TO BE UNITED STATES \n                  CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I hoped my friend in his statement tonight would indicate \nwhy we are moving to this woman, when we have people here--we have \nEdward Prado, who is from Texas, Dee Drell from Louisiana, Richard \nBennett from Maryland--who, it appears, will go through here very \neasily.\n  My friend should understand, as I told him privately, there will be \nsome people wanting to speak about this at some length.\n  The majority leader has indicated there will be no more votes today \nso there is no need for anyone to hang around on this tonight--that's \ntrue? You are going to speak, but there is\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\ngoing to be no action taken on this other than the motion?\n  Mr. HATCH. There will be no action on this tonight.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw any objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Priscilla Richman Owen, \nof Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, to answer my distinguished friend, the \nreason Priscilla Owen is being brought up today is because we are \ngradually trying to move the President's nominees as quickly as we can. \nShe was nominated on May 9, 2001, almost 2 years ago. I am trying to do \nit, as close as I can, in chronological order, which seems to me to be \nthe way to go, when I can.\n  I am not the only one who made this decision; a number of people did, \nincluding the majority leader, who desired to bring Priscilla Owen up \ntoday. I commend him because she really deserves to be brought up at \nthis particular time. She has been waiting for almost 2 years and went \nthrough what I consider to be a tremendously insensitive hearing when \nthe Democrats controlled the committee, and then came back for another \nhearing just a short while ago, where I think she more than \nsubstantiated the reasons why the President would have picked her to be \na nominee for the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  So I rise today to express my enthusiastic support for the \nconfirmation of Justice Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  The Senate's consideration of Justice Owen's nomination is important. \nIt is important because it represents an opportunity to remedy the \nmistreatment Justice Owen received last September when she was voted \ndown in the Judiciary Committee along party lines and not allowed a \nvote on the Senate floor, where she would have been confirmed by \nMembers of both parties. The decision by the committee last September \nwas unprecedented, representing the first time a nominee rated \nunanimously well qualified by the American Bar Association had been \nvoted down by the Judiciary Committee. This is despite the fact that \nJustice Owen had--as she does today--the full, unqualified support of \nher home State Senators, both of whom testified on her behalf.\n  It is important to note that with regard to circuit court of appeals \nnominees, it is important to have the support of both Senators, but it \nis not absolutely essential. In the case of district court judges, it \nhas been all but essential. The reason is that circuit court of appeals \nnominees represent not just one State but a whole series of States, as \nis the case in the Fifth Circuit.\n  It is important because this nomination will demonstrate whether the \nsenate will be fair to a qualified nominee and provide an up and down \nvote. This isn't just a qualified nominee; this is a well-qualified \nnominee, according to the American Bar Association.\n  It is perhaps most important because we have the opportunity to place \na great judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Three weeks ago we took the first step in remedying the wrongful \ntreatment inflicted on Justice Owen last fall by holding an open \nhearing in which I invited all Members to come and ask her questions. \nMembers were also free to submit any written questions following the \nclose of the hearing. The hearing was informative. It was productive. \nJustice Owen answered every question during the hearing and responded \nto lengthy written questions with substantive can cogent answers. As \nshe has done throughout this process, Justice Owen consistently \ndemonstrated her intelligence, her legal acumen, and her respect for \nthe law.\n  The hearing was valuable for several reasons. First, the hearing \nallowed us to obtain some much needed perspective and insights from \nSenator Cornyn, who, as we all know, served with Justice Owen on the \nTexas Supreme Court and observed her work as a judge day to day for 3 \nyears in hundreds of cases. He knows her. He knows what it is to be a \njudge and to be called upon to make hard decisions in close cases. He \nknows the workings of the Texas Supreme Court. He was most helpful in \nplacing into proper context what outsiders seem to think was extremely \nunusual or striking criticism from her court colleagues in a few \ncases--and darn few cases.\n  Senator Cornyn showed that this type of talk is common among court \nmembers and that such criticism is perfectly normal and even healthy \nfor a well-functioning judiciary. Judges disagree from time to time, \nand they may express themselves with fervor during such times. That is \nto be expected. Senator Cornyn personally attested to Justice Owen's \ndedication to her judicial duties. He has seen the work and the care \nshe puts into deciding each case. He also attested to her commitment to \nenforcing the will of the legislature. As Senator Cornyn said.\n\n       I know [Justice Owen] is a good judge who always tries to \n     faithfully read and apply the law. That is simply what good \n     judges do, and we can ask for nothing more.\n\n  In this regard, it strikes me once again as significant that the two \nindividuals conscripted as star witnesses to discredit Justice Owen as \nan activist judge--Judge Alberto Gonzales and Senator Cornyn--are \nactually two of her biggest supporters and attest to her fitness for \nthe bench and for this position on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nNothing can change that fact no matter how hard some try to pretend \notherwise.\n  Justice Owen is also firmly supported by former Texas Supreme Court \nChief Justice John L. Hill and former Justices Jack Hightower and Raul \nGonzalez, all of whom are Democrats and all of whom know Justice Owen's \nrecord. Justices Hightower and Gonzalez have the additional perspective \nof judges who personally served with Justice Owen. Fifteen past \npresidents of the Texas State Bar, Democrats and Republicans alike, \nhave enthusiastically endorsed her. Those who know Justice Owen and her \nrecord best know she will make an excellent Federal circuit court of \nappeals judge.\n  Second, the hearing allowed us to set the record straight: Justice \nOwen does not engaged in results-oriented jurisprudence nor does she \nsee such practices as desirable or legitimate in any manner. In \naddition, there is no credible evidence that Justice Owen harbors \nbiases against plaintiffs or defendants or favors one interest over \nanother. Some have charged that she consistently rules against certain \nplaintiffs and legal rights. Justice Owen has provided the committee \nwith a long list of decisions which refute that charge. One the issue \nof results-oriented decisionmaking, let me quote what she said to \nSenator Kennedy on this subject:\n\n       I do not try to achieve a result, and I don't look at \n     whether I want one side to win or the other side or one \n     segment of our population to be favored over another. That is \n     not my job.\n\n  Later she said, regarding her decisions:\n\n       Sometimes workers win, sometimes big companies win. The \n     outcome is determined by the law applied to the facts, not my \n     favoring one side or the other.\n\n  These are the words of a judge who understand her role and respects \nthe limits of her judicial authority. We don't need politicians and \nlegislators dedicated to achieving certain results, policies, or \noutcomes serving on the bench as judges who would do the same.\n  Incidentally, I find it particularly ironic that on the one hand, \nJustice Owen is faulted by some for engaging in results-oriented \ndecisionmaking, and, on the other hand, she is faulted for not engaging \nin what amounts to results-oriented decisionmaking. Thus she is \ncriticized for not reaching ``balance'' in her decisions, for voting \ntoo often or too infrequently--take your pick--in the majority or \ndissent--take your pick--in particular types of cases--take your pick--\nor for not sticking up for, showing sufficient ``sympathy'' for, or \ndisplaying enough ``dedication'' to, certain types of litigants.\n  Of course, we should shun jurists who are looking to achieve \n``balance'' in their decisions or do what may be popular or \ncontroversial in a case--apart from what an honest reading of the law \nand facts in that case would dictate. And it is serious error--indeed, \na misunderstanding of the role of our independent judiciary--to simply \ntranslate\n\n[[Page S4894]]\n\na judge's decision in a certain case as that judge's intent to achieve \na certain outcome or set some broad policy that will favor or prove \n``hostile'' to certain types of future litigants. A decision naturally \nwill prove ``detrimental'' to one of the parties--one side loses the \ncase--but we can hardly criticize the judge who is following the law as \npassed by the legislature. It is not a matter of looking to see whether \nsome partisan interest group has characterized a judge as ``deaf'' to \ncertain concerns or ``coldhearted'' to certain plaintiffs; it is a \nmatter of looking to see whether a judge can put aside personal \nfeelings and apply the law.\n  Sometimes, as Senator Cornyn helpfully pointed out during the hearing \n2 weeks ago, a judge may or may not like the posture of the case or the \nrecord developed in the lower court, but an appellate judge must take \nthe case as it is and make the best decision based upon the law and the \nfacts. That is a judge's job, that is what we expect judges to do, and \nthat is all we should expect judges to do. Justice Owens has lived up \nto that standard.\n  Third, the hearing set the record straight on Justice Owen's \ndecisions in judicial bypass cases. No matter how much some would \nprefer to argue the point, these cases were not about the right to an \nabortion. There was never any question about the girls' right to an \nabortion. Indeed, Justice Owen argued in the Doe 2 case that, based on \na 1990 Supreme Court decision striking down a Minnesota statute \nrequiring a minor girl to obtain consent from both parents, a statute \nrequiring a girl to notify both parents would also be questionable \nunder the Constitution. Clearly, Justice Owen recognizes a woman's \nright to obtain an abortion. These cases were about whether a minor \ngirl should be required to notify one parent before obtaining an \nabortion, in accordance with the Texas state legislation enactments. \nAnd Justice Owen has been well within the mainstream of her court in \nthe 14 decided cases, joining the majority judgment in 11 of those \ncases.\n\n  And we should never lose track of the fact that out of the close to \n800 bypass cases since the Texas statute was passed, a mere 12 girls \nhave appealed all the way to the Texas Supreme Court. These are usually \nthe toughest cases. By this time, two courts--the trial and the appeals \ncourts--have already considered the bypass petitions and turned them \ndown. Given the deference appellate courts must pay to the findings of \nthe trial court--the court which is in the very best position to listen \nto the girl, consider all relevant evidence, and hear the arguments--\nthe decision is likely to affirm the lower court rulings denying a \nbypass. That should be no great surprise. Certainly Justice Owen and \nher colleagues on the Texas Supreme Court disagreed in some cases, but \nin all cases there was a genuine effort to apply applicable precedent.\n  These parental consent cases show that Justice Owen takes Supreme \nCourt precedent seriously: she looks to precedent for guidance, she \ncites it, and she makes a good-faith effort to apply it to the case at \nhand. She understands the rules of appellate review and takes pains to \nfollow them. She is a judge who defers to the legislature's considered \njudgment in its policy choices and earnestly seeks to ascertain \nlegislative intent in her rulings. None of her opinions, to quote the \nWashington Post, ``seem[] to us [to be] beyond the range of reasonable \njudicial disagreement.''\n  I have been on the Judiciary Committee a long time--27 years now--and \nI have seen many, many nominees come through the committee. Justice \nOwen takes a backseat to no one. She has shown herself to be a \nbrilliant, fair, and restrained jurist who will be a strong credit to \nthe Federal courts. Simply put, Justice Owen deserves to be on the \nbench. I urge my colleagues to do what is right and join me in \nsupporting her confirmation to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Mr. President, the supplemental appropriations bill \npassed by the Senate last week includes $3 million for the Government \nof Egypt and up to $2 billion in future loan guarantees. While Egypt \nremains an important ally of the United States and a partner in our on-\ngoing war against terrorism, I continue to be extremely concerned about \nthat country's lack of political, legal, and democratic reforms.\n  We provide substantial assistance to Egypt on an annual basis. We did \nso in this supplemental. While loan guarantees and other forms of \neconomic aid may be beneficial to Egypt, we are doing far too little to \npromote political reforms that would benefit the Egyptian people. It is \nno secret that I have long felt that the Department of State and the \nU.S. Agency for International Development need to do a better job in \nimplementing democracy programs in Egypt that are both substantive and \neffective. This will require State and USAID to be aggressive in \nengaging the Egyptians on this issue on an ongoing and consistent \nbasis. To date, this has yet to happen.\n  Waiting for the Egyptians to engage us on democracy programs is \nsimply not an option.\n  Some may point to the recent release from jail of sociologist Dr. \nSaad Eddin Ibrahim, an Egyptian-American who was subjected to a \npolitical show trial, as evidence of political and legal reform in \nEgypt. It is not. Dr. Ibrahim should never have been arrested, should \nnever have been tried, and should never have been jailed. Dr. Ibrahim's \nonly `crime' was to criticize the Egyptian government and to call for \ngreater freedoms.\n  I continue to hope that the Secretary of State Colin Powell will \nclearly, publicly, and forcefully register the concerns of the United \nStates regarding Egypt's commitment to human rights and democracy. It \nis not unreasonable for the United States to expect its allies to live \nup to basic standards of human rights and political freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4894-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BUNNING.

He served his country with \ndignity, honor, courage and integrity.\n  America extends her sincerest sympathy to the family and friends of \nPFC Howard Johnson II upon his death in combat in the service of his \ncountry. It is a great form of love to give oneself courageously in \nunity with others to make our country safer and to create a better life \nfor those long oppressed.\n  After completing the LeFlore High School ROTC, Private Johnson joined \nthe Army and served in a critical role in the 507th Maintenance \nCompany. The unit was ordered to Iraq and was attempting to provide \nservice and support to forces moving north, where they were attacked \nand he was killed. He has left behind loving parents, whose lives have \nbeen given to the service of the Lord.\n  Private Johnson is survived by his father, Rev. Howard Johnson, his \nmother, Gloria Johnson, and two sisters,\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\nZsaquez Johnson and Geiselle LaVonne Johnson Edwards. His father \nReverend Johnson, pastor of Truevine Missionary Baptist Church, is a \ndistinguished pastor and community leader in the Mobile area, with whom \nI have worked on projects to make Mobile a better place for all.

Two dump trucks \ntraveled under guard to deliver the weapons, which apparently included \nAK 47s, sawed off shotguns, Uzis and machine guns, from police \nheadquarters to the steel plant. At the plant, steelworkers melted the \nfirearms by pouring 2,600 degree molten steel over them.\n  Detroit Police Chief Jerry Oliver said that taking these guns out of \ncirculation will save lives. That is good news. Last year alone, 26 \nchildren lost their lives in incidents of gun violence in Detroit. The \nDetroit Police Department has been working hard to reduce gun violence \nin the city. And every gun that's taken off the street helps make this \njob a little bit easier.\n  The fight to reduce gun violence must be waged on many fronts. We \nneed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, prevent children from \ngaining access to firearms, and give law enforcement the resources they \nneed to thoroughly investigate gun-related crimes. At the same time, we \nhave to vigorously prosecute criminals who commit gun-related crimes.\n  We in the Senate should take up and pass common sense gun safety \nlegislation. And we need to provide adequate resources to police \ndepartments. Unfortunately, we are fighting an uphill battle. Common \nsense gun safety legislation is blocked by the National Rifle \nAssociation and its allies. The President's budget proposes massive \ncuts to COPs and other critical law enforcement programs. And Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft, while indicating the Bush Administration's support \nfor the current ban on assault weapons, recently refused to support \nreauthorization of the ban.\n  Melting those guns in Dearborn last week was a welcome event for all \nof us who care about reducing gun violence. But it would surely have \nbeen better if those guns had never made it onto the street in the \nfirst place. Absent adequate funding for police departments and the \npassage of common sense legislation to keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals, I fear that truckloads of guns will remain on our streets, \nin the hands of criminals, threatening our communities. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in working to restore funding for COPs, close the \ngun show loophole, and reauthorize the assault weapons ban this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4895-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4895-S4896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           TRIBUTE TO THE MT. CARMEL REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mt. \nCarmel Regional Medical Center in Pittsburg, KS for its 100 years of \nproviding healthcare services to the people of Crawford County and the \nsurrounding region.\n  From a handful of Sisters of St. Joseph of Wichita and only a few \ndoctors a century ago to more than 800 employees, 200 volunteers and 50 \nphysicians, Mt. Carmel Regional Medical Center has remained true to its \nfounder's directive to ``Do all the good you can, to all the people you \ncan, in all the ways that you can, and just as long as you can.''\n  On a rainy April morning in 1903, Mother Bernard Sheridan and five \nSisters answered a call to serve in a region where countless immigrant \nminers and their families had flocked to work in the coalfields, a \nplace where injury and illness were rampant. One of the Sisters \ndescribed the deplorable conditions: ``When the miner's wife or \nchildren fell ill as a result of these unsanitary conditions, or when \nthe miner himself was carried out of the pit broken and bloody or \novercome by gas or powder fumes, there was no sickroom but the hot, \ncrowded, dust-covered, fly-infested shack.'' With faith and little more \nthan $5 in her pocket, Mother Bernard opened a hospital to serve those \nas they would ``that God should deal with themselves and their loved \nones.'' The hospital was the first of many healthcare ministries the \nSisters would later sponsor throughout Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado and \nCalifornia.\n  The little hospital could accommodate 20 patients at the time of its \nopening, and there was no paid staff. The six women worked 7 days a \nweek attending to the nursing, cooking, laundry, cleaning and minding \nof the furnace. Eighteen-hour workdays were common, and when time \nallowed, the sisters slept in the attic. To aid in the hospital's \nsurvival, the Sisters worked out an agreement with the Santa Fe \nOperating Companies to care for the firm's employees for $80 and 15 \ntons of coal a month, an early example of managed care. The Sisters \nalso created Kansas' first prepaid hospital insurance plan. For 25 \ncents a month, miners and their families were assured hospital care for \nas long as it was needed. Moreover, addressing their own nursing \nshortage, in 1904, the Sisters opened a school of nursing which \ncontinued into the 1970s when it was transformed into the present day \nuniversity nursing education program.\n  Mr. President, 100 years later, Mt. Carmel Regional Medical Center is \na state-of-the-art facility serving nine counties of southeast Kansas, \nand it continues to be a leader in meeting community need with \ncreativity and innovation. Mt. Carmel has overcome the early-day \nadversities of Kansas blizzards and oven-hot winds, numerous epidemics, \nwar, drought, floods, mine strikes and shutdowns; to present day \ndifficulties of escalating operating costs, third party payer cutbacks \nand work force shortages. So well did the hospital adapt, that it was \nrecognized by the American Hospital Association in 1991 as one of the \nthree best hospitals in the Nation to respond to the changes in health \ncare.\n  Mt. Carmel continues to meet the needs of those it serves, \nidentifying health care issues and addressing them with the same \ningenuity and collaboration its founder relied upon in the beginning. \nIt holds fast to its mission of providing healthcare to all, regardless \nof ability to pay. Mt. Carmel has addressed the region's need for \ncomprehensive cancer care with the creation of a certified community \ncancer center; and it is now aggressively fighting heart disease \nthrough the opening of a regional heart center. It has collaborated \nwith others to create high quality, affordable childcare for working \nfamilies and has provided accessible healthcare services through the \ncreation of a community health clinic, recently transformed into a \nfederally qualified health center. It has developed one of the few free \ndental clinics in the State, and a prescription drug assistance program \nto aid those who cannot afford them. Mt. Carmel has developed a \ncongregational health ministry that actively involves and encourages \narea churches not only to take care of their own, but to put their \nfaith in action for the betterment of their community.\n  On the occasion of its centennial, Mt. Carmel Regional Medical Center \nlooks to the future as it completes the most significant expansion and \nrenovation in its history. A $16.5 million Outpatient Services project \ndoubled the facility's ground floor square footage and included the \nopening of the heart center, and the installation of one of the most \npowerful MRI units in the region. Also\n\n[[Page S4896]]\n\ncompleted were a new emergency department, expanded diagnostic imaging \nand surgery center, new occupational health and pre-op testing \ndepartments, expanded laboratory, pharmacy, medical records, patient \nregistration, and financial services.\n  So much has changed since Mother Bernard Sheridan embarked on her \nfirst healing ministry 100 years ago. Mt. Carmel has grown, adapted, \nand positioned itself as a healthcare leader and visionary, while never \nforgetting its mission to do all the good it can. I welcome this \nopportunity to pay tribute to all that has and will be done by Mt. \nCarmel Regional Medical Center as its looks forward to yet another \ncentury of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4896-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ROSSI KATHERINE CLARK\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nRossi Katherine Clark. The Kentucky Association for Gifted Education, \nKAGE, and the National Association for Gifted Children, NAGC, named \nRossi the 2002-2003 NAGC Nicholas Green Distinguished Student in \nKentucky.\n  A fourth grader from Floyd County, Rossi was chosen among many \nnominees considered by the Kentucky Association for Gifted Education. \nRossi's love for the traditional music of East Kentucky, while actively \npursuing new music, earned her the appreciation of some of Kentucky's \nbetter known fiddlers. Rossi has shared her love of the fiddle with \nfellow classmates and members of her community.\n  The NAGC Nicholas Green Distinguished Student Awards are named after \na young gifted student named Nicholas Green who was killed at a young \nage. His parents, Reg and Maggie, donated his college savings to the \nNational Association for Gifted Children.\n  Nominated by Linda Bartrum, Curriculum Resource Teacher, Floyd County \nSchools, Rossi has shown a commitment to excellence deserving of such a \ndistinguished honor. Rossi's example demonstrates what you can achieve \nif you work hard and pursue your goals. I am convinced that Rossi will \nsucceed as an outstanding musician and I am proud of her \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4896-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO KENNETH RAY McCARTHA\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to pay \ntribute to Kenneth Ray McCartha, who was an outstanding citizen of \nAlabama.\n  Mr. McCartha was a native of Crenshaw County, AL. He graduated from \nGreenville High School in 1956 and Troy State University in 1960. His \nexceptional banking career began in 1960 when he served with the \nGreenville Bank in Greenville, AL, leaving in 1963 to work as an \nExaminer with the Alabama State Banking Department. He graduated from \nthe Graduate School of Banking of the South at Louisiana State \nUniversity in 1968. He was promoted to Senior Bank Examiner in 1973 and \nappointed Deputy Superintendent of Banks in Alabama in 1974. He was \nappointed Acting Superintendent by Governor George C. Wallace in 1978 \nand reappointed by Governor Fob James in 1979. He was reappointed \nSuperintendent of Banks by Governor Wallace in 1983 and held that \nposition until 1985, resigning to resume the position as Deputy \nSuperintendent under the State merit system. He served as \nSuperintendent once again beginning in 1993, a position he held until \nhis retirement on December 31, 1996. While serving in this position he \nalso served as a member of the Alabama Securities Commission, the \nAlabama Agriculture Finance Authority, the Alabama higher Education \nLoan Corporation, and the Alabama Housing Finance Authority.\n  Following his retirement, he was an active participant in the \naccreditation process for banks with the Conference of State Bank \nSupervisors. CSBS is a national association of State officials \nresponsible for chartering, supervising and regulating the Nation's \nState-chartered banks.\n  Mr. McCartha set a high standard of effectiveness, ethics and \nleadership and had a unique ability to build coalitions and find \nsolutions to the many tough situations facing banks today.\n  I commend his life and his service to banking in the State of \nAlabama, and\nI am honored to come to the floor\ntoday to recognize his many accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4896-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MUSSELMAN HIGH SCHOOL PARTICIPATES IN WE THE PEOPLE NATIONAL FINALS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on April 26, 2003, more than \n1,200 students from across the United States will visit Washington, \nD.C. to compete in the national finals of the We the People: The \nCitizen and the Constitution program, a well-known educational program \ndeveloped specifically to educate young people about the Constitution \nand the Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, \nthe We the People program is funded by Congress through the U.S. \nDepartment of Education.\n  I am proud to announce that the class from Musselman High School will \nrepresent the State of West Virginia in this national event. These \nyoung scholars from Inwood, WV, have worked conscientiously to reach \nthe national finals by participating in both local and statewide \ncompetitions. As a result of their hard work, they have gained a deep \nknowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of \nour constitutional democracy.\n  The 3 day We the People national competition is modeled on hearings \nin the United States Congress. The hearings consist of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges on \nconstitutional topics. The students are given an opportunity to \ndemonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend \npositions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. Their \ntestimony is followed by a period of questioning by the judges who \nprobe the students' depth of understanding and ability to apply their \nconstitutional knowledge.\n  The We the People program provides curriculum and materials at upper \nelementary, middle, and high school levels. The curriculum not only \nenhances students' understanding of the institutions of American \nconstitutional democracy, it also helps them identify the contemporary \nrelevance of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Critical thinking \nexercises, problem-solving activities, and cooperative learning \ntechniques help develop the kind of participatory skills necessary for \nstudents to become active, responsible citizens.\n  Independent studies by the Educational Testing Service, ETS, revealed \nthat students enrolled in the We the People program at upper \nelementary, middle, and high school levels ``significantly outperformed \ncomparison students on every topic of the tests taken.'' Another study \nby Richard Brody at Stanford University discovered that students \ninvolved in the We the People program develop greater commitment to \ndemocratic principles and values than do students using traditional \ntextbooks and approaches. Researchers at the Council for Basic \nEducation noted:\n\n       [T]eachers feel excited and renewed . . . . Students are \n     enthusiastic about what they have been able to accomplish, \n     especially in terms of their ability to carry out a reasoned \n     argument. They have become energized about their place as \n     citizens of the United States.\n\n  The class from Musselman High School is eager to participate in the \nnational competition in Washington, D.C. It is inspiring to see these \nyoung people advocate the fundamental ideals and principles of our \ngovernment, ideas that identify us as a people and bind us together as \na nation. It is important for future generations to understand these \nvalues and principles which we hold as standards in our endeavor to \npreserve and realize the promise of our constitutional democracy. I \nbelieve these young West Virginians have already won a great deal \nthrough the knowledge they have gained, but I also wish them every \nsuccess in the We the People competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4896-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4896-S4897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of the Little Sisters of the Poor in caring for the elderly \nin Delaware. Since their opening in 1903, the Little Sisters have \ntouched the lives of thousands of people. Sharing their homes\n\n[[Page S4897]]\n\nand hearts, they have cared for the elderly in the spirit of humble \nservice.\n  The Congregation of the Little Sisters of the Poor has aided and \ngiven comfort to the impoverished elderly worldwide for over 163 years. \nThis organization, which has spread its loving arms to over 30 \ncountries worldwide, was founded by a group of caring women who were \nled by Jeanne Jugan. After taking in an elderly blind woman in 1839, \nJeanne and two other women purchased a home where the poor could take \nshelter. Over the years, Jeanne took the place of the elderly women on \nthe streets and began a campaign of soliciting in order to raise funds. \nBy 1879, her ranks had grown to include 2,400 Little Sisters, and her \nbeliefs and thoughtful nature had spread throughout Europe. Although \nJeanne Jugan passed away later that year, she succeeded in inspiring \nand improving the lives of thousands of needy people.\n  Over the 163 years that the congregation has existed, the \nCongregation of the Little Sisters of the Poor has opened 242 homes \nthat presently serve 22,000 residents. Their tireless efforts to bring \ncomfort to those who need a shoulder to lean on shows that the Little \nSisters not only represents the values of America but also the \nunremitting concern for one's neighbor.\n  The Little Sisters have faithfully served the people of Delaware for \nthe last century. Opening St. Joseph's Home for the Aged on Fourth and \nBancroft in Wilmington in 1903, the Little Sisters became a beloved and \nwell-known part of the community. In 1978, the Jeanne Jugan residence \nopened in Newark, where the Little Sisters continue their work to this \nday, providing the highest possible level of care for their residents. \nThe non-denominational home cares for low-income individuals of all \nracial and ethnic backgrounds.\n  The Little Sisters have provided care for over 4,700 people during \ntheir time in Delaware. Blessed by the generosity of the community in \nwhich they serve, the Sisters continue to work towards their mission of \nhumble service to the elderly among us.\n  I rise today to commemorate all the work that has been done by the \nLittle Sisters of the Poor in aiding the elderly. What began in 1839 as \nan effort to gather funds for a poor blind woman in France has become \nan international community of compassionate individuals who have chosen \nto give their lives in the attempt to improve the well being of the \nelderly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4897-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated in \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4897-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United State submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/07/senate-section/article/S4897-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:00 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrent of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1559.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to improve the \nsystem for enhancing automobile fuel efficiency, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 795. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional tax incentives for enhancing motor vehicle fuel efficiency, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a package of \nlegislation--two bills--designed to put us back on track for improved \nfuel efficiency among automobiles.\n  I support a balanced, forward-looking energy policy, which should \ninclude a strong provision to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. In \n2002, the Senate spent several weeks debating energy policy, including \nfuel efficiency. Unfortunately, a strong bill on this topic was not \nenacted into law last year.\n  Both chambers of Congress are currently crafting a national energy \npolicy. As the challenging times we currently face demonstrates, we \ncannot delay in addressing our national energy policy, including oil \nconsumption.\n  Throughout the debate on energy policy, I have emphasized that the \nbest way to lessen our Nation's dependence on foreign oil is to improve \nthe fuel efficiency of our automobiles. Transportation as a sector is \nthe largest user of petroleum. If we are truly committed to crafting a \nforward-thinking energy policy, automobile fuel efficiency is the place \nto start.\n  In 1975 the United States Congress had a vision: to double the fuel \nefficiency of our Nation's passenger vehicles in ten years. By 1985 the \nautomotive industry achieved the goal that Congress set. As of 2001, \nthanks to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, law, oil \nconsumption was about 2.8 million barrels per day lower than it \notherwise would be.\n  Unfortunately, progress is now at a stand-still, and in fact, the \naverage fuel economy in the United States has slipped since 1985. Since \npeaking at 22.1 mpg in 1987 and 1998, average fuel economy declined \nnearly eight percent to 20.4 in 2001, lower than it had been at any \ntime since 1980. Average fuel economy for automobiles 8,500 pounds and \nfewer continues to decline. One major factor in this regression is the \nfact that passenger standards have not increased since 1985. While the \nBush Administration has recently increased non-passenger standards by a \nmodest 1.5 mpg, this is not enough to compensate for the progress we \nhave failed to achieve for more than a decade.\n  Another reason why we are losing ground in terms of fuel efficiency \nis the exploitation of the ``non-passenger vehicle'' category. \nOriginally intended to cover trucks used for business-oriented \npurposes, such as farming and construction, this category soon was \nseriously abused, so that it now includes minivans, sport utility \nvehicles, SUVs, and cross-over utility vehicles, CUVs.\n  In addition, out-dated provisions of our tax code have encouraged \nincreased manufacturing and purchasing of non-passenger vehicles. For \nexample, the Federal gas guzzler excise tax, enacted in 1978, exempted \nnon-passenger vehicles. At the time, few non-passenger vehicles \nexisted, aside from heavy duty trucks and vans. But today, sales of \nSUVs, minivans, and CUVs make up over 30 percent of new vehicle \npurchases. As these sales have grown, these vehicles have enjoyed \nincreasing subsidies by the Federal Government. In 1999, the SUV \nloophole in the gas guzzler tax cost the government $5.6 billion in \nuncollected taxes.\n  For those in America who want to make a difference in terms of energy \npolicy: take a look at the parking lots across America. Take a look at \nthe inefficient vehicles we are driving on the road today, because this \nCongress and country have not shown the leadership to spur development \nof more efficient cars and trucks in America.\n  We can improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles. We have done it in \nthe past, and we can do it again. A panel at the National Academy of \nSciences, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and other reputable \norganizations have documented the myriad technologies available today, \nand emerging technologies, that will reduce or eliminate the need for \noil in our vehicles.\n  Today we squarely face the question and challenge of energy security. \nI believe American families are ready to do their part for their \ncountry by purchasing more fuel-efficient vehicles. And I believe the \nauto manufacturers, scientists and engineers of this country are ready \nto step up to the plate and produce more fuel-efficient vehicles. By \nsupporting improved fuel economy, we can lead and demonstrate to future \ngenerations that we are prepared to make a sacrifice for our national \nsecurity, environment, and public health.\n  Many have already voiced their support for decreasing our dependence \non oil. I am submitting for the record several editorials, which are \njust a sample of the many public calls for enacting an energy policy \nthat includes a way to conserve oil. I also am submitting letters from \nnational organizations calling for more fuel efficient vehicles. I ask \nthat these documents be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  Today I am introducing two bills to get us back on the track of \nprogress, to increase fuel efficiency for both passenger and non-\npassenger vehicles.\n  The Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act will increase the \nfuel economy standard for both types of vehicles. It will increase the \nCAFE standard of passenger automobiles to 40 miles a gallon by 2015, a \n60 percent increase above the current average of 25 miles a gallon, \nwith the first increase required in model year 2006. The bill also will \nincrease the fuel economy of non-passenger automobiles to 27.5 miles a \ngallon by 2015, a 60 percent increase above the current average of 17.5 \nmiles a gallon, with the first increase required in model year 2006. \nThrough the CAFE standards required this bill, we will save a \ncumulative 123 billion gallons of gasoline, and over 250 million metric \ntons of carbon dioxide emissions, by 2015.\n  This bill also will close the loopholes in the non-passenger vehicle \ndefinition. It will update the weight cut-off for\n\n[[Page S4900]]\n\npassenger and non-passenger automobiles, to reflect changing trends in \nvehicle weight. Many vehicles, such as the new SUV called the Hummer, \nweigh more than 8,500 pounds, the current weight cut-off for regulation \nunder CAFE. This bill will regulate vehicles up to 12,000 pounds, in \norder to prevent large passenger vehicles from circumventing the \nsystem. In addition, SUVs, minivans, and CUVs would be considered \npassenger vehicles under this bill.\n  Another provision of this bill would establish a Federal procurement \nrequirement for the purchase of vehicles that exceed CAFE standards. \nThe bill also requires a study to improve the accuracy of the EPA test \nfor fuel economy, and would implement necessary changes to the test, so \nthat we can better account for improvements in fuel efficiency based on \nhow vehicles are truly performing on the roads. Finally, this bill \nwould update the civil penalties for violating CAFE laws, to adjust the \namounts for inflation.\n  The second bill I am introducing today, the Tax Incentives for Fuel \nEfficient Vehicles Act, would modify the tax code. First, this bill \nwould create a new tax credit for purchasers of passenger and non-\npassenger vehicles that exceed CAFE standards by at least 5 miles a \ngallon. Second, this bill would modify the gas guzzler tax, effective \nat the beginning of Model Year 2006, so that SUVs and other passenger \nvehicles currently escaping the tax through an existing loophole would \nbe included. Heavy-duty trucks and vans would continue to be excluded.\n  Modifying the gas guzzler tax to include SUVs, minivans, and CUVs \nwill help us advance the policy goal of discouraging vehicles that are \nespecially inefficient in terms of energy consumption, while at the \nsame time raising revenues that can be used to provide an incentive for \nvehicles that are especially fuel-efficient. This approach will help \nspawn investment in automobiles that are better for our environment, \nenergy security and consumers.\n  I would ask my colleagues to note that it is my intention that the \nTax Incentives for Fuel Efficient Vehicles Act will have virtually no \ncost to the Federal Government. If the revenues raised by the expansion \nof the gas guzzler tax do not adequately compensate for the cost of the \ncredit, I will adjust the size of the credit accordingly.\n  I am proud to have the support of Senators Nelson, FL, Jeffords, \nCorzine, Reed and Kennedy in introducing the Automobile Fuel Efficiency \nImprovements Act. Also I am pleased that the following organizations \nare supporting the Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act: Sierra \nClub, Union of Concerned Scientists, Natural Resources Defense Council, \nU.S. PIRG, National Environmental Trust, Friends of the Earth, Public \nCitizen, The Wilderness Society, Citizen Action Illinois, Coalition on \nthe Environment and Jewish Life, National Council of Churches, \nHadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, American Jewish \nCommittee, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, Union of American Hebrew \nCongregations, Central Conference of American Rabbis, MoveOn, and \nChesapeake Climate Action Network.\n  For the benefit of our children and future generations, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n\n                                                  Sierra Club,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2003.\n       Dear Congress Member: Protecting our environment and the \n     health and safety of our families are values that are clearly \n     and consistently supported by the majority of Americans. As \n     the nation's oldest and largest grassroots environmental \n     organization, the Sierra Club looks forward to working with \n     you and your staff to keep America's promise to leave a \n     cleaner planet to future generations.\n       The challenge facing the 108th Congress is not merely to \n     maintain existing protections, but to take common-sense steps \n     to protect our communities from environmental hazards and to \n     safeguard our natural heritage. Poll after poll confirms that \n     Americans--regardless of demographics or political \n     persuasion--care about protecting our special places, \n     restoring our forests, promoting smart growth, and improving \n     the safety or our clean air and water.\n       However, public support alone is not enough. It is for this \n     reason that the Sierra Club works with our more than 750,000 \n     members nationwide to educate their neighbors about \n     environmental threats and opportunities, mobilize their \n     communities to demand environmental protection, and to hold \n     public officials accountable for their actions.\n       Sierra Club members are looking to their elected \n     representatives to continue progress on protecting our \n     communities, improving the quality of our air and water, and \n     ensuring a natural heritage of wilderness, parks and open \n     spaces for future generations. As the 108th Congress begins, \n     I would like to inform you about the particular issues on \n     which the Sierra Club's members will be seeking your support:\n       Oppose efforts to weaken the framework of existing laws \n     that safeguard public health and the environment and improve \n     the quality of our air and water, and protect our communities \n     from toxic pollution;\n       Support measures that safeguard America's wildlife and \n     unique natural heritage from Alaska's Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge to the wildlands of Utah and California;\n       Provide adequate funding for the enforcement of \n     environmental protection programs;\n       In reauthorizing TEA-21, give priority to maintaining \n     existing roads and bridges over new construction, and defend \n     the National Environmental Policy Act and Clean Air \n     Conformity laws from attack;\n       Push for policies that reduce global warming pollution, \n     reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and increase our energy \n     security by increasing our fuel economy, energy efficiency \n     and reliance on clean renewable sources of energy;\n       Protect the health and integrity of National Forests along \n     with the public's right to participate in the management of \n     our public lands;\n       Fully fund international and domestic family planning \n     programs that are critically important to stabilizing \n     population;\n       Ensure tough environmental standards in future US trade \n     agreements, and the personal safety and civil liberties of \n     those on the front lines of environmental protection around \n     the world.\n       Many of your constituents are also our members, which is \n     why we would like to work together in Washington and in your \n     district to protect the land we all love. Attached is a \n     contact sheet of our issue experts in several policy areas. \n     If you have any questions about upcoming legislation, would \n     like to find out more about Sierra Club positions, or would \n     like to get in touch with our members in your district, \n     please do not hesitate to contact us.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you and your \n     staff to protect America's environment, for our families, for \n     our future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Debbie Sease,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Natural Resources Defense Council,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2003.\n     [Re Boxer/Chafee amendment to the Senate budget resolution.\n\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the over 550,000 members \n     of Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), I thank you for \n     supporting the Boxer/Chafee amendment to the Senate budget \n     resolution preventing oil and gas development in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge.\n       You have voted to insure the continued protection of the \n     Arctic Refuge's ``biological heart,'' critical to nearly 200 \n     species of wildlife. This area known as America's Serengeti \n     serves as a denning area for polar bears in the winter, a \n     nesting and/or feeding area for millions of migratory birds, \n     and the calving grounds for the 130,000 member Porcupine \n     caribou herd which returns every summer to calf and feed. \n     This herd has supported the Gwich'in Indian's way of life for \n     thousands of generations. The American public overwhelmingly \n     agrees with you that the coastal plain--one of our nation's \n     most spectacular wilderness areas--is too precious to \n     destroy.\n       Drilling in the Arctic Refuge makes no sense. It won't \n     lower gasoline prices and, it won't give us energy \n     independence or security. The best estimate is that there is \n     less than a six-month supply equivalency of oil that can be \n     economically produced from the Refuge--a mere drop in the \n     bucket--and, we won't get it for ten years.\n       Improving fuel efficiency of our automobiles is the \n     cheapest, fastest and cleanest energy solution. Efficiency \n     savings can be tapped immediately and would cost less than \n     half as much as producing oil from the Arctic Refuge. \n     Improving the fuel efficiency of America's automobile fleet \n     by just one percent per year would save more than 10 times as \n     much oil as is likely to be available in the Arctic Refuge. \n     Advanced hybrid electric vehicles announced by Ford and \n     already being produced by Honda and Toyota achieve about a \n     50% improvement in fuel economy. In contrast to drilling in \n     the Arctic Refuge, increasing fuel efficiency will help slow \n     down global warming.\n       We thank you for your leadership to save this irreplaceable \n     natural treasure. We salute your dedication to the protection \n     of this great crown jewel.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    John H. Adams,\n     President, Natural Resources Defense Council.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 23, 2003]\n\n                      The Missing Energy Strategy\n\n       The Senate struck a blow for the environment and for common \n     sense last week, defeating President Bush's second attempt in \n     less than a year to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n     to oil exploration. Credit goes to the Democrats, who mainly \n     held firm\n\n[[Page S4901]]\n\n     in a close 52-to-48 vote, and to a small, sturdy group of \n     moderate Republicans, which now includes Norm Coleman, a \n     Minnesota freshman who wisely chose not to renege on his \n     campaign promise to protect the refuge despite an aggressive \n     sales pitch from senior Republicans and the White House.\n       The pitch included the usual hyperbole from the Alaska \n     delegation, which typically inflates official estimates of \n     economically recoverable oil in the refuge by a factor of \n     four. It also included a new but equally spurious argument \n     minted for the occasion, namely that rising gas prices and \n     the war in Iraq made drilling more urgent than ever. In \n     truth, Arctic oil will have no influence on gas prices until \n     it actually comes out of the ground, and even then it is \n     likely to reduce American dependence on foreign oil by only a \n     few percentage points.\n       Nevertheless it is much too soon for the environmental \n     community or its Senate champions, like Joseph Lieberman, \n     John McCain and James Jeffords, to rest on their well-earned \n     laurels. Drilling proposals will almost certainly resurface, \n     most likely in energy bills now on the drawing boards in both \n     the House and Senate. Beyond that, neither the White House \n     nor the Republican leadership shows any appetite for \n     developing what America really needs: innovative policies \n     that point toward a cleaner, more efficient and less oil-\n     dependent energy future. Instead, the White House and its \n     Congressional allies continue to push a retrograde strategy--\n     of which Arctic drilling was just one component--that \n     faithfully caters to President Bush's friends in the oil, gas \n     and coal industries and remains heavily biased toward the \n     production of fossil fuels.\n       On this score, the energy bills now being drawn up on \n     Capitol Hill offer no more hope than the 2002 models. Last \n     year's energy plan, which mercifully expired in a conference \n     committee, was top-heavy with subsidies for industry and \n     light on incentives for energy efficiency, alternative fuels \n     and other forms of conservation. The news from the relevant \n     Congressional committees suggests more of the same. Just last \n     week, Edward Markey of Massachusetts offered his colleagues \n     on the House energy committee a proposal to increase fuel \n     economy standards for cars and light trucks, including \n     S.U.V.'s, by about 20 percent by 2010. This is not an \n     unreasonable goal, given Detroit's technological \n     capabilities, and would save 1.6 million barrels a day, more \n     than double the recent imports from Iraq and far more than \n     the Arctic refuge could produce in the same time frame. The \n     committee crushed the idea.\n       The last two years have given the country plenty of reasons \n     to re-examine its energy policies: a power crisis in \n     California, the attacks of 9/11 and now a war in the very \n     heart of the biggest oil patch in the world. It is plainly \n     time to move forward in a systematic way with new ideas. But \n     the best we can do, it appears, is to beat back bad ones.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Nov. 8, 2002]\n\n                            More Per Gallon\n\n       Standards: Congress must approve higher vehicle mileage \n     requirements in order to reverse a troubling trend.\n       Body: Each year the Environmental Protection Agency trots \n     out mileage ratings for new car models. And year after year, \n     the news is depressing.\n       On Oct. 29, the EPA reported that the average fuel economy \n     for all 2003-model cars and passenger trucks is a paltry 20.8 \n     miles per gallon.\n       That's down slightly from last year. But more notably, it's \n     6 percent below the peak for passenger vehicle efficiency of \n     22.1 mpg set 15 years ago.\n       In the past decade and a half, automakers have made \n     technological improvements that have increased engine \n     efficiency significantly. But those gains have been offset by \n     millions of Americans buying ever-larger gas guzzlers.\n       Much of the blame lies in Washington, where the Bush \n     administration and Congress haven't been able to come to a \n     consensus on energy policy and apparently lack the will to \n     mandate even a modest increase in the Corporate Average Fuel \n     Economy (CAFE) standards for vehicles.\n       Those standards--which haven't been changed for 17 years--\n     require that each automaker's fleet of new cars averages 27.5 \n     mpg. Light trucks (which include pickups, minivans and sport \n     utility vehicles) must average only 20.7 mpg.\n       The solution is simple: Congress should raise the CAFE \n     standards significantly, particularly for light trucks. But \n     the new standards should be reasonable ones that automakers \n     can meet.\n       Continued improvement in engine technology is one key to \n     meeting higher standards.\n       Some mileage gains also can be achieved even if automakers \n     make no further technological improvements and Congress \n     continues to sit on its hands.\n       Higher mileage standards would cut fuel consumption, which \n     in turn would reduce air pollution, decrease America's \n     dependence on foreign oil, save motorists money at the pump \n     and increase the chances that metropolitan areas such as \n     North Texas will be able to attain federal air quality \n     standards.\n       Those are compelling reasons for Congress and the White \n     House to adopt standards that will, for a change, result in \n     higher annual mileage ratings instead of continued declines.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the St. Petersburg Times, Nov. 16, 2002]\n\n                     More Fuel-Efficiency Is Needed\n\n       Americans are getting a confusing message on automobile \n     mileage. ``By driving a more fuel-efficient vehicle, a \n     vehicle powered by alternative fuels, or even by driving our \n     current vehicles more efficiently, we can all do our part to \n     reduce our Nation's reliance on imported oil and strengthen \n     our energy security,'' Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham \n     recently announced.\n       Good advice. But Abraham chose an odd occasion to make his \n     appeal. He and Environmental Protection Agency chief Christie \n     Whitman were announcing the mileage figures for 2003 cars and \n     passenger trucks. The average of 20.8 MPG continued a \n     downward trend on fuel efficiency that has continued for the \n     past decade and a half.\n       In fact, the percentage of cars getting more than 30 MPG \n     declined in the new model year to only 4 percent of cars, \n     down from 6 percent last year. So it is even more difficult \n     for American drivers to heed Abraham's call to conserve.\n       If President Bush, who is Abraham's boss, or Congress \n     really wanted to lessen our dependence on foreign oil, they \n     would have embraced tougher mileage requirements. Yet, Vice \n     President Dick Cheney set the tone for the administration by \n     scorning energy conservation. Congress also backed away from \n     more stringent Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, \n     which have been frozen since 1994. Even pro-environment \n     Democrats played along with the makers of gas-guzzling SUVs \n     when the United Auto Workers union opposed improved fuel \n     efficiency, arguing it would cost jobs (and union members).\n       Improving mileage isn't that difficult. ``We could be \n     averaging close to 30 to 40 miles per gallon, and that's with \n     conventional technology: nonhybrids, better engines, better \n     transmission, improved aerodynamics,'' said David Friedman, a \n     senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n       Instead, our wasteful ways complicate foreign policy in the \n     Middle East, whose oil fuels not only our cars but also \n     repressive regimes and terrorism. Soon enough, American \n     soldiers could be in harm's way in the region. Rather than \n     winking at the decline in fuel efficiency, our leaders should \n     set about reversing the troubling trend.\n       The president and congressional leaders should require \n     automakers to improve CAFE standards. They also should call \n     on Americans to share the sacrifices that lie ahead. We are \n     likely to respond.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Aug. 8, 2002]\n\n         Stop Your Grousing, Auto Makers, and Get the Gases Out\n\n                           (By Carl Zichella)\n\n       The auto industry howled when Gov. Gray Davis signed \n     California's landmark global warming control bill. Litigation \n     to overturn the new law, which restricts automobile emissions \n     of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, was \n     threatened before his signature was dry.\n       For auto industry observers, there was a sense of deja vu \n     about this hysterical response. Every time the government has \n     required new safety or efficiency standards, auto makers have \n     claimed that the result would be financial ruin, the \n     elimination of thousands of jobs and the loss of consumer \n     choice.\n       The truth is that the industry was wrong at every turn, and \n     it is wrong now. Car makers, instead of suing to overturn \n     this much-needed law, should get busy complying with it. No \n     new technology needs to be developed.\n       This is the industry that fought turn signals, seat belts \n     and safety glass. Henry Ford II called laminated windshields, \n     padded interiors and collapsible steering wheels \n     ``unreasonable, arbitrary and technically unfeasible.''\n       When Congress required auto manufacturers to build cleaner \n     cars in 1973, the industry response was hyperbolic. ``If GM \n     is forced to introduce catalytic converter systems across the \n     board . . . it is conceivable that complete stoppage of the \n     entire production could occur,'' warned a GM vice president. \n     The company easily complied, consumers benefited and GM \n     suffered no appreciable hardship.\n       In 1974, a Ford official told a congressional committee \n     that ``corporate average fuel economy''--CAFE--standards \n     would ``result in a Ford product line consisting either of \n     all sub-Pinto-sized vehicles or some mix of vehicles \n     ranging from sub-sub-compact to perhaps a Maverick.'' That \n     couldn't have been more wrong.\n       According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, from 1977 to \n     1983 American-built cars increased in efficiency by seven \n     miles per gallon. From 1977 through 1985, the U.S. gross \n     domestic product rose 27% while oil imports fell by 42%. OPEC \n     lost an eighth of its market. Few public policies have ever \n     been such a resounding success. Vehicle choice expanded while \n     oil prices declined.\n       The sky isn't falling for auto manufacturers, but the \n     planet is getting warmer, and the consequences for California \n     are severe. If the snowpack in the Sierra declines, bitter \n     competition for water will result since about 70% of \n     California drinking water originates there.\n       Further, farmland will become more arid and sea levels will \n     rise, reducing food production and flooding coastal cities. \n     Forests will shrink and some of the most valuable wildlife \n     habitat on Earth will vanish or be altered.\n\n[[Page S4902]]\n\n       The good news is that some simple solutions are at hand. \n     This year Ford sponsored a ``Future Truck'' competition for \n     university engineering students to build more-efficient sport \n     utility vehicles. If you believe the industry's rhetoric, \n     you'd think that SUVs will be abolished. But Ford's ``Future \n     Truck'' contestants showed the ridiculousness of this charge.\n       Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison this year \n     modified a Ford Explorer to get the equivalent of 38 mpg. \n     Others built a GMC Suburban that emits about half the carbon \n     dioxide of the production version. More-efficient vehicles \n     mean less CO2 emissions. You don't need to require \n     mileage standards--something that federal law forbids the \n     state to do--to get these benefits; all the state needs to do \n     is require the auto makers use the best technology available.\n       If university students can do this, why can't the Big \n     Three? Ford boasts that it plans to introduce a hybrid gas-\n     electric SUV in 2003. This model would meet the standard far \n     ahead of the new law's generous 2009 deadline. Instead of \n     suing California, auto makers should do what is right and \n     comply with the law.\n\n Mr. NELSON of FLORIDA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join \nwith my colleague, Senator Durbin of Illinois, and others, in \nintroducing a Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency bill that requires \npassenger vehicles to have an average fuel efficiency of 40 miles per \ngallon and nonpassenger vehicles to have an average fuel efficiency \n27.5 miles per gallon by 2015.\n  This proposal should be an important part of the upcoming debate on \nthe energy needs of our country. I was very disappointed last year \nduring the energy debate when several meaningful CAFE proposals were \ndefeated.\n  Now, as we again embark on the important task of determining how our \ncountry's energy needs will be met in the coming decades, CAFE \nincreases should be a part of the plan.\n  It has been said many times, but is worth repeating: the purpose of \nincreasing CAFE is to reduce fuel consumption.\n  The U.S. consumes 25 percent of the world's oil, but only has 3 \npercent of the world's reserves--so we have to use less of it and find \nalternatives.\n  Our national security depends on it. If we don't have to rely on \nother countries, many of whom do not support our policies and may be in \nfact be working against us, for our energy, we as a nation are more \nsecure.\n  And increasing CAFE protects the environment. Toxic air emissions and \ncarbon dioxide emissions are reduced--thereby slowing global warming.\n  The automobile manufacturers won't embrace this proposal, but they \nshould. The 2001 National Academy of Sciences' report said 40 mph is \npossible and feasible.\n  The technology exists to raise CAFE significantly with no net \nconsumer costs. And, developing technologies, including hybrid vehicle \ndesigns, could improve vehicle fuel economy by 20-40 percent. We're \nperfectly willing to give auto manufacturers the lead time necessary to \nmake these strides, but the benchmark has to be there to spur them into \naction.\n  The pay off to our national security, environment, level of \ntechnological expertise and market share will be worth the effort.\n  I have faith in the ingenuity of our automakers and the adaptability \nof the American consumer to make an increased CAFE standard profitable.\n  For these reasons, I lend my support to Senator Durbin's measure and \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on this issue during the \nupcoming energy debate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n           By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 804. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nnonrefundable tax credit for contributions to congressional candidates; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill with my \ncolleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, that provides tax incentives \nfor American families to participate in political campaigns. It will \nempower millions of Americans to become engaged in our political \nsystem, by providing a tax credit to those who donate money to \ncongressional candidates.\n  As campaigns become more and more expensive, the number of small \ncontributors is actually decreasing. The current campaign finance \nsystem is becoming dominated by big dollar contributors, a trend that \nis troubling to me.\n  Our bill would make middle income Americans more able to donate to \ncandidates. Specifically, the bill would provide a maximum $400 tax \ncredit to married couples earning up to $120,000 for their campaign \ncontributions. For singles with income up to $60,000, the tax credit \nwould apply to contributions up to $200. This credit will provide a \ndollar for dollar offset for contributions, an incentive that could \nencourage the many working families to consider contributions to the \ncandidates of their choice.\n  This is not a new idea. This type of credit was a part of our tax \nsystem for more than a decade in the 1970s and 1980s. It has been a \npart of many campaign finance reform proposals over the years, \nproposals that have been introduced and supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans. And this policy proposal is the focus of a study last year \nby the American Enterprise Institute, AEI, which concluded that this \napproach would help to elevate small donors from the supporting role \nthat they now play. So, our proposal has been successful in the past, \nand it has had broad support from both parties over the past thirty \nyears.\n  Participation in the political process is key to a strong democracy. \nThis bill will help broaden participation and will provide an incentive \nfor more Americans to be included in political campaigns.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 804\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance the rights of crime victims, to establish \ngrants for local governments to assist crime victims, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past Sunday marked the beginning of \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week. We set this week aside each year \nto focus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims. I am \npleased to take\n\n[[Page S4903]]\n\nthis opportunity to introduce legislation with my good friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and our cosponsors, Senators Corzine, \nKerry, Murray, and Schumer. Our bill, the Crime Victims Assistance Act \nof 2003, represents the next step in our continuing efforts to afford \ndignity and recognition to victims of crime.\n  My involvement with crime victims began more than three decades ago \nwhen I served as State's Attorney in Chittenden County, VT, and \nwitnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since \nto ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the \nrights and dignity of victims of crime, rather than one that presents \nadditional ordeals for those already victimized.\n  I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution \nto provide victims with greater rights and assistance. Over the past \ntwo decades, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills \nhave included: the Victims of Crime Act of 1984; the Victims' Bill of \nRights of 1990; the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990; the \nViolence Against Women Act of 1994; the Mandatory Victims Restitution \nAct of 1996; the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997; the Crime \nVictims with Disabilities Awareness Act of 1998; the Victims of \nTrafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000; the Victims of \nTerrorism Tax Relief Act of 2001; and the September 11th Victim \nCompensation Fund of 2001.\n  The legislation that we introduce today, the Crime Victims Assistance \nAct of 2003, builds upon this progress. It provides for comprehensive \nreform of the Federal law to establish enhanced rights and protections \nfor victims of Federal crime. Among other things, our bill provides \ncrime victims with the right to consult with the prosecution prior to \ndetention hearings and the entry of plea agreements, and generally \nrequires the courts to give greater consideration to the views and \ninterests of the victim at all stages of the criminal justice process. \nResponding to concerns raised by victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, \nthe bill provides standing for the prosecutor and the victim to assert \nthe right of the victim to attend and observe the trial.\n  Assuring that victims are provided their statutorily guaranteed \nrights is a critical concern for all those involved in the \nadministration of justice. Our bill would establish an administrative \nauthority in the Department of Justice to receive and investigate \nvictims' claims of unlawful or inappropriate action on the part of \ncriminal justice and victims' service providers. Department of Justice \nemployees who fail to comply with the law pertaining to the treatment \nof crime victims could face disciplinary sanctions, including \nsuspension or termination of employment.\n  In addition to these improvements to the Federal system, the bill \nproposes several innovative new programs to help States provide better \nservices to victims of State crimes. The bill authorizes technology \ngrants for local authorities to develop state-of-the-art notification \nsystems to keep victims informed of case developments and important \ndates. Grants would also be available to improve compliance with State \nvictim's rights laws, encourage further experimentation with the \ncommunity-based restorative justice model, streamline access to victim \nservices through the use of case managers, and expand the capacity of \nvictim service providers to serve victims with limited English \nproficiency.\n  Finally, the Crime Victims Assistance Act would improve the manner in \nwhich the Crime Victims Fund is managed and preserved. Most \nsignificantly, the bill would eliminate the annual cap on spending from \nthe Fund, which has prevented millions of dollars of Fund deposits from \nreaching victims and supporting essential services. We should not be \nimposing artificial caps on VOCA spending while substantial unmet needs \ncontinue to exist. The Crime Victims Assistance Act would replace the \ncap with a self-regulating system, supported by crime victim groups, \nthat would ensure the stability and protection of Fund assets, while \nallowing more money to be distributed for victim programs.\n  These are all matters that can be considered and enacted this year \nwith a simple majority of both Houses of Congress. They need not \novercome the delay and higher standards necessitated by proposing to \namend the Constitution. They need not wait the hammering out of \nimplementing legislation before making a difference in the lives of \ncrime victims.\n  I have on several occasions noted my concern that we not dissipate \nthe progress we could be making by focusing exclusively on efforts to \namend the Constitution. Regretfully, many opportunities for progress \nhave been squandered. One notable exception was the passage, as part of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, of several significant amendments to the \nVictims of Crime Act that Senator Kennedy and I had proposed in an \nearlier version of the Crime Victims Assistance Act. I am glad that we \ncould get those important provisions signed into law, but we still have \nmore to do.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, victims \ngroups, prosecutors, judges and other interested parties on how we can \nmost effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and \nState legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights \nover the past 20 years and we have an opportunity to make additional, \nsignificant progress this year to provide the greater voice and rights \nthat crime victims deserve. It is my hope that Democrats and \nRepublicans, and supporters and opponents of the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, will join in advancing the Crime Victims \nAssistance Act through Congress. We can make a difference in the lives \nof crime victims right now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the section-by-\nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 805\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Formula for distributions from the Crime Victims \n     Fund. Replaces the annual cap on distributions from the Crime \n     Victims Fund with a formula that ensures stability in the \n     amounts distributed while preserving the amounts remaining in \n     the Fund for use in future years. In general, subject to the \n     availability of money in the Fund, the total amount to be \n     distributed in any fiscal year shall be not less than 105 \n     percent nor more than 115 percent of the total amount \n     distributed in the previous fiscal year. This section also \n     establishes minimum levels of annual funding for both State \n     victim assistance grants and discretionary grants by the \n     Office for Victims of Crime.\n       Sec. 302. Clarification regarding antiterrorism emergency \n     reserve. Clarifies the intent of the USA PATRIOT Act \n     regarding the restructured Antiterrorism emergency reserve, \n     which was that any amounts used to replenish the reserve \n     after the first year would be above any limitation on \n     spending from the Fund.\n       Sec. 303. Prohibition on diverting crime victims fund to \n     offset increased spending. Ensures that the amounts deposited \n     in the Crime Victims Fund are distributed in a timely manner \n     to assist victims of crime as intended by current law and are \n     not diverted to offset increased spending.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, victims of crime deserve to have their \nvoices heard and be notified about important events in the criminal \njustice system relating to their cases, and they deserve enforceable \nrights under the law.\n  Today, my colleagues and I are introducing the Crime Victims \nAssistance Act. It is especially appropriate that we do so this week, \nwhich is National Crime Victims' Rights Week. Our bill is intended to \ndefine the rights of victims more clearly, and establish effective \nmeans to implement and enforce these rights. Equally important, it does \nso without taking the unnecessary and time-consuming step of amending \nthe Constitution.\n  Our bill strengthens protections for victims of both violent and \nnonviolent Federal crimes, and gives them a greater voice in the \ncriminal justice system. It gives victims a number of important rights, \nsuch as the right to be notified and consulted on detention and plea \nagreements; the right to be present and heard at trial and at \nsentencing; and the right to be notified of a scheduled hearing on a \nsentence adjustment, discharged from a psychiatric facility, or grant \nof clemency.\n  The rights established by this bill will fill existing gaps in \nFederal criminal law and will be a major step toward guaranteeing that \nvictims of crime receive fair treatment and are afforded the respect \nthey deserve. Our bill achieves these goals in a way that does not \ninterfere with the rights of the States to protect victims in ways \nappropriate to each State.\n  Rather than mandating that States modify their criminal justice \nprocedures in particular ways, our bill authorizes the use of Federal \nfunds to establish effective programs to promote victim rights \ncompliance. It increases resources for the development of state-of-the-\nart systems for notifying victims of important dates and developments \nin their cases. It provides funds for the development of community-\nbased programs relating to those rights. It also provides funds for \ncase management programs to streamline access to victims services and \nreduce ``revictimization'' by the criminal justice system, and enable \nservice providers to help victims with special communication needs, \nsuch as limited English proficiency, hearing disabilities, and \ndevelopmental disability.\n  Finally, our bill replaces the cap on spending form the Crime Victims \nFund, which has prevented millions of dollars of fund deposits from \nreaching victims and supporting essential services. The bill adopts a \nnew approach supported by victim groups to strengthen the stability of \nthe fund and protect its assets, while allowing more funds to be \ndistributed for victim programs.\n  We do not have to amend the Constitution to achieve these important \ngoals. The Constitution is the foundation of our democracy. It reflects \nthe enduring principles of our country. The Framers deliberately made \nthe Constitution difficult to amend because it was never intended to be \nused for normal legislative purposes. If it is not necessary to amend \nthe Constitution to achieve particular goals, it is necessary not to \namend it. Our legislation is well-designed to establish effective and \nenforceable rights for victims of crime, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 807. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide a \nmaximum term of supervised release of life for sex offenders; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the legislation I have offered, along \nwith Senator Hatch, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, is called the \nLifetime Consequences for Sex Offenders Act of 2003. It is supported by \nthe U.S. Department of Justice.\n  We will be seeking to include it within the child crimes bill, \notherwise known as the PROTECT Act.\n  Studies show that sexual offenders are prone toward recidivism \nthroughout their lives. A 1988 study of sexual recidivism factors on \nchild molesters showed that 43 percent of offenders sexually reoffended \nwithin a 4-year followup period--43 percent, almost half of them who \nwere caught. Within a 4-year period, maybe others reoffended and were \nnot caught. So one way to help curb that recidivism is to place the \ndefendant on supervised release for a period of years after he or she \nis released from prison.\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\n  Currently, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3543, a Federal judge is allowed \nto impose a term of 1 to 5 years supervised release on a convicted sex \noffender. In a review of 42 studies regarding sexual-offender \nrecidivism in which researchers followed up on the offenders, the \nresearchers have found that the longer the followup period is, the \ngreater is the percentage of those who will commit another crime. So it \nmeans they tend to reoffend way out into extended periods of time.\n  So this will give the sentencing court discretion to place a sex \noffender on supervised release for a term of up to life if the court \nthinks that is appropriate.\n  Mr. President, I had one of America's finest citizens in my office \nthis afternoon, John Walsh of the ``America's Most Wanted'' program, of \nwhich he is known so well. He has been a champion of protecting \nchildren from sexual predators and abuse. He told me there is no \ndoubt--and there is no doubt scientifically or any other way--that \nchild predators and sexual offenders and child molesters tend to be \nrecidivists. Pedophiles continue that activity. We wish it were not so, \nbut we see that in the papers every day--people who have had prior \nproblems, who have not just offended one time.\n  When I was a Federal prosecutor, I prosecuted a number of individuals \ncharged with sexual based offenses. In almost every instance, those who \nare apprehended--possessing child pornography, making child \npornography--had a history prior to that, over a period of years, of \nthe molestation of other children. In fact, I remember one who did not \nappear to have that history, and the agent ended up talking to his \ndaughter or step-daughter, and she said when she was a young girl, he \nhad molested her. So there was never one defendant that I had, in the \nfifteen years I prosecuted, who did not have a history of it.\n  It is a problem that we know is real. And it is not correct or wise \nto have a judge maybe sentence somebody to jail for 5 years in custody, \nand then they get out, and the most the judge can supervise them is 1 \nto 5 years. They may still be molesting children 25 years down the \nroad. Supervision can help them avoid repeat offenses and can help \nprotect children. And they will have a probation or parole officer \nsupervising their activities, making them report, on a daily basis, \nknowing where they are working, making sure they are not working in an \narea that could endanger children.\n  I think this is a commonsense bill. Senator Hatch and I are pleased \nto offer it. It is something that needs to be made a part of American \nlaw.\n  I appreciate the leadership that John Walsh has committed to these \nissues and the PROTECT Act, in particular.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 807\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 106\n\n       Whereas during the term of President Dwight David \n     Eisenhower and the era of Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft \n     Benson, it became apparent that the development of external \n     markets was needed to ensure the financial viability of the \n     agricultural sector of the United States;\n       Whereas the Foreign Agricultural Service was established on \n     March 10, 1953, to develop and expand markets for United \n     States agricultural commodities and products;\n       Whereas the Foreign Agricultural Service has represented \n     agricultural interests of the United States during a period \n     of expansion of United States agricultural exports from less \n     than $3,000,000,000 in 1953 to more than $50,000,000,000 in \n     2002;

which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n       Whereas scleroderma is a debilitating and potentially fatal \n     autoimmune disease with a broad range of symptoms which may \n     be either localized or systemic;\n       Whereas scleroderma may attack vital internal organs, \n     including the heart, esophagus, lungs, and kidneys, and may \n     do so without causing any external symptoms;\n\n[[Page S4910]]\n\n       Whereas more than 300,000 people in the United States \n     suffer from scleroderma;\n       Whereas the symptoms of scleroderma include hardening and \n     thickening of the skin, swelling, disfigurement of the hands, \n     spasms of blood vessels causing severe discomfort in the \n     fingers and toes, weight loss, joint pain, difficulty \n     swallowing, extreme fatigue, and ulcerations on the \n     fingertips which are slow to heal;\n       Whereas people with advanced scleroderma may be unable to \n     perform even the simplest tasks;\n       Whereas 80 percent of the people suffering from scleroderma \n     are women between the ages of 25 and 55;\n       Whereas scleroderma is the 5th leading cause of death among \n     all autoimmune diseases for women who are 65 years old or \n     younger;\n       Whereas the wide range of symptoms and localized and \n     systemic variations of scleroderma make it difficult to \n     diagnose;\n       Whereas the average diagnosis of scleroderma is made 5 \n     years after the onset of symptoms;\n       Whereas the cause of scleroderma is still unknown and there \n     is no known cure;

Mr. President, I believe the majority leader will be in \nthe Chamber in a moment. While we wait, I will take this opportunity to \nshare a few thoughts about an extraordinary nominee to the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Priscilla Owen.\n  She is, from my observation of hearings before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, an excellent, superb, truly magnificent nominee for the \ncourt of appeals. Justice Owen went to Baylor Law School, a very fine \nlaw school, and as I recall, finished second or third in her class, \nthen took the bar exam. Every person who wants to be admitted to the \nbar in Texas has to take it. They study as they can and take the test. \nIt is reported she made the highest single score on the Texas bar exam \nwhen she graduated from Baylor Law School. She was on the Law Review at \nBaylor law school.\n  She went to work at one of the finest law firms in Texas, did very \nwell, achieved a very nice level of compensation as would be \ncommensurate with that position, and many considered her to be perhaps \nthe finest litigator in the State of Texas, a very high honor. The \nState of Texas Supreme Court had\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\nproblems and they were looking for good candidates to run for that \ncourt. People talked to her about it. She thought about it and decided \nshe would run. She would give up the practice, as lucrative as it was, \nand give herself to public service. She ran for the Supreme Court of \nTexas and won that race. She served that term, ran again, and was \nelected with 87 percent of the vote of the people of Texas.\n  This is a remarkable record, the finest bar exam score, the highest \nscore in Texas, the very top of her law school class, editor of Law \nReview at Baylor University Law School, and in every way the kind of \nbackground you would want for a Federal appellate judge. Of course, she \nhad a number of years on the Supreme Court of Texas and handled that \nwork in an extraordinary way.\n  When President Bush thought about who would be a good nominee to his \nhome circuit, the Fifth Circuit--Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi--he \nlooked no further than Justice Owen, who had been so useful on the \nSupreme Court of Texas, who had been so popular, who was such an \noutstanding lawyer, a person of the highest possible integrity and \ngreat skill and ability. That is why he chose to nominate her. No \nwonder he did.\n  Things looked good, it seemed to me. We had a hearing on her in the \nJudiciary Committee. She answered the questions superbly, with great \npatience, great clarity of thought and expression. She dealt with each \nobjection anyone would throw out to her. She explained the cases that \nshe ruled on and why she ruled the way she did. She was asked and she \ntold the story about her campaign finance. She had such a good race the \nsecond time she ran that she did not spend all the money contributed to \nher campaign, and she did something I have never heard of before. She \nsent some of it back to everyone who contributed to her. That is the \nkind of person we are talking about. I have never seen it in \ncandidates. I have seen them give it to other candidates but not send \nit back to contributors, when she might yet again run for office and \nneed that money in the future.\n  I thought we were on the road to a first-rate quick confirmation. \nUnfortunately, groups raised objections and targeted this nominee. How \nthey pick nominees to target, I don't know, but this fine woman from \nthe Texas Supreme Court is one they should not have targeted, in my \nview. They raised quite a number of complaints.\n  One of them alleged that in the Ford Motor Company v. Miles case, a \nproduct liability case resulting from an automobile accident, Justice \nOwen overturned well-established venue precedence. That is a weak \nargument that did not hold up under scrutiny. Venue is the technical \nterm for the proper county in which to file a lawsuit. In this case, \nJustice Owen cited settled law in Texas which required that the lawsuit \nbe filed where a company has an agent or a representative. Ford did not \nhave an agent or a representative in the county where this lawsuit was \nfiled. In her opinion, Justice Owen was joined by Democrats. She \nconcluded that the plaintiff should have filed the lawsuit in the \ncounty where she lived, where the car was purchased, and the accident \noccurred.\n\n  These same groups have argued that Justice Owen is anticonsumer and \nantijury because she agreed with the trial court, a lower court, that \nthe plaintiff's claims were without merit in the City of McAllen v. De \nLa Garza. The plaintiff in this case was a passenger in a vehicle \ndriven by a drunk driver. The driver apparently fell asleep, veered off \nthe road, traveled over 100 feet, ran through a wire fence, knocked \nover several fence poles, all before landing in a limestone pit owned \nby the city of McAllen. The man was drunk, drove off the road, went \nthrough a fence, knocked over several posts, and ran into the pit. And \nhe sued the city. The plaintiff, remarkably argued, despite the fact \nthat he as a drunk driver caused the accident, that the city owed a \nduty to warn drivers of where the limestone pit was, several feet away \nfrom the road, barricaded by a fence and other obstacles not part of \nthe ordinary course of travel.\n  That is the kind of thing that judges deal with every day. They do \nnot just rule because they like a case or do not like a case. They go \nback and look at the precedent. They consider the statutes. They \nconsider what the law is, and they determine if the city of McAllen, \nTX, had a responsibility to put up a specific sign that said there was \na limestone pit out there. Maybe the neighbors would not like a tacky \nold sign saying there was a limestone pit there. They put up a fence so \nit would not be seen. The groups criticized her for that.\n  One of the things they complained about, in addition to that, was \nthat she had ruled in favor of lower court judges who had held that \nyoung women under Texas law would be required to inform their parents \nif they intended to have an abortion. Texas passed a law that dealt \nwith this circumstance. What the Texas Legislature concluded was that \nif a child were to have a serious procedure such as an abortion, they \nshould at least tell the parents. They did not declare that the parents \nhad to consent, just that the child had to tell. And to try to avoid \nconstitutional complaint, they put in the idea that if there was a \npotential for abuse, if there was some justifiable reason--and they \nspelled out some of those--the child would not have to tell the parent.\n  Several cases came up to Judge Owen because she is on the Supreme \nCourt. The lower court judge held a hearing and concluded the young \nperson had no basis not to tell their parents. The parents were not \ngoing to abuse them. It was not a problem in this case. You cannot give \na child an aspirin in school without parental consent, but here they \nsaid you had to tell the parent under Texas law.\n  Then the case went from that judge to an immediate court of appeals \nin Texas, and the court of appeals studied the case and studied the \ntrial court judge's ruling and they affirmed it in two or three cases \nwhile Justice Owen was on the Supreme Court and they affirmed the trial \ncourt, too.\n  So then it comes up to the Supreme Court of Texas, and Justice Owen \nread the case and studied the law, and went further than most judges \nwould have. She read the Supreme Court Federal cases about abortion. \nShe thought about the words the Supreme Court used in those cases. She \nwrote in her opinion that she assumed the statutes were trying to make \nsure they did not violate Federal law and Federal Supreme Court \nrulings. Texas tried to word the parental consent statute in a way that \nwas consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court, so she interpreted the \nwords that way and analyzed whether or not the Texas law was such that \nthis child should have to notify her parents or not. She agreed with \nthe three judges and the trial court below her.\n\n  So what the groups say is: Oh, she is not fit for the Supreme Court \nbecause she is not happy about abortion. She favors having children \ntell parents about whether or not they have abortions. She does not \nfollow the law.\n  If somebody studied that opinion, they would see she went to great \ncare to follow the Supreme Court, to follow the language they used. She \nhas, to my knowledge, never publicly expressed an opinion about \nabortion. She has not been out here campaigning against it or making \nany big to-do about it. What her personal views are, are her own. \nIndeed, 80 percent of the American people favor requiring a minor to \ndiscuss with her parents a serious procedure such as abortion.\n  Children in Texas are required to get consent of a parent before they \nhave a tattoo, which is probably a good idea, body piercing, or even an \naspirin at school. That is the Texas law that Justice Owen interpreted \nrequired a simple notification, but not a consent, of just one parent. \nHer opinion affirming that law and the lower court judges was not out \nof the mainstream of American law. There is just no doubt about it.\n  But there is an ideological movement around here which suggests that \nanybody who happens to be pro-life--and we don't even know for sure, to \nmy knowledge, whether Priscilla Owen is pro-life or pro-choice--but \nanyway, anybody who rules in this fashion is not fit for the courts of \nappeals of the United States.\n  It is really troubling to me when we see this happen to candidates of \nthe quality of Jeffrey Sutton, the quality of Priscilla Owen, or Miguel \nEstrada, people who have received the highest ABA rating, unanimously, \nby the bar association. The American Bar Association does background \nchecks on\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\nnominees. What they do is they make the nominees list all the major \ncases they have handled, list the judges who tried those cases, list \nthe names of the lawyers on the other side of the cases, and who their \nclients were. These ABA people--and I like what they do--go out and \ntalk to a lawyer on the other side of the case. They talk to the judge: \nHow did these lawyers handle themselves? Did they conduct themselves \nwith integrity? Were they skilled in argument? Did they understand and \nmake common-sense arguments? Are they hard to deal with? Irritable? \nDuplicitous and sneaky? That is what they do. They came out and gave \nher the highest possible rating after doing all of that. That is the \nreason why I would ask how a person with her background, her skill, her \nexperience, with that kind of rating of the ABA--why they would pick \nher to try to block? I hope it is not so, really. I hope we do not have \na filibuster on this case like we do, in fact, have with Miguel \nEstrada. Maybe we will and maybe we will not.\n  I just cannot believe it, frankly. I cannot believe it is possible \nthat Members of this body would conduct a filibuster against a \ncandidate for the court of appeals as qualified, as superbly qualified \nas Priscilla Owen. It is just beyond my comprehension that that could \never occur here.\n  There is not one hint she has anything other than the highest \nintegrity. There is no doubt she is brilliant. There is no doubt she \nhas given her life to the law and knows it and that is what she has \ndone throughout her career. She loves the law. She respects it and she \ncares about it. She cares about it deeply enough to enforce the law as \nwritten, whether or not she agrees with it. She will follow Supreme \nCourt rulings even if she were to disagree with them, like she \nrepeatedly pledged to do, because she is a lawyer and a judge who \nbelieves in the rule of law.\n\n  I think we will be facing a very sad event here in the next day or so \nif we end up with further objections--objections to bringing her up for \na vote, in effect having a filibuster. It is just beyond my \ncomprehension.\n  In the history of this country, we have never had a filibuster of a \ncourt of appeals judge or a district judge. The Constitution says by \nadvice and consent the Senate, in effect, will confirm or reject a \nPresident's nominee. The clear meaning of that statute and the way it \nis written leaves no doubt that it means a majority vote. Yet through \nthe utilization of the filibuster rule, some in this body are using a \nrule that has never before been used for a court of appeals judge or \ndistrict court judge in the history of this country. The effect has \nbeen to ratchet that up to a 60-percent vote--you have to have 60 votes \nhere.\n  You know from Miguel Estrada, he has already received 54 or 55 votes \nfor confirmation, which is a clear majority. But because he does not \nhave a 60-vote margin, he is not able to come up for an up-or-down \nvote.\n  I hope we are not going to see that in the case of Priscilla Owen. \nShe is entitled to an up-or-down vote. She is entitled to be confirmed \nas a Justice on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. President Bush knew \nher, he knew her reputation. He picked one of the finest people who \ncould be picked for any court of appeals position anywhere in this \ncountry, right in his home State of Texas. Is that why they are \nobjecting to her, because it is his State? I don't know. But it cannot \nbe on the merits.\n  I have looked at this matter. I have seen the arguments. I attended \nher hearing. I saw how well she handled herself. I believe and I hope \nand pray this body will not descend into a pattern of filibuster of \nnominees for the courts of appeals of this country, or for the district \ncourts, or even for the Supreme Court of the United States. That would \nbe a terrible alteration of our traditions, maybe even be in violation \nof the Constitution, which says a majority vote is what it takes to \nadvise and consent on Presidential nominees. It is something we ought \nto think very seriously about.\n  I hope my colleagues will not take that route and will give her an \nup-or-down vote. If they do, I have no doubt she will be confirmed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
