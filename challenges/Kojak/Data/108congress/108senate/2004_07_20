Mr. President, I see the minority leader in the Chamber. I \nwill make a few brief comments prior to him taking the floor.\n  This morning, we will be in morning business, and I want to make a \ncouple of comments about my frustration at this moment. William Myers \nis a Ninth Circuit court nominee from the President to fill the Idaho \nposition. He is a phenomenal and highly qualified young man who has \nserved as Solicitor at the Department of Interior. He was nominated \nwell over a year ago and brought before the committee. He handled \nhimself extremely well and professionally. He has been a man who has \nhad experience in both the public and the private sector. He served on \nthe Judiciary Committee under the former Senator from the State of \nWyoming. He is a top-flight man.\n  Yesterday, as we debated the nomination of Bill Myers, no one from \nthe other side came. The reason they did not is that we were served \nnotice some months ago that Bill Myers would not receive a vote this \nyear. We could try to cloture him, but they were going to block a vote \nagainst him. Was he qualified? Yes. Should he serve? Yes. Is he the \nselection of the President? Yes. Should he have an up-or-down vote? \nAbsolutely. But that is not going to happen.\n  He is now the eighth judge the other side has just flat told us does \nnot serve their political purpose, and therefore they will not allow us \na vote. That is constitutional obstructionism in the first order of the \nadvise and consent of our Constitution.\n  So here is a young man who came to Washington out of college to serve \nhis U.S. Senator, served with honor with the Judiciary Committee, \nworked for a\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\nprivate organization advising this Senator and the Senator from South \nDakota, as well as the National Cattlemen's Association, on grazing; \nbecame a private practice attorney; then went as attorney to the \nSecretary of Interior; has served most honorably and very credibly. He \nwill not get a vote this session of the 108th Congress. Why? Because \nthe other side has just flat said he serves their environmental agenda \npurposes and therefore we will not be allowed to vote on him.\n  That is a phenomenally frustrating reality to me as a Senator who \nbelieves that we do not have the right to arbitrarily pick and choose, \nwe have the right to advise and consent and to vote them up or vote \ndown, 51 votes or 50 votes, but not to arbitrarily pick and choose to \nserve the political agenda of a given political party for these \npurposes. There is no other explanation than the one I have just \noffered.\n  If one looks at the broad qualifications of the eight judges who have \nnow arbitrarily been chosen for their political past involvement and \ntherefore the accusation that they might be an activist on the court, \nthat is a frustration of the first order.\n  So no one came to the floor yesterday to debate him except those of \nus on the Judiciary Committee advocating his nomination. The votes are \nso locked in, so fixed, so regimented, that this just is not going to \nhappen. So we will have a 2:15 vote today. It is perfunctory. It is \njust the way it is going to be, unless we break out of this and say \ncollectively to the Senate as a whole, no, this procedure of misusing \nthe process is wrong. There is a time to debate, a time of reality, a \ntime of broad understanding, but most importantly, under our \nConstitution, we have never filibustered nor intentionally blocked by \ndemanding a 60-vote majority. They have always broken in the past when \ntried, and ultimately up until this Congress, Presidential nominations \nreceived the opportunity of the advise and consent of the Senate by a \nvote on the Senate floor, not of a cloture but of a majority.\n\n  The reason I highlight that is because that is the vote this \nafternoon. It is a false vote. It is an unnecessary vote for a highly \nqualified young man who would serve the Ninth Circuit well, a Ninth \nCircuit court that is now viewed as the most dysfunctional court in the \nland, where over 90 percent of its decisions are overturned by the \nSupreme Court. Bill Myers brings common sense to the court, not the \nradicalism of San Francisco lawyers but common sense spread across the \nwestern public land States of our country.\n  Is that why he is not getting the vote? Very possibly so. And that is \na tragedy of the highest order. This is not the kind of day the Senate, \nthis great Chamber, ought to have, but we are going to have it today at \n2:15 this afternoon. So it is important that I speak briefly to that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8432-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         9/11 COMMISSION REPORT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I know the minority leader is kindly \nwaiting, but let me say one other thing. We are going to be presented--\nthe press has already been presented--the 9/11 Commission report. I do \nnot have one in my office. I have to go read about it in the New York \nTimes. Thank you, Commission, for being so public that you will not \neven inform those of us who created you, but we understand they are \ngoing to recommend the creation of a czar-like or individual director \nof intelligence that coordinates all of the agencies.\n  I have one comment on that only because I have not seen the report, \nand I do not know that the minority leader has either--we have not had \na full opportunity to read it--let us proceed with caution. We have \ndone a great deal of work since 9/11 now to bring these institutions \ntogether to coordinate intelligence. We are better off than we were \npre-9/11.\n  I am not sure that I want a Cabinet level, politicized director of \nintelligence for our country. I do not know that it is a good idea to \npoliticize that. If we put them in a Cabinet level position, by the \ncharacter of that position we have politicized intelligence. \nIntelligence should not be politicized. It ought to be factual. And we \nnow know we have had a problem with the facts, but it wasn't just our \nintelligence community; it was intelligence communities around the \nworld. Bad information makes bad information makes bad reports and can \nproduce bad decisions.\n  Intelligence is critical and it needs to be of the highest order. I \nam not suggesting we don't have a top level coordinator/director, but \nlet us think long about the idea of politicizing that person. We have \nseen the Directors of the FBI stay on through Republican and Democrat \nadministrations throughout history--not always but many times. It \nbrought quality and uniformity to that law enforcement community. It \ndid not politicize it. It is every bit if not more important today, \nwith the war on terrorism, that we build a quality structure, that the \ninformation be of the first order, and that it never ever could be \nsuggested or run the test of, well, that person is a political person, \nthat person was appointed because he was a political friend. That is my \nonly caution today, in a preliminary thought, until we get the report \nand see the facts and the evidence. And I do wish the Commission would \nlet us have the report before they give it to the New York Times. It \nprobably would be a bit more appropriate and give us an opportunity to \nspeak factually and knowledgeably about it.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. The minority leader has been kind and \npatient, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8432-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me respond briefly, if I may, to the \nSenator from Idaho. I have respect for him and for much of the work we \nhave done together over the years on many issues, including forest \nhealth. But I must say I strongly disagree with his characterization of \nthis particular judicial nominating debate.\n  Over the history of our 220 years, the Senate has seen fit on \ncountless occasions to require either a threshold cloture vote or, \nbefore we had cloture, some resolution to controversial matters \ninvolving extended debate. Before we had cloture, there was no way to \nresolve it. A Senator could see fit to talk about an issue or a nominee \nfor days, weeks, months, and there was no way to resolve it. There were \nmany occasions during the 20th century when this was exactly the case. \nThat evolved, of course, with the implementation of cloture and the use \nof cloture over the course of the last 100 years. So now we have a rule \nof the Senate that says on those issues that are controversial, a \nsupermajority is required.\n  I think for the Senator from Idaho to make the point that there is no \nvote is just wrong. The vote occurs at 2:15. If the supermajority will \nmove to proceed on this very controversial nominee, you go to the \nsecond phase of consideration. But that is what the Senate rules \nrequire. I must say that is a far better approach than what we faced \nduring the Clinton administration, when more than 60 nominees never got \na committee vote. We go back to the old days of the 20th century during \nthe Clinton years when you didn't even have an opportunity for cloture \nbecause the Judiciary Committee refused to act on over 60 nominees. So \nthis is an improvement, to say the least, over that.\n\n  As to the qualifications of Bill Myers, I will simply say the ABA \ndoes not share the view of the Senator from Idaho with regard to his \nqualifications. It is very rare for the ABA not to categorize a nominee \nas qualified--extremely rare. They have not done so in\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\nthe case of Bill Myers. ``Partially qualified,'' but do we really want \na ``partially qualified'' nominee to serve on the circuit court of our \nland?\n  It is rare--in fact, it is unprecedented--for the Native-American \ncommunity in the United States to take a position on a judge. They have \nnever done so. The Native-American community in South Dakota and North \nDakota, in all Western States around the country, has come together \nwith one voice to say this man ought not be a circuit court judge--\nunheard of. We have never seen that before.\n  We have never seen the National Wildlife Foundation take a position \non a judge, but they, too, have said please do not confirm this \nnominee. Why? Because of what limited record he had with regard to \njudicial issues. He virtually has none as Solicitor. There is no real \ncourt experience, with a couple of exceptions. So you have somebody \nwith at least, arguably, some ethical questions that have not been \naddressed; you have major communities such as the Native-American \ncommunity in our country in an unprecedented statement in opposition; \nyou have the ABA that has said they are reluctant to support this \nnominee because he is only ``partially qualified.''\n  So, Mr. President, clearly it is those and many other factors that \nled every single Democrat, in a rare demonstration of opposition in the \ncommittee, to oppose this nomination. We have now approved, I believe \nit is 196 nominations--198 nominations. That is a record that surpasses \nBill Clinton, the first President Bush, and Ronald Reagan. This \nPresident's three predecessors have not had a record of confirmation \nequal to his.\n  I must say it is interesting, and I would note, that my colleague \nfrom Idaho, who just abhorred this current circumstance regarding \ncloture on a nominee, voted against cloture, voted to sustain the \nextended debate, ironically, in the circumstances involving another \nNinth Circuit nominee, Richard Paez. They voted to continue the debate, \nnot to vote for cloture, not to terminate the debate, not to move to \nthat second phase. So I would certainly ask the distinguished Senator \nat some point for his explanation as to why it was appropriate to \nextend debate in that case but not in this case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8433-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8433-S8434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE WORKING POOR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 60 years ago Franklin Roosevelt gave one \nof the most memorable State of the Union speeches in our history.\n  As he spoke, Germany occupied all of Europe. Americans were dying in \nbattle abroad and sacrificing for the war effort at home.\n  Total victory was uncertain. But that did not diminish President \nRoosevelt's optimism and vision.\n  In his address, he said the Nation had accepted a Second Bill of \nRights that, he said, would create ``a new basis of security'' for all.\n  In this Second Bill of Rights, President Roosevelt cited the right to \na decent home, a good education, and dependable health care; the right \nto fair prices for farmers and free competition for business; and the \nright to be free of the fears of hardship caused by old age. But first, \nand most fundamental, he called for the right to work for a fair wage.\n  Our country should be proud of the extraordinary progress we have \nmade in many of these areas. Together we have made our country better, \nstronger, and more secure. There is, though, more work to be done, and \ntoday I want to focus on President Roosevelt's call for a fair wage.\n  No value is more fundamental to the American character than the value \nof work. No ideal is shared so widely or cherished so deeply.\n  No principle binds us more closely to the generations of Americans \nwho built up our country, and the millions of new Americans who came to \nour shores to join in the effort. And no conviction so unites the \nconservative and liberal traditions of our Nation.\n  Ronald Reagan once said that:\n\n       People in America value family, work, and neighborhood. \n     These are the things we have in common socially and \n     politically. When it comes to the bottom line, all of us are \n     striving for the same thing--a strong and healthy America and \n     a fair shake for working people.\n\n  There is a fundamental American truth in those words--working people \ndeserve a fair shake. It has always been the promise of our country, \nand as we debate legislation here in the Senate, we should do all we \ncan to give life to that promise.\n  We should make certain that no American who works full-time lives in \npoverty. Unfortunately, the gap between promise and reality is \nwidening. Among full-time, year-round workers, poverty has doubled \nsince the late 1970's to 2.6 million workers. All told, the working \npoor are raising 9 million American children.\n  Moreover, as recent work by the Family Economic Self-Sufficiency \nproject shows, the level of income it now takes just to pay the basic \nbills is far above what we consider to be the poverty line. No working \nAmerican wants a handout. These families are playing by the rules. But \nas hard as they work, they cannot escape the grip of poverty.\n  A few weeks ago a Sioux Falls family sent me a letter. The father \nworks 56 hours a week as a skilled welder. His wife is a substitute \nteacher who only works part-time so she can care for her son, who \nsuffers from autism and diabetes. They live in a 20-year-old mobile \nhome that has sinking floors and a leaking ceiling. They wrote:\n\n       We are facing possible foreclosure. Lights, heat, phone, \n     etc. are all 60 plus days past due and on the verge of \n     disconnection. . . . Medical bills have been turned over to a \n     collection agency.\n\n  Their final question was: ``Now what?''\n  They feel trapped. Since they can't afford insurance, their son's \nmedical bills have erased their savings and destroyed their credit. \nWithout good credit, interest payments eat up much of their income. And \nwithout affordable child care, the family's mom can't shift to full-\ntime work, which could help lift them out of poverty.\n  They are working as hard as they can and want to work even harder. \nBut that doesn't seem to be enough. They are farther away from \nPresident Roosevelt's vision today than when they first wrote to me. \nIt's in our national interest not to look away from this difficult \nproblem, but to face it squarely and honestly.\n  If the people who work hard don't get a fair shake, then our Nation \nrisks losing an essential value that has contributed to America's \nexcellence and ongoing success. We cannot let that happen. We should \nnot kid ourselves and pretend this is an easy problem. It is not. It is \nenormously complicated. But there are things we can and must do.\n  First, it is important that American business leaders live up to \ntheir responsibility as good corporate citizens and share the benefits \nof increased productivity with their workers, not just their \nshareholders. The Chief Economist at Merrill Lynch recently noted that \nthere's been a notable ``redistribution of income to the corporate \nsector.'' While salaries have remained flat over the past 4 years, \ncorporate profits now occupy a greater share of our GDP than at any \npoint since tracking began nearly 60 years ago. We are moving in the \nwrong direction, and leaders in the private sector have a \nresponsibility to help us move back in the right direction.\n  Here in Congress, we also have a responsibility to address the \nproblems confronting the working poor, and we should start by requiring \na long overdue increase in the minimum wage. Today, the minimum wage of \n$5.15 per hour is worth $3 less than it was in 1968. Americans who work \nat the minimum wage for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, still fall \n$5,000 short of the poverty line. That means, as the Sioux Falls family \nknows, that adequate housing, enough food to eat, health insurance, and \ncollege funds are the stuff of fantasy, not reality. In the time we \nhave left this year, we should increase the minimum wage to $7. That \nwon't solve all our problems, but it is a beginning.\n\n  We should also revisit the Earned Income Tax Credit. It was created \n20 years ago as an incentive to help working families lift themselves \nout of poverty through hard work. President Reagan called it the ``best \nanti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to \ncome out of Congress.'' I agree. Now we need to expand it, so that \nevery American child grows up seeing that work is rewarded and \nrespected.\n  We should also make sure all families receive their fair share of the \nchild tax\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\ncredit. Extending the credit to all working families would restore a \nbasic level of fairness and offer millions of working families the same \nchild tax credit given to those higher up the income ladder.\n  We must also acknowledge that despite the many benefits of \nglobalization, it has placed downward pressure on low income wages. We \nwon't make progress if our wages fall faster than the prices for the \nproducts we need.\n  ``What do the American people want more than anything else?'' \nPresident Roosevelt asked in 1944.\n  This was his answer:\n\n       To my mind, they want two things: work, with all the moral \n     and spiritual values that go with it; and with work, a \n     reasonable measure of security. . . . Work and security. \n     These are more than words. They are more than facts. They are \n     the spiritual values, the true goal toward which our efforts \n     should lead.\n\n  That was the challenge 60 years ago, and it remains a central \nchallenge today. It is, as President Roosevelt said, ``our duty.''\n  I hope we can all join together to make that vision a reality for \nmillions of hard-working and honest Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to talk today about the 9/11 \nCommission report, the war on terror, and the progress we have made \nsince we were attacked 3 years ago in this country.\n  For years, terrorists have attacked the United States with little or \nno reaction from us. We have highlighted time and time again the trail \nof terror that led to September 11, 2001.\n  In 1993, terrorists bombed the World Trade Center, killing 6 people \nand wounding more than 1,000. It is still not fully solved.\n  In 1996, terrorists bombed the U.S. military living quarters at \nKhobar Towers, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 brave Americans and wounding \nscores more--never solved.\n  In 1998, followers of Osama bin Laden attacked U.S. Embassies in \nKenya and Tanzania, killing and wounding hundreds--never solved.\n  In 2000, Osama bin Laden's followers attacked the U.S.S. Cole in a \nharbor in Yemen, killing 17 sailors and wounding 39 more--not solved.\n  Sadly, it took four hijacked airplanes being turned into weapons of \nmass destruction and the loss of nearly 3,000 innocent Americans and \nvisitors to our country for us to resolve that we had been attacked, \nour way of life had been attacked, and the United States of America is \ngoing to fight back. We are in a war on terrorism.\n  The 9/11 Commission is going to report on Thursday, and we know there \nwill be blame for everybody about the failure of our intelligence \ncapabilities. The administration of President Bush provided \nunprecedented access and cooperation to the Commission because the \nPresident said we want to know what went wrong so we can make it right. \nThe President himself said:\n\n       The 9/11 commission will issue a report this week and will \n     lay out recommendations for reform of the intelligence \n     services of the United States. I look forward to seeing those \n     recommendations. They share the same desire that I share \n     which is to make sure that Presidents and Congress get the \n     best possible intelligence. I have spoken about the reforms, \n     and some of the reforms are necessary--more human \n     intelligence, better ability to listen and see things and \n     better coordination among the various intelligence gathering \n     services.\n\n  This is what President Bush said about the 9/11 Commission. He went \nfurther to say:\n\n       Based on published accounts, we expect the commission \n     report will show that government institutions failed to adapt \n     to the threat of terrorism over more than a decade, enabling \n     terrorists to exploit dangerous weaknesses in our defenses. \n     We expect the commission to confirm that the blame for the 9/\n     11 attacks lies squarely and exclusively with al-Qaida. It is \n     clear as the threat of international terrorism evolved over \n     more than a decade that our national security and \n     counterterrorism institutions did not resolve to meet the \n     threat under both Republican and Democratic administrations, \n     Republican and Democratic Congresses. The kind of systematic \n     changes and reform that might have made it more difficult for \n     the terrorists to strike on 9/11 did not take place.\n\n  We have established that we can put the blame everywhere--in \nCongress, with Republicans, with Democrats, with administrations of the \npast and administrations of the present. We have taken some steps \nalready as the Commission hearings have resolved.\n  We have taken the steps of implementing a new policy on terrorism by \nholding to account terrorist groups and the states that sponsor them \nand not allowing dangerous threats to gather overseas unchecked. We \nhave cut off their money supply in many instances where we could with \ncooperation from allies.\n  We have transformed the FBI into an agency focused on preventing \nterrorist attacks through intelligence collection and other efforts \nwhile also trying to help it perform its traditional role as a world-\nclass law enforcement agency for investigating terrorism and other \ncrimes.\n  We conducted the largest reorganization of the Federal Government \nsince 1947 by creating the Department of Homeland Security, bringing \nunparalleled focus and resources to homeland security efforts.\n  We have dramatically increased security on airplanes and other \ntransportation systems on our borders and in our ports, providing \nsignificantly increased support for America's first responders.\n\n  We have broken down the unnecessary ``wall'' between law enforcement \nand intelligence gathering with the USA PATRIOT Act and with internal \nprocedures and guidelines that are reformed so that our intelligence \nagencies and our law enforcement agencies can do their job without \nartificial restrictions that would keep them from doing something as \nsimple as tracing through cell phones potential terrorists who are \nplanning some kind of action against innocent law-abiding Americans.\n  We are going to challenge these security issues. We are not going to \nignore them. We are not going to wait for a future tragedy.\n  Recently, President Bush articulated three commitments in our \nstrategy for peace.\n  First, we are defending the peace by taking the fight to the enemy. \nWe are not sitting here waiting for the enemy to come back to America; \nwe are taking the fight where the enemy is. We are taking the fight to \nthe Taliban resurgents in Afghanistan. We are taking the fight to Iraq \nwhere, Heaven knows, we have seen the brutality of Saddam Hussein in \nhis support for terrorists by giving $25,000 rewards to suicide bombers \nin Israel.\n  Second, we are protecting the peace by working with friends and \nallies and international institutions to isolate and confront \nterrorists and outlaw regimes. We are laser-beam focused in the war on \nterrorism.\n  We are working with the United Nations, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, and other international organizations to take action for \nour common security. We are not facing a security threat just in the \nUnited States; we are facing a security threat to every freedom-loving \ncountry. Every country that lives in freedom is a target. We have seen \nit in bombings throughout the world, and recently in Spain.\n  Third, we are extending the peace by supporting the rise of \ndemocracy.\n  It is absolutely proven that in democratic and successful societies, \nmen and women will not allow the malcontent and zealots and murderers \nto stay among them. They turn their labor to rebuilding and to better \nlives.\n  Is there one person in the world who has children who doesn't want \nthe best for them? Is there a person in the world who doesn't want an \neducation for their children so their children will have a better life \nthan they did? Is there one person in the world who doesn't want that? \nIt is clear that the way to get education for every child and a quality \nof life that would be good for every child to grow up in is democracy \nand freedom. That is how you get it. That is what we are trying to \nprovide. We are doing it in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq where \nthey haven't known freedom for years. We have some successes.\n  Look at Afghanistan. Three years ago, Afghanistan was the home base \nof\n\n[[Page S8435]]\n\nal-Qaida, ruled by the Taliban, the most cruel of regimes imaginable. \nThe things they did to women and children are unimaginable in our \ncountry. Today, Afghanistan is looking at a presidential election this \nfall. The terror camps are closed. The Afghan Government is helping us \nto hunt down the remnants of the Taliban. The American people are safer \nbecause Afghanistan is now stabilized with a great President, Hamid \nKarzai, who wants for his people the same thing that everybody wants--\nfreedom, democracy, education, good health care, jobs, and an economy. \nHe is trying to provide it, and we are helping him, and we are safer \nbecause of it.\n  Let us look at Pakistan. Three years ago, Pakistan was a country that \nopenly recognized the Taliban. Al-Qaida was active. They were \nrecruiting in Pakistan. The United States was not on really good terms \nwith Pakistan at that time, but today, we see a great ally in Pakistan. \nPresident Musharraf is a friend to our country. He is making reforms in \nPakistan and trying to root out the same Taliban/al-Qaida network in \nthe remote regions that have terrorized Afghanistan and, in fact, have \nhurt the people of Pakistan as well. It was Pakistan that helped us \ncapture Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the planner of the 9/11 attack on \nAmerica.\n  Who could say we are not safer today because we have an alliance with \nPakistan and an alliance and a stake in the stability of Afghanistan?\n  Iraq, 3 years ago; where were the people of Iraq? The ruler of Iraq \nwas an enemy of our country. He was a mass murderer. He had used \nweapons of mass destruction on his own people.\n  Today, we see pictures of him in a system of justice which he never \nallowed his own people. But he is going to have justice. It is going to \nbe given justice by the people he treated so horribly. The people of \nIraq are seeking justice.\n  The people of America are safer because Saddam Hussein is gone. He is \nnot giving $25,000 to the family of a suicide bomber to blow up a bus \nin Israel and kill children. We are safer because there will be \nelections in Iraq. By next January, we will see the people of Iraq \nspeaking about their own government. In fact, U.N. Secretary Kofi Annan \nhas named a career diplomat to the post that has been vacant since \nsuicide bombers blew up the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad last August, \nkilling the last U.N. representative there. America is safer because \nSaddam Hussein is behind bars and because his sons are no longer \ntorturing and maiming hundreds of people in Iraq.\n  Saudi Arabia, 3 years ago; Saudi Arabia had terrorists within its \nmidst and they were looking the other way. Today, Saudi Arabia says \nthey are trying to find the attackers. They are finally realizing the \ngrowth of these terrorist regimes hurt their people, too. We are going \nto try to help Saudi Arabia in every way they ask us to help, to root \nout the terrorists who have fomented in their country.\n  If there is no place for the terrorists to hide in the Middle East, \nand if people are starting to see an economy, and if there are \ndemocracies emerging in places such as Iraq, it will change the course \nof the whole Middle East.\n  Libya, 3 years ago; Libya, a longtime supporter of terror, was \nspending millions of dollars to acquire chemical and nuclear weapons. \nToday, thousands of Libya's chemical munitions have been destroyed. The \nLibyan Government finally saw that the civilized world was not going to \nsit back any longer and let it continue to proliferate weapons of mass \ndestruction. Muammar Qadhafi, in Libya, said: We are going to abandon \nany chance for nuclear weapons to be produced in our country.\n  We are seeing the breakdown of the terrorist regimes, one by one, in \nthe Middle East. Why are we seeing the regimes go away and the \nbeginnings of democracy come forward? Because our President has been \nfocused. He has not relented in the war on terrorism. He has not \nrelented in his responsibility to protect the people of America. \nEverything he has done has been with one goal in mind and that is to \nprotect the people of America. That is the President's focus and that \nis why we are as far along as we are.\n  Let me read from an AP story about the success of the newly emerging \nIraq stock exchange. From the AP on Sunday, July 18:\n\n       The miniature Liberty Bell clanged. Elbows flew. Sweat \n     poured down foreheads. Sales tickets were passed and, with \n     the flick of the wrist, 10,000 shares of the Middle East Bank \n     has more than doubled in value.\n       The frantic pace Sunday of those first 10 minutes of \n     trading typified the enthusiasm behind the Iraq Stock \n     Exchange--a new institution seen as a critical step \n     in building a new Iraqi economy.\n       In just five sessions, trading volume has nearly quadrupled \n     and the value of some stocks has surged more than 600 \n     percent. . . .\n       The exchange's chief executive, as he eyed the activity on \n     the trading floor, which is housed in a converted restaurant \n     because looters had gutted the old exchange, looked out and \n     said: How can I not be excited about this?\n\n  The unofficial figures of the day's trade tell the story. Over 10 \nmillion equivalent dollars in stocks changed hands, reflecting the \nmovement of 1.43 million shares--although only 27 companies are listed \non the exchange.\n  That is just one more step in the stabilization of Iraq. America is \ngoing to stay to help Iraq as they recover from the brutal regime of \nSaddam Hussein. As long as we are asked to stay to stabilize, we will \nbe there. When we are no longer needed with the allies that are staying \nwith us, we will happily leave that country in the hands of trained \nmilitary personnel for security and in the hands of elected democratic \nleaders selected by the vote of the people.\n  Today, we see the emerging of the temporary government of Sunnis and \nShiites and Kurds, working together to create a unified Iraq that will \nbe able to hold elections for that country.\n  We have more to do. We all know we have more work to do. Our \nPresident has done so much in 3 years, rebuilding the areas of New York \nthat were hit by terrorists, building up our security network, spending \nbillions for homeland security, focusing on airline, airplane, and \nairport security, port security.\n  We live in a big country. We live in a free country. It is hard to \nget control in a free country of every potential site that a terrorist \nmight attack. But because we are free, the people of our country are \nstepping up to the plate, too; they are helping. They are being \nvigilant. They are looking for things that are strange and reporting \nthem. We believe attacks have been averted because of the vigilance of \nthe President and Congress and the people of the United States.\n  We must remain a united country. When I hear some of the debates in \nthe political arena, it is as if people are saying, we are two \ndifferent countries; we are a divided country.\n  We are not a divided country. We need leaders who recognize we are \nnot a divided country. We are a unified country. We need leaders who \nwill unify America and talk to the people about what we can do together \nthat will make us stronger, standing up and celebrating our diversity, \nshowing how it can work in a free and democratic society. That is what \nwe are proving by leading as unifiers.\n  We have a President of the United States who is leading for security \nand unification of our country. We must work with the President as a \nunited Congress to combat terrorism for the security of our people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the imminent \nrelease of the final report of the 9/11 Commission. The Commission's \nreport will be the final product of a long and comprehensive process \nthat has at times deeply touched the families of those who were lost on \n9/11 and has questioned the ability of our Government to defend against \na new terrorist threat.\n  As the Commission issues its report, the state of the Union on \nhomeland security is not good enough. Are we better off than we were on \n9/11, as my colleague from Texas has mentioned? Yes, we are. Are we \ndoing everything we can to protect ourselves? Absolutely not. Are we \nputting the same energy in the homeland to defend ourselves that we are \nputting into the war overseas? No, unfortunately not.\n  Time and time again, on homeland security, we are not doing enough. \nAnd the view of the White House is that it takes a back seat to \nfighting the war on terror overseas. Dollars that are needed for so \nmany projects are not\n\n[[Page S8436]]\n\nforthcoming in this administration's budget or from the Congress, for \nthat matter. That is a bad thing and a sad thing for America.\n  That is why this report that the Commission is issuing is so \nimportant. It is my hope, it is my prayer, that it importunes us to do \nmore so that another 9/11 will never happen.\n  First, I would like to address the Commission itself. They have done \na remarkable job. This Commission, as we know, was created with a \nmandate of exploring how the United States became vulnerable to a \nterrorist attack as large and as complex as that attack which so hurt \nus on 9/11. The Commission was resisted by the White House and by some \nin this body. But it was the families that forced it to happen: the \nfour brave widows from New Jersey who said they would not rest until \nthere was a commission. Those families and many other families of the \nvictims in New York, my State, were relentless in not only forcing a \ncommission to occur, but in forcing it to be a bipartisan commission, a \nnonpolitical commission that had full power to get to the bottom of \nwhat happened.\n  I can tell you, having spoken to many of the family members, they \nonly had one mission. They are Republicans and Democrats; they are \nconservatives, moderates, and liberals. Their mission was a simple one. \nWalking with holes in their hearts because their loved ones had been \ntaken from us in such a cruel event, their mission was a generous one, \nI might say a noble one: that this never happen again. Their view, \nwhich I think America has accepted, is that the only way we can prevent \na future 9/11 is to learn of the mistakes that were made before 9/11.\n  The Commission was led by two remarkably nonpartisan figures: \nGovernor Thomas Kean, Republican of New Jersey; Congressman Lee \nHamilton, Democrat of Indiana. They steered the Commission away from \nfinger-pointing, away from blame, away from partisanship but, rather, \ntoward ``just the facts, ma'am,'' as Jack Webb said on ``Dragnet.'' \nJust the facts is what they wanted to find out so we could then learn \nof the mistakes that were made--not to excoriate, not to blame, but, \nrather, to correct and make sure it does not happen again.\n  The Commission dutifully pursued this task, despite resistance from \nmany quarters in Washington. It did not shirk from even the most \ntroubling aspects of its investigation.\n  The final report is about to be released this week. It is important \nthat every one of us, that every American, learn of its findings, and \nwe make sure our Government, without delay, examines those \nrecommendations and then acts to make us safer still.\n  There are a couple of things that have come out already about what \nthe Commission wants. They have recommended there be a Cabinet level \nappointee of the President to be in charge of all intelligence. It \nmakes eminent sense, in my judgment. We cannot even count the number of \nintelligence agencies there are. And so many of them are too interested \nin turf. One agency finds out something and does not tell another so \nthey might gain a leg up. There is a lack of coordination, even the \nfact that their computers do not talk to one another. It all hurts \nevery one of us in terms of our desire to be secure and make sure \nanother terrorist attack does not occur.\n  By having one Cabinet officer in charge of all intelligence, with \nbudgetary authority, that Cabinet officer can enforce a regime which \nwill require all of the agencies to cooperate with one another.\n  There will also be some structural changes within the agencies. In \nthe FBI, an agency I have been very interested in, I am hopeful the \nCommission will recommend something I know they considered, and I think \nmay well recommend, which is there be a separate part of the FBI \ndealing with counterterrorism.\n  The FBI's mission in the past has always been to find out who did \ncrimes and prosecute them. The FBI does a very good job of that. But \ncounterterrorism is different. We have to prevent crimes. It requires a \ndifferent mentality. It is my hope we will rearrange the FBI. Some have \nrecommended a separate agency for counterintelligence. I think that may \ngo too far. But to have a reorganization within the FBI makes a great \ndeal of sense.\n  Now, these are a few of the recommendations that will come out. There \nare going to be many more. Let me just say, the tendency of some here \nin Washington, some in the White House, when they hear news they \ndisagree with or that points to an error that was made, instead of \nresponding on the merits and saying, Here is why you are wrong, or here \nis why we want to do it differently, they disparage the messenger. They \ncall them not patriotic. They call them political. They call them \npartisan.\n  This Commission, if ever, is not partisan and is not political. We \nshould listen to their recommendations, and I hope there is not delay. \nSome are going to say: Let's wait until next year on their clear-cut \nrecommendations. If the rumors are correct, the Commission will be \nunanimous. All the Democrats and all the Republicans will have one set \nof recommendations. So, again, it is not partisan, and there is an \nequal number of each party on the Commission. We should not wait. To \nwait until next year--a new Congress, maybe a new President--will delay \nus. These recommendations should not be put in a political context and \nshould not be looked at in light of the political calendar that is upon \nus. We should immediately move, in September, when we return, to enact \nthese recommendations. We may choose to modify them. Perhaps the body \nwill reject them.\n  There is a lot of talk that the Defense Department and the CIA will \noppose having an overseer above them. We will have to debate that. I \nhope we listen to the Commission. But to delay would be delaying our \nsafety.\n  So I hope and pray we will move quickly and move forward and not \neither kneecap the Commission--because already I saw some column by a \nvery conservative gentleman who said: The Commission, forget about it. \nAll this writer was interested in was saying the President did \neverything right.\n  Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, whether you are a liberal \nor a conservative, we know that neither this President nor prior \nPresidents of both parties did everything right or we would not have \nhad a 9/11.\n  So, again, let us not put our defensive shields up and hunker down \nfor a fight. Let us make this one of those rare moments of \nbipartisanship, as the Commission itself has, and adopt their \nrecommendations.\n  Now, let me say, as somebody who cares a great deal about homeland \nsecurity, there are a number of areas where we are not doing enough. I \ndon't know if the Commission will address these, but I hope so. We have \ndone a pretty good job on air security. Flying is a lot safer and less \nprone to terrorism today than before 9/11. But we have not done \neverything there. One big problem is shoulder-held missiles. We know \nterrorists have them. God forbid, they smuggle some of those into the \nUnited States and shoot down 5 or 10 planes at once in Boston, or New \nYork, or Houston, or Seattle, or Denver, or Chicago. We are not doing \nenough there.\n  We are doing far too little on port security. The percentage of the \nbig containers that come into our Pacific ports, Atlantic ports, and \ngulf coast ports that are inspected is too few. The technology has not \nbeen implemented as quickly as it might be.\n  On truck security and rail security, Madrid was a wake-up call. We \nare far behind what we should be doing.\n  The unfortunate problem is that the terrorists have access to the \nInternet just as we all do. They are on it diligently looking for where \nwe are weak. If we strengthen air security, they will look to the \nports. If we strengthen the ports, they will look to the rails. So we \nhave to have a multifront war. We are not doing enough.\n  On so many of these issues, as somebody who comes from New York and \nstill lives with the grief that so many of my constituents feel, I can \ntell you we are not doing close to enough. Oftentimes, it is not that \nwe don't have the technology and not that we don't have the ability; it \nis that we don't put in the money that is needed. I think if you ask \nmost Americans what their priorities are, homeland security would be at \nthe top of the list. Unfortunately, we get a lot of talk and not much \naction.\n  Another place where we are way behind is how we give out our homeland \nsecurity funds. To its credit, the first\n\n[[Page S8437]]\n\nyear, the administration really allocated the money on the basis of \nneed. My State of New York got about a third of the funds, which is \nprobably right. But then they abandoned ship. Once Mitch Daniels left, \nwho was head of OMB, a true conservative who didn't want to spend \nmoney, these homeland security funds became pork battle and they are \nspread thin.\n  I say to the Chair, I know everybody has some needs, but to have his \nState get, on a per capita basis, far more dollars than mine in terms \nof homeland security, I don't think seems right, much as I want to \nprotect both. Over and over again, on homeland security funds, we have \nnot allocated it to the places of greatest crisis. That, too, is a \nproblem.\n  So the bottom line is this: I hope this report will be what it should \nbe, a wake-up call--a wake-up call that, on intelligence, our agencies \nare too disparate, they don't talk to one another or coordinate with \none another. They are not doing the job they should and we have to \ncorrect that. I hope it is a wake-up call that here at home on homeland \nsecurity we are not doing enough. It is common knowledge that, as so \nmany say, to win a basketball or a football game you need both a good \noffense and a good defense. We have an offense out there all right. I \nhave been largely supportive of that offense. But we are not doing \nenough on the defense. You cannot win a game without a good defense. I \nhope it is a wake-up call on defense as well. I hope it is a wake-up \ncall.\n  I hope the report will be comprehensive, and that it will talk about \nso many things--immigration, rail, port, truck security, and air \nsecurity. It will talk about all of the things that we did wrong before \n9/11. Again, instead of finger-pointing, instead of seeking blame, \ninstead of ducking, let's hope this report importunes the Congress, \nimportunes the White House to one of its finest hours in that we spend \nsome time in September, after having had plenty of time to analyze the \nreport, to implementing its recommendations--at least the ones the \nCongress sees fit. It would be unacceptable for us to just look at the \nreport for a day and then do nothing. That would be a dereliction of \nour duty to our citizens to do what we are required to do, that which \nthe Constitution requires us to do--protect the security of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Two high-ranking White House officials leaked this name to more \nthan one reporter. It is interesting that no other reporters reported \nit except Robert Novak.\n  Here we are 372 days--1 year and 6 days after this crime was \ncommitted. We still have no answers about who in the White House was \nresponsible for this leak. We still have no assurance from the \nPresident or the Vice President that those who are responsible do not \nstill remain in high-ranking decision making roles in the White House. \nThey are probably still there.\n  This administration has failed to find and punish the officials \nresponsible for this criminal action. Ms. Plame's identity was leaked \nby senior White House officials only 8 days after her husband \nquestioned in print one of the key administration justifications for \nthe war in Iraq; that is, that Iraq had sought to buy uranium ore from \nthe country of Niger.\n  This blatant defiance of public accountability weakens our country. \nIt damages our international credibility and undercuts our human \nintelligence efforts at a time when they are needed more than ever. It \nis just one example of the way this administration has weakened \nAmerica's standing in the world.\n  I will speak further to this issue during the remainder of the week. \nAgain, I will continue to point out how this has weakened America. Last \nmonth, for example, a group of 26 former senior diplomats and military \nofficials who worked for Presidents of both parties, Republican and \nDemocrat, issued a compelling statement about the damage the \nadministration has done to our security. Their statement said:\n\n       Our security has been weakened.\n\n  It said further:\n\n       [The] Bush administration has shown that it does not grasp \n     the circumstances of the new era and is not able to rise to \n     the responsibility of world leadership in either style or \n     substance.\n\n  When a former Ambassador, Joseph Wilson, raised issues that \nquestioned part of President Bush's rationale for the war in Iraq, this \nadministration attacked him politically, and then went after his wife. \nAnd the smear campaign continues, as we have seen in recent columns and \nfour statements this week.\n  I am not here to criticize or defend former Ambassador Joseph Wilson. \nI am here to make the point that when he dared to question whether one \nof the President's justifications for the war in Iraq was correct, the \nWhite House was so intent on discrediting him that they were willing to \nexpose the identity of an undercover CIA agent in an act of vicious \npolitical retribution. They were willing to break the law, and to \ndamage the relationship between the White House and the intelligence \ncommunity. This administration purposefully stretched intelligence data \nthey knew to be questionable to justify the war to the American people \nand to Congress.\n  According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report, in February of \n2002, the CIA sent former Ambassador Wilson to Niger to investigate \nclaims that Iraq had sought to purchase Nigerian uranium ore. His trip \nand subsequent debriefing neither verified the claim, nor disproved it. \nFollowing his trip, the intelligence community continued efforts to \nverify the claim.\n  In October of 2002, the White House sought to include that claim--\nthat Iraq had tried to buy uranium ore from Niger--in a policy speech \nby the President that was to be given in Cincinnati. But the CIA had \nsuch serious concerns about this being in his speech that they sent a \nmemo to the White House seeking changes. The CIA did not think these \nconcerns were being taken seriously, so the following day, they sent a \nsecond memo that urged the information be deleted from the President's \nspeech.\n  So now we have two memos to the White House on subsequent days asking \nthat this be taken out of his speech because ``the evidence was weak'' \nand that the CIA had told Congress that ``the Africa story was \noverblown.'' That same day, CIA Director Tenet personally called Deputy \nNational Security Adviser Stephen Hadley to express his concerns about \nusing this information in the speech. And guess what. It was taken out \nof the President's speech by Stephen Hadley, the Deputy National \nSecurity Adviser.\n  That is how concerned the CIA was about this information and about \nthe credibility of the information: two memos and a personal call from \nthe Director of the CIA to Deputy National Security Adviser Hadley. It \nwas taken out of the President's speech. This is October.\n  Between October and January, both the State Department and the CIA \nobtained copies of documents that purported to be a uranium ore \npurchase agreement between Iraq and Niger. As I heard, these documents \ncame from someplace in Italy. But the State Department determined the \ndocuments were probably a hoax.\n  So between October and January, there was even more reason to doubt \nthe credibility of these uranium ore claims. Nonetheless, when the \nPresident took the floor in the House Chamber to give his State of the \nUnion Message, what happened? Those claims were included in his speech.\n  Who was the person responsible for vetting, for clearing these kinds \nof statements in the President's State of the Union Message? Guess \nwhat, it was Stephen Hadley, the Deputy National Security Adviser. He \nwas in charge of vetting the national security issues for the \nPresident's State of the Union speech. This was the same person who \njust a couple of months before had received two memos and a personal\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\nphone call from Mr. Tenet, the head of the CIA, telling him these \nclaims were highly suspect. But these words made it into the \nPresident's State of the Union Message. Thus, the White House, in its \ndetermination to wage war, included information they knew to be \nquestionable to justify the war in Iraq.\n  Six months later, when Joseph Wilson questioned that information, two \nsenior White House officials undertook a campaign to destroy the career \nof his wife. Who would have known that Valerie Plame was married to \nJoseph Wilson? Maybe some in the CIA knew it. I don't know who else \nknew it. They had different names. She was deep undercover. She was not \ngiven diplomatic immunity. She was very deep undercover in the CIA.\n  In the process of blowing Ms. Plame's cover, these White House \nofficials cost the people of this country a 20-year investment in \nValerie Plame. They placed into jeopardy her entire network of contacts \nand CIA operatives. They caused the entire intelligence community to \nquestion whether they might be next and be exposed. Thus, they weakened \nthe reputation of this country at home and abroad.\n  Don't take my word for it; take the words of three former CIA high-\nranking officials. Vincent Cannistrano, former chief of operations and \nanalysis at the CIA counterterrorism center, said of the Plame \ndisclosure:\n\n       The consequences are much greater than Valerie Plame's job \n     as a clandestine CIA employee. They include damage to the \n     lives and livelihoods of many foreign nationals with whom she \n     was connected, and it has destroyed a clandestine cover \n     mechanism that may have been used to protect other CIA non-\n     official covered officers.\n\n  Or the words of James Marcinkowski, a former CIA operations officer, \nhe said:\n\n       The deliberate exposure and identification of Ambassador \n     Wilson's wife by our own Government was unprecedented, \n     unnecessary, harmful, and dangerous.\n\n  Larry Johnson, a former CIA analyst, said:\n\n       For this administration to run on a security platform and \n     to allow people in this administration to compromise the \n     security of intelligence assets I think is unconscionable.\n\n  No one listening to these three men could have any doubts about the \ndamage this act has done to our intelligence community and the extent \nto which this has weakened America.\n  We have seen that this administration has put relentless pressure on \nthe intelligence community to justify the war. I have been informed \nthat Vice President Cheney personally went to the CIA headquarters--\npersonally went across the river in Virginia to the CIA headquarters--\nat least eight times in the months when this intelligence data was \nunder review. The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the Vice \nPresident's office even prepared its own dossier of all the information \nthey thought should be used by the Secretary of State to justify the \nwar, much of which the State Department rejected.\n  My question is, what was Vice President Cheney doing visiting the CIA \nover eight times? This is unprecedented--unprecedented.\n  And my final question is this: Where is the same drive and \ndetermination by the President or the Vice President when it comes to \nfinding those responsible for the breach of national security this leak \ncaused?\n  The people who exposed Valerie Plame broke the law. Title 50 U.S.C., \nsection 421. It is very clear on this: Any person who has access to \nclassified information that identifies a covert agent shall be fined or \nimprisoned not more than 10 years or both.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the exact words of 50 U.S.C., section \n421, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Title 50.--War and National Defense\n\n\nchapter 15.--national security, protection of certain national security \n                  information, 50 usc Sec. 421 (2004)\n\n       Sec. 421. Protection of identities of certain United States \n     undercover intelligence officers, agents, informants, and \n     sources.\n       (a) Disclosure of information by persons having or having \n     had access to classified information that identifies covert \n     agent. Whoever, having or having had authorized access to \n     classified information that identifies a covert agent, \n     intentionally discloses any information identifying such \n     covert agent to any individual not authorized to receive \n     classified information, knowing that the information \n     disclosed so identifies such covert agent and that the United \n     States is taking affirmative measures to conceal such covert \n     agent's intelligence relationship to the United States, shall \n     be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned \n     not more than ten years, or both.\n       (b) Disclosure of information by persons who learn identity \n     of covert agent as result of having access to classified \n     information. Whoever, as a result of having authorized access \n     to classified information, learns the identity of a covert \n     agent and intentionally discloses any information identifying \n     such covert agent to any individual not authorized to receive \n     classified information, knowing that the information \n     disclosed so identifies such covert agent and that the United \n     States is taking affirmative measures to conceal such covert \n     agent's intelligence relationship to the United States, shall \n     be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned \n     not more than five years, or both.\n       (c) Disclosure of information by persons in course of \n     pattern of activities intended to identify and expose covert \n     agents. Whoever, in the course of a pattern of activities \n     intended to identify and expose covert agents and with reason \n     to believe that such activities would impair or impede the \n     foreign intelligence activities of the United States, \n     discloses any information that identifies an individual as a \n     covert agent to any individual not authorized to receive \n     classified information, knowing that the information \n     disclosed so identifies such individual and that the United \n     States is taking affirmative measures to conceal such \n     individual's classified intelligence relationship to the \n     United States, shall be fined under title 18, United States \n     Code, or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\n       (d) Imposition of consecutive sentences. A term of \n     imprisonment imposed under this section shall be consecutive \n     to any other sentence of imprisonment.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this law does not make any exceptions. It \ndoes not say, you can be fined or put in prison unless your spouse has \ngone against the administration's policy. It does not have that in \nhere. No one is excused, not even, in my opinion, Mr. Novak.\n  One year and 6 days later we are still waiting for some action to be \ntaken against those who broke the law. I have said repeatedly, if the \nPresident wanted to know the identity of these high-ranking officials, \nhe could have done so within 24 hours. Clearly, Mr. Bush does not want \nto know the identity of the leakers, and when he was asked about it, he \njust dismissed it out of hand, smiled about it, said: There are a lot \nof leakers, who knows, a lot of people in the administration, and he \njust brushed it off. Where is Mr. Bush's sense of outrage that two \npeople would do this and so weaken America's national security?\n  I think getting these answers means only one thing: The President of \nthe United States, Mr. Bush, the Vice President of the United States, \nMr. Cheney, should be put under oath and filmed at the same time and \ndeposed and asked these questions. One might say: Senator, that is an \nawful drastic step to be taken to put the President and Vice President \nunder oath. I remind my colleagues that just a very few years ago a \nformer President was put under oath and questioned under oath and \nfilmed, and we sat in this Chamber and watched on television sets the \ndeposition of former President Clinton when he was put under oath.\n  Regardless of how one may have felt about the impeachment one way or \nthe other, I think the fact that the President was put under oath and \nquestioned sent a signal very loudly and clearly to the people of this \ncountry: No one is above the law, not even the President of the United \nStates. If it was good enough for a former President, it is good enough \nfor this President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed the 5 \nminutes allocated to Senator Reid as well.\n  All time has expired on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct that we will now go to the \nMyers nomination?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8438-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:30 p.m. shall be equally divided for debate only between the \nchairman and the ranking member or their designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on this side I have how much time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 34\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, not long ago the Democratic leadership \nreached an agreement with the White House that both sides believed was \nreasonable and fair. Actually, it was the Democratic leadership, the \nRepublican leadership, and the White House. We agreed to hold votes for \n25 of the President's judicial nominees, including one that was so \ncontroversial that he received what might have been the highest number \nof ``no'' votes ever from both Republicans and Democrats for a \nconfirmed judge.\n  Now in return for those good-faith votes, the White House agreed not \nto make any more recess appointments of judges for the remainder of the \nPresident's term. So we fulfilled our end of the deal. When we were in \nthe majority during 17 months, we moved 100 of President Bush's \nnominees. In about 27 or 28 months, the Republican majority has moved \nanother 98 or 99. Of course, we brought up for consideration and agreed \nto consideration of all 25 of the judicial nominees we had agreed on \nwith the President.\n  Probably on the basis that no good deed goes unpunished, especially \nwith the most political, poll-driven administration I have seen in the \ntime I have been here, the day after the debate and this extremely \nclosely divided vote on the last of the group of those 25 judicial \nnominees, one many Republicans voted against, President Bush flew to \nNorth Carolina and then on to Michigan in an effort to politicize this \nissue anew. It appears that nominating and appointing his most \nideological, partisan slate of judicial nominees is not enough for this \nPresident.\n  Besting the confirmation record of Ronald Reagan, former President \nBush, and President Clinton does not satisfy him. The President \ncontinues to insist that every nominee, every nomination he makes to a \nlifetime, well-paying position, must be confirmed by the Senate because \nhe is President, making the nominations. This ignores the fact that \nthat has never been the case. Even President George Washington, the \nmost popular President in this Nation's history, saw the Senate reject \nhis nominees. President Franklin Roosevelt, who carried all but two \nStates in the country in his reelection bid, with a heavily Democratic \nSenate, saw them reject his court-packing plan.\n  Like the recent abuse of the Constitution for partisan political \npurposes, I believe the President is trying to turn the independent \nFederal judiciary into an arm of the Republican Party. He has \npoliticized the filling of judicial vacancies beyond anyone who \npreceded him and now we see he is exploiting this important \nPresidential authority as a campaign issue.\n  The independent Federal judiciary should not be an arm of the \nDemocrat party or the Republican Party, and the American people should \nnot fall for it. Facts are stubborn things. No amount of demagoguery \novercomes the facts. The Senate has now confirmed 198 judges.\n  We have objected to a small handful of the most extreme or \nunqualified nominees. The President uses sharp rhetoric about \n``activist judges,'' yet he nominates activist candidates from the far \nright wing of his party. When we have felt it necessary to draw the \nline at some of these candidates, we have done so to protect the rights \nof the American people from being undercut by partisan and ideological \nactivists. We have tried to ensure the independence of the federal \ncourts so that this Administration and its enablers in the Senate would \nnot successfully turn our courts into an arm of the Republican Party.\n  We have cut vacancies on the federal judiciary to one quarter of what \nRepublicans maintained during the Clinton Administration. Let me repeat \nthat: Today, vacancies are one fourth what they were when Republicans \nwere blocking dozens of President Clinton's judicial nominees. We have \neven reduced circuit court vacancies by more than 60 percent. \nBy contrast, under Republican Senate leadership during the Clinton \nAdministration, circuit court vacancies more than doubled from 16 to \n33. From the high of 110 vacancies in the federal system that \nRepublicans maintained during the Clinton Presidency, the federal \ncourts are now down to 27 vacancies. There are more active judges \nserving on the federal courts today than at any time in our nation's \nhistory.\n\n  Not that the facts will deter the President and Republican partisans \nduring this election year. This is another area on which this President \nhas been a divider and not a uniter, in spite of the promises he made \nduring his last campaign. Instead of working with us and uniting all \nAmericans and strengthening their confidence in our courts, he and his \nsupporters criticize the courts and attack the Senate for fulfilling \nits constitutional responsibilities and standing up to the most extreme \nof his nominees. The Senate has withheld consent only from the worst of \nhis nominees, but he insists on sending more nominees who divide the \nSenate and the American people.\n  The nomination before us on which the Republican leadership insists \nthe Senate devote three days is perhaps the most anti-environmental \njudicial nominee sent to the Senate. The nomination of William Myers to \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is an example \nof how this President has misused his power of appointment to the \nfederal bench. Mr. Myers is neither qualified nor independent enough to \nreceive confirmation for a lifetime appointment to this federal circuit \ncourt. His nomination is the epitome of the anti-environmental tilt of \nso many of President Bush's nominees.\n  Mr. Myers' hometown newspaper warned that as Solicitor at the \nDepartment of the Interior: ``Myers sounds less like an attorney, and \nmore like an apologist for his old friends in the cattle industry.'' He \nhas a record of extremism when it comes to his opposition to \nenvironmental protections, having gone as far as comparing the federal \ngovernment's management of public lands to ``the tyrannical actions of \nKing George'' over the American colonies and arguing that the \ngovernment is fueling ``a modern-day revolution'' in the American West.\n  Well, I come from a part of the country that fought a revolution to \noverturn the tyrannical power of King George, and even though I may \ndisagree with this administration, I do not liken this or any other \nadministration to the tyrannical rule of King George.\n  I have carefully reviewed the record Mr. Myers has logged in private \npractice and in the Bush administration. I asked him a series of \nquestions at his hearing in February and later in writing after that \nhearing. We gave Mr. Myers every opportunity to be heard and to make \nhis case that he would be a fair and impartial adjudicator if he is \nconfirmed to the Federal bench. Unfortunately, the only conclusion I \nhave been able to arrive at is that if he is confirmed he would be an \nanti-environmental activist on the bench. He has a consistent record of \nusing whatever position and authority he has had to fight for corporate \ninterests at the expense of the environment and at the expense of the \ninterests of the American people in environmental protections.\n  For 22 years, Mr. Myers has been an outspoken antagonist of long-\nestablished environmental protections, usually wearing the hat of a \npaid lobbyist for industry. At his hearing, he attempted to defend his \nanti-environmental statements and actions by saying he was just acting \nas an attorney, ``on behalf of his clients.'' This is not a case of a \nrepresentation of a defendant in a single case. He has chosen this \ncareer for which he has been amply rewarded both monetarily and by \npositions in the Bush administration.\n  An attorney also has a duty to follow the law and, on more than one \noccasion, Mr. Myers' advocacy has pushed the limits of the law. As The \nNew York Times editorialized, Mr. Myers ``regularly took positions \nthat, though legally insupportable, would have had a\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\ndevastating impact on the environment.''\n\n  As the chief lawyer at the Department of the Interior, Mr. Myers \ndisregarded the law in order to make it easier for companies to mine on \npublic lands--a position consistent with his prior role lobbying for \nmining interests while he was in private practice. He interpreted the \nmining law in a way that would have allowed the reversal of Secretary \nBabbitt's rejection of a permit for Glamis Mining Co. on land in the \nSoutheastern California desert. Fortunately, an independent review by a \nfederal court concluded that Mr. Myers' interpretation was wrong. The \ncourt called into question his ability to interpret a statute as he \nviolated ``three well-established canons of statutory construction.'' \nIn addition, he acted without government-to-government consultation \nwith the Quechan Indian Nation, a federally-recognized tribe, or other \nColorado River Tribes, before taking action to imperil their sacred \nplaces.\n  As Solicitor General at the Interior Department, Mr. Myers encouraged \ntwo Northern California congressmen to sponsor legislation that would \nhave given a private firm eight acres of valuable federal land in Yuba \nCounty, CA. Recognizing that the government did not have the right to \nturn over the land without compensation, he told the landowners that \nthe ``department would support private relief legislation'' to \naccomplish that goal. The Department has since withdrawn its support \nfor the private relief bill after its own agents produced readily \navailable documents that conclusively proved that the government owned \nthe land.\n  Mr. Myers' record on the environment would raise serious concerns no \nmatter where he would be sitting as a judge. However, it is especially \ndisturbing given the court to which he has been nominated. William \nMyers has been nominated to a circuit court with jurisdiction over an \narea of the country which contains hundreds of millions of acres of \nnational parks, national forests and other public lands, tribal lands, \nand sacred sites. Judges on the Ninth Circuit decide legal disputes \nconcerning the use and conservation of many of the most spectacular and \nsacred lands in America and often make the final decision on critical \nmining, grazing, logging, recreation, endangered species, coastal, \nwilderness, and other issues affecting the nation's natural heritage. \nThese judges are also the arbiters on treaty, statutory, trust \nrelationship, and other issues affecting American Indian tribal \ngovernments, Native Americans, and Alaska Native groups. The Ninth \nCircuit plays an enormous and pivotal role in interpreting and applying \na broad range of environmental rules and protections that are important \nto millions of Americans, and to future generations of Americans.\n  At Mr. Myers's hearing, I raised concerns over what might be at stake \nif he were to be confirmed. At stake is the longstanding acceptance of \nthe Constitution's commerce clause as the source of congressional \nauthority to enact safeguards to protect our air, water, and land. In \nSolid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, Mr. Myers submitted an amicus brief arguing that the \nCommerce Clause does not support the United States Army Corps of \nEngineers' jurisdiction over isolated, intrastate waters on the basis \nthat they are or have the potential to be migratory bird habitat. Mr. \nMyers' position raises concerns whether his extremely narrow view of \nthe scope of the Constitution's commerce clause would undermine our \nnation's environmental, health, safety, labor, disability and civil \nrights laws.\n  At stake are environmental protections which can be struck down if \ntaxpayers do not pay polluters, according to the extreme expansion of \nthe takings clause that some judges have begun to adopt. Mr. Myers has \ntaken this extreme view by arguing that property rights should receive \nthe same level of constitutional scrutiny as free speech. His position \nraises concerns that he will interpret as ``takings'' the very laws \nimplemented by Congress to protect our lands and our environment.\n\n  At stake is the true meaning of the Constitution's Eleventh Amendment \nand the right of citizens to sue to enforce environmental protections. \nIn an era of ballooning government deficits and cuts in environmental \nenforcement budgets, there is much at stake if courts eliminate or \nminimize the critical role of ``private attorneys general'' who are \nneeded to ensure that polluters are complying with federal mandates. \nMr. Myers has even argued that judges should take a more active role in \nreducing lawsuits brought by environmentalists by requiring non-profit \nenvironmental organizations to post a bond for payment of costs and \ndamages that could be suffered by any opposing party. He wrote: \n``Environmentalists are mountain biking to the courthouse as never \nbefore, bent on stopping human activity wherever it may promote health, \nsafety and welfare.'' These positions raise concerns that plaintiffs in \nhis courtroom who are members of environmental organizations will not \nbe treated fairly.\n  For the last four years, the Bush administration has systematically, \nand often stealthily, set out to undermine the basic safeguards that \nhave been used by administrations of both parties to protect the \nenvironment. One way the Bush administration has demonstrated its \ncontempt for our nation's environmental laws is in the court system. A \nDefenders of Wildlife study covering the Administration's first 2 years \nnoted how its agencies argued in court. Amazingly, in cases where the \nAdministration had a chance to defend the National Environmental \nProtection Act (NEPA), more than 50 percent of the time it presented \narguments in court which would weaken NEPA. Similarly, the \nAdministration argued to weaken the Endangered Species Act (ESA) more \nthan 60 percent of the time.\n  Despite the Administration's arguments against the environmental laws \nit is entrusted with protecting, and despite the deference customarily \npaid to Executive agencies in federal court, the independent federal \njudiciary, thus far, has generally upheld our longstanding \nenvironmental laws. The courts ruled against the Administration's \narguments to weaken NEPA 78 percent of the time, and ruled against the \nAdministration's arguments to weaken the ESA an astounding 89 percent \nof the time. Further illustrating how important the judiciary has \nbecome for environmental protection, especially in the absence of a \ncommitment to environmental protection by Executive agencies, the \nLeague of Conservation Voters for the first time included a vote on a \njudicial nominee on its 2003 scorecard of Senate votes. In the past \nyear, our federal courts resisted efforts to weaken the Clean Water \nAct, the Clean Air Act, and the Endangered Species Act. The courts \nprotected our National Monuments from challenges by extremist groups \ntrying to strip them of their status, upheld air conditioning standards \nwhich save energy and money for consumers, and stopped Administration \nrollbacks that benefited industry at the expense of our forests. The \nresult of these court decisions is that our vital wetlands and rivers \nare not decimated, diverse species are protected from extinction, and \nthe standards for air quality are brought into compliance with the law.\n  There are, however, dark clouds on the horizon. There are cases \npending where the outcomes could affect whether our air is threatened \nby toxic chemicals and whether our water and health are threatened by \npollution and pesticides. There are cases pending whether to allow \nsnowmobiles in our National Parks, whether to allow the Administration \nto open up 8.8 million acres of important wildlife habitat and hunting \nand fishing grounds in Alaska for oil and gas leasing, whether pumping \ndirty water into the Everglades violates the Clean Water Act, and \nwhether the Administration can open our nation's largest National \nForest to logging.\n\n  How will these cases be decided? Will the federal courts continue to \nstand as a bulwark against the administration's assault on \nenvironmental protection? Consider that in two recent cases, judges \nappointed by President Bush dissented, arguing against environmental \nprotections. In one case, a Bush-appointed judge indicated that he \nmight find the Endangered Species Act unconstitutional, and, in the \nother case, a Bush judge would have ruled to make it harder for public \ninterest groups to prevent irreparable environmental harm through \ninjunctive relief\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\nwhile claims are pending. What if President Bush succeeds in appointing \nmore like-minded judges and these Bush judges become the majority next \ntime, positioned to strike down vital environmental protections? This \nis the type of judicial activism against established precedent that \nPresident Bush says he deplores, but he nominates and appoints judges \nwho engage in wholesale judicial activism.\n  The Bush administration has already proposed more rollbacks to our \nenvironmental safeguards, aiming to benefit industry at the expense of \nthe public's interest in clean air and water, our public lands, and \nsome of our most fragile wildlife populations. While today we have a \nFederal judiciary which has in many instances prevented this \nadministration's attempts to roll back important environmental laws and \nprotections, in the future we may not be so fortunate. Today, the \nappellate courts in this country have tilted out of balance with \nRepublican appointees already in control of 10 of the 13 circuit \ncourts. The American people expect good stewardship of the nation's \nair, water and public lands, and the American people deserve that. \nJudges have a duty to enforce the protections imposed by environmental \nlaws. The Senate has a duty to make sure that we do not put judges on \nthe bench whose activism and personal ideology would prevent fair and \nimpartial adjudication and would circumvent environmental protections \nthat Congress intended to benefit the American people and generations \nto come.\n  An editorial in The Boston Globe recognized: ``When the White House \nis in the clutches of the oil, coal, mining, and timber companies, as \nit is now, the best defenders of laws to protect the environment are \noften federal judges.'' The editorial concludes that if the Senate \nconfirms William Myers, ``the judicial check in this administration's \nunbalanced policies will be weakened.''\n  For almost his entire 22-year legal career, Mr. Myers has worked in \nWashington--in political positions for Republican Administrations and \nas a lobbyist. He received a partial ``Not Qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association--the ABA's lowest passing grade. He has \nminimal courtroom experience--having never tried a jury case and having \nnever served as counsel in any criminal litigation. It seems clear that \nWilliam Myers was nominated not for his fitness to serve as a lifetime \nmember of the federal judiciary but rather as a reward for serving the \npolitical aims of the administration.\n  When Mr. Myers was appointed to his legal post at the Department of \nthe Interior, some described it as putting a fox in charge of the \nhenhouse. Another metaphor that comes to mind is the revolving door \nthat is emblematic of so many of this administration's appointments, \nespecially to sensitive environmental posts. Mr. Myers' Interior \nappointment was the first ``swoosh'' of the revolving door. His \nnomination by President Bush to one of the highest courts in the land \ncompletes the cycle. Mr. Myers is one of several nominees who have come \nbefore us because they are being awarded lifetime appointments to the \nfederal courts based not primarily on their qualifications for the \noffice, but as part of a spoils system for those who are well connected \nand have served the political aims of the Bush administration.\n\n  So many of President Clinton's judicial nominees upon whom the Senate \ntook no action seemed to have been penalized for their government \nservice or for having supported the President. Elena Kagan, James \nLyons, Kent Markus and so many others never received hearings, and \ntheir nominations were defeated through Republican inaction and \nobstruction, without explanation. With a Republican President, Senate \nRepublicans have reversed their field and position. We have already \nconfirmed to lifetime appointments a number of Administration and \nRepublican-connected candidates, including Judge Prost, Judge \nMcConnell, Judge Cassell, Judge Shedd, Judge Wooten, Judge Chertoff, \nJudge Hudson, Judge Clark, and Judge Bybee. At this point in a \npresidential election year, in accordance with the Thurmond Rule, only \nconsensus nominees being taken up with the approval of the majority and \nminority leaders and the chairman and ranking members of the Judiciary \nCommittee should be considered. Mr. Myers is no such nominee. In 1996, \nthe last time a President was seeking reelection, the Senate Republican \nmajority refused to confirm any judges to the circuit courts. Not one \nwas considered and confirmed that entire session. In contrast, this \nyear we have already proceeded to confirm five additional circuit \njudges.\n  The list of those who are deeply concerned about, and who have felt \ncompelled to oppose this nomination has been long and it continues to \nlengthen. More than 175 environmental, Native American, labor, civil \nrights, disability rights, women's rights and other organizations have \nsigned a letter opposing Mr. Myers' confirmation to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. The National Congress of American Indians, a \ncoalition of more than 250 tribal governments, unanimously approved a \nresolution opposing Mr. Myers' nomination. The National Wildlife \nFederation, which has never opposed a judicial nomination by any \nPresident in its 68-year history, wrote:\n\n       Mr. Myers has so firmly established a public record of open \n     hostility to environmental protections as to undermine any \n     contention that he could bring an impartial perspective to \n     the issues of wildlife and natural resource conservation that \n     come before the court. Indeed, Mr. Myers is distinguished \n     precisely by the ideological rigidity that marks his \n     positions on these issues.\n\n  A letter from the California Legislature, signed by the Senate \nPresident Pro Tem, the Chair of the Senate Natural Resources Committee, \nand the Chair of the Senate Environmental Quality Committee, strongly \nopposing Mr. Myers' nomination, told the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Mr. Myers' record as Interior Solicitor of favoring the \n     interests of the grazing and mining industries over the \n     rights of Native Americans and the environment, coupled with \n     his long history as an extreme advocate for those industries, \n     cause serious doubts on his willingness or ability to put \n     aside his personal views in performing his official duties.\n\n  I have great regard for the Senators from Idaho. I have affection for \nthe former Senator from Wyoming who was my colleague on the Judiciary \nCommittee for many years and who I consider a friend. In deference to \nthem, I have examined Mr. Myers' record and asked myself whether I \ncould support this nomination. Regrettably, I cannot.\n  If you watch what the Bush administration does, instead of just \nlistening to what it says, there is much evidence of this \nadministration's outright contempt for high environmental standards. \nThis nomination, in itself, says something about that.\n  I hope that the Senate's vote today will say something about the \nhigher priority that the Senate makes of environmental quality.\n  I must oppose Mr. Myers' confirmation.\n  Also, we know under the Thurmond rule he can't even be confirmed \nwithout the agreement of the Republican leader, the Democratic leader, \nthe chairman, and myself.\n  We have come to a time when we can't get our budget done. We can't \npass veterans appropriations or homeland security. We can't do these \nthings because we don't have time, and yet we are wasting time on \nsomething everyone knows will go nowhere.\n  I must oppose Mr. Myers' nomination.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Before yielding to me, would the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from Vermont inform me and the Senate \nthe number of nominees of the Bush administration to date who have been \napproved by the Senate and the number of those who have been \ndisapproved?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would note that we have approved, first, \n100 in the 17 months that we, the Democrats, were in charge of the \nSenate.\n  In the next 21, 22, 23 months, however long it was that the \nRepublicans were in charge, another 98 were confirmed.\n  I don't think a single one was defeated on the Senate floor. A small \nnumber had been held back--I think about one-tenth of what the \nRepublican majority held back during the Clinton Presidency.\n  Actually, I might say to my friend from Illinois, we have confirmed \nmore than we did during President Reagan's first term when, of course, \nyou had a Republican Senate throughout his term. For that matter, we \nconfirmed\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\nmore than President George H.W. Bush.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield, if I am not mistaken, \nwe have approved 198 nominees from the Bush administration, and only 6 \nhave not been approved to date?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does that number meet the Senator's recollection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, and one highly contentious one went through. He had \nthe most negative votes, of both Democrats and Republicans, of any \nnominee in history because of the extreme positions he had taken.\n  I yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nWilliam Myers to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  William Myers is a successful lawyer and a passionate advocate. If I \nowned a mining company or a ranch and I needed a lobbyist, Mr. Myers \nwould be the first person I would call. But I have concerns about \nwhether Mr. Myers can walk away from a lifetime of lobbying for these \nspecial interests and be fair as a judge on the Nation's second highest \ncourt.\n  His loyalty to the grazing and mining industries and to ranchers has \nbeen undivided and passionate. He has advanced their agenda, whether on \na private payroll or working for the Government.\n  For example, in a case from my home state of Illinois, Solid Waste \nAgency of Northern Cook County v. United States Corps of Engineers, Mr. \nMyers argued on behalf of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association \nthat Federal regulation of certain land use was beyond the commerce \nclause power of Congress because that area is traditionally regulated \nby State and local governments. Mr. Myers' narrow reading of the \ncommerce clause, if followed through, could jeopardize essential \nhealth, safety, environmental, and antidiscrimination laws.\n  In another Supreme Court case, Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of \nCommunities for a Great Oregon, Mr. Myers argued, on behalf of the \nNational Cattlemen again, that:\n\n     . . . the constitutional right of a rancher to put his \n     property to beneficial use is as fundamental as his right to \n     freedom of speech or freedom from unreasonable search and \n     seizure.\n\n  He argued that the freedom claimed by a rancher to use his property \nwas equivalent to our freedom of speech under the Constitution. This is \nan argument that would make any cowboy blush. Mr. Myers should have \nknown better. He should have known that the Supreme Court has held that \nonly a very limited number of rights are so fundamental, such as \nfreedom of speech and the right to privacy. Mr. Myers' celebration of \nproperty rights is reminiscent of the Lochner decision, an era of court \nlaw when property and economic rights trumped almost all others. All \nbut the most radical thinkers have rejected this ancient, discredited \nview. Mr. Myers lovingly embraces it.\n  The Ninth Circuit is a crucial battleground circuit. It hears a great \nmany cases pitting property rights against environmental regulation. I \nhave searched in vain for any evidence--any evidence--that Mr. Myers \ncould rule on such cases with an open mind. I can't find it.\n  In a 1998 article entitled ``Litigation Happy,'' Mr. Myers expressed \nconcerns about environmental litigation. These are his words:\n\n       Environmentalists are mountain biking to the courthouse as \n     never before, bent on stopping human activity wherever it may \n     promote health, safety and welfare.\n\n  End of quote from nominee Myers.\n  He wrote another article in which he compared the Federal \nGovernment's management of public lands to King George's tyrannical \nrule of the American colonies, and he claimed that public land \nsafeguards are fueling ``a modern-day revolution'' in the West.\n  Mr. Myers has stated that many environmental laws have ``the \nunintended consequence of actually harming the environment.''\n  He has denounced the California Desert Protection Act, a significant \nenvironmental law that was passed in 1994, thanks to the leadership of \nour colleague, Senator Dianne Feinstein. Mr. Myers calls that \nparticular law ``an example of legislative hubris.'' In his hearing he \nacknowledged his remark was a ``poor choice of words,'' and we all \nappreciated his honesty. But as the San Francisco Chronical put it:\n\n       Poor choices of words seem to be the rule, not the \n     exception, in Myers' career.\n\n  President Bush rewarded Mr. Myers for his track record of advocacy by \nappointing him to be the top lawyer at the Department of Interior in \n2001. While there, he formulated several important policy changes that \nfavored the industries that he traditionally represented in public \nlife. He issued a controversial legal opinion that prevented the \nvoluntary retirement of Federal grazing permits. These voluntary \nretirements had enjoyed bipartisan political support, but they were \nopposed by the grazing industry. He also wrote a legal opinion \noverturning the policy of the Clinton administration and allowed for \nmining of the 1,600-acre Glamis open-pit gold mine.\n  This decision was strongly opposed by the Quechan Indian Nation \nbecause the mining violates their sacred lands.\n  Because of his role in the Glamis project, Mr. Myers' nomination has \nbeen opposed by the National Congress of American Indians, the first \ntime this organization of 500 tribes has ever opposed a judicial \nnominee.\n  In addition, he has been opposed by virtually every major \nenvironmental group, including the National Wildlife Federation, which \nhas never opposed a judicial nominee in its history.\n  The final concern I have about Mr. Myers is his minimal courtroom \nexperience. He is seeking a spot on the second highest court of the \nland and comes to this nomination with extremely limited experience in \na courtroom. Mr. Myers' exposure to the courtroom has apparently been \nlimited to watching the second half of ``Law and Order.''\n  He has never handled a case that went before a jury in 23 years of \nlegal practice. He has participated in only three trials and he has no \ncriminal litigation experience whatsoever. His lack of legal experience \nmay explain why Mr. Myers received the ABA's lowest passing grade: \n``majority qualified'' and ``minority not qualified.''\n  I believe President Bush can do better by this circuit. I don't think \nMr. Myers should receive a lifetime appointment to the second highest \ncourt in the Nation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded \n5 minutes from the time of the minority.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues here \ntoday.\n  I rise in strong opposition to the confirmation of William Myers. \nWhen the nine Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee unanimously \nvote against a nominee, you can be sure that there are real questions \nabout the nominee that must be answered. We rarely do it.\n  Once again to reiterate, 198 judges approved, 6 opposed. Why are we \ntrying to make Mr. Myers the seventh? Is it some lobbying group? Not at \nall. Is it the fact we just do not agree with his views? Clearly not.\n  The bottom line is that Mr. Myers is extreme on environmental issues \nand on land issues. And these issues are important where the Ninth \nCircuit probably has much more to say than any other circuit in the \nland, given the vast territory out west that it covers.\n  Mr. Myers is one sided and extreme. There has been no balance. There \nhas been no attempt to see the other side. There has been no attempt to \nbe judicious in the true sense of the word. That is why so many of us \nfeel constrained to rise against him.\n  Nominating William Myers is like sticking a thumb in the eye of all \nSenators who believe extremists, right or left, should not be on the \nFederal bench.\n  The bottom line is very simple; that is, Mr. Myers has not shown a \nsingle iota of moderation as he has moved through his career. He has \nnot been a judge or somebody who has had judicial experience. But that \ndoesn't bother me. It bothers some. It doesn't bother me.\n  The problem is Mr. Myers' record screams ``passionate activist.'' It \ndoesn't so much as whisper ``impartial judge.''\n  Let us go over some of the things my colleague, Mr. Durbin, \nmentioned. I\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\nwill elaborate on some of those. It is not just that Mr. Myers has \nspent almost every day of his career as a professional lobbyist \nadvocating for mining and ranching interests to the detriment of \nenvironmental concerns. It is how he has done it. There is never an \nunderstanding that the other side has any merit.\n  The bottom line here is what he said: ``Environmentalists are \nmountain biking''--that was snide--``to the courthouses, never before \ndone, stopping human activity wherever it may promote health, safety, \nand welfare.''\n  Human activity that pollutes the air or water? This man comes from \nsuch a narrow mindset that it is clear he doesn't belong on the bench.\n  The cases he was discussing when he said that included suits to halt \nthe discriminatory placement of waste treatment facilities, protection \nof irrigation canals from toxic chemicals, and to stop logging in \nprotected national forests.\n  Again, he shows such little tolerance for the other viewpoint that \none doesn't have much faith that he can be an impartial judge.\n  When it comes to the environment, it seems like confirming William \nMyers would be like putting the fox in charge of the environmental hen \nhouse.\n  If one remark were an isolated incident, you could say, well, one \nremark shouldn't stop someone from being a judge. But he said the Clean \nWater Act has the unintended consequence of actually harming the \nenvironment. Who in America believes that? Some people--very few--may \nsay it goes too far. But that it harms the environment?\n  He argues that it is fallacious to believe the central government can \npromote environmentalists.\n  Let me tell Mr. Myers something. In New York City where I live my \nlungs are cleaner because the Federal Government has a Clean Air Act. \nMaybe he doesn't need one in Idaho, but they sure need one in Los \nAngeles which is in the Ninth Circuit.\n  And the intolerance to say that the central government can never \npromote environmentalism--he has compared the Government's management \nof public lands to King George's tyrannical rule over the American \nColonies.\n  I guess that kind of selfish freedom--you own the land and you can do \nwhatever you want with it--is Mr. Myers' view. It is not America's \nview. This man has continued to have that view.\n  He said that professional environmentalists are primarily interested \nin fundraising and the selling of magazine subscriptions. Do we want to \nsay the Cattlemen's Association is only interested in making money no \nmatter what happens? What would the Cattlemen's Association or a \nrancher who is trying to do a good job think of that?\n  Mr. Myers' comments are hardly reflective of the moderation and \ntemperament we look for from judicial nominees. His lack of \nunderstanding and intolerance come across over and over and over again.\n  When it comes to comments about the environment, Mr. Myers is like \nthe Energizer bunny: He just keeps on going and going.\n  Earlier this year, the Buffalo News ran an editorial against his \nnomination, saying in part:\n\n       The Bush administration is showing an Oz-like talent for \n     turning over protect-the-environment posts to former \n     lobbyists who once sought to overturn the rules they are now \n     being charged with keeping.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  This is just another example of the Bush Administration saying one \nthing and doing another. They say they care more about the environment \nand then they nominate anti-environmentalists to defend it.\n  With Mr. Myers' nomination, we are not just through the looking \nglass; we are all the way down the rabbit hole.\n  I wish we didn't have rise today and vote no but I think we are \ncompelled to. I urge my colleagues to reject this nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield such time as he needs to the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you very much, Mr. President, I thank the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for yielding me this time.\n  It is my honor to stand here in strong support of the nomination of \nWilliam G. Myers to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Contrary to the remarks we have just heard, former Solicitor of the \nInterior, William G. Myers is a highly respected attorney who has had \nextensive experience in the field of natural resources, public lands, \nand environmental law. His nomination enjoys widespread support from \nacross the ideological and political spectrum.\n  Mr. Myers has been nominated to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nwhich covers the States of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, \nMontana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, as well as Guam and the \nNorthern Mariana Islands. He has a distinguished career serving on the \nissues that are critical to these States.\n  From July 2001 to October of 2003, Mr. Myers served as Solicitor of \nthe Interior, the chief legal officer and third ranking official of the \nDepartment of the Interior. In that capacity, he was supervisor over \n300 attorneys in 19 offices across the country and managed a $47 \nmillion annual budget, and provided advice and counsel to the Secretary \nof the Interior, as well as to the Department's offices and bureaus.\n  He was confirmed by the Senate as Solicitor of the Interior by \nunanimous consent. At that time, these arguments that are now being \nbrought forward simply were absent from the floor.\n  The reason is because Mr. Myers' strong service is respected across \nthe political spectrum.\n  Before coming to the Department of Interior, Mr. Myers practiced at \none of the most respectable law firms in the Rocky Mountain region, \nwhere he participated in an extensive array of Federal litigation \ninvolving public lands and natural resource issues. Some of the attacks \non him are attacks made against him because of positions he took on \nbehalf of clients, something which Members across the board in this \nSenate have said is not the appropriate way to judge whether a person \nwill, as a judge, take a balanced view.\n  An advocate in the courtroom is different than a judge. One should \nnot be judged in their professional qualifications when they are \nserving as an advocate, as is being done to Mr. Myers today.\n  From 1992 to 1993, Mr. Myers served in the Energy Department as the \nDeputy General Counsel for Programs, where he was the Department's \nprincipal legal adviser on matters pertaining to international energy, \nGovernment contracting, civilian nuclear programs, power marketing, and \nintervention and State regulatory proceedings.\n  He served as Assistant to the Attorney General of the United States \nfrom 1989 to 1992. In this capacity, he prepared the Attorney General \nfor his responsibilities as Chairman of the President's Domestic Policy \nCouncil.\n  Before entering the Justice Department, Mr. Myers served over 4 years \nas legislative counsel for one of our former colleagues, Senator Alan \nSimpson of Wyoming, where he was Senator's Simpson principal adviser on \npublic lands issues. Mr. Myers is a nationally recognized expert in \nnatural resource law and public lands law. He served as vice chairman \nof the Public Lands and Land Use Committee of the American Bar \nAssociation, the section on environmental and energy and resources. In \nhis home State of Idaho, Mr. Myers chaired Idaho State Board of Land \nCommissioners, Federal Lands Task Force Working Group, and the Boise \nMetro Chamber of Commerce State Affairs and Natural Resources \nSubcommittee.\n  He is an avid outdoorsman and committed conservationist. For the past \n15 years, he served as a volunteer for the National Park Service and \nover that span has logged at least 180 days of volunteer service in \nnumerous parks, performing trail work, campsite cleaning, visitor \nassistance, and park patrols.\n  He has widespread support, as I indicated, from across the political \nspectrum. Again, contrary to the comments made in the Senate today, Mr. \nMyers has the balanced demeanor to be an excellent Federal judge.\n  Former Democratic Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus, who also served as \nSecretary of the Interior in the Carter administration, supports Mr. \nMyers. He stated that Mr. Myers possesses ``the necessary personal \nintegrity, judicial temperament and legal experience, as\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\nwell as the ability to act fairly on matters of law that will come \nbefore him on the court.''\n  In addition, former Democratic Governor of Wyoming, Mike Sullivan, \nwho also served as a U.S. Ambassador to Ireland under the Clinton \nadministration, endorses Mr. Myers. He calls Mr. Myers a thoughtful, \nwell-grounded attorney who has reflected, by his career achievements, a \ncommitment to excellence, and states that Mr. Myers would provide \nserious responsible and intellectual consideration to each \nmatter before him as an appellate judge and would not be prone to \nextreme or ideological positions unattached to legal precedence or the \nmerits of a given matter.\n\n  Mr. Myers is backed by every member of the Idaho congressional \ndelegation and 15 State attorneys general, including three Democratic \nattorneys general--Ken Salazar from Colorado, Drew Edmondson from \nOklahoma, and Patrick Crank from Wyoming--who strongly support Mr. \nMyers. These chief law enforcement officers from their States say Mr. \nMyers would bring to the Ninth Circuit strong intellectual skills \ncombined with a strong sense of civility, decency, and respect for all.\n  Two former Attorneys General of the United States support Mr. Myers, \none Republican and one Democrat. Former Attorney General William P. \nBarr states that Mr. Myers represents the epitome of judicial \ntemperament and would do a great job, while former Attorney General \nDick Thornburgh calls Mr. Myers exceptionally well-qualified to serve \nas a member of the Federal judiciary.\n  There have been some attacks made against Mr. Myers today to which I \nwill briefly respond. As I said earlier, many of the attacks made \nagainst him are for positions he took advocating on behalf of clients \nor on behalf of an employer when he was working in the Department of \nthe Interior or in other capacities.\n  Some groups claim that Mr. Myers did not adequately protect the \nenvironment as the Solicitor of the Interior. The record simply belies \nthis argument. As Solicitor of the Interior, Mr. Myers vigorously \nfought to safeguard the environment and conserve natural resources. Mr. \nMyers sought to protect this country's lands and national parks and \nmonuments. The list I have in front of me is extensive, listing actions \nhe has taken as the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior to \npreserve and protect the incredible environmental resources which we \nhave in this Nation.\n  He is also recognized for protecting indigenous animals as well as \nthe environment and supported an agreement removing dams from the \nPenobscot River, in what conservationists called the biggest \nrestoration project north of the Everglades. His involvement in working \non wolf issues and on issues regarding nesting sites of endangered \nbirds to protect them from harassment of bird watchers has been \nsignificantly noted. He has a very proconservationist leaning.\n  Mr. Myers fought to protect our Nation's waters and to ensure the \nNation was adequately compensated for the private use of natural \nresources. Again, he has been attacked in the Senate today for his \ndefense of private property rights by those who do not want to see a \nbalance brought back to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Myers \nhas defended reasonable interpretations of the Outercontinental Water \nRoyalty Relief Act to ensure that oil and gas companies did not enjoy \nunjustified windfalls through royalty-free activity and supported \nrecord royalty recoupment against Shell Oil Company regarding natural \ngas in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  This shows when there are actions taken by those who would harm the \nenvironment, he is prepared and ready to step forward. Yes, he does \nprotect private property rights. He has a belief that private property \nprotection means something in this country. He recognizes the value \nof private property in our Constitution and in our system of government \nin America. For that, he is being criticized in the Senate today.\n\n  We should be glad to have a nominee to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals who will help us bring some sense of balance back to that \ncourt. Our colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, who just debated, \nstated last year on the nomination of Jay Bybee that the Ninth Circuit \nis by far the most liberal of any court in our country. Most of the \nnominees are Democrats and from Democratic Presidents. It is the Ninth \nCircuit that gave us the Pledge of Allegiance case, which is way out of \nthe mainstream on the left side. Mr. Myers would bring some \nconservative balance back to that Ninth Circuit court, it is true. \nFrankly, I personally believe one of the reasons he is being so \nstrongly objected to in the Senate today is because there are many who \ndo not want to see that balance brought back to the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals.\n  Finally, I conclude by discussing a little bit more the \nqualifications of Bill Myers. I know him personally. As has been \nstated, he is from Idaho. He has shown throughout his legal career that \nhe can be a fierce, strong, eloquent advocate for those who were his \nclients and for those who were his employers. His effectiveness in \nadvocating on behalf of his clients and his employers is now being \nutilized against him. If that were done to other nominees, as it has \nbeen done to some nominees, very few who were eloquent, strong \nadvocates as attorneys or who were strong public servants serving as \nattorneys in the public service of our country would be able to pass \nthrough this Senate. We could find quotations in their briefs, \nquotations in their statements and in their advocacy which we could use \nin an isolated way to say they were taking too strong a stand.\n  The reality is, those who know him--Idaho Democratic Governor Cecil \nAndrus, Wyoming Democratic Governor, the Democratic Attorneys General \nwho have worked with him--have given the true picture of Bill Myers. He \nis a man who with passion fights for that in which he believes but who \nhas the ability, the skill, and the demeanor as a judge to stand in \njudgment with balanced reference to the precedent that comes before \nhim. He would be an outstanding addition to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I encourage all Members in the Senate to vote to give him a \nchance to have his nomination considered.\n  In conclusion, let's remember what the vote is that we are having \ntoday. The vote we are having today is not on the nomination of Mr. \nMyers; it is on the effort to get cloture on the filibuster of his \nnomination.\n  We are voting today to answer the question of whether he is entitled \nto a vote on his nomination--something that, until this Congress, has \nalways been allowed on someone who was put out of the Judiciary \nCommittee and brought to the floor of the Senate. Never, before this \nCongress, has a nominee sent from the Judiciary Committee to the floor \nof the Senate been denied a vote on their nomination. Yet today we see, \nfor the seventh time in this Congress, an honorable person who is \nnominated, and has made it all the way to the floor of this Senate, \nbeing threatened with the denial of even a vote on their nomination.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to afford Mr. Myers the kind of \nopportunity that all persons before him--until this Congress--have been \nallowed to have; and that is, a vote on his nomination to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming be granted up to 5 minutes, and \nimmediately following him, the distinguished Senator from Idaho be \ngranted up to 5 minutes of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  I come to the floor to speak on behalf of Bill Myers because of his \nactivity in Wyoming and his work in Washington, working with a former \nSenator from Wyoming. But after hearing what was said on the other side \nof the aisle, I am particularly inclined to share a little bit about \nBill Myers and the fact that he would bring some balance to the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  Fortunately, Wyoming is not in the Ninth Circuit, but I am concerned \nthere would be someone there who has\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\ndealt with public lands issues, who has dealt with the kinds of issues \nwe deal with in the West, and who has done so very successfully.\n  So I support Bill Myers' nomination to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. He has had a distinguished career in public service and as a \npracticing attorney, as well as being Solicitor of the Interior \nDepartment. He was confirmed by the Senate unanimously to that job as \nSolicitor, which is a very difficult task, of course.\n  He is nationally recognized as an expert on natural resources and the \nuse of natural resources and issues that are of particular importance \nto the West and the Ninth Circuit area. So I am not going to continue \nwith his credentials. Our friends from Idaho know more about that than \nI, and they have talked about his qualifications.\n\n  But, unfortunately, western issues disqualify him for Idaho's only \nseat on the Ninth Circuit Court. That is a shame because there is \nnothing more important overall than natural resource kinds of issues. \nSo I guess the court will not have a person with that kind of \nexperience, but, rather, this floor will keep the citizens of Idaho \nfrom having someone there to represent them in those areas that are so \nimportant. I certainly feel badly about that kind of position.\n  There has been discussion that he is not supported by any Democrats. \nThat is not the case. I have a statement from the Honorable Michael \nSullivan, former Democratic Governor of Wyoming:\n\n       Mr. Myers has a wealth of legal experience in the private \n     practice, in Washington, and in the areas of public lands and \n     the environment. Those are areas of extreme importance to the \n     country and those of us in the West, and it is my view that \n     Bill's experience would serve the Court and the Circuit well. \n     . . . He is, in my view, an individual who would provide \n     serious, responsible, and intellectual consideration to each \n     matter before him as an appellate judge and would not be \n     prone to extreme or ideological positions unattached to legal \n     precedent or the merits of a given matter.\n\n  So I rise to say we have observed the activities of Bill Myers in the \nWest. Certainly, from all the activities he has been involved in, he \nhas done so well. It is my belief he should go on to this court. But, \nmore importantly, in terms of process, he certainly ought to have an \nopportunity to have a vote on the floor of the Senate. So I urge that \nbe the case this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \nvisiting with us about Bill Myers and his qualifications.\n  I was on the Senate floor yesterday and made my full statement on \nbehalf of Bill Myers. I spoke this morning in opening remarks, but I \ndid want to make a few additional comments before the chairman of the \ncommittee, once again, revisits the nomination of Bill Myers.\n  On the Senate floor this morning, I said I believed there was a \nselective, concerted effort on the part of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle to pick nominees and block a vote against them for \nthe purpose of the filibuster and ultimately knowing they can kill \nthese nominees because we cannot get to the 60-vote requirement or \nthreshold they have provided us.\n  I made that statement this morning. I was told, very frankly, by a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee on the other side, that when Mr. \nMyers was voted out, he would not be confirmed. Why? Because they were \ngoing to use him to demonstrate before their environmental \nconstituencies that he was their token, and they would bring him down.\n  Bill Myers does not deserve that kind of treatment for a variety of \nreasons. My colleague from Idaho has expressed them very clearly, as \nhave I, that in his private life he was a good attorney and an advocate \nfor his clients.\n  But here is what Bill Myers said in the committee hearing that I \nchaired in his behalf when we were considering his nomination. He said:\n\n       [W]hen a person takes on those robes--\n\nMeaning the robes of a judge of the Ninth Circuit--\n\n     takes the oath of office, swears to uphold the Constitution, \n     that means they will follow the law and the facts, wherever \n     the law and the facts take them, without regard to personal \n     opinion, public opinion, friends or foes.\n\n  To me, that sounds like a gentleman of judicial temperament who \nunderstands the appropriate role of a judge, as some who have come to \nthe floor who are Senators, and were attorneys in other lives, also \nunderstand the appropriate role of an advocate, an attorney for a \nclient. Yet Mr. Myers is criticized today because he was a good \nattorney for a client. It was because he was a good attorney that the \nPresident of the United States said: This man will make a good judge in \nthe Ninth Circuit. And now he is criticized for it.\n  The minority leader, after I had spoken this morning, said: Well, \nSenator Craig voted to not allow cloture on a judge of the Ninth \nCircuit before. I did. I did exactly what the minority leader said I \nhad done. And the man's name was Richard Paez. That was in 2000. He was \na nominee for the Ninth Circuit by President Clinton. I voted against \ncloture, and I lost. And why I lost is that it was not an organized \n``party'' effort of the kind we now see demonstrated on the floor of \nthe Senate today, that has openly and directly refused the right of \nseven people to have a vote on the floor.\n  I voted against Mr. Paez because I am a constituent of the Ninth \nCircuit, and I thought he would be a liberal, activist judge. I did \nsomething else. I voted to delay indefinitely a vote on Richard Paez. I \nlost. Why did I lose? Because it was not an organized ``party'' effort \non this side of the aisle, as is the vote we will see at 2:15 this \nafternoon. I voted against confirming Richard Paez and I lost.\n  But the point here is clear: Richard Paez got his vote on the floor \nof the Senate. He was not denied a vote, as now the Democrat leader and \nhis colleagues have decided to deny Bill Myers a vote. That is a fact. \nAnd the minority leader needs to know it. He needs to know that Richard \nPaez was not organized against. Up-or-down votes: I lost; Richard Paez \nwon.\n  Now, I was not wrong in my vote. Richard Paez has now been on the \nNinth Circuit bench for at least 3 years. He is an activist, liberal \njudge. And I was right about reviewing him.\n  He still got his vote. He still got his judgeship because a majority \nof the Senate said Richard Paez should serve in our advise and consent \nrole under the Constitution. We advised the President of the United \nStates on behalf of his nominee and he was confirmed.\n  I will talk about one other item I think is important. We are all \nentitled to our own opinions, but not to our own facts. We can all look \nat facts differently. I want to talk for a few moments about ABA \nratings. I remember the American Bar Association ratings of nominees \nused to be called the ``gold standard.'' If you didn't get a top \nrating, my goodness, you were not, nor should be, considered. Let me \ntalk about those briefly.\n  The other side was saying Mr. Myers doesn't have the right rating. \nWell, they also riled and railed against Miguel Estrada and Priscilla \nOwen and, by the way, they had top ABA ratings. Have they already \nforgotten the very principles they applied to somebody else? You cannot \nreverse them in a 48-hour period and apply them in a different way to \nsomebody else. I am sorry, you can be entitled to your own opinions, \nbut you ought not to be entitled to your own facts.\n  As we each consider the weight of ABA ratings and what they should \ncarry, let me remind this body that Mr. Myers' rating places him among \nan impressive group of individuals. Among the names of those who \nreceived similar ABA ratings, we find judicial nominees like Judge \nRichard Posner, arguably one of this generation's most prolific and \nimpressive court of appeals judges, who was described by Supreme Court \nJustice William Brennan as one of the two geniuses he had ever met. \nWell, Bill Myers is in that category. Not bad. Other nominees included \nJudge Frank Easterbrook, Stephen Williams, James Buckley, Jerry Smith, \nand Laurence Silberman. No one familiar with their impressive \nexperience, credentials, and legal acumen can honestly question these \njudges' fitness for the Federal bench. Yet Mr. Myers' ratings and \ntheirs are the same.\n  Isn't it interesting how it can be so arbitrary and one can choose \nand pick based on one's opinions? I cannot criticize my colleagues on \nthe other side. They are entitled to their own opinions. But they are \nnot entitled to their own facts.\n  Finally, let me remind you that during the Clinton administration \nthis\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\ncommittee voted out and the Senate confirmed 3 circuit court and 15 \ndistrict court nominees who had ABA ratings identical to Mr. Myers' \n``majority qualified; minority not qualified'' ratings. In August, \nSeptember, and October of 1994, this committee even voted out three \ndistrict court nominees who had ``majority not qualified'' ABA ratings, \nand all three judges were confirmed. These nominees include Roger \nGregory, confirmed on a 93-1 vote, who now serves in the Fourth \nCircuit; Julio Fuentes, confirmed by a 93-0 vote. The reason that \nhappened is because, at that time in the history of the Senate, we \nrecognized the importance of the debate and we also recognized an up-\nor-down vote. What we did not see was a concerted party effort on \nselectively picked nominees for political purposes and denying them \ntheir right to a vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 8 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to briefly make a point in rebuttal \nto the statement by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle, this \nmorning.\n  The minority leader seems to be trying to justify his obstruction of \nan up or down vote on Bill Myers by pointing to some in our caucus who \nvoted against cloture on two very liberal Ninth Circuit judges whom the \nSenate confirmed without a filibuster in election year 2000. Just \nstating the facts makes it clear that there is no justification for the \nDemocrats' obstruction. But let me also point out. Unlike their \nleadership, Republican leadership made sure that those two liberal \nnominees, now committed leftist activists on the Ninth Circuit, were \nnot filibustered. They got up or down votes because the vast majority \nof us thought that filibusters of judicial nominees were completely out \nof order in the U.S. Senate.\n  These liberal activist judges, now issuing their often-reversed \nedicts from San Francisco, received up or down votes in this Senate in \nan election year. Bill Myers deserves no less.\n  I think it's important to get on record exactly what's happened here \nwith Bill Myers' nomination. We originally asked for 5 or 6 hours of \ndebate; Democrats objected. We settled on 4 hours of debate, equally \ndivided, during yesterday's session, and not a single Democrat came to \nthe Senate Floor to debate. It is puzzling to me why those who oppose \nhim so vehemently did not come to the floor, stand up and defend their \nobjections. It seems to me that if Senators can't defend their \nobjections to a nominee, they certainly shouldn't object to an up or \ndown vote. I appreciate that today we have at least heard some of their \narguments, though I think they are not reflective of this qualified \nnominee nor his outstanding record.\n  So I want to return to what this debate is about, or at least what it \nshould be about. While this nomination has been hijacked by another \nunparalleled filibuster--the seventh nominee to be subjected to this \nunprecedented form of obstruction--it should have been about the \nqualifications of Bill Myers to be a Ninth Circuit judge. And in that \nrespect, let me remind my colleagues, that Bill Myers' nomination to \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is supported by a wide, bipartisan \nrange of individuals and organizations, particularly those who value \nexpertise in Western land use issues.\n  Let me provide just a few examples from several support letters \nreceived by the Judiciary Committee:\n  The Farm Bureau Federations of California, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, \nthe Oregon Cattlemen's Association, the Oregon Forest Industries \nCouncil, the Oregon Wheat Growers League, the Oregon Women for \nAgriculture, and eight additional county farm and stock grower bureaus \nin Oregon, among others, wrote on February 18, 2004:\n\n       Mr. Myers' background and legal career provide enormous \n     experience that could only serve to benefit the citizens of \n     the [Western United States]. His professional history shows \n     clear leadership skills in resolving many complex issues. It \n     is clear that Mr. Myers has an ability to analyze problems \n     and make rational decisions that conserve our national \n     heritage while at the same time move us forward in a \n     responsible manner. Time and again he has shown a capacity to \n     set aside the rhetoric and to objectively evaluate the \n     respective interests of the parties involved. . . . Our \n     organization and membership has found, whether through first \n     hand experience or simply as interested observers, that Mr. \n     Myers conducts himself with integrity, competence, \n     professionalism and an unprecedented respect for the law.\n\n  The Tulalip Tribes of Washington State wrote on March 9, 2004:\n\n       The Tulalip Tribes [write] to support the nomination of \n     [Bill Myers]. . . . We find that he has a balanced record [of \n     defending] the interest of Native Americans. The [Ninth \n     Circuit] is in need of an appointment by an individual \n     experienced and knowledgeable in Federal Indian Law.\n\n  And the Attorney Generals of South Dakota, North Dakota, Delaware, \nHawaii, Nevada, Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Ohio, Oklahoma, Wyoming, \nPennsylvania, Virginia, Utah, and Guam wrote on January 30, 2004:\n\n       As Attorneys General, we observed that Mr. Myers, while \n     dutifully representing his client, the federal government, \n     always maintained an objectivity and practical understanding \n     of the conflicting demands relating to those interests. In \n     our view, his thorough understanding of relevant legal \n     precedents, decisions and key policy interests and his \n     outstanding legal reasoning as Solicitor demonstrate his keen \n     intellect, sound judgment and the skills suitable to the \n     bench. . . . [W]e appear before the Circuit Courts of Appeal \n     with considerable frequency. Clearly, we value judges who \n     display a temperament that is even-handed, respectful and \n     thoughtful--the temperament displayed by Mr. Myers. Mr. Myers \n     would bring to the Ninth Circuit strong intellectual skills, \n     combined with a strong sense of civility, decency and respect \n     for all.\n\n  Now, while such endorsements from these types of people--farming and \nranching organizations, Indian tribes who do not have ideological axes \nto grind with the Department of the Interior, and 15 state Attorneys \nGeneral--may not matter much to Senate Democrats, they do to me, and to \nmost Westerners.\n  They matter to Senators Craig and Crapo, whose state will effectively \nlose its representation on the Ninth Circuit by means of a stealth \nfilibuster. This is grossly irresponsible and unworthy of the U.S. \nSenate. They matter to a majority of Senators who stand ready to vote \nand confirm Bill Myers to a Ninth Circuit that so badly needs \nqualified, non-activist judges who respect the law and the \nConstitution.\n  Let me just talk about the process here of confirming judges. We have \nconfirmed 198 judges so far, which I might add, is fewer than President \nClinton's first term. Yet some of my colleagues think that the \nconstitutional duty to advise and consent has a time clock attached to \nit and that the time has run out for the Senate to do its duty. I \nreject this analysis, either that the previous agreement to allow the \nvote on the 25 judges was the sum total of our work in the Senate; or \nthe notion that judicial nominations cannot be confirmed after some \nmythical deadline is announced.\n  There are plenty of examples of confirmations of judges in \nPresidential election years during the fall, some which occurred after \nthe election was held. Stephen Breyer, confirmed to the First Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, is just one example. I know, I was one who helped \nbring that about. Under the Senate Democrats theory, the remaining 25 \njudges pending before the Senate should be dismissed out of hand. This \nis not logical, nor is it the proper approach to take under the \nConstitution.\n  So it appears that the Democrats' newest tool of obstruction takes \nthe form of a stealth filibuster. Sure, we object, my colleagues say, \nbut we are not going to bother to explain to the American people why. \nTo the Senator whose States are in the Ninth Circuit--Senators Craig \nand Crapo, Senator Smith, Senator Ensign, Senators Stevens and \nMurkowski, Senators Kyl and McCain, Senator Burns--guess what? You are \ntold by Senate Democrats that they are not going to allow you to vote \non this nominee, that you need for the Ninth Circuit, and that the \nposition papers of the extreme environmental groups that have distorted \nthe record of and attacked Bill Myers for over a year should adequately \nexplain their opposition and basis for refusing a vote.\n  Yesterday, I said that Senators should ask themselves, Is this vote \non Bill Myers really about Bill Myers? It is clear that this cloture \nvote, this denial of an up-or-down vote, is not about Bill Myers. It \nis, in fact, nothing more\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\nthan a reflection of special interest group disdain for policies \nfavored by farmers, ranchers, miners, the Bush Interior Department, or \nanyone else who advocates balanced uses of Federal lands. It is, as \nSenator Sessions put it so well yesterday afternoon, a demonstration of \nthe conceit of the elite, that Senate Democrats refuse to allow an up-\nor-down vote.\n  Bill Myers has been nominated to the Ninth Circuit, but I want to \nemphasize that the impact of this vote--or the Democrat minority's \nobstruction of an up-or-down vote--will be felt not only in the States \nwithin the Ninth Circuit, but throughout the West, as Senator Enzi so \neloquently emphasized yesterday afternoon.\n  And it is, quite simply, a slap in the face to those farmers, \nranchers, miners, and others who make their livings off of the public \nand private lands of our Western States to say that because a nominee \nhas represented their interests, he does not even deserve a fair vote \nin the Senate. And, almost silently now, he is filibustered because he \nis too extreme to sit on a Ninth Circuit with a demonstrated record of \nleftist judicial activism.\n  Such a position is untenable, objectively, and I predict it will play \neven more poorly in the West. Let me read a recent letter to the \neditor, which was sent by a representative of South Dakota farmers and \nranchers to that State's largest newspapers:\n\n                                            Rapid City Journal and\n\n\n                                                 Argus Leader,\n\n                                  Belle Fourche, SD, July 9, 2004.\n\n                           Support Nomination\n\n       Agriculture producers in South Dakota and throughout our \n     great country need elected representatives who understand our \n     needs and respond to them. An important issue is currently \n     before the U.S. Senate and Sen[ator] Daschle, the nomination \n     of Bill Myers to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     We urge Sen[ator] Daschle to support the interests of South \n     Dakota agriculture producers by allowing an up or down vote \n     on the merits of the nomination on the floor of the Senate.\n       The Ninth Circuit issues many important decisions on \n     resource use and environmental matters. Much of the \n     opposition to Mr. Myers has been by environmentalists who \n     have not liked his representation of people who make their \n     living from the land in the West, including ranching \n     interests in particular.\n       South Dakota producers would be well-served by having \n     someone with direct knowledge of their concerns sitting on \n     the Ninth Circuit, helping to set environmental legal policy \n     for the entire country.\n       We hope Sen[ator] Daschle will hear our call and allow the \n     Myers nomination to come to a full vote in the Senate. We are \n     constantly reminded how powerful the minority leader position \n     is. Bill Myers deserves a vote by the full Senate.\n\n                                                 Chance Davis,\n\n                                           President, South Dakota\n                                             Public Lands Council.\n\n  Indeed, I do hope that Senate Democrats hear this call. I hope they \nlistened to Senators Craig, Sessions and Enzi yesterday, when they were \ntoo busy to even engage in a reasoned debate about why they insist on \nobstructing a qualified nominee.\n  In closing, the Senate should show the Constitution some respect by \nvoting up or down on Bill Myers' nomination. I urge my colleagues to \nreject the filibuster of judicial nominations now and in the future, \nreject the smears of the extremist special interest groups who have \npoisoned this process. I urge my colleagues to support the cloture \nmotion and allow the Senate to do its duty and vote up or down on the \nnomination.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Biden is in the Chamber. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand I have roughly 8 minutes; is \nthat correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be granted 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                   Responding to the Crisis in Darfur\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Senator DeWine and I have introduced a bill \nto address the atrocities and human rights abuses inflicted by the \nGovernment of Sudan upon its citizens living in the western region of \nDarfur.\n  By now you are aware of the terrible violence being perpetrated \nagainst civilians by the Government of Sudan and its allied militias in \nDarfur, Sudan. As many as 30,000 black Africans have been killed. Rape \nhas routinely been used as a weapon of war by the Sudanese Government's \njanjaweed militia proxies. The Government of Sudan has obstructed the \ndelivery of humanitarian assistance--as a result, over 300,000 people \nare expected to die of disease and malnutrution. Entire villages have \nbeen razed to the ground. Crimes against humanity have and are taking \nplace with frightening regularity. Any reasonable person would agree \nthat at the very least, we are witnessing ethnic cleansing. However, I \nbelieve that what we are actually seeing is genocide, and that the \nburden of proof should be on those who deny that such is the case.\n  Secretary of State Powell visited Darfur at the end of June. I \napplaud him for going. His visit as well as that of United Nations \nSecretary General Kofi Annan served to shine a much needed \ninternational spotlight on Khartoum's brutal actions.\n  However, I am disappointed in the actions taken by the administration \nin the wake of the Secretary's visit.\n  The administration is circulating a draft United Nations Security \nCouncil resolution which puts sanctions on the janjaweed. I do not \nthink pursuing a resolution which would impose an arms and travel \nembargo on the janjaweed will improve the security situation in Darfur. \nI am sure there must be a strategy behind this resolution, but on its \nface, it is hard to see. The janjaweed is not a state actor. It is not \neven an independent actor. It certainly is not accepting arms shipments \nfrom foreign governments. The janjaweed is armed and supplied by the \nGovernment of Sudan. And last I heard the only place the janjaweed has \ntraveled is across the border into Chad to further harass its victims. \nI was not aware that militia members applied for visas to do so. So I \nwould like to know what exactly the thought process behind pursuing \nsuch sanctions is.\n  I would also like to know just why the administration does not \nbelieve the Genocide Convention has been triggered. Article II of the \nConvention defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with \nthe intent to destroy, in whole or substantial part, a national ethnic, \nracial or religious group: killing members of the group; causing \nserious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately \ninflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about \nits physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures \nintended to prevent births within the group; or forcibly transferring \nchildren of the group to another group.\n  Let's consider what we know to be the case in Darfur and compare it \nto the criteria set out in the Convention.\n  Is there an intent to destroy a national ethnic racial or religious \ngroup? A U.N. interagency fact finding team found in April that while \nvillages populated by black Africans were destroyed, villages in the \nsame area populated by Arabs were undisturbed. In some cases the \nvillages that were left undisturbed were less than 500 meters away from \nthose that were bombed and burned to the ground, its residents \nmurdered, raped or tortured, its wells poisoned, its food stores and \ncrops destroyed. This seems to me to be a pretty profound indicator \nthat black Africans are being deliberately targeted. The scorched earth \npolicy of the janjaweed makes it virtually impossible for those who \nlive through the attacks to survive. One can reasonably assume that \nthey were not meant to.\n  We know that the Government of Sudan, through it janjaweed proxies, \nhas murdered an unknown number of people--perhaps 30,000--because of \ntheir ethnicity.\n  We also know that the militia has caused serious bodily and mental \nharm to black Africans in Darfur. According to the Convention only one \nor the other is necessary to qualify as genocide, but the janjaweed and \nthe Sudanese military have done both. As a recent Washington Post \narticle points out, the text of which I ask unanimous consent be \nprinted in the Record, the janjaweed have engaged in widespread \nsystematic rape in an effort to populate Darfur with Arab babies.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 30, 2004]\n\n `We Want to Make a Light Baby'; Arab Militiamen in Sudan Said To Use \n                   Rape as Weapon of Ethnic Cleansing\n\n                             (By Emily Wax)\n\n       Geneina, Sudan, June 29.--At first light on Sunday, three \n     young women walked into a scrubby field just outside their \n     refugee camp in West Darfur. They had gone out to collect \n     straw for their family's donkeys. They recalled thinking that \n     the Arab militiamen who were attacking African tribes at \n     night would still be asleep. But six men grabbed them, \n     yelling Arabic slurs such as ``zurga'' and ``abid,'' meaning \n     ``black'' and ``slave.'' Then the men raped them, beat them \n     and left them on the ground, they said.\n       ``They grabbed my donkey and my straw and said, `Black \n     girl, you are too dark. You are like a dog. We want to make a \n     light baby,' '' said Sawela Suliman, 22, showing slashes from \n     where a whip had struck, her thighs as her father held up a \n     police and health report with details of the attack. ``They \n     said, `You get out of this area and leave the child when it's \n     made.' ''\n       Suliman's father, a tall, proud man dressed in a flowing \n     white robe, cried as she described the rape. It was not an \n     isolated incident, according to human rights officials and \n     aid workers in this region of western Sudan, where 1.2 \n     million Africans have been driven from their lands by \n     government-backed Arab militias, tribal fighters known as \n     Janjaweed.\n       Interviews with two dozen women at camps, schools and \n     health centers in two provincial capitals in Darfur yielded \n     consistent reports that the Janjaweed were carrying out waves \n     of attacks targeting African women. The victims and others \n     said the rapes seemed to be a systematic campaign to \n     humiliate the women, their husbands and fathers, and to \n     weaken tribal ethnic lines. In Sudan, as in many Arab \n     cultures, a child's ethnicity is attached to the ethnicity of \n     the father.\n       ``The pattern is so clear because they are doing it in such \n     a massive way and always saying the same thing,'' said an \n     international aid worker who is involved in health care. She \n     and other international aid officials spoke on condition of \n     anonymity, saying they feared reprisals or delays of permits \n     that might hamper their operations.\n       She showed a list of victims from Rokero, a town outside of \n     Jebel Marra in central Darfur where 400 women said they were \n     raped by the Janjaweed. ``It's systematic,'' the aid worker \n     said. ``Everyone knows how the father carries the lineage in \n     the culture. They want more Arab babies to take the land. The \n     scary thing is that I don't think we realize the extent of \n     how widespread this is yet.''\n       Another international aid worker, a high-ranking official, \n     said: ``These rapes are built on tribal tensions and \n     orchestrated to create a dynamic where the African tribal \n     groups are destroyed. It's hard to believe that they tell \n     them they want to make Arab babies, but it's true. It's \n     systematic, and these cases are what made me believe that it \n     is part of ethnic cleansing and that they are doing it in a \n     massive way.''\n       Secretary of State Colin L. Powell flew to the capital, \n     Khartoum, on Tuesday to pressure the government to take steps \n     to ease the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. U.S. officials \n     said Powell may threaten to seek action by the United Nations \n     if the Sudanese government blocks aid and continues \n     supporting the Janjaweed. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan \n     is due to arrive on Khartoum this week.\n       The crisis in Darfur is a result of long-simmering ethnic \n     tensions between nomadic cattle and camel herders, who view \n     themselves as Arabs, and the more sedentary farmers, who see \n     their ancestry as African. In February 2003, activists from \n     three of Darfur's African tribes started a rebellion against \n     the government, which is dominated by an Arab elite.\n       Riding on horseback and camel, the Janjaweed, many of them \n     teenagers or young adults, burned villages, stole and \n     destroyed grain supplies and animals and raped women, \n     according to refugees and U.N. and human rights \n     investigators. The government used helicopter gunships and \n     aging Russian planes to bomb the area, the U.N. and human \n     rights representatives said. The U.S. government has said it \n     is investigating the killings of an estimated 30,000 people \n     in Darfur and the displacement of the more than 1 million \n     people from their tribal lands to determine whether the \n     violence should be classified as genocide.\n       The New York-based organization Human Rights Watch said in \n     a June 22 report that it investigated ``the use of rape by \n     both Janjaweed and Sudanese soldiers against women from the \n     three African ethnic groups targeted in the `ethnic \n     cleansing' campaign in Darfur.'' It added, ``The rapes are \n     often accompanied by dehumanizing epithets, stressing the \n     ethnic nature of the joint government-Janjaweed campaign. The \n     rapists use the terms `slaves' and `black slaves' to refer to \n     the women, who are mostly from the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa \n     ethnic groups.''\n       Despite a stigma among tribal groups in Sudan against \n     talking about rape, Darfur elders have been allowing and even \n     encouraging their daughters to speak out because of the \n     frequency of the attacks. The women consented to be named in \n     this article.\n       In El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, about 200 miles \n     east of Geneina, Aisha Arzak Mohammad Adam, 22, described a \n     rape by militiamen. ``They said, `Dog, you have sex with me,' \n     '' she said. Adam, who was receiving medical treatment at the \n     Abu Shouk camp, said through a female interpreter that she \n     was raped 10 days ago and has been suffering from stomach \n     cramps and bleeding. ``They said, `The government gave me \n     permission to rape you. This is not your land anymore, abid, \n     go.' ''\n       Nearby, Ramadan Adam Ali, 18, a frail woman, was being \n     examined at the health clinic. She was pregnant from a rape \n     she said took place four months ago. She is a member of \n     the Fur tribe and has African features.\n       ``The man said, `Give me your money, slave,''' she said, \n     starting to cry. ``Then I must tell you very frankly, he \n     raped me. He had a gun to my head. He called me dirty abid. \n     He said I was very ugly because my skin is so dark. What will \n     I do now?''\n       In Tawilah, a village southeast of El Fasher, women and \n     children are living in a musty school building. They said it \n     was too dangerous to leave and plant food.\n       Fatima Aisha Mohammad, once a schoolteacher, stood in a \n     dank classroom describing what happened to her three weeks \n     ago, when she left the school to collect firewood.\n       ``Very frankly, they selected us ladies and had what they \n     wanted with us, like you would a wife,'' said Mohammad, 46, \n     who has five children. ``I am humiliated. Always they said, \n     `You are nothing. You are abid. You are too black.' It was \n     disgusting.''\n       During a recent visit, government minders warned people at \n     the school to stop talking about the rapes or face beatings \n     or death. Minders also were seen handing out bribes to keep \n     women from speaking to foreign visitors. But those at the \n     school spoke anyway. A group of people handed a journalist \n     two letters in Arabic that listed 40 names of rape victims, \n     and wanted the list to be sent to Sen. Sam Brownback of \n     Kansas and Rep. Frank R. Wolf of Virginia, Republicans who \n     were touring the region and pressing the government to disarm \n     the Janjaweed.\n       ``I was sad. I am now very angry. Now they are trying to \n     silence us. And they can't,'' Mohammad said. ``What will \n     people think of all of us out here? That we did this to \n     ourselves? People will know the truth about what is happening \n     in Darfur.''\n       Later that day in Tawilah's town center, Kalutum Kharm, a \n     midwife, gathered a crowd under a tree to talk about the \n     rapes. Everyone was concerned about the children who would be \n     born as a result.\n       ``What will happen? We don't know how to deal with this,'' \n     Kharm lamented. ``We are Muslims. Islam says to love children \n     no matter what. The real problem is we need security. We \n     don't trust the government. We need this raping to stop.''\n       Aid workers and refugees in Geneina said that despite an \n     announcement last week by Sudan's president, Lt. Gen. Omar \n     Hassan Bashir, that the Janjaweed would be disarmed, security \n     had not improved. Janjaweed dressed in military uniforms and \n     clutching satellite phones roamed the markets and the fields, \n     guns slung over their shoulders. Last week, the Janjaweed \n     staged a jailbreak and freed 13 people, aid workers said. \n     They also killed a watermelon salesman and his brother \n     because they did not like their prices, family members of the \n     men said.\n       A government official, speaking with a reporter, described \n     the rapes as an inevitable part of war and dismissed \n     accusations by human rights organizations that the attacks \n     were ethnically based.\n       In Geneina, two women told their stories while sitting in \n     front of their makeshift straw shelter. One of the women, a \n     thin 19-year-old with dead eyes, moved forward.\n       ``I am feeling so shy but I wanted to tell you, I was raped \n     too that day,'' whispered Aisha Adam, the tears rushing out \n     of her eyes as she covered her face with her head scarf. \n     ``They left me without my clothing by the dry riverbed. I had \n     to walk back naked. They said, `You slave. This is not your \n     area. I will make an Arab baby who can have this land.' I am \n     hurting now so much, because no one will marry me if they \n     find out.''\n       Sitting on mats outside the shelter, Sawela Suliman's \n     father talked with village elders about what to do if his \n     daughter became pregnant.\n       ``If the color is like the mother, fine,'' he said as a \n     crowd gathered to listen. ``If it is like the father, then we \n     will have problems. People will think the child is an Arab.''\n       Then his daughter looked up.\n       ``I will love the child,'' she said, as other women in the \n     crowd agreed. ``But I will always hate the father.''\n       Then the rains came. They pounded onto the family's frail \n     shelter, turning their roof into a soggy and dripping clump \n     of straw. Suliman started to shiver as the weather shifted \n     from steaming hot to a breezy rain. She will no longer leave \n     the area of her hut to collect straw. She will stay here, \n     hiding as if in prison, she said, and praying that she is not \n     pregnant.\n\n   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the article, which appeared on the \nfront page of the Post on Wednesday, June 30, a woman tells of how she \nand other women were gang raped by six janjaweed militia men as they \nwent out to gather fuel for fire. ``They grabbed my donkey and my straw \nand said `Black girl, you are too dark. You are like a dog. We want to \nmake a light baby. . . .' '' They said ``You get out of this area and \nleave the child when it's made.'' If that isn't inflicting mental and \nbodily harm on a group, what is?\n  We know for a fact that the Government of Sudan has prevented the \ndelivery of humanitarian aid such that, as I\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\nmentioned before, over 300,000 people--black Africans--will probably \ndie. I would say that qualifies as deliberately inflicting on the group \nconditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction \nin whole or in part.\n  I can not speak to the final two elements. I have not yet heard that \nthe Government or janjaweed have imposed measures intended to prevent \nbirths within the group or forcibly transferred children of the group \nto another group. However, the Convention does not require that all \nfive acts be committed. Any one of the acts qualify as genocide.\n  Let me make one thing perfectly clear. I completely agree with the \nSecretary Powell that we must urgently meet the needs of the people of \nDarfur regardless of whether what is happening is genocide. And the \nGenocide Convention makes clear that we are to prevent, suppress and \npunish the crime. So whether one believes what is happening is actual \nor potential genocide, we are obligated to act.\n  However, I also believe it is imperative that we acknowledge what is \ngoing on. Failure to call the crime what it is and respond fosters a \nsense of impunity, and emboldens the bad actors in other parts of the \nworld to carry out these sorts of atrocities. I do not believe that the \nargument I and others are making about whether or not what is going on \nis genocide is academic, or misses the point about the necessity of \nhelping those suffering in Sudan.\n  U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan visited Darfur at the end of June \nas well. The United Nations and the Government of Sudan issued a joint \ncommunique in which the Government agreed to allow unfettered access of \nassistance and to disarm the janjaweed. The bill Senator DeWine and I \nhave introduced puts pressure on Khartoum to make good on the promises \nit has made.\n  The bill requires the President to certify 30 days from its enactment \nand every 90 days thereafter whether or not the Government of Sudan has \nmade credible, sincere and genuine efforts to demobilize and disarm the \njanjaweed, and allowed truly free access to Darfur, without using red \ntape as a way to prevent aid delivery.\n  The Government is subject to three different types of sanctions 120 \ndays after the bill becomes law unless that certification is made. \nFirst, senior members of the military and Government in Khartoum as \nwell as their families will have any U.S. held assets frozen, and be \ndenied entry into the United States. Second, prohibitions on assistance \nin this year's appropriations bill will remain in place beyond the end \nof the fiscal year.\n   Finally, unless the President issues this certification, the \nsanctions that are part of the original Sudan Peace Act are triggered: \nOur representatives to the multilateral development banks are directed \nto use their voice and vote to oppose any loans to Sudan. The President \nis asked to consider downgrading our diplomatic representation to \nSudan, and directed to seek a UN Security Council Resolution to impose \nan arms embargo on Sudan and to deny Khartoum oil revenue.\n  As a further means of pressuring the Government of Sudan, the bill \ntakes the extra steps of prohibiting the normalization of relations \nbetween the Government of Sudan and the United States and the \ndisbursement of any U.S. funds to support a comprehensive north-south \nagreement unless the President certifies in six months the Government \nof Sudan has stopped attacking civilians, demobilized and disarmed the \njanjaweed, ceased harassing aid workers, and cooperated with the \ndeployment of the African Union ceasefire monitoring team. And for \nevery 6 months the government of Sudan continues its reign of terror in \nDarfur, the amount that otherwise would have been available to support \nthe north-south peace agreement--$800 million--is reduced by $50 \nmillion.\n  Perhaps the most important piece of this bill is an authorization for \n$200 million to provide much needed relief for the people of Darfur. \nThe money is offered with no strings attached. The needs on the ground \nin Darfur and Chad are urgent and we must respond quickly and robustly \nwithout conditions or caveats.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this bill, as it provides both help \nfor Sudanese civilians affected by war in western Sudan and an \nincentive for Khartoum to stop the violence and allow the international \ncommunity to assist the victims of what our own Government has called \nthe world's worst humanitarian crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the United States Senate has now confirmed \nmore than 170 of President Bush's judicial nominees. The nomination the \nSenate is considering today--that of William G. Myers III for a \nlifetime seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit--is different from many because of both the background and \nexperience of the nominee and the direct and lasting influence the \nnominee's decisions will have on Oregon and her citizens. This \nnominee's rulings will affect the fate of environmental and other \nsafeguards in nine western States, including Oregon.\n  After a career as a grazing and mining industry lobbyist, Mr. Myers \nworked as Solicitor General for the Department of Interior, responsible \nfor Indian Affairs and most Federal lands. In his position at the \nDepartment of Interior, Mr. Myers continued to advocate for his former \nclients, overturning precedent to allow mining on sacred Indian grounds \nand rendering a decision in direct response to a case he participated \nin as a lobbyist. Not only has Mr. Myers refused to recuse himself from \ncases where there may be a conflict of interest, he has limited \njudicial experience. He received a partial Not Qualified rating from \nthe American Bar Association and has minimal courtroom experience. He \nhas never tried a jury case and never been involved as counsel in any \ncriminal ligation. Unfortunately, Mr. Myers has demonstrated neither \nthe experience nor judicial temperament to qualify him for this \nposition.\n  As a result of his performance as Solicitor General, at least 180 \ngroups have come out in opposition to his nomination. Among those \nopposing his nomination are every major tribe in this Nation--including \nthe Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, the Cow Creek, Warm Springs, \nand Umatilla tribes all from Oregon, and the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians, which represents over 250 tribes nationwide, as well \nas Oregon groups such as the Oregon Natural Resources Council. The \nOregonian just published an editorial today, which may have said it \nbest: ``Myers' anti-environmental activism by itself shouldn't \ndisqualify him. The problem--and this gets back to his lack of judicial \nexperience--is that he has no track record whatsoever to show how he \nwould separate his ideology from his interpretation of the law on the \nNation's second-highest court.''\n  Mr. President, I take very seriously the Senate's role to advise and \nconsent to the President's nominations, and in this instance, the facts \nrequire that I withhold my consent on this nominee.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose \nthe nomination of William Myers to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit, and to vote no on the motion to close debate. I \ncame to my decision after a careful review of Mr. Myers' professional \nrecord. That review has convinced me that he is not the proper person \nto serve on this highly influential Federal court of appeals, which \noversees all Federal litigation in my home State of California.\n  I met with William Myers and I found him to be an extremely polite \nand personable man. But I have serious reservations about whether he \nhas the professional qualifications to serve on the Ninth Circuit. I \nalso have serious doubts about his ability to rule on cases, \nparticularly environmental and land-use cases, in an impartial, even-\nhanded way.\n  A position on the appellate court should be reserved for our Nation's \nbest legal minds and most accomplished attorneys. But, the American Bar \nAssociation gave Mr. Myers a partial ``not qualified'' rating. A key \nfactor was his lack of legal experience.\n  This nominee has little litigation experience in either State or \nFederal court. By his own account, he has taken only a dozen cases to \nverdict--and six of those occurred before 1985 when he was a newly \nminted lawyer. He has never served as a counsel in criminal litigation. \nEven as Solicitor of the Department of Interior, Myers had no role in \nwriting legal briefs.\n  Mr. Myers has spent a large part of his legal career as a lobbyist \nfor cattle\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\nand grazing interests. Attorneys are obligated to zealously represent \ntheir clients and there is nothing wrong with this representation. But, \nI am troubled by a number of extreme comments that he made as an \nadvocate.\n  For example, in a 1996 article, Myers equated Federal management of \nrangelands with the ``tyrannical actions of King George'' against the \nAmerican colonists. According to Myers, these tyrannical practices \nincluded:\n\n       over-regulation and efforts to limit [ranchers'] access to \n     federal rangelands, revoke their property rights, and \n     generally eliminate their ability to make a living from the \n     land.\n\n  Source: ``Western Ranchers Fed Up with the Feds,'' Forum for Applied \nResearch and Public Policy, winter 1996.\n  Equating Federal rangeland policy with the tyrannical policies that \nsparked the American revolution is strong language. But when asked by \nSenator Leahy to back up his claim, Myers could not come up with any \nexamples.\n  Similarly, after the California Desert Protection Act was passed, he \ndescribed the law as ``an example of legislative hubris.'' The source \nis a book chapter: ``Farmers, Ranchers, and Environmental Law,'' 1995, \nat page 209. As the author of the California Desert Protection Act, I \nwas quite struck by this statement. Myers himself has acknowledged his \n``poor choice'' of words, but this is one more piece of evidence that \nMr. Myers can be intemperate and extreme.\n  The California Desert Protection Act created the Joshua Tree National \nPark, the Death Valley National Park, and the Mojave National Preserve. \nThese are among our Nation's environmental jewels.\n  In total, the act set aside 7.7 million acres of pristine California \nwilderness, 5.5 million acres as a national park preserve, and provided \nhabitat for over 760 different wildlife species. It has provided \nrecreation and tourism for over 2.5 million people, provided more than \n$237 million in sales, more than $21 million in tax revenue, and more \nthan 6,000 new jobs. This is what Myers called ``legislative hubris.''\n  Similarly, in a 1994 article, entitled ``Having Your Day in Court,'' \nMyers railed against ``activist'' judges. He wrote of environmental \ngroups:\n\n       They have aggressively pursued their goals before friendly \n     judges who have been willing to take activist positions and \n     essentially legislate from the bench.\n\n  Source: National Cattlemen Magazine, November/December 1994, at page \n34.\n  To illustrate his argument, he wrote:\n\n       No better example can be found than that of wetlands \n     regulation. The word ``wetlands'' cannot be found in the \n     Clean Water Act. Only through expansive interpretation from \n     activist courts has it come to be such a drain on the \n     productivity of American agriculture.\n\n  When I and other Senators pointed out that, 10 years prior to his \narticle, the Supreme Court had unanimously upheld the application of \nthe Clean Water Act to protect wetlands, Myers backtracked and \nacknowledged Supreme Court precedent. He further acknowledged that he \ncould not recall any specific cases that would justify the argument he \nmade in his article.\n\n  Similarly, Myers, in another article, wrote that environmental groups \nare ``mountain biking to the courthouse as never before, bent on \nstopping human activity wherever it may promote health, safety, and \nwelfare.'' Source: ICA Line Rider, February, 1998. When queried about \nthese statements, Myers again backtracked. And he has argued that he \nwas merely the zealous lobbyist taking tough positions on behalf of his \nclient.\n  There is one area of Myers' career where he can't attribute his words \nand actions solely to his role as a legal advocate. It is Myers' \ntroubling body of work as Solicitor of the Department of Interior in \nthe Bush administration. His record in this position provided for me \nthe ``tipping point'' against his nomination.\n  As Solicitor of Interior, Myers' client was the American public. He \nhad a duty to carry out his work in an impartial fashion just as he \nwould if confirmed to be a Ninth Circuit judge. Nevertheless, on \nmultiple occasions as Solicitor, Myers engaged in actions that raised \nquestions about his impartiality and professional qualifications.\n  One of Myers two formal opinions as Solicitor involved the proposed \nGlamis Gold Mine in California.\n  During the Clinton administration, then-Solicitor Leshy wrote an \nopinion that led to the denial of an industry proposal which would have \ncarved an 880-foot deep, mile-wide, open-pit gold mine out of 1,600 \nacres of ancestral tribal land in Imperial County, CA.\n  The Leshy opinion came out of an exhaustive review process spanning 5 \nyears, three environmental documents, as well as several formal \nGovernment-to-Government consultations with the affected tribe, the \nQuechan Tribe. Within months of becoming Solicitor, Myers reversed the \nLeshy opinion.\n  In coming to his decision, Myers met personally with industry \nrepresentatives, but not with the affected tribe. This one-sided \ndealing cannot be justified or explained away--particularly because \nMyers was mandated by law to engage in Government-to-Government \nconsultation with the tribes and to protect sacred Native American \nreligious sites.\n  Given that Myers would not even meet with the tribes to hear their \npoint of view, it was not surprising that when Myers subsequently \nissued an opinion in favor of the industry, the District judge \ndetermined that Myers ``misconstrued the clear mandate'' of the \napplicable environmental law.\n  In his only other major opinion as Solicitor, Myers reversed a \nClinton administration regulation on grazing permits challenged by his \nformer clients, the Public Lands Counsel.\n  The issue involved whether environmental groups such as the Grand \nCanyon Trust could buy grazing permits from willing sellers in order to \nretire them. Myers, contrary to his strong support for property rights \nand free-market principles in other areas of Government regulation, \nfound such a practice illegal.\n  Further, as the Los Angeles Times has reported, Solicitor Myers \nrecommended that California State Representatives Herger and Doolittle \nintroduce a private relief bill giving $1 million worth of public land \nin Marysville, CA, to a private firm. Source: ``Interior Attorney \nPushed Land Deal,'' Los Angeles Times, March 8, 2004, at B1.\n  The land, called locally the Yuba Goldfields, consists of 9,670 acres \nof gravel mounds and ponds created by hydraulic mining during the 19th \ncentury. According to the Bureau of Land Management, the land contains \nsand and rock that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars for \nconstruction projects.\n  It turns out the companies seeking legislative relief did not have a \nvalid claim to the land and had never even paid taxes on the property. \nAnd since 1993, the property had been carried on the county's tax \nrecords as public lands.\n  I am concerned that Myers committed the Department to support a bill \nwithout first doing the basic research needed to evaluate the issue, \nlike consulting with local Bureau of Land Management officials.\n  I would like to comment briefly on one other area. Mr. Myers' \nnomination is to the Ninth Circuit. Some might argue that circuit could \nuse some shaking up. But criticisms along those lines of the Ninth \nCircuit are not justified and do not do justice to the Ninth Circuit's \njudges.\n  This is not the time or the place for a long discussion of the Ninth \nCircuit generally. But I do want to cite just a few statistics to show \nthat the Ninth Circuit's decisions are well within the mainstream of \nother circuit courts.\n  From 1994 to 2002, nationwide, the Supreme Court granted certiorari \nin only .23 percent of all Federal appellate cases. The Ninth Circuit \nhad numbers that were a bit higher for that time period; the Supreme \nCourt granted certiorari in .37 percent of all Ninth Circuit cases for \nthose years. But while higher than average, this was entirely within \nthe mainstream of other circuit courts. The range among circuits for \nthat time period ranged from .13 percent of all Eleventh Circuit cases, \nto .5 percent for all DC Circuit cases. The Ninth Circuit is clearly in \nthe mainstream of how its cases are treated by the Supreme Court.\n  Based on Myers' record, over 170 national groups have decided to \noppose his nomination, including organizations that usually don't get \ninvolved in nominations. The National Congress of American Indians, \nNCAI, a coalition of\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\nmore than 250 tribal governments, is opposing the nomination and they \npreviously have not weighed in on any Bush-nominated judges. The \nNational Wildlife Federation, which has never in its 68-year history \nopposed a judicial nominee, opposes Myers.\n  In closing, I would offer the observations of Joseph Sax, a \nnationally renowned professor of environmental and natural resources \nlaw at the Boalt Hall, U.C. Berkeley, who is familiar with Myers' work.\n  Sax writes:\n\n       I do strongly believe that we are entitled to have persons \n     of professional distinction appointed to important posts such \n     as that of the U.S. Court of Appeals. Neither based on his \n     experience as a practicing lawyer, nor while serving as \n     Solicitor at Department of Interior has Myers distinguished \n     himself, nor has he made any significant contributions to the \n     law in his writings. . . . We can do much better.\n\n  Given Myers unremarkable record and the serious questions about his \ncapability to judge cases impartially, I do not believe we should \nconfirm him to the Ninth Circuit. So I will vote nay.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of William G. \nMyers to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. After attending the \nhearing on his nomination, listening to his testimony, and reviewing \nhis responses to my written questions, I am not persuaded that Mr. \nMyers can set aside his personal views and objectively evaluate cases \nthat come before him. Many times during the nomination hearing, Mr. \nMyers simply evaded or refused to answer questions that were posed to \nhim, claiming that he could not comment on an issue that could come \nbefore him if he is confirmed.\n  This was not the approach taken by at least some of President Bush's \nnominees. Then-Professor, now-Judge Michael McConnell, for example, was \nforthcoming in his testimony and answers to written questions. He \nconvinced me in his hearing that he would put aside his personal views \nif he were confirmed to the bench. Mr. Myers did not.\n  Since Mr. Myers has never served as a judge, his published articles, \nhis past legal work, his legal opinions at the Department of the \nInterior, and his testimony before the Judiciary Committee are all we \nhave to assess his legal philosophy and views. This nominee did not \nsimply make a stray comment that can be interpreted as indicating \nstrong personal disagreement with our nation's environmental laws; he \nhas a long record of extreme views on the topic.\n  Mr. Myers has called the Clean Water Act an example of ``regulatory \nexcess.'' He has stated that critics of the administration's policies \nare the ``environmental conflict industry.'' He has stated that \nconservationists are ``mountain biking to the courthouse as never \nbefore, bent on stopping human activity wherever it may promote health, \nsafety, and welfare.'' He even compared the management of public lands \nto King George's ``tyrannical'' rule over American colonies.\n  Over 175 environmental, Native American, labor, civil rights, women's \nrights, disability rights, and other organizations oppose the \nnomination of Mr. Myers. This opposition speaks volumes about the \nconcern that many potential litigants have about his views on a diverse \nrange of issues that would come before his court. Rather than \nexplaining what his views were during the nomination hearing or in \nresponses to follow-up questions, Mr. Myers repeatedly ducked questions \nposed by me and my colleagues.\n  For example, during the hearing Mr. Myers was asked to identify which \nregulations he considered to be ``tyrannical.'' After pointing out that \nhe wasn't criticizing Government employees, which obviously wasn't the \nquestion, Mr. Myers finally identified a previous Federal rangeland \npolicy. Yet, when pressed, Mr. Myers would not say that he personally \nbelieved these regulations were unneeded, but that he was merely \n``advocating on behalf of my clients.'' This is what all nominees say, \nof course, when challenged about past statements made on behalf of \nclients, but since Mr. Myers has never been a judge or a law professor, \nwe have no other record to evaluate. And since he was repeatedly \nunwilling to tell us about his personal views in his hearing, we \ncertainly cannot ignore his previous published statements on important \nlegal issues that he will be called upon to decide.\n  Mr. Myers's views on the jurisdiction of Federal environmental laws, \nwhich he has called ``top down coercion,'' also concern me. Mr. Myers \nauthored a Supreme Court amicus brief on behalf of the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association and others in an important case dealing \nwith the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, Solid Waste Agency of \nNorthern Cook County (SWANCC) v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The \nSWANCC case involved a challenge to the Federal Government's authority \nto prevent waste disposal facilities from harming waters and wetlands \nthat serve as vital habitats for migratory birds. Mr. Myers argued in \nthis brief that the commerce clause does not grant the Federal \nGovernment authority to prevent the destruction and pollution of \nisolated interstate waters and wetlands. The Department of Justice, on \nbehalf of the Army Corps and EPA, has filed approximately 2 dozen \nbriefs in Federal court since the SWANCC decision. DOJ has consistently \nargued that the Clean Water Act (CWA) does not limit coverage of the \nClean Water Act to navigable-in-fact waters.\n  When I asked Mr. Myers about his view of the Clean Water Act, Mr. \nMyers would not say whether he agrees with this administration's \nconsistent interpretation of the SWANCC case. He would not provide any \ninformation on how he reads the Supreme Court's SWANCC decision other \nthan saying that it is ``binding precedent'', nor would he state what \nwaters, if any, should not receive Federal Clean Water Act protection \npost-SWANCC. His refusal to respond to these questions gives me pause \nbecause of a recent Ninth Circuit decision that ruled that the SWANCC \ndecision should be read narrowly and that wetlands, streams and other \nsmall waters remain protected by the statute and implicitly that the \nrules protecting those waters are constitutional. While Mr. Myers \nindicated that he would follow this Ninth Circuit precedent, he refused \nto elaborate on his views on this crucial issue.\n  In follow-up questions, I also asked Mr. Myers about a 1994 article \nhe wrote for the National Cattlemen Beef's Association, which he also \nrepresented in the SWANCC case. Myers wrote that environmental \norganizations have:\n\n     aggressively pursued their goals before friendly judges who \n     have been willing to take activist positions and essentially \n     legislate from the bench. No better example can be found than \n     that of wetlands regulation.\n\n  Mr. Myers argued:\n\n       The word ``wetlands'' cannot be found in the Clean Water \n     Act. Only through expansive interpretation from activist \n     courts has it come to be such a drain on the productivity of \n     American agriculture.\n\n  Mr. Myers' answers to my questions about this article were not \nforthcoming. Mr. Myers would not list any of the cases he was referring \nto in that article or any cases of which he had subsequently become \naware in which there has been an ``expansive interpretation from \nactivist courts'' of ``wetlands regulation.'' Nor could he provide me \nwith his analysis of United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., \nthe 1985 case in which the United States Supreme Court unanimously \nupheld the Reagan administration's application of the Clean Water Act \nto protect wetlands. Mr. Myers stated that he considered the case to be \nbinding precedent, which of course it is, but that doesn't shed much \nlight on his views on the Clean Water Act.\n  I am also deeply troubled by Mr. Myers's record as Solicitor General \nat the Department of the Interior. During his tenure as the chief \nlawyer for the Department, Mr. Myers authored a very controversial \nSolicitor's opinion, and approved an equally controversial settlement. \nThat Solicitor's opinion overturned a previous ruling regarding the \napproval of mining projects and greatly limited the authority of the \nInterior Department to deny mining permits under the Federal Land \nPolicy Management Act--FLPMA.\n  FLPMA amends the Mining Law of 1872 in part by requiring that:\n\n     in managing public land the Secretary shall, by regulation or \n     otherwise take any action necessary to prevent the \n     unnecessary or undue degradation of public lands.\n\n  In the Solicitor's opinion, Mr. Myers interpreted this law to mean \nthat the Government could only deny a project to prevent unnecessary \nand undue degradation of public lands. Thus, if the\n\n[[Page S8452]]\n\nproposed mining activity is ``necessary,'' then Mr. Myers declared that \nthe Government would have no authority to prevent a mine from going \nforward, even if it would harm sacred Native American grounds, historic \nsites, or environmentally sensitive areas. This legal opinion \ninterpreting DOI regulations is one of the only guides we have to \nevaluate how a Judge Myers would interpret statutes\n  Last year, a Federal court found that Mr. Myers's opinion\n\n     misconstrued the clear mandate of FLPMA, which by its plain \n     terms vests the Secretary of the Interior with the \n     authority--indeed the obligation--to disapprove mines that \n     ``would unduly harm or degrade the public land.''\n\n  In response to questions posed about this opinion at the hearing, Mr. \nMyers could not adequately explain his statutory interpretation of \n``unnecessary or undue,'' nor could he articulate his rationale for \nfinding that the word ``or'' in the statute actually meant ``and.''\n  After Myers's opinion, Secretary Norton approved the mining permit \nfor the 1600-acre cyanide heap-leaching Glamis gold mine located on \nsacred tribal lands. Tribal leaders have called the Myers' legal \nopinion and the resulting decision to approve the Glamis mine ``an \naffront to all American Indians.'' The National Congress of American \nIndians, which includes more than 250 American Indian and Alaska Native \ntribal governments, formally opposes the Myers nomination.\n  I have discussed my concerns about this nominee at some length \nbecause I wanted to show that my opposition to Mr. Myers is not based \non a single intemperate remark he has made as an advocate. I simply am \nnot convinced that Mr. Myers will put aside his personal policy views \nand fairly interpret and apply the law as passed by Congress. He has \nshown a willingness to disregard clear statutory language as Solicitor \nGeneral of the Department of the Interior.\n  It is not enough for Mr. Myers to pledge that he will follow Supreme \nCourt precedent. As we all know, the Supreme Court has not answered \nevery legal question. Circuit court judges are routinely in the \nposition of having to address novel legal issues. Mr. Myers's writings \nand speeches raise the question of whether he has prejudged many \nimportant legal questions. His answers to committee questions did not \nsatisfy me that he has not. I will vote ``No'' on the nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of William G. Myers III to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Looking over Mr. Myers record, it is clear that we do not see eye-to-\neye on environmental policy. He once complained that the ``federal \ngovernment's endless promulgation of statutes and regulations harm the \nvery environment it purports to protect.'' Mr. Myers believes that the \nEndangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act's wetlands protections \nare examples of ``regulatory excesses.'' He has also compared the \nGovernment's management of public lands to King George's rule over the \nAmerican colonies.\n  But policy disagreements alone are not enough to disqualify an \nindividual from serving on our Nation's lower courts. I dare say that \nthere has not been a judge confirmed during my almost 16 years in the \nSenate where the nominee and I have agreed on all issues. I believe the \nsame could be said by any Senator who has ever served in the Senate.\n  For me to oppose a judicial nomination there needs to be more than \njust a disagreement on policy; there needs to be an issue concerning \njudicial temperament or competence. When reviewing the record compiled \non Mr. Myers by the Judiciary Committee, I do believe there are serious \ndeficiencies with this nomination, beyond a disagreement on policy, and \nI must oppose it.\n  First, Mr. Myers has very little litigation experience, a critical \nfactor for serving on the circuit court level. In fact, he has never \nbeen a judge, nor has he participated in a jury trial, and only rarely \nhas he participated in a nonjury trial. He has never been a law \nprofessor, and he has written only a few law review articles. Some \ncandidates who I have supported in the past have lacked one kind of \nexperience--being a judge, professor, or prolific writer--but have \ncompensated for that gap with strength in other areas. Mr. Myers' \nresume, however, does not show any other such compensatory experience.\n  I am also greatly concerned that Mr. Myers' past actions bring into \nquestion his ability to separate his strong beliefs from his judicial \nduty to rule dispassionately on the law. This is a critical trait for \nany judge, at any level of the judiciary, and one that appears to be \nlacking in this nominee. For example, when he was the Interior \nDepartment Solicitor, which is the chief lawyer for the Department, he \nwas sworn to defend the public interest and enforce Federal land \nregulations. However, in many actions taken by Mr. Myers, he used his \nposition to weaken environmental regulations to the benefit of his \nformer mining and grazing industry clients. This is a strong indication \nof his inability to separate his beliefs from his duty as a judge, and \nhe must not be allowed to carry that to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  For those reasons I will oppose his nomination. In addition, as the \nranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I \nam distressed that the majority leadership has decided to use valuable \nfloor time to debate a nominee with horrible environmental perspectives \nand no chance at confirmation, while failing to take action on many \nimportant environmental issues.\n  We should be enacting comprehensive power plant antipollution \nlegislation. We should be looking for new opportunities to improve the \nefficiency of our cars, homes, and buildings to help curb air pollution \nand reduce global warming. We should pass standards to improve reliable \ndelivery of electricity. We should agree to produce more renewable \nmotor fuels that meet Federal Clean Air requirements. We should build a \npipeline to bring needed natural gas from Alaska to the lower 48 \nStates. We should end manipulative electricity marketing practices that \ngouge our consumers. Finally, we should expand our use of renewable \nenergy. We could do all these things, which would provide more energy \nfor our country, and do them with substantial Senate support rather \nthan debate a nomination that does not have the support necessary to be \nconfirmed.\n  We also have failed to ensure that the United States continues to \nexercise leadership in multilateral efforts to protect the global \nenvironment. Even though the United States led the way in negotiating \nand signing several important international environmental treaties, we \nare not yet a party to these treaties because of a failure to pass \nnecessary implementing legislation. The Law of the Sea Treaty is a \nperfect example. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic \nPollutants is, unfortunately, another.\n  These are some of the important environmental issues the Senate \nshould be spending its precious remaining time on, and not on divisive \nnominees who have no chance for confirmation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today I discussed my concerns about \nthe nomination of William Myers to a lifetime job as a judge on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Before we vote on the \nmotion of Republican Senators to invoke cloture on this nomination, I \nwould like to highlight a few things.\n  This nomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on April \nFool's Day over the objections of every single Democratic member of the \ncommittee.\n  The Republican majority has failed to bring this nomination up for a \nvote during the past 4 months, knowing that Mr. Myers is strongly \nopposed by the widest coalition of citizen groups that have ever \nopposed a circuit court nominee in U.S. history. Suddenly last Friday, \nRepublicans filed their cloture motion to end a debate that had not \neven begun about why President Bush nominated such an anti-environment \nactivist for a judgeship. They set debate for a time they knew few were \nscheduled to be here on such short notice. It seems that they are \nafraid of a robust and thorough debate on the merits, or lack of merit, \nof this nomination but they are eager to try to create a political \nissue out of it.\n  I do not think it is too skeptical to suggest that Republicans are \nbringing this nomination up now only to try to politicize the judicial \nnominations issue further in advance of the Presidential nominating \nconventions. This\n\n[[Page S8453]]\n\nis the partisan game plan proposed by the rightwing editorial page of \nthe Washington Times and White House and rightwing advocacy groups such \nas the Committee for Justice. The White House and its Republican \nfriends in this body should stop playing politics with these lifetime \njobs as judges. Stop playing politics with our courts. Stop proposing \nextremists for our Federal bench. Stop trying to remake the Federal \njudiciary from an independent branch of Government into just another \nwing of the Republican Party.\n  We have stopped only a handful of this President's most extreme \njudicial nominees, even though Republicans blocked more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees from getting an up-or-down vote. \nRepublicans blocked nearly 10 times as many of President Clinton's \nmoderate and well-qualified judicial nominees. Democrats have been \njudicious and sought to check only the worst nominations President Bush \nhas proposed. This nomination is one of the most controversial and \ndivisive, and the worst choice in terms of environmental protections \nand policy. It is so obvious he was chosen with the hope that he will \ncontinue to help roll back protections for clean water, clean air, and \nendangered ecosystems from the judicial bench.\n  Mr. Myers was picked to be a lifetime-appointed judge because for \nmost of his working life he has been a strident opponent of \nenvironmental laws. The nomination of this industry lobbyist who has \nbarely been inside a courtroom exemplifies the revolving door between \ncorporate interests and the Bush administration. It is no wonder that \nhis confirmation is opposed by more than 180 environmental, tribal, \nlabor, civil rights, disability rights, women's rights and other \ncitizen groups. I ask unanimous consent to have a list of those \nopposing this nomination printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Letters of Opposition to the Nomination of William G.

He is opposed because he should not be trusted with a \nlifetime job as an appellate judge. His record is too extreme.\n  If you watch what the Bush administration does, instead of just \nlistening to what it says, there is much evidence of this \nadministration's outright contempt for high environmental standards. \nThis nomination, in itself, says something about that. This nomination \nis emblematic of so many of this administration's appointments, \nespecially to sensitive environmental posts. Mr. Myers' Interior \nappointment was the first ``swoosh'' of the revolving door. His \nnomination by President Bush to one of the highest courts in the land \ncompletes the cycle.\n  I must oppose cloture on this nomination, and I hope that the \nSenate's vote today will say something about the higher priority that \nthe Senate makes of environmental quality.\n   Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I will vote in favor of invoking \ncloture on the nomination of William G. Myers III to serve on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. During the 108th Congress, the \nSenate has failed to invoke cloture on the nominations of Mr. Myers and \nseveral other circuit court nominees. I have supported invoking cloture \non these nominations because I am concerned about how such filibusters \nwill affect the judicial confirmation process, including the nominees \nof future Presidents. The overwhelming majority of editorial pages \nacross the Nation agree that district and circuit court nominees are \nentitled to an up-or-down vote.\n   However, a vote to invoke cloture is not an automatic vote for \nconfirmation. in fact, I joined several other Republicans in voting \nagainst a district court nominee earlier this month. I have heard from \na number of Rhode Islanders who have serious concerns about Mr. Myers, \nparticularly his views on property rights and environmental protection, \nand I will carefully weigh their objections should the Senate invoke \ncloture on his nomination in the future.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, over the last 3\\1/2\\ years, the Senate \nhas approved 198 of President Bush's judicial nominees: more than were \nconfirmed during President Reagan's first term, more than confirmed \nduring the first President Bush's term, and more than were confirmed \nduring President Clinton's second term, when the other party controlled \nthis body.\n  The reality is that the Senate has made remarkable progress approving \nthis President's nominees. Today, there are fewer Federal judicial \nvacancies than at any time in the last 14 years.\n  This is true because both sides of the aisle have been able to work \ntogether to identify talented, qualified, experienced nominees--\nnominees who can put their own ideologies aside and uphold the law.\n  We have a bipartisan selection process that has worked very well for \nWashington state. Members of Washington State's legal community, the \nWhite House, and my colleague Senator Patty Murray and I worked \ntogether to review a group of applicants. I am proud of our work. This \ncooperative approach has produced a number of highly qualified judicial \nnominees--including two who were confirmed just last month--and I \nbelieve it is a sound model for other States.\n  Unfortunately, the nomination before us today--that of William Myers \nto the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--represents a break with this \nspirit of cooperation and fairness. As a Senator who represents a State \nin the Ninth District, I feel that I must explain why I have concluded \nthat I have no choice but to oppose this nomination.\n  Other Senators have spoken about Mr. Myers' inexperience. I agree \nthat the nominee before us has limited experience. He has never been a \njudge, he\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\nhas never tried a jury case, he has never served as counsel in any \ncriminal litigation, and he has tried just twelve cases to verdict or \njudgment.\n  I am troubled that this administration believes such a candidate is \nan appropriate choice to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals, just one \nlevel below the U.S. Supreme Court. But I would like to spend my time \ndiscussing some other problematic aspects of this nomination.\n  The decision this body makes on the nomination before us will have a \nlong-lasting impact on the States of the Ninth Circuit. For one thing, \nthe person appointed to fill this seat on bench will receive a lifetime \nappointment. For another, the Ninth Circuit decides on many cases that \ncan have dramatic impacts on land management policy and environmental \nprotections. Decisions about how to use our natural resources and \npublic lands can have irrevocable consequences.\n\n  With this in mind, I am concerned that this nominee has compared the \nfederal government's management of public lands to ``the tyrannical \nactions of King George'' over the American colonies.\n  More troubling in his view of the Commerce Clause. In the face of \ndecades of established law, Mr. Myers has argued for a more limited \ninterpretation of this key portion of the Constitution, which underpins \nmuch of Federal environmental law. Rhetoric is one thing; radically re-\ninterpreting the Constitution is another.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate has spent so much time debating a \njudicial nominee with such a poor record on protecting the environment, \ninstead of taking up legislation that could actually improve the \nenvironment.\n  And in addition to public lands issues, the Ninth Circuit often \nconsiders cases regarding Native American issues. Yet here, too, Mr. \nMyers's record is troubling.\n  In one case, Myers reversed existing policy of the Department of the \nInterior, without seeking public opinion or input from affected Tribes. \nHis decision, which relied on his interpretation of the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act, FLPMA, allowed a mining company to \ncontaminate a large area of land in California that was sacred to the \nQuechan tribe.\n  But when a Federal judge reviewed the case--the only time a Federal \njudge reviewed Myers' work--he concluded, ``The Solicitor misconstrued \nthe clear mandate of FLPMA.''\n  It is for reasons like this that the National Congress of American \nIndians--which has never in its history opposed a Federal judicial \nnominee--opposes this nominee. Together, 560 tribes have spoken up and \nvoiced their strong concerns with his nomination.\n  The Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, which represents tribes \nin Washington, Oregon, Montana, and the nominee's home State of Idaho, \nhas also never previously opposed a judicial nominee. But they believed \nit was necessary to step forward and oppose Mr. Myers. As they noted in \na letter to me and other Northwest Senators, ``We do not take this step \nlightly--but when a nominee has acted with such blatant disregard for \nfederal law and our sacred places, we must speak out.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Affiliated Tribes' letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 Affiliated Tribes\n\n\n                                         of Northwest Indians,\n\n                                     Portland, OR, March 19, 2004.\n     Re: Opposition to the Nomination of William G. Myers III to \n         the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n     Senators: Stevens, Murkowski, McCain, Kyl, Feinstein, Boxer, \n       Inouye, Akaka, Craig, Crapo, Baucus, Burns, Reid, Ensign, \n       Wyden, Smith, Murray, Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Dear Senators: We write to you today as leaders of tribes \n     within the jurisdiction of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals \n     to express our strong opposition to the confirmation of \n     William G. Myers III to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. As \n     President of the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians/\n     Chairman of the Coeur d'Alene Tribe in Idaho, and as \n     Treasurer of the National Congress of American Indians/\n     Chairman of the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe, respectively, we \n     represent a broad base of tribes in the Northwest who would \n     be directly impacted by this nomination.\n       We have never before stepped forward to oppose a judicial \n     nominee. We believe that the President is entitled to receive \n     the consent of the Senate for his judicial appointments \n     unless there are serious concerns regarding judicial fitness. \n     However, former Solicitor of Interior Myers' disregard for \n     federal law affecting Native sacred places compels our view \n     that he is unable to fairly and impartially apply the law and \n     thus should not be confirmed.\n       The U.S. government, as steward for millions of acres of \n     Western lands, has accepted responsibility for maintaining \n     and protecting religious sites of significance to Native \n     Americans. This responsibility is clearly recognized not only \n     by treaty and custom but also in laws such as the Federal \n     Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA).\n       Unfortunately, the nominee, while serving two years in the \n     Bush administration as solicitor of the Department of the \n     Interior, trampled on law, religion, and dignity. In his \n     official capacity he orchestrated a rollback of protections \n     for sacred native sites on public lands, although such places \n     have been central to the free exercise of religion for many \n     American Indians for centuries.\n       Most notably, despite his stewardship responsibility, with \n     the stroke of his pen Myers reversed a crucial departmental \n     decision that had been arrived at over a period of years with \n     substantial public input. His action cleared the way for a \n     massive hardrock mining operation employing cyanide to \n     extract gold from enormous heaps of rock. This mine, run by \n     Canada's Glamis Imperial Gold Company, stands to contaminate \n     thousands of acres and destroy a vast swath of land in the \n     California desert that is sacred to the Quechan tribe.\n       In one of only three formal opinions in his two-year tenure \n     at Interior, Myers argued that the agency's Bureau of Land \n     Management did not have authority under the FLMPA law to \n     prevent the undue degradation of public lands that sometimes \n     accompanies such mining operations. But this is contrary to \n     the specific wording of the legislation, which requires the \n     Department of the Interior to protect against public land \n     degradation that is ``unnecessary or undue.''\n       Myers simply concluded that any practice necessary for a \n     mining operation was, by definition, not undue. Such \n     reasoning stands contrary to common sense and turns \n     legislative statute on its head. While specifically \n     addressing only the Glamis project, Myers's opinion, if \n     followed, would block the Bureau from preventing undue \n     degradation across millions of acres of public land.\n       It's hard to imagine a more fundamental misreading of the \n     language and intent of the law. As Federal district Judge \n     Henry Kennedy Jr.--the only judge to have reviewed Myers's \n     handiwork--declared, ``The Solicitor misconstrued the clear \n     mandate of FLPMA.''\n       Furthermore, the court held: ``FLPMA by its plain terms, \n     vests the Secretary of Interior with the authority--and \n     indeed the obligation--to disapprove of an otherwise \n     permissible mining operation because the operation, though \n     necessary for mining, would unduly harm or degrade the public \n     land.'' No wonder the American Bar Association questions \n     Myers's legal qualifications for a position on the Federal \n     appellate bench.\n       Equally troubling to tribes in the 9th Circuit is the \n     shameful exclusion of the Quechan Indian Nation from the \n     decision to reconsider the Glamis project. Neither Myers nor \n     Interior Secretary Gale Norton engaged in government-to-\n     government consultation with the Quechan Indian Nation or \n     other Colorado River tribes before reopening and reversing \n     the Glamis debate.\n       The Ninth Circuit Court encompasses a huge area. It \n     contains scores of reservations, more than one hundred Indian \n     tribes, millions of Indian people, and millions of acres of \n     public lands. Because so few legal cases ever reach the U.S. \n     Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit is often the court of last \n     resort for deciding critically important federal and tribal \n     land management issues.\n       Judges on this court must understand and respect tribal \n     values and the unique political relationship between the \n     federal government and tribal governments. Myers' actions and \n     legal advice in the Glamis matter trample on tribal values, \n     raise serious questions about his judgment, and demonstrate a \n     clear lack of the impartiality necessary to decide cases \n     affecting public lands.\n       We ask that you stand with us in opposing this nominee. We \n     do not take this step lightly--but when a nominee has acted \n     with such blatant disregard for Federal law and our sacred \n     places, we must speak out.\n     Ernest L. Stensgar,\n       President, Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, \n     Chairman, Coeur d'Alene Tribe.\n     W. Ron Allen,\n       Chairman, Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe, Former President, \n     National Congress of American Indians.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, for the 29 tribes in my home State of \nWashington, and the many tribes throughout the West, this is a \ntroubling report.\n  To be clear, I am not opposing Mr. Myers's nomination simply because \nwe disagree on issues. I have voted for many of this President's \nnominees whose views on a range of issues differ from my own.\n  I have had ideological differences with many of the nominees put \nforth\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\nby this administration, yet I have voted to approve the overwhelming \nmajority of those candidates. I do not believe that a difference in a \nnominee's views alone justifies voting against him or her.\n  But I cannot assent to a nominee who I do not believe will uphold the \nlaw when it conflicts with his ingrained political philosophy. \nUnfortunately, I believe Mr. Myers is such a nominee.\n  Mr. Myers has written, ``Judge Bork's judicial philosophy was well \nwithin the parameters of acceptable constitutional theory, worthy of \nrepresentation on the Supreme Court.'' More importantly, Mr. Myers \nindicated his support of ``judicial activism'' in his discussion of \nBork's views: ``Interpretivism does not require a timid approach to \njudging or protecting constitutionally guaranteed rights . . . \ninterpretivism is not synonymous with judicial restraint and may \nrequire judicial activism if mandated by the constitution.''\n  A Pacific Northwest newspaper, the Oregonian, summed up Mr. Myers's \nnomination this way: ``Myers has overwhelmingly looked out for industry \ninterests while antagonizing a vast array of conservation groups, \ntribes, labor unions and civil-rights organization.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that this editorial be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Oregonian, July 20 2004]\n\n  Wrong Pick for 9th Circuit; Surely the White House Can Find a More \n      Qualified Nominee for the Appellate Court than William Myers\n\n        In conservative doctrine, no court in the land is more out \n     of step than the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It's \n     considered a nest of ``activist'' judges whose liberal \n     leanings produce some truly wacky rulings.\n        That reputation reared its head again Monday in a hearing \n     on the nomination of William G. Myers III to a 9th Circuit \n     vacancy. One Republican senator after another testified that \n     the Idaho lawyer is just what's needed to bring some \n     ``balance'' to the court.\n        Wrong. The 28-seat appellate court may indeed harbor some \n     ideology-driven activists. But the solution isn't to add \n     another ideology-driven activist.\n        Myers didn't get this nomination because of superior \n     judicial fitness. He got it because of his political views \n     and friendly relationships with industries besieged by \n     environmental lawsuits.\n        He lacks any judicial experience, but that isn't the real \n     problem. Many outstanding judges, such as Portland's Diarmuid \n     O'Scannlain, were appointed to the 9th Circuit without coming \n     up through the judicial ranks.\n        But unlike Scannlain, Myers wasn't hailed by his peers as \n     a brilliant legal mind. He received only a tepid \n     ``qualified'' rating by the American Bar Association's \n     judicial review panel. Not one member rated him ``well-\n     qualified,'' and several voted ``unqualified.''\n        No distinguished career in law won Myers the attention of \n     the Bush administration. He toiled for years as a lobbyist \n     for the mining industry and cattle interests before the White \n     House appointed him to be the Interior Department's top \n     lawyer in 2001.\n        In that role, Myers has overwhelmingly looked out for \n     industry interests while antagonizing a vast array of \n     conservation groups, tribes, labor unions and civil-rights \n     organizations.\n        Myers' anti-environmental activism by itself shouldn't \n     disqualify him. The problem--and this gets back to his lack \n     of judicial experience--is that he has no track record \n     whatsoever to show how he would separate his ideology from \n     his interpretation of the law on the nation's second-highest \n     court.\n        The Senate is scheduled to vote today on Myers' \n     confirmation. According to their aides, Sen. Gordon Smith, R-\n     Ore., probably will support the appointment, which is \n     unfortunate, and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., will vote against \n     it.\n        The Senate has confirmed more than 170 of Bush's judicial \n     nominees, while blocking only seven. William Myers should be \n     the eighth.\n\n   Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, Mr. Myers's embrace of judicial \nactivism, combined with his anti-environmental record and a poor \nhistory of recognizing tribal rights, prevent me from offering my \nconsent on this nomination.\n   I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to rebut my colleagues' \nstatements regarding our nominee William Myers. Some of these \nstatements we have heard today are inaccurate and I would like to set \nthe record straight.\n  Despite some accusations to the contrary, Myers has a proven record \nof defending Native American tribal interests in this country. For \nexample, he defended the constitutionality of a provision of the \nCalifornia Constitution giving Indian tribes the exclusive right to \nconduct casino gaming in that State.\n  He also fought to uphold the Secretary of the Interior's decision to \nput a parcel of land located in Placer County, CA into trust for the \nUnited Auburn Indian Community. In addition, Myers supported \nlegislation that vindicated the property rights of the Pueblo of \nSandia, a federally recognized Indian tribe in central New Mexico, by \ncreating the T'uf Shur Bien Preservation Trust Area within New Mexico's \nCibola National Forest.\n  He also helped negotiate an agreement removing two dams from the \nPenobscot River in an effort to clear the way for the Penobscot Indian \nNation to exercise its tribal fishing rights. Conservation groups and \nthe Penobscot Indian Nation supported these efforts, and the agreement \nis now being implemented by the DOI's Boston field office.\n  And finally, with respect to tribal interests, Myers worked to \nimplement an Indian Education Initiative that provided increased budget \nsupport to the Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, including over $200 \nmillion annually for school construction. This initiative emphasizes \nthe teaching of tribal languages and cultures in addition to improving \nreading, math, and science education.\n  Some have also alleged that Myers demonstrated his hostility to \nenvironmental safeguards when he submitted a brief, on behalf of the \nNorth Dakota Farm Bureau, the American Farm Bureau and a similar group \nof clients, which challenged the Army Corps of Engineers' authority to \nregulate solid waste disposal into isolated wetlands. However, the U.S. \nSupreme Court agreed with his argument--pretty good evidence that the \nargument was both mainstream and stood on solid legal ground.\n  In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with Myers' clients that as a \nmatter of statutory interpretation, the Clean Water Act did not \nauthorize the Army Corps of Engineers to regulate the habitat of \nmigratory birds in isolated, intrastate waters.\n  Myers' brief never contended that Congress lacks the ability to \nregulate wetlands under other statutes or provisions of the \nConstitution, e.g., under its spending clause powers. It simply argued \nthat the Clean Water Act, as it existed in 1999, did not properly \ndelegate such regulatory authority to the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  In his responses to Senator Feinstein's written questions, Mr. Myers \naffirmed that Congressional intent in passing the Clean Water Act was \nto ``restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological \nintegrity of the Nation's waters,'' and that ``the health of our \nNation's waters is often inextricably connected to the health of \nadjacent wetlands.''\n  As Myers stated at his hearing, the Clean Water Act is clearly \nconstitutional, and there's no question that he understands its \nimportance. And there's also no question that advocacy of a position \naccepted by a Supreme Court majority should be viewed as a positive \npoint for a nominee, not a negative due to someone's personal \ndisagreement with the decision in question.\n  I would also like to set the record straight regarding our nominee \nand an amicus brief he submitted on behalf of the National Cattlemen's \nAssociation to the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1995 Sweet Home v Babbitt \ncase. Despite what my colleagues allege, this brief did not argue that \nthe Endangered Species Act itself was unconstitutional.\n  The brief simply relied on the then-recent precedent of Dolan v City \nof Tigard, in which the Supreme Court stated:\n\n       We see no reason why the Takings Clause of the Fifth \n     Amendment, as much a part of the Bill of Rights as the First \n     Amendment or the Fourth Amendment, should be relegated to the \n     status of a poor relation in these comparable circumstances.\n\n  The problem that Mr. Myers' clients had with the Endangered Species \nAct was that Babbitt Interior Department regulations defined the term \n``harm'' in the statute in a way that essentially precluded any private \nlandowner's use of property on which an endangered species might find \nhabitat, and, importantly, that the Government had no intention of \ncompensating affected landowners.\n  In fact, the Endangered Species Act contains provisions that enable \nthe\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\nSecretary of the Interior to pay landowners to protect endangered \nspecies on their properties, while also preserving viable economic uses \nof the land. It's no surprise that the Babbitt Interior Department had \nno intention of enforcing those provisions of the law, but you can \nhardly blame ranchers and farmers adversely affected by Endangered \nSpecies Act regulations for hiring lawyers to ask the Supreme Court to \nremind the Interior Department of its obligations.\n  These provisions of the statute are, of course, in addition to the \ntakings clause of the Fifth Amendment. Now, I understand that the \nSupreme Court ruled against Mr. Myers' clients' position in this case, \nbut it seems to me that arguments well grounded in the plain language \nof the Constitution and the statute at issue, that acknowledged the \nbasic validity of the statute, cannot credibly be tarred as \n``extreme.''\n  By contrast, here is a situation that I think most people would agree \nis extreme. Last month, the Associated Press published an article \nentitled ``So Endangered It Didn't Exist,'' in, among other newspapers, \nthe Daily Southtown of Illinois. The article reports that the LeSatz \nfamily of Chugwater, WY:\n\n     wants to be able to teach their clients the finer points of \n     riding and roping without having to trailer their animals 25 \n     miles to the nearest public indoor arena whenever the weather \n     turns miserable. But the LeSatzes aren't able to build their \n     own riding arena. The only decent site on their property in \n     southeastern Wyoming lies within 300 feet of Chugwater Creek, \n     and building there is far too expensive because of Endangered \n     Species Act restrictions intended to protect the Preble's \n     meadow jumping mouse.\n\n  The article then breaks it to the reader that the mouse doesn't \nexist:\n\n       After six years of regulations and restrictions that have \n     cost builders, local governments and landowners on the \n     western fringe of the Great Plains as much as $100 million . \n     . . new research suggests the Preble's mouse in fact never \n     existed. It instead seems to be genetically identical to one \n     of its cousins, the Bear Lodge meadow jumping mouse, which is \n     considered common enough not to need protection.\n\n  Now, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is in the process of deciding \nwhether or not these two species of mice are identical; if they are, \nthen neither needs protection from the Endangered Species Act. And the \nconsequences would positively affect many Western communities, in \nMontana, Wyoming, Colorado, and perhaps several other Western States. \nAs a spokesman for the Colorado Contractors Association put it:\n\n       If we've shown that the mouse doesn't exist, what happens \n     to all that has been set aside? Because that's been a huge \n     economic burden.\n\n  Indeed it has. As the article reports, ``nearly 31,000 acres along \nstreams in Colorado and Wyoming have been designated critical mouse \nhabitat.'' The mouse ``also has blocked the construction of reservoirs \namid a five year drought in the Rocky Mountains.''\n  Naturally, environmental groups have begun their usual attacks in \nhopes of preserving the potentially bogus classification of this mouse \nas endangered. But the quote from one of those groups' spokesmen in the \nAP article is instructive. Does it attack the science? Does it say, \nwell, let's get to the bottom of this? No. It personally attacks the \nbiologist who raised this issue with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, as having ``a clear anti-Endangered Species Act agenda,'' and \nmocks him for ``testifying in Washington, D.C. in front of committees \nheaded by members of Congress who would like nothing better than having \nthe Endangered Species Act thrown away.'' I guess that, by this \nindividual's logic, any time someone who doesn't share his policy \nagenda is chairing a Congressional committee, testimony before that \ncommittee is illegitimate. An interesting standard--I wonder if Bill \nMyers' liberal environmentalist opponents would like it applied to \ntheir detriment.\n  Now, the biologist referenced in this AP article may or may not prove \nto be right about this mouse; it's the Fish and Wildlife Service's job \nto figure that out. But here's the point: anyone who suggests that \nsound science ought to inform Endangered Species Act classifications--\nas Bill Myers did when he was representing folks like the LeSatzes, \ntrying to make a living off the land, in this case, their own land--is \nattacked by the liberal activists as trying to throw the entire law \ninto the garbage can. Sound familiar? It should. It sounds exactly like \nthe kinds of personal attacks we're hearing on Bill Myers today, and it \nsounds like the attacks on any member of Congress who has the gall to \nsuggest that the Endangered Species Act must be reformed. While now is \nnot the time to debate the ESA, now should also not be the time to \npersonally attack a qualified judicial nominee for having represented \nWesterners who have suffered because of its draconian applications.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues of Mr. Myers' acknowledgement at his \nhearing, that:\n\n     the Supreme Court, in interpreting the Takings Clause and the \n     Fifth Amendment, has never interpreted it as an absolute. . . \n     . [P]roperty rights are subject to reasonable regulation by \n     government entities.\n\n  We all know this is the case--not only with the Takings Clause, by \nthe way--and Mr. Myers has never suggested otherwise, despite the \nmisrepresentations of his opponents.\n  I might note that I find it very unfortunate that the various Indian \ntribes that oppose Bill Myers have bought into the same false \naccusations about the Glamis Gold Mine issue.\n  The truth is Bill Myers was not involved in the permitting process \nfor the proposed Glamis gold mine in southern California. He simply \nissued a Solicitor Opinion regarding the proper scope of the Interior \nDepartment's authority under the Federal Land Policy and Management \nAct, which allowed Glamis Gold, the owner of several mining claims in \nthe area, to proceed with a pre-existing mining proposal. My colleagues \nshould understand that the Babbitt Interior Department approved the \nsame Glamis proposal--supported by two draft environmental impact \nstatements in 1996 and 1997, and two separate Native American tribal \ncultural resource studies in 1991 and 1995--up until the last week of \nthe Clinton Administration in January 2001.\n  At his hearing, Mr. Myers stated that:\n\n     my role in that matter was looking at a fairly narrow [legal] \n     point and determining whether the Department had the \n     congressional authority that it needed to make certain \n     interpretations [of the FLPMA].\n\n  And his legal conclusion was that the Interior Department did not \nhave the authority to do what former Secretary Babbitt's Solicitor said \nit did, regardless of the policy merits.\n  In response to Senator Leahy's written questions, Mr. Myers explained \nthat prior to his tenure as Solicitor.\n\n       Interior had suspended the 2000 regulations affecting hard \n     rock mining. Those regulations were based in part on one of \n     my predecessor's opinions. Multiple lawsuits regarding the \n     suspended regulations were also pending when I arrived. I \n     therefore felt an obligation to review the opinion that was \n     common to these controversies to determine if the \n     Department's defense to the lawsuits was viable.\n\n  In fact, Myers reached the legal conclusion that the regulations \nbased on that opinion could not be credibly defended in Federal court.\n  Additionally, as his written responses to several other Senators' \nquestions make clear, he reached that conclusion before he met with any \nmining industry representatives, and with the full awareness of the \nlegal positions taken by the affected Indian tribes. Mr. Myers \nemphasized that:\n\n     representatives of the mining company were disappointed by \n     their meeting with me because I would not engage them in a \n     discussion of their ideas or views on the [hardrock mining] \n     matter.\n\n  Finally, last spring, a Department of the Interior Inspector General \nreport, concluded:\n\n     the conduct of the DOI officials involved in this [Glamis] \n     matter was appropriate, that their decisions are supported by \n     objective documentation and that no undue influence or \n     conflict of interest affected the decision-making process \n     related to the Imperial Project.\n\n  While a Federal district court judge here in D.C. disagreed with \nMyers' Opinion regarding mining operations on Federal lands, the judge \nupheld the Interior Department's regulations that were based on Myers' \nOpinion. As Bill noted in his responses to Senator Feinstein's written \nquestions, his opinion was consistent with the Carter administration's \ninterpretation of the relevant portions of the FLPMA, and the D.C. \njudge agreed with Bill's Opinion's ultimate conclusion that the Bush \nadministration's mining regulations would protect public lands from \nunnecessary and undue degradation.\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\n  Just once I would like to come here to vote on a nominee that some \nDemocrats have maligned and misrepresented in order to make him or her \n``controversial,'' and hear more than one Democrat say, well, we've \nactually reviewed the hearing transcript and the nominee's answers to \nwritten questions, and he or she really is a balanced, reasonable \nperson who doesn't deserve the slander we've hurled at him or her. \nMaybe just once those Democrats prosecuting these filibusters will \nstray from the talking points and press releases of the inside-the-\nBeltway smear groups.\n  But I fear that day will be a long time in coming. Until then, and \ntoday in Bill Myers' case, all I can do is calmly point out facts and \nin particular, statements that the nominee has made to us that \nconclusively rebut the fevered allegations against him.\n  Mr. Myers' opponents have continually argued that since Bill Myers \nhad publicly advocated his former clients' causes, which clash with \ntheir own policy preferences, he is presumptively disqualified from \nservice on the Federal bench. But here is what he said in response to \nSenator Schumer's question regarding the Federal Government's role in \nenvironmental policy:\n\n       A centralized government, i.e., Congress, has an important \n     role to play in environmental protection. And the Clean Water \n     Act, the Clean Air Act--there are probably 70 environmental \n     statutes that give evidence to that truth.\n\n  He further explained that much of his advocacy for ranchers against \nthe Government was in response to the impact of environmental \nregulations on the generally good environmental stewardship of public \nlands by ranchers.\n  But, Mr. Myers explained in his responses to Senators' written \nquestions that he has in fact represented ``clients who actively \nopposed use of federal land for oil and gas exploration and ranching,'' \nin one case because ``proposed oil and gas exploration conflicted with \nmy client's use and enjoyment of . . . the land's aesthetic and \necosystem values.'' He also clarified that his lobbying on behalf of \ncoal companies was limited to a piece of legislation supported by Bruce \nBabbitt's Interior Department.\n  In written questions, Mr. Myers was asked:\n\n       In private practice, have you ever represented an \n     environmental organization or Indian tribe in litigation \n     against the grazing or mining industry, or lobbied for \n     environmental or Native American organizations on an issue or \n     piece of legislation that was opposed by the mining or \n     grazing industries?\n\n  And here's how he responded:\n\n       I have not represented environmental organizations in \n     private practice. However, I have represented Native American \n     tribal interests in pursuit of environmental matters \n     unrelated to grazing or mining. In particular, I have \n     represented tribal interests in securing water rights and \n     damages for lost fishing rights. I have not lobbied for \n     environmental or Native American organizations. While in \n     private practice, I volunteered to chair a review \n     commissioned by the State of Idaho regarding management of \n     federal lands in Idaho. Environmental interests participated \n     in that effort. Specific environmental groups were invited to \n     join the group as full members but they declined to do so.\n\n  Mr. Myers also clarified that as Solicitor, he:\n\n     supported litigation and non-litigation activities \n     restricting commercial use of public land for gold mining, \n     ranching, off-shore oil and gas development, trespass in \n     National Parks, expansion of national monuments, and \n     protection of Indian sacred sites.\n\n  The question is, Do Mr. Myers' opponents care about his statements \nand the facts of the particular matters they hold against him, or had \nthey made up their minds, well before he ever had an opportunity to \nrespond to their concerns, and regardless of what he's actually said in \nsworn testimony? I think I know the answer, and it is a profoundly \nunsettling one.\n  I would also like to respond briefly to a falsehood recently \ncirculated by a reliably liberal environmental group about Mr. Myers' \nOctober 2002 Solicitor Opinion, which addressed the Bureau of Land \nManagement's authority to permanently retire grazing permits on Federal \nlands. The Opinion concluded that BLM does have the authority to retire \npermits at the request of a permittee, but only after compliance with \nstatutory requirements and a BLM determination that the public lands \nassociated with the permit should be used for purposes other than \ngrazing. And BLM's decision to retire grazing permits is subject to \nreconsideration, modification or reversal.\n  Some found this Opinion controversial; some saw it as a shot across \nthe bow against environmental activist groups that try to buy up \ngrazing permits and then seek to retire them permanently, in order to \nshut ranchers off from those permitted areas. But at least in the case \nof a dispute over a portion of Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante \nNational Monument, a spokesman for the environmental group that sought \nto buy and retire grazing permits had this reaction to your Opinion:\n\n       What [Myers'] memo sets up is an acknowledgement of what \n     we've already known . . . Once an area is closed to grazing, \n     someone could still come along later and say ``we want to \n     graze here'' and the BLM could re-open the area to grazing. . \n     . . What people consider new about the memo is that plan \n     amendments are not permanent. But that was not new to us.\n\n  I guess the extreme environmentalists opposition campaign didn't \nbother to read that quote, or Myers' Opinion.\n  In fact, the portion of the 1999 Tenth Circuit opinion in Public \nLands Council v Babbitt that the U.S. Supreme Court did not review \nfound that there is a presumption of grazing use within grazing \ndistricts, and that BLM could not unilaterally reverse this \npresumption. That finding supports the Opinion.\n  Let me also note that Myers' Opinion superseded a prior memorandum \nissued by former Secretary Babbitt's Solicitor on January 19, 2001, \nduring the final hours of the Clinton Administration. That memorandum \nfailed to consider a critical factor in any analysis of grazing permits \nunder the Federal Taylor Grazing Act, namely, that the Secretary of the \nInterior has deemed lands within existing grazing districts ``chiefly \nvaluable for grazing and the raising of forage crops.''\n  Now, the environmental group that's propagating the \nmisrepresentations about this Solicitor Opinion also speculates that, \nif Myers' ``authority also extended to the national forests,'' then \ngroups that try to buy up land to preclude all subsequent economic uses \nof it wouldn't be able to duplicate the ``success story'' of wolf and \ngrizzly bear reintroduction in Wyoming and Montana. It is hard to know \nwhere to start dismantling this absurd statement. First, as the record \nwill now show, the relevant Solicitor Opinion does not, in any way, \nstop willing buyers of land from buying land from a willing seller--but \nthe Federal Taylor Act must be respected in the process. Second, as a \nFederal appellate judge, Bill Myers, at his most powerful, would be on \na panel of three judges. Given the overwhelming number of liberals on \nthe Ninth Circuit, the odds are that he would be routinely outvoted.\n  The third and perhaps most telling, only a liberal environmental \ngroup believes that grizzly bear and wolf reintroduction in the West \nhas been a ``success.'' The verdict of the many farmers and ranchers, \ninside and outside of the Ninth Circuit, who have lost their livestock \nand livelihoods to these federally subsidized and protected predators \nis quite different. And it is Bill Myers' understanding of both sides \nof these types of issues that makes it absolutely essential that he be \nconfirmed as a Ninth Circuit judge.\n  I would like to point out that at the Judiciary Committee markup on \nApril 1, 2004, Bill Myers was unfairly characterized by one of my \ncolleagues as ``a man who has contempt for the views, the well-believed \nand cherished views of others,'' based on a couple of quotes, lifted \nout of context, from several advocacy articles he wrote on behalf of \nhis clients: ranchers and farmers.\n  I thought I might read you a few quotes, not lifted out of context, \nfrom some of the many activist groups who have fomented much of the \nbaseless opposition to Myers' nomination. Judge for yourselves whether \nthis rhetoric fits the Senator's definition of contempt for the views \nof others, but I think it's crystal clear that what Myers' opponents \nwould like to do is demonize him as a way to silence the opposition to \ntheir own favorite purveyors of contempt.\n  Here are a few choice quotes from a document posted by a coalition of \nseveral liberal environmental groups, all of which have vilified Bill \nMyers as an ``extremist,'' in April 2002:\n\n       One of the most nefarious strategies used by the Bush \n     Administration and its industry\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\n     allies to undermine environmental protections is to set \n     policy by failing to defend against industry lawsuits or by \n     reaching ``sweetheart'' settlements with industry.\n       Among the top contributors to the 2000 Bush Presidential \n     Campaign were the very industries oil--and gas, logging, \n     ranching and large-scale real estate development--that stand \n     to benefit most from the weakening of federal wildlife \n     policy. The court cases discussed above [regarding the \n     Endangered Species Act] were virtually all filed by \n     developers, ranchers and loggers, so it is clear that these \n     industries have already benefited from their generosity to \n     the campaign and their otherwise close ties with the Bush \n     Administration. The oil and gas industry similarly has \n     enjoyed favored treatment, even when its activities would \n     despoil some of the most important remaining habitats of \n     imperiled species.\n       Unfortunately, in the current Administration, science is \n     often shortchanged when it gets in the way of favored \n     corporate interests. Secretary Norton's Interior Department \n     has repeatedly suppressed, distorted or scuttled the science, \n     even when it comes from biologists within the Department.\n\n  Let's see if I've got this straight. The entire Bush administration \nis nefarious, corrupt, and bribed by corporate interests. Secretary \nNorton distorts science to benefit the administration's corporate \ncontributors. But it's Bill Myers who is contemptible and ``extreme'' \nbecause he dared suggest that frivolous environmental lawsuits are \nincreasing?\n  I think everyone ought to be honest about what's going on here. \nGroups like this, which I'm sure many Democrats would defend as \n``mainstream,'' and whose bidding Senators will be doing by refusing to \nvote on Bill Myers, are the ones spewing contempt.\n  I would like to respond to some of the rhetoric about Bill Myers' \nrecord as Solicitor at the Department of the Interior, a position to \nwhich this Senate confirmed him without opposition in 2001.\n  I understand that Mr. Myers's opponents believe that association with \nthe Bush/Norton Interior Department is a disqualifier for service on \nthe Federal bench I wonder if they will mind when such a standard is \napplied to the detriment of officials from the Clinton/Babbitt Interior \nDepartment, or any future Democratic administration, who might be \nnominated to the Federal bench. Regardless, let me point out just one \nexample of where the Bush Interior Department clearly got a policy \nissue right, an issue on which Bill Myers himself has been extensively \ncriticized.\n  The issue was decided just last month in the case of Southern Utah \nWilderness Alliance [124 S. Ct. 2373 (2004)]: The Bush Interior \nDepartment's position in this case, for which Bill Myers laid the legal \nfoundation, was upheld by a unanimous Supreme Court. The Court rejected \nenvironmental activists' challenges to a land use plan that was duly \nissued under authority of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. \nThe Court endorsed the Interior Department's ``multiple use \nmanagement'' concept, describing it as ``a deceptively simple term that \ndescribes the enormously complicated task of striking a balance among \nthe many competing uses to which land can be put. . . .'' The Court \nalso held that while a ruling in favor of the environmental activists:\n\n     might please them in the present case, it would ultimately \n     operate to the detriment of sound environmental management. \n     Its predictable consequence would be much vaguer plans from \n     BLM in the future--making coordination with other agencies \n     more difficult, and depriving the public of important \n     information concerning the agency's long range intentions.\n\n  The fact that Bill Myers defended such policies cannot, in a rational \nconfirmation process, disqualify him from service on the Federal bench. \nIn fact, the endorsement of multiple use management policies by a \nunanimous Supreme Court in this case is compelling evidence against the \nabsurd allegations that Bill Myers is somehow ``out of the mainstream'' \nwith respect to public lands and environmental law.\n  I would also like to address a point raised earlier about some \nstatements that Bill Myers made in articles that he wrote on behalf of \nhis clients--cattlemen, ranchers and farmers who opposed Federal \nGovernment mismanagement of public lands.\n  In a July 1, 2004 article entitled ``Ronald Reagan, Sagebrush Rebel, \nRest in Peace,'' William Pendley of the Mountain States Legal \nFoundation wrote: ``I am, former Governor Ronald Reagan proclaimed in \n1980, `a Sagebrush Rebel.' ''\n  Now, at his hearing, Bill Myers was attacked merely for having used \nthis same term, in an advocacy piece he wrote for his farming and \nranching clients. In fact, he was mocked at this hearing, and after it, \nfor merely channeling the concerns of his clients, who, like Ronald \nReagan, considered themselves ``Sagebrush Rebels.''\n  Mr. Pendley's article goes on:\n\n       When Ronald Reagan was sworn in, he became the first \n     president since the birth of the modern environmental \n     movement a decade before to have seen, first hand, the impact \n     of excessive federal environmental regulation on the ability \n     of state governments to perform their constitutional \n     functions; of local governments to sustain healthy economies; \n     and of private citizens to use their own property. . . . \n     Reagan thought federal agencies in the West should be ``good \n     neighbors.'' Therefore, Reagan returned control of western \n     water rights to the states, where they had been from the time \n     gold was panned in California until Jimmy Carter took office. \n     Reagan sought to ensure that Western states received the \n     lands that they had been guaranteed when they entered the \n     Union. Reagan responded to the desire of western governors \n     that the people of their states be made a part of the \n     environmental equation by being included in federal land use \n     planning.\n\n  I would also like to note that Reagan criticized ``excessive'' \nregulation, not any regulation at all--neither Bill Myers nor anyone \nelse thinks there is no role for the Federal Government in \nenvironmental regulation. And Bill Myers emphasized this at his \nhearing, in response to very hostile questioning by Democratic \nSenators:\n\n       A centralized government--i.e. Congress--has an important \n     role to play in environmental protection. And the Clean Water \n     Act, the Clean Air Act--there are probably 70 environmental \n     statutes that give evidence to that truth.\n\n  But the Reagan approach, which is also the Bush Interior Department's \napproach, which Bill Myers did his best to defend, is inimical to the \nenvironmental activist groups that oppose Mr. Myers' nomination. Any \nattempt to give the people who actually make their living on and around \nWestern lands a stake in how those lands are regulated is violently \nopposed by these groups. And then these groups label their enemies \n``enemies of the environment,'' or ``friends of polluters.'' It is \nunfortunate that such labels are uncritically accepted by some \nSenators, and because these liberal groups have similarly labeled Bill \nMyers, he won't get the up or down vote he deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8459-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished assistant \nminority leader for his approval of going ahead on this issue. I thank \nevery Senator on the other side because any Senator on the other side \nor, for that matter, this side can object to any legislation coming up. \nTrade legislation is a little more controversial than it used to be. We \nhave had great cooperation from the Democrats in the bipartisan manner \nit takes to get business done in the Senate on three very important \ntrade agreements, including now this one, the United States-Morocco \nFree Trade Agreement. Last week we did the United States-Australia Free \nTrade Agreement, and prior to that the extension and reauthorization of \nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act, which was passed just prior to \nour previous recess for the Fourth of July.\n  So often in this body the antagonism gets highlighted between \nRepublican and Democrats. I wish to thank all the minority Members for \nallowing me to move ahead with this legislation.\n  Obviously, since I presented this legislation, I support this bill, \nS. 2677. It is legislation that implements the United States-Morocco \nFree Trade Agreement. I happen to believe this agreement marks a solid \nwin for America, and when it comes to trade legislation, when we talk \nabout a solid win, that is in economic terms and that creates jobs in \nAmerica because America produces, in most instances, more than we can \nconsume, particularly in agriculture but in other areas as well.\n  The United States is 5 percent of the world's population. So if \nanybody thinks we should not accept goods from overseas and then other \ncountries not let us export, understand that 5 percent of the people of \nthis world, the Americans, when we produce much more than we consume--\nand in agriculture that is 40 percent--what they would be saying is \nthat we ought to shut down part of productive America. Obviously, if we \nshut down part of productive America, we lose jobs. So if we are going \nto keep enhancing our economy, to increase our standard of living--and \nthat is related to increased productivity--then, obviously, we have to \nlook to the 95 percent of the people of the world who are outside the \nUnited States as a market.\n  Other countries, obviously, look to the world for a market. So it is \na very competitive market. But the extent to which we reduce trade \nbarriers--and this Morocco agreement is one example of reducing \nbarriers to trade--then we let the marketplace make a decision on where \ngoods go, what goods cost, and the quality of goods. For the most part, \nconsumers of those respective countries, including America, make a \ndetermination as to what they want to pay and the quality of product \nthey want. But the marketplace is going to be making that decision.\n  When we have barriers to trade that are set up by governments, then \npolitical leaders are making those decisions. Or if it is not political \nleaders, it is government employees making those decisions. Quite \nfrankly, when government makes decisions, you do not reap the benefits \nof the efficiency of the marketplace and the efficiency of productivity \nof the respective workers of the respective countries that you do if \nthe marketplace is making those decisions.\n  Willing buyer, willing seller, setting price, setting quality, \nsetting time of transaction is better than 535 Members of Congress \nmaking that decision. All one has to do is look at Russia today. It is \nmuch more productive than it was when bureaucrats in Moscow were \ndeciding how many acres of wheat to plant and when to combine those \nacres, the mature crop. A third of it was left in the field because \nwhen 5 o'clock came, they went home. When the American farmer goes out \nto harvest crops, he stays there until he gets it done, particularly \nsomething that is time sensitive, such as the maturing crop of wheat or \nsoybeans. But not the Russian farmer under the Soviet system of command \nand control. Russia was not exporting grain. Today, Russia is exporting \ngrain. We have to go back to the new economic program of the late 1920s \nfor that to have happened, or you have to go back to the days of the \nczar for that to have happened in Russia.\n\n  So the marketplace is the best place to make these decisions, and \nagreements leveling the playing field, such as this Morocco agreement, \nare examples of the United States looking to the rest of the world to \nsell the surplus we manufacture, the surplus we produce, the excess--if \nyou do not want to call it surplus, it is excess--of what we can \nconsume here.\n  When this agreement is implemented, more than 95 percent of bilateral \ntrade will become duty free immediately. According to the Office of the \nU.S. Trade Representative, this is the best market access package of \nany U.S. free-trade agreement with a developing country. This will \nbring important new opportunities for America's manufacturing sector. \nThe agreement will also benefit our service providers with new market \nopportunities, particularly in key sectors such as engineering, \ntelecommunications, banking, and insurance. U.S. intellectual property \nrights owners will obtain the benefits of\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\nstronger protection for their trademarks, for their copyrights, and for \ntheir patents.\n  Any agreement will lead to a more open and transparent trading regime \nwith the implementation of the new transparency procedures for customs \nadministration, new commitments to combat bribery, and strong \nprotections for U.S. investors in the region.\n  Perhaps most importantly for my home State of Iowa, the agreement \nbrings substantial benefits to the U.S. agricultural community. I note \nfirstly that the agreement is comprehensive. No sector is excluded. \nThis is important for the future of our U.S. agriculture. The fact is, \nwhen we take a sector off the table during negotiations, our trading \npartners are bound to do the same. All too often the sector they want \nexcluded is one of our most competitive agricultural products. That \nmeans lost sales for America's family farmers.\n  It is very important that we send a strong message to our future \ntrading partners that our country, the United States of America, \nremains committed to negotiating broad and very comprehensive free-\ntrade agreements. Passage of this agreement moves that ball closer to \nthe goalpost and reaffirms our commitment to negotiating and not being \non the sideline.\n  Second, this agreement is sure to advance our agricultural exports in \nan important and growing region of the market. The recent trend of \nArgentine and Brazilian corn displacing American corn in the Moroccan \nmarket will end. In fact, the International Trade Commission predicts \nthat absent the current tariff, United States corn producers will \nsupply nearly all of Morocco's corn imports in the coming years.\n  The International Trade Commission also estimates that United States \nexports of soybean meal to Morocco will likely increase substantially \nunder this agreement. With Morocco presently imposing tariffs as high \nas, believe this, 275 percent on the import of United States beef, the \nUnited States is in effect literally shut out of the Moroccan beef \nmarket. This will change under this agreement, with the United States \ngaining new access for our beef going into Morocco.\n  United States exporters are currently at a competitive disadvantage \nwhen they try to sell wheat to Morocco. The fact is that competitors of \nthe United States can sell their wheat cheaper. This agreement will \nchange that. This agreement will level the playing field for America's \nwheat farmers. It is also going to do it for our beef ranchers.\n  An independent study by the American Farm Bureau Federation found \nthat under this agreement--now, this is the American Farm Bureau--the \nUnited States agricultural trade surplus with Morocco could reach $382 \nmillion by 2015 with Moroccan agricultural exports rising by only $25 \nmillion. Thus, under this agreement, U.S. agriculture would see roughly \na 10-to-1 gain. Those figures speak louder than words.\n  I have received testimony and letters in support of this agreement \nfrom across America's agricultural sector. I concentrate on what we \nhave heard from one Iowa farmer, but also a person who is very much a \nleader in the Iowa Soybean Association, Ron Heck from Perry, IA. He \ntestified before the Finance Committee, which I chair, that the \nagreement will not only benefit soybean farmers directly in increased \nexports to the country of Morocco but also indirectly as they sell \ntheir grain to America's beef and poultry farmers who will in turn \nexport these products of beef and poultry to Morocco.\n  When one sells meat, one sells a value-added agricultural product \nthat has created more jobs in America. It is better to sell the beef \nand the poultry, it brings more wealth to America than sending our raw \ngrain and our raw soybeans overseas.\n  We have the National Corn Growers Association, the International \nDairy Food Association, the National Milk Producers Federation, the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Association of \nWheat Growers, the National Chicken Council, the Corn Refiners, and the \nUSA Rice Federation, to name a few, that have all written to me in \nfavor of this agreement.\n  The Morocco free trade agreement also contains a preference clause \nthat grants the United States market access provisions that will be at \nleast as good as those granted by Morocco to other countries in any \nfuture free trade agreement they may enter into.\n  Finally, the agreement enabled us to tackle tough sanitary and \nphytosanitary issues which had been acting as a bar to many of our \nagricultural exports.\n\n  In my mind, the economic benefits are enough for any Senator to \nsupport this agreement. I think my colleagues ought to take into \nconsideration other less tangible reasons to cast their vote as yea.\n  Morocco is a longstanding friend and ally of the United States. In \nfact, Morocco was the first country to extend diplomatic relations to \nthe United States following our independence. Our two nations first \nsigned a treaty of peace and friendship in 1786, making this the oldest \nunbroken treaty in the history of the United States foreign relations.\n  Today, Morocco is a valuable ally in the war against terrorism, \nworking with our country to bring peace and stability throughout the \nMiddle East. In short, Morocco has been and still remains a valued \nfriend of our country. I am pleased we will be able to strengthen our \nfriendship with the passage of this free trade agreement.\n  The Morocco free trade agreement marks our third free trade agreement \nin the Middle East. Although we enjoy strong free trade agreements with \nIsrael and Jordan, the Congress may soon have an opportunity to \nconsider a fourth free trade agreement with Bahrain, another important \nMiddle Eastern country and one that is very helpful to us in a military \nway.\n  While each free trade agreement is valued in and of itself, these \nfree trade agreements are also steppingstones toward President Bush's \nbroader vision of a Middle East free trade agreement by the year 2013. \nToday, far too many people in the Middle East are plagued by poverty \nand lack of education and opportunity. While trade itself will not \nalleviate every ill, it is a vital tool of development which has been \nlacking for far too long in that important region of the world. I am \nconfident the passage of this free trade agreement, along with our \ncontinued efforts to build a Middle East free trade agreement, can help \nchange that by ushering in a new era of hope and prosperity in that \ncritical part of the world.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation to \nimplement the U.S.-Morocco free trade agreement. By voting to approve \nthe Morocco implementing legislation, we can confirm our close and \nlongstanding ties with Morocco.\n  In 1777, soon after a breakaway British colony calling itself the \nUnited States of America declared independence from Britain, Morocco \nwas the first country in the world to recognize the new government.\n  In 1787, the two nations negotiated a Treaty of Peace and Friendship \nthat is still in force, representing the longest unbroken treaty \nrelationship in U.S. history.\n  Soon thereafter, Morocco's rule wrote to President Washington to ask \nfor help in protecting Morocco's shipping fleet from marauding bandits.\n  Washington wrote back, apologizing that the United States was too \npoor and too weak from the recent American Revolution to help Morocco. \nBut Washington said that perhaps someday, the United States would be \nstrong enough to help its friends. For Morocco, that day has now come.\n  So there are strong foreign policy reasons to vote for the Morocco \nimplementing legislation. But I have often said that foreign policy \nconcerns alone should not control our trade policy. I have argued that \nwe should negotiate free trade agreements with countries that offer \nreal economic advantages for U.S. farmers, workers, and businesses.\n  I am happy to report that while Morocco has a relatively small \neconomy, the agreement with Morocco is a\n\n[[Page S8462]]\n\nstrong agreement that offers significant opportunities for American \nexporters. In many ways, it sets a new standard for U.S. free trade \nagreements with developing countries.\n  Take, for instance, the provisions regarding intellectual property. \nMorocco has agreed to a high level of protection for intellectual \nproperty rights. The agreement includes state-of-the-art protections \nfor digital copyrights and trademarks, expands protection for patents, \nand mandates tough penalties for piracy and counterfeiting.\n  Morocco has also agreed to the best market access package to date of \nany U.S. free trade agreement with a developing country.\n  Over 95 percent of our trade with Morocco in consumer and industrial \nproducts will become duty-free immediately upon the entry into force of \nthe agreement. All remaining tariffs will be eliminated within 9 years.\n  The agreement is also good for U.S. agricultural producers. Wheat was \na sensitive issue for the Moroccan negotiators. They initially resisted \nattempts to increase access to U.S. wheat exports. Morocco purchased \nmost of the wheat it needed to import from the European Union. They did \nnot want to open it up to America, but I fought hard to ensure that \nU.S. wheat producers would not be left out of the agreement. I made it \nclear that I could not--and would not--support any agreement with \nMorocco that excluded wheat. Wheat is an important export crop for many \nU.S. States, including my home State of Montana.\n  In the end, Morocco agreed to open up its market to U.S. wheat. The \nagreement creates new tariff rate quotas for wheat that could lead to a \n5-fold increase in U.S. exports to Morocco. Most importantly, it will \nallow U.S. wheat producers to compete in Morocco on a level playing \nfield with their European competitors.\n  Beef was another sensitive issue for Moroccans. Again, I made clear \nhow important beef exports were to me and to others in the Congress. In \nthe end, the agreement gives U.S. beef producers new access to Morocco \nfor their high-quality beef exports.\n  The agreement is good for the United States, but it is also good for \nMorocco. It will help update and modernize Morocco's economy and \nattract investment to Morocco.\n  Morocco has used the free trade agreement negotiations to consolidate \nsignificant domestic reforms. For example Morocco recently enacted a \nnew labor law and a new law on child labor, both of which were drafted \nwith the help of the International Labor Organization.\n  Also, during the course of the negotiations, Morocco agreed to accede \nto the World Trade Organization Agreement on the Expansion of Trade in \nInformation Technology.\n  As a result, Morocco recently eliminated tariffs on a number of \ninformation technology products. That could help increase Morocco's \nproductivity as Moroccan businesspeople gain easier access to high-tech \nproducts.\n  By voting to approve Morocco implementing legislation, we can support \nreformers in Morocco who seek to modernize its economy. We can also \nsend a signal to other developing countries with reform-minded \ngovernments that opening up their economies can lead to closer economic \nrelations with the United States and new opportunities for their \ncitizens.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to take a moment to thank my good \nfriend, the chairman of the committee, Senator Charles Grassley, for \nhis leadership not only on this legislation but on every piece of \nlegislation we have dealt with in this Congress. The chairman and I \nhave worked with other members of the Finance Committee to address \ntheir concerns. I must say, there were several on this implementing \nlegislation with Morocco. We worked with those Senators, with their \nconcerns. I compliment the chairman for his leadership in working all \nthat out, and I believe he has successfully addressed all those \nconcerns.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the members of the committee to work \ncooperatively to get this legislation done in a timely manner.\n  I yield the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask \nunanimous consent that time under the quorum call be charged equally \nagainst both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was thinking about speaking about trade \nbut I nearly wore out my welcome last week on that subject so I will \nonly say that I would much prefer a trade bill be brought to the Senate \nfloor that solves problems rather than creates new problems. I do not \nknow that a trade agreement with Morocco is going to cause new problems \nbut I do know that in trade agreement after trade agreement over a good \nmany years, we have caused more problems, none of which ever get fixed. \nThe problems of trade with Europe, with Japan, with Korea, with Mexico, \nwith Canada never get fixed. Again, I do not know that this will cause \nproblems with respect to Morocco. Morocco is one of those few countries \nwith which we have a trade surplus.\n  But it has been the case that in every circumstance where we \nnegotiated a trade agreement the surpluses that existed soon turned \ninto deficits. In fact, we have the largest trade deficit in human \nhistory right now and that trade deficit exists with China, well over \n$130 billion a year; we have a trade deficit with Japan, Europe, Korea, \nand more. The NAFTA agreement was supposed to create a massive number \nof new jobs, hundreds of thousands of new jobs in this country, yet \nfollowing the NAFTA agreement with Mexico and Canada we, in fact, \nturned a small trade surplus we had with Mexico into a very large \ndeficit and we turned a modest deficit that we had with Canada into a \nvery large trade balance deficit.\n  I do not intend to give a lengthy speech about trade today and repeat \nwhat I have talked about before, the outsourcing of American jobs, the \nmovement of jobs from this country to other countries that is going on \nin a wholesale capacity. I will mention just a couple of issues, as \nexamples of broken promises in trade. With respect to Mexico, we were \ntold that we would see the products being imported into this country \nfrom Mexico, being the product of low-skill, low-wage labor. In fact, \nthat is not the case at all.\n  The three largest imports into this country from Mexico are \nautomobiles, automobile parts, and electronics, the products of high-\nskill, high-wage labor except they do not pay high wages in Mexico. \nThat is why these jobs have moved to Mexico.\n  I was told, although I have not yet checked this, that we now \nperversely import more automobiles from Mexico into the United States \nthan we export to all of the rest of the world. This is after we did a \ntrade agreement with Mexico.\n  I could spend time talking about our trade agreements with China, \nJapan, Europe, and others, and it is the same result.\n  Now, especially during the Olympic trials, our negotiators really \nought to be required to wear jerseys so they can look down and see, as \nthe Olympic athletes do, ``USA'' so at least they know for whom they \nwork.\n  It is not very easy, in my judgment, to see the result of their work \nand understand whose side they were on when they negotiated these \nagreements.\n  I mentioned last week the recent agreement that was negotiated with \nChina. In the agreement between the United States and China, we agreed \nthe Chinese could impose a 25-percent tariff on any automobiles the \nUnited States ships to China and that we would impose a 2.5-percent \ntariff on any Chinese automobiles they would aspire to sell in our \nmarketplace. In other words, our negotiator agreed that, with a country \nwith which we have a $100-plus billion deficit, we would allow them to \nput a tariff on automobiles that would be 10 times higher than the \ntariff we would impose on Chinese automobiles to be sold in our \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S8463]]\n\n  I say to you, that is incompetent. I have no idea how that happens; \nhow someone rationalizes that this is fair.\n  What does it mean to average folks? It means jobs lost. It means jobs \nare created there rather than here. It means jobs leave here to go \nthere. It means outsourcing. In most cases, it is why I do not support \nthese trade agreements. Those who negotiated the agreements did not \ndecide to stand up for the economic interests of our country. I am not \ntalking about protectionism, I am talking about standing up for our \neconomic interests and requiring and demanding fair trade.\n  It was one thing post the Second World War to be able to have \nconcessionary trade policies, to say to other countries: Look, we will \nbe glad to provide some concessions because we are bigger than you are, \nwe are stronger, we are more capable, we have a thriving, growing \neconomy and we can beat almost anyone in economic competition with one \nhand tied behind our back. That wasn't a big problem then. But things \nhave changed. We now face stiff, shrewd, international competitors, yet \nmost of our trade policy is still softheaded foreign policy, and those \nwho negotiate it don't stand up for the economic interests of this \ncountry, in my judgment.\n  So much for trade.\n  I did want to mention a couple of other items, if I might.\n\n\n                              Tax Shelters\n\n  The Washington Post did a story which described something most of us \nnow have known is occurring. The U.S. Treasury Department has tapped a \nprivate company called KPMG, one of the largest accounting companies, \nperhaps the largest in our country, to audit the Treasury Department's \nconsolidated financial statements. These are audits that were done \npreviously by Government folks. These are internal audits by the \nInspector General's office or others. But now they have tapped this \ncompany to audit the Treasury Department's financial statements.\n  Interestingly enough, the company they have hired to do that down at \nthe Treasury Department is the subject of a Federal grand jury probe \ninto its tax shelter abuses. By tax shelter abuses I mean this is a \ncompany that by all accounts now was aggressively marketing tax shelter \nabuses to clients and refuses to provide to the Treasury Department \nnames of its clients so we can find out who avoided paying taxes by \nusing the aggressive tax shelters proposed by this company. The \nTreasury Department says: On the one hand, we are investigating you \nwith a grand jury probe. On the other hand, let's give you a big \ncontract.\n  I don't understand that. I don't understand it at all. Why on Earth \nwould the Treasury Department do this?\n  This aggressive marketing of tax dodges to those who want to avoid \npaying taxes is pretty difficult for the Treasury Department to get at. \nThey have a difficult time trying to shut these down, these aggressive \ntax shelters. Because of the marketing of aggressive and abusive tax \nshelters, more and more companies have decided I want to be an American \ncompany for purposes of doing business in America and calling myself \nAmerican, but I don't want to be an American company when it comes to \npaying taxes. Then I want to call myself a citizen of the Bahamas, \nor the Cayman Islands, or the Dutch Antilles. I want to run my company \nthrough a mailbox. I want to rent a mailbox in one of these countries \nthat sets themselves up as a tax haven, and I want to run my company \nthrough a mailbox. Why? Not because that is where the company is going \nto be run from. It is because they want to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n\n  Some companies--not too many, but some--have gone the extra step of \ndeciding to dump their U.S. citizenship, renounce their U.S. \ncitizenship and become citizens of other countries.\n  These corporations are given life as an artificial person. A \ncorporation isn't a real person, but we, in law in this country, have \ndecided to create artificial persons. It is called a corporation. They \ncan sue and be sued, contract and be contracted with. They, by a \ncharter granted them in this country--in most cases by the State of \nDelaware but in other places as well--become an artificial citizen of \nthe U.S. They do business. With a corporation, they limit liability and \nthey are able to accumulate capital. It has been good for this system \nof ours, the capitalistic system, the free enterprise system. It has \nbeen good.\n  Except now this is what we are saying to companies such as KPMG, that \nare marketing aggressive tax shelters to these other companies, \nAmerican companies who want to remain American companies and want to do \neverything but pay taxes to our country. We have the largest Federal \nbudget deficit in history and we have companies trying to avoid paying \ntaxes right and left and we have a big company that was advising them \non how to avoid paying their taxes and in some cases creating abusive \nand aggressive tax shelters, and the Treasury Department says: Oh, by \nthe way, I know we are investigating you in a grand jury probe, but on \nthe other hand, let us help you out with a big, fat contract.\n  I don't understand who makes these decisions, but I don't think it is \na decision that makes sense for the taxpayers of this country. I don't \nlike the signal it sends. I don't know this company. I am not involved \nwith the people involved in this company. It is not about this being \npersonal. It seems to me, if a company, in order to curry favor with \nits clients, decides it wants to market aggressive and abusive tax \nshelters, it has to bear the responsibility for having done that. Part \nof the responsibility is not, in my judgment, bringing down a big, old \ncontract on the positive side of the ledger, to now audit the \nDepartment of the Federal Treasury.\n  Let me say, while I am at this, Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus \nhave made statements about this which I think are very admirable. I \ncould read some of them. I think the statements about this by both the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Finance Committee are right on \ntarget. Senator Grassley says:\n\n       If we could just get Federal agencies not to work at cross \n     purposes it would go a long way towards ensuring everybody \n     pays their fair share of taxes.\n\n  Senator Baucus launched a probe into the Department of Interior's \nplanned acquisition of mineral rights from a seller who wanted to claim \na big charitable deduction. That is the same thing.\n  These companies marketing these strategies these days, they even have \nnow in this country something a lot of people would find strange, \nsubway systems and city hall being sold to the private sector in a \nleaseback. You actually sell it and then lease it back so the private \ncompany can get tax benefits from a building that was owned by the \nFederal Government or State government or local government--in most \ncases it is State or local government--and it is kind of a golden \nhandshake where a building that would not be depreciated, because the \ngovernment wouldn't depreciate it, sells the building to a private \nbusiness and then leases it back so the private company can actually \ncollect more in tax benefits than it lays out to the government in the \nfirst place. It is a big tax dodge. It doesn't make any sense at all.\n  At a time when we have a giant Federal budget deficit, trying to \nfigure out how we make enterprises pay their fair share and people pay \ntheir fair share, the ordinary folks, the folks who go to work every \nday and try to do the best they can, at the end of the year file a tax \nreturn on April 15 and pay their fair share, they look at this and say \nI don't understand that. A company that makes $500 million pays zero or \nnext to zero, companies that make billions of dollars end up claiming \nthese tax dodges.\n  Let me commend Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus and encourage them \nand say, as one Member of the Senate, I hope you will be as aggressive \nas possible to try to shut this down because this makes no sense at \nall.\n\n\n                   Secret Airplane Flights after 9/11\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to mention one other issue, one \nthat I think very few people are paying as much attention to as they \nshould, especially in the press.\n  I believe my colleague from New Jersey has discussed it on the Senate \nfloor, it was discussed recently in a Commerce Committee hearing, and I \nhave discussed it in many venues--the question of something that \nhappened which was curious and very worrisome to me in the days \nfollowing September 11, 2001. Let me describe what it was. We have all \nread snippets about it, and some of them are not accurate.\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\n  In the days following 9/11, there were six secret charter flights \nthat were allowed to leave this country. They gathered up 142 Saudi \nnationals that were in the United States. They gathered up those \nSaudis, which included over two dozen members of the bin Laden family, \nand got them to a few gathering points, and on six secret charter \nflights they left this country. The public did not know they were \nleaving. The public did not know that these flights were occurring \nuntil after they left our country.\n  There have been a lot of questions about this issue. Let me describe \nsome of what is in the public record.\n  Fifteen of the 19 terrorists who struck this country on September 11, \n2001, were Saudi citizens. So who would have allowed the gathering up \nof 142 Saudi citizens to be put on 6 secret charter airplane flights to \nleave this country?\n  On September 3, 2003, Richard Clarke, head of counterterrorism in the \nWhite House at the National Security Council, said this before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. He addressed this question:\n\n       It's true that members of the bin Laden family were among \n     those who left.\n\n  That is part of the 142 Saudis who left on the 6 secret flights.\n\n       It is true that members of the bin Laden family were among \n     those who left. We knew at the time--I can't say much more in \n     open session--but it was a conscious decision with complete \n     review at the highest levels of the State Department and the \n     FBI and the White House.\n\n  That is Richard Clarke testifying before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee when asked about who allowed these secret flights. He said: \nWell, we knew about it. I can't tell you much more in open session, but \nit was a conscious decision with complete review at the highest levels \nof the State Department and the FBI and the White House.\n  Then Richard Clarke--the same Richard Clarke--appeared under oath in \nMarch 2004 at the 9/11 Commission. Here is what he said about who \nsought these secret charter flights:\n\n       I'd love to be able to tell you who did it, who brought \n     this proposal to me, but I do not know. The two possibilities \n     that are the most likely are either the Department of State \n     or the White House Chief of Staff's office.\n\n  That is what he told the 9/11 Commission when asked who proposed \nthese secret flights to be allowed to leave. He said: I do not know. \nThe two possibilities are the Department of State or the White House \nChief of Staff's office.\n  In the same testimony before the 9/11 Commission, Mr. Clark testified \nwith respect to the secret flights, and the request that the flights be \napproved:\n\n       I suggested that it be routed to the FBI, and the FBI \n     looked at the names of individuals who were going to be on \n     the passenger manifest and that they approve it or not. I \n     spoke with at the time the No. 2 person at the FBI, Dale \n     Watson, and asked him to deal with this issue. The FBI then \n     approved the flight.\n\n  That is Richard Clarke, a direct quote under oath to the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  The FBI spokesperson, speaking of these charter flights with the \nSaudis and the bin Laden family members, said:\n\n       We haven't had anything to do with arranging or clearing \n     the flights.\n\n  Then the FBI said no one was allowed to depart ``who the FBI wanted \nto interview in connection with the 9/11 attacks.''\n  That is what the FBI said. No one was allowed to leave who the FBI \nwanted to interview in connection with the 9/11 attacks.\n  However, Dale Watson, the No. 2 person at the FBI, head of \ncounterterrorism at the time of these flights, said that the FBI did \nnot conduct in-depth checks on the Saudis being repatriated.\n  He said:\n\n       They were identified but they were not subject to serious \n     interviews or interrogation.\n\n  What we now know, according to the 9/11 Commission, is that about 30 \nof the 142 Saudis who were allowed to leave were interviewed by the \nFBI. But the No. 2 person at the FBI said none of them were subject to \ninterviews or interrogation.\n  Among those who were allowed to leave this country, the Saudis--and I \nwill not use their names; though I may have used them before--was a \ncousin of Osama bin Laden who had run the U.S. operations of a charity \nthat had been accused of financing terrorism by the Governments of \nIndia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Bosnia. The FBI had investigated \nthis person dating back to 1996. His case file was reopened on \nSeptember 19, 2001, even as these flights were in progress.\n  Another individual was allowed to leave. He, it turns out, curiously, \nwas in the same hotel as three of the hijackers the night before \nSeptember 11, 2001. He was a former director of a Saudi charity that \nhas been investigated for ties to terrorism. He was interviewed by the \nFBI shortly after 9/11, but the interview was cut short when he \npretended to be ill. The FBI agent recommended that he should not be \nallowed to leave until a followup interview could occur. That \nrecommendation was not complied with, and he was allowed to return to \nSaudi Arabia without a followup interview.\n  The interesting thing about the 9/11 Commission report is what they \nsay about this flight and these citizens. The 9/11 Commission says that \nno one was allowed to depart who the FBI wanted to interview in \nconnection with the 9/11 attacks. Incidentally, we can't get the \nmanifest of the passenger list; I think Senator Lautenberg has gotten \none of them, but the rest of them have not been made available--but at \nany rate, the 9/11 Commission says that no one was allowed to depart \nwho the FBI wanted to interview in connection with the 9/11 attacks.\n  Just take that for a moment and understand what they are saying. No \none was allowed to leave who the FBI wanted to interview in connection \nwith the 9/11 attacks. What about someone who they should have \ninterviewed in connection with financing terrorist activities? What \nabout someone who they should have interviewed because of involvement \nwith a charity that had been financing terrorist activities, perhaps \nnot 9/11 but other terrorist activities?\n  They say no one was allowed to leave who the FBI wanted to interview \nin connection with these attacks, but I just described to you two \npeople who left, one who an FBI agent did not want permitted to leave, \nand the other who had his case reopened on September 19, 2001.\n  This is really a little too cute, I think. The 9/11 Commission says \nno one was allowed to leave who might have had some issue dealing with \n9/11. But what about other ties to terrorism? The issue is the \ngathering up of 142 Saudi citizens in the aftermath of 9/11--keeping in \nmind that 15 of the 19 terrorists on 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia--and \nputting these 142 people, including two dozen members of the bin Laden \nfamily, on 6 secret charter flights, disclosing those flights to no one \nuntil they left for Saudi Arabia.\n\n  The question for me is, Were any of those people involved in any way \nin the financing of terrorist activities anywhere any time in the \nworld? That has not been answered. The 9/11 Commission has not answered \nthat and may not answer it, apparently, and most people have stopped \nasking those questions.\n  My colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, asked those \nquestions. I asked those questions. The American people deserve to know \nanswers to those questions.\n  I don't allege some elaborate coverup. I allege gross incompetence. \nSomebody said that I was alleging a conspiracy at the White House. I am \nnot alleging that at all. Richard Clarke says that the decision to \nallow these six secret flights was ``at the highest levels'' of the \nState Department, the FBI, and the White House. But I am not alleging \nthere is some sort of conspiracy or connection. All I am alleging is \ngross incompetence, I think, because somebody allowed there to be \ngathered up a big group of people who should have been properly \ninterrogated, and they allowed them, before those proper \ninterrogations, to jump on six secret charter flights and were given \nopportunities no one else in this country was given. There are a lot of \nother Saudi citizens here. A lot of other people weren't given the \nopportunity to leave this country on secret flights. Why did that \nhappen? How did it happen? Who asked for it and who approved it? Those \nquestions have not yet been answered. I think the American people \ndeserve those answers.\n  We are told now that there is threat of a substantial terrorist \nattack\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\nagainst this country. Two weeks ago we were told that terrorists would \nattempt to strike this country between now and the election to disrupt \nthe election, or disrupt the two political conventions. The ability of \nthis country to detect and to stop a potential terrorist attack relies \non our ability to use good intelligence and the coordination between \nthe intelligence community and our law enforcement community. If that \ndoes not work, then we are in trouble.\n\n  I don't for the life of me understand how we could have allowed these \nsecret flights to occur without learning everything there was to learn \nfrom these passengers. One might say: Well, maybe we would not have \nlearned anything. Maybe not. I expect you would learn something from \nthe two people I described, both of whom had previously been of \ninterest to the FBI, but now, after 9/11, were not questioned \nthoroughly by the FBI. I don't know about the rest of them.\n  Someone made a grievous error, in my view. Someone did not exhibit \nthe competence we should expect from those making decisions to protect \nthis country.\n  I continue to ask these questions. I know my colleague, will, as \nwell, and I hope at some point we will find out what the answers are. \nWho authorized these flights? Why were they authorized? What is on the \npassenger manifest list? Are there more Saudis who the FBI should have \nquestioned further who were allowed to leave this country? I don't know \nthe answer to that, but this country, in my judgment, deserves an \nanswer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2694 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             20th Anniversary of Rule 208-Age 21 Enactment\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, 20 years ago this month, as Transportation \nSecretary, raising the drinking age to 21 across our Nation was a \nmeasure I was confident in supporting. I was confident it would prevent \ncrippling and disabling injuries and save thousands of lives.\n  Statistics of teens driving across State borders, ``blood borders,'' \ninto a neighboring State with a lower drinking age, then driving back \nunder the influence of alcohol, convinced me of the dire need to \neliminate the differences between State laws.\n  Senator Frank Lautenberg, Senator Richard Lugar, and former Senator \nJack Danforth were instrumental in the passage of age 21 legislation.\n  On July 17, 1984, when President Reagan signed this law in a Rose \nGarden ceremony, he said:\n\n       We know that drinking, plus driving, spells death and \n     disaster. . . . And I know there's one . . . simple measure \n     that will save thousands of young lives . . . if we raise the \n     drinking age.\n\n  And it has. Twenty thousand lives have been saved in 20 years. The \nnumbers represent real people, tragedies averted, family members and \nfriends who did not have to suffer the loss of a loved one in an \nalcohol-related automobile accident. My family had to suffer such a \nloss. My uncle, just out of college, just about to be married, was hit \nhead on and killed by a drunk driver.\n  This month also marks the 20th anniversary of another revolution in \nhighway safety. On July 11, 1984, the same week President Reagan signed \nthe age 21 law, the Department of Transportation enacted rule 208 with \nthe goal of saving as many lives as possible as quickly as possible. \nThis successfully resolved the 17-year policy dispute that spanned four \nadministrations. Rule 208 resulted in the production of airbags and the \npassage of State safety belt laws. It recognized the role of the States \nin automotive safety. No State, in July 1984, had passed a safety belt \nlaw, not a single State. Usage was only 13 percent. Airbags were \nvirtually nonexistent. In fact, I had to look all over to find a car \nwith an airbag to place on the White House lawn for President Reagan \nand the Cabinet to examine. Consumer acceptance was low. Many people \nthought airbags would go off just crossing the railroad tracks.\n\n  Most of us get into a car and automatically fasten our safety belts \ntoday. We barely notice that the vehicle has an airbag. Today, 49 \nStates have belt laws. National belt usage is 79 percent and climbing. \nThere are more than 149 million airbag-equipped vehicles on the road. \nAs of this year, all cars, light trucks, and minivans come equipped \nwith front seat airbags.\n  The National Safety Council reports that since 1984, 190,000 lives \nhave been saved through this safety trifecta: the 21 drinking age, \nState safety belt laws, and airbags. They totally changed the climate \nof highway safety in America. My hat's off to the tremendous team I had \nat the Transportation Department--Jim Burnley, Diane Steed, Phil \nHaseltine, Erika Jones, Jenna Dorn, Bob Davis--and many others, like \nChuck Hurley of the National Safety Council and the Mothers Against \nDrunk Driving.\n  According to the National Safety Council, since 1984, 157,500 lives \nhave been saved by safety belts. The National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration estimates that safety belt use has resulted in savings \nto the U.S. economy of $50 billion in medical care, lost productivity, \nand other injury-related costs. NHTSA also reports that more than \n14,500 lives have been saved by airbags.\n  The record speaks for itself; however, work remains to be done. I am \npleased the highway bill recently passed in the Senate contains \nnumerous safety provisions. In particular, I commend my colleague, \nSenator John Warner, for introducing incentives for States to enact \nprimary safety belt laws. Mothers Against Drunk Driving has voiced \nstrong support for primary belt laws, allowing a law enforcement \nofficer to write a citation when observing an unbelted driver or \npassenger. Secondary enforcement allows the citation only after \nstopping a vehicle for some other reason.\n  My home State of North Carolina was one of the first to enact primary \nbelt laws in 1985. Our usage rate last year was 86 percent. But as of \nMay 2004, only 20 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia \nhave primary laws. According to NHTSA, safety belt usage is much higher \non average in States with primary enforcement laws. Two decades after \nthe safety trifecta, incentives for State safety belt laws, airbags, \nand 21 drinking age are reported by the National Safety Council to have \nsaved 190,000 lives. This is just one example where we continue to \nstrive for improvement, strive to prevent injuries, and strive to save \nlives.\n\n\n               united states-morocco free trade agreement\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I express my support for the United States-\nMorocco Free Trade Agreement. Under the leadership of U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Robert Zoellick, the U.S. has once again negotiated a \nsound free trade agreement with a country that is energetic in their \nsupport of U.S. interests around the world.\n  I thank all of those involved in negotiating this agreement, \nespecially the dedicated staff at the U.S. Trade Representative's \nOffice and my colleagues on the Finance Committee, Chairman Grassley \nand ranking minority member Baucus. Although bilateral trade agreements \nwith relatively small countries are very time consuming and difficult, \nwhen taken in aggregate, they add up to a substantial amount of U.S. \nannual exports. In all, these smaller free-trade agreements end up \nsaving U.S. businesses millions of dollars a year in tariffs and duties \nand, therefore, are worth all the effort exerted in getting them \nnegotiated and enacted.\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\n  The United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement will open up the \nMoroccan market to fair trade and will allow U.S. companies to compete \neffectively. In fact, with the signing of this agreement, more than 95 \npercent of bilateral trade in consumer and industrial products will \nbecome duty free immediately. Industries such as information \ntechnology, machinery, chemicals, and construction equipment will gain \nimmediate duty-free access to Morocco. Agricultural markets in Morocco \nwill continue to open up to U.S. imports at a rapid pace. Service \nindustries that are so crucial to the economy of the State of Utah will \nhave rapidly increasing access to Morocco, thereby, allowing banks, \nconsulting companies, insurance companies, and telecommunications \ncompanies the ability to compete on a level playing field. Of \nparticular note in this agreement is the inclusion of antibribery and \ntransparency provisions. These provisions will help Morocco in cracking \ndown on illegal activity which hurts U.S. exporters and leads to higher \ncosts for consumers.\n  Utah companies have exported nearly $1 million worth of goods and \nservices to Morocco over the last 5 years. Although this amount seems \nrelatively modest, I take comfort in the fact that those small \nbusinesses engaged in this trade will be saving money under this \nagreement and be better positioned to increase the amount they export. \nOne million dollars in trade with Morocco may not seem like much when \nmeasured against overall Utah exports, but to those individuals whose \njobs depend on trade with Morocco, $1 million is a very big deal and I \nam proud to be able to help them. Much of the products exported by Utah \ncompanies are manufactured products and manufacturing jobs can be \ndifficult to hold on to these days. Therefore, I am pleased to help \nlower barriers around the world and make it easier for Utah \nmanufacturers and their employees to compete.\n  Utah workers, and American workers collectively, deserve to be \ntreated fairly in the world-wide marketplace and this agreement \naccomplishes that goal. Fairness and transparency only help U.S. \ncompanies compete and that is why I support the swift approval of this \nimplementing legislation.\n\n\n                   The Situation in Darfur and Sudan\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nsituation in Darfur, Sudan. I have come to the floor many times before \nto discuss this horrible crisis. I do so again today.\n  My colleague Senator Biden and I have introduced a bill, which I will \ndescribe in detail in a few minutes. Significant, I think, within the \npast hour was a very graphic video and audio description of the \nsituation in Darfur, as it appeared on CNN. I commend it to any \ncolleagues who may have the opportunity to see it, or who can even get \na transcript of that show. It is a 3- or 4-minute piece. It clearly \ndemonstrated in the most stark terms that the tragedy of Darfur \ncontinues to unfold. We saw little children who were in danger of \ndying. Some may be dying. They described one man who had been injured--\nshot within the last week by the militias who came in. So despite the \npledges of the Sudanese Government that they will stop the militias \nfrom carrying out this genocide, in fact, as we meet here today, it \ncontinues.\n  There has been a discussion about whether genocide is in fact \noccurring. Some have argued this is not genocide. So as I describe what \nis in the bill Senator Biden and I have introduced today, I want to \ndescribe for my colleagues what, under the law, it takes for genocide \nto occur, what the convention says, and what the facts are.\n  I am on the floor tonight to discuss whether what is happening in the \nDarfur region of Sudan is in fact genocide. I believe it is \ngenocide, although for some reason there seems to be some confusion \nabout what that term, in fact, means and what responsibilities come \nwith that once it is determined that genocide is taking place.\n\n  I have been using the term ``genocide'' to describe what has been \nhappening in the Darfur region of Sudan since May, and I think it is \ntime, frankly, that this body, as a whole, and the world, more \nimportantly, begins to do the same. That is why Senator Biden and I \nhave introduced a bill that refers to what is happening, in fact, as \ngenocide.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Biden, for his leadership on this \nissue. He, too, has been calling this genocide since the beginning, and \nwe hope our colleagues will join us and rightly identify the atrocities \nin Darfur as, in fact, genocide.\n  Our bill will also prevent any normalization of relations between the \nU.S. Government and the Sudanese Government unless and until the \nPresident of the United States can certify that the Government of Sudan \nis taking significant and demonstrable steps to stop the militias and \nallow humanitarian aid to flow.\n  The bill we have introduced today will allow us to place sanctions on \nSudan contingent on improvements in Darfur. Simply put, this bill will \nuse every weapon in our diplomatic arsenal to attack this problem, and, \nfrankly, that is exactly what is needed.\n  Only when the Government of Sudan satisfies the requirements laid out \nin this bill--and we have set a high but, frankly, reasonable hurdle--\nwould the Government of Sudan then be eligible for any U.S. assistance.\n  The bill will authorize $800 million in support of the north-south \npeace process, but that money will not be available until and unless \nthe Government of Sudan complies with the terms of the bill. But \nseparate and apart from that money, the bill will authorize an \nadditional $200 million for humanitarian assistance for Darfur, \nobviously not going through the Government of Sudan.\n  Let me reiterate. The $800 million that we would authorize in support \nof the north-south peace process would only be available if and when \nthe genocide has stopped, the atrocities have stopped, the humanitarian \nsituation has improved, and the President of the United States is \nconfident and willing to certify to Congress that the Government of \nSudan is protecting its people.\n  It is my hope that this bill will be passed before the summer recess \nso the pressure on the Government of Sudan begins immediately and does \nnot stop until that Government complies.\n  I want to return to the larger issue of whether what is taking place \nin Sudan now is, in fact, genocide because there does seem to be a lot \nof confusion about this issue. There should not be any confusion about \nit because what is taking place in Sudan today clearly is genocide.\n  The definition of ``genocide'' can be found in the Convention on the \nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide which entered into \nforce originally in 1951. Specifically, article 2 states that genocide \nis any one of five acts which is committed with the intent to destroy, \nin whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.\n  Let me repeat that. Specifically, article 2 states that genocide is \nany one of five acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or \nin part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.\n  Here are the five acts, any one of which will qualify for genocide.\n  First is the act of killing members of the group. There is no doubt \nthat the militias in Darfur, aided by the Government of Sudan, have \nbeen killing the Black Africans of Darfur. Their scorched Earth \ncampaign has left 30,000 dead--men, women, children. These people were \nkilled because they were Black, while their Arab neighbors went \nuntouched. That is the fact. Even when the people fled, the militias \nchased them into Chad trying to finish the job. Under this \nqualification alone, what is happening should be classified as \n``genocide.''\n\n  The second group of actions that constitute genocide under the \nConvention is causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the \ngroup. The militias have used rape as a weapon, killed children in \nfront of the parents, killed parents in front of the children, made \nhusbands stand by while their wives are raped and killed, and have done \nall of this because their victims are Black.\n  An Amnesty International report stated:\n\n       The long-term effects of these crimes can be seen in \n     countries like Rwanda where many women and children remain \n     traumatized.\n\n  In the same way, the people of Darfur will remain traumatized for \nyears to come, and this is what the militias want. The militias want to \nmake sure that the Black Africans they do not\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n\nkill are broken by the atrocities they have witnessed and suffered \nthrough.\n  Let me turn to the third measure. The third way to commit genocide is \nto deliberately inflict on a group conditions of life calculated to \nbring about a group's physical destruction in whole or in part. The \nnumbers in Darfur are appalling and clearly makes a case that this \nprovision is satisfied. Over 1 million people--1 million people--have \nbeen driven from their homes, over 400 villages have been destroyed, \nwells have been poisoned, crops have been destroyed, and granaries and \nherds have been looted. The militias and Government have done \neverything possible to ensure that the Black Africans of Darfur cannot \nsurvive even if they escape the initial killings. There is nothing left \nfor them. Their herds are gone. Their crops are gone. What is worse is \nthe Government militias are also now blocking humanitarian aid.\n  These tactics, in the face of the worst humanitarian crisis in the \nworld, can be for no other purpose than to ensure that those who escape \nthe killing now die along the way or die in camps.\n  The militias have turned the camps into prisons, killing those who \nleave in search of firewood and food. This campaign is, obviously, not \njust about driving these people off the land; it is about destroying \nthe Black African groups, and that, I say to my colleagues, is what is \ngenocide. That is genocide.\n  The final two acts that qualify as genocide are imposing measures \nintended to prevent births within a group and forcibly transferring \nchildren of the group to another group. We have reports that children \nhave been abducted and that women are being raped by Arab men to ``make \na light baby.''\n  In these societies, a child adopts the father's ethnic background, \nand by raping all of these women with the purpose of making lighter \nchildren, they are effectively meeting the fourth and fifth criteria \nfor genocide in the Convention.\n  Specifically on the fifth criteria for genocide, forcibly \ntransferring children from one group to another group, I want to share \nwith my colleagues in the Senate the story of a woman named Mecca. She \nwas killed by the militias when she tried to stop them from taking her \n3-year-old son. I am sure there are countless others who were killed \ntrying to save their children, as any parent would. For these parents, \nfor the children who have been abducted, for the girls and women who \nhave been raped, for the people dying right now, I ask this body, I \nplead with this body to support using the term ``genocide'' because \nthat is what it is.\n  Although we can make a case that all five of these provisions have \nbeen met, the Convention is very specific. The Convention states that \nany one of these actions constitutes genocide. The fact that we have \nevidence to support all five qualifying categories only makes the \ndecision to call this genocide that much easier.\n  The question remains, though, if we call it genocide, what does that \nmean? What is the significance? Maybe when we know the answer, that \nwill tell us why sometimes some people in the international community \nmay be a little reluctant to call it genocide. The answer to the \nquestion once again is right in the convention, both in its title and \nin its articles. The document is called the Convention on the \nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It is called that \nfor a good reason.\n  We need to make sure that the crimes being committed in Darfur are \nboth prevented and punished. To prevent these crimes, the Government of \nSudan and the militias need to be forced to end their reign of terror. \nWe have tried to use diplomatic pressure to get them to start. The U.N. \nSecretary General and our own Secretary of State Colin Powell both went \nto the region to plead with the Government to stop the atrocities. The \nU.N. even submitted a draft U.N. Security Council resolution including \ntargeted sanctions on the militias and an option for sanctions on the \nSudanese Government if they did not keep their promises to rein in the \nmilitias. All of this, and yet, as Secretary Powell has said, the \nGovernment of Sudan is still not keeping their promises. The atrocities \ncontinue. That means to prevent genocide, we will need more than \npromises and high-level visits.\n  Quite frankly and bluntly, we need troops on the ground. The African \nUnion is going to send 300 peacekeepers, but we all know that is not \nenough for a region that is the size of Texas. We need more countries \nto commit troops, and we, the U.S. Government, need to be prepared to \nfund and assist these troops in reaching the region and protecting the \ncivilian population of Darfur.\n  The second major responsibility we have under the convention is to \nensure that the crime of genocide is punished. The Government of Sudan \nmust try those individuals suspected of committing these atrocities, \nand if they are found guilty, they must punish them. This includes \nvetting the ranks of the military to ensure that no further militia \nmembers find refuge there. It also means not just rounding up a few \nlow-level members of the militias and punishing them. That is not \nenough.\n  In addition, the international community will not accept show trials \nand, if necessary, an international tribunal should be convened to \nensure that justice is served in Darfur.\n  Justice also must be blind to the position held by those responsible \nfor genocide. If any public officials in Sudan are guilty of genocide, \nconspiracy to commit genocide, direct and public incitement to commit \ngenocide, an attempt to commit genocide, or complicity in genocide, \nthey must be held just as accountable as the militia members \nthemselves.\n  It does no one any good to wait until after the fact to call this \ngenocide. Let's not wait 6 months. Let's not wait a year. Let's not \nwait 5 years. That is what happened in Rwanda. We cannot afford to let \nthat mistake happen again. That is why I have been calling this \ngenocide, because it is. We must call this genocide.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Biden and myself in calling this \ngenocide. I urge my colleagues to speak out. My colleagues, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Brownback, and others, have been on the floor of the \nSenate speaking about this issue. Senator Biden and I have a bill. I \nurge my colleagues to come forward and cosponsor and help us pass this \nbill. I also urge my colleagues to come forward and help us pass \nSenator Brownback's resolution condemning this as well. This is \nsomething that needs to be done. This Senate needs to speak out. This \ncountry needs to take action. The international community needs to take \naction.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that tomorrow \nmorning, immediately following morning business, the Senate resume \nconsideration of S. 2677; provided further that the time until 11:30 be \nequally divided between the chairman or ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, and at 11:30 the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the \nbill with no intervening objection or debate, and all provisions of the \ngoverning statute remain in order; I further ask that when the Senate \nreceives from the House the companion measure, the Senate proceed to \nits consideration, the bill will be read the third time and passed, \nwith no intervening action or debate; provided further, once the Senate \nhas passed the House companion, passage of S. 2677 be vitiated, and the \nbill be returned to the calendar.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today, I submit an amendment to the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, \nS.2541, to offer a more pragmatic and sustainable approach to future \nspace exploration, given the uncertainties that now confront the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n  Put simply, this substitute addresses three fundamental flaws with \nthe approach contained in the underlying bill. Like the underlying \nbill, the substitute endorses human exploration of the Solar System but \nplaces it in context alongside other, equally important, elements of \nscientific discovery in space. Second, it states that a gap in U.S. \nhuman launch capability is unacceptable and requires NASA to accelerate \nthe development of the next crewed launch vehicle. Finally, it \nauthorizes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, for \none year, fiscal year 2005, and rejects the ``go-as-you-pay'' approach \nthe Administration wants to employ in planning for human space \nexploration.\n  Allow me to discuss this final point first. The underlying bill \nauthorizes NASA at the President's requested level for five years. I \ntook a different approach--if the agency is embarking on a broad new \nprogram, it is unlikely that estimates made now will have any fidelity \nthree, four, or five years from now. After all, we were told in this \npast week--2 months before the new fiscal year will begin--that it will \nnow take at least $450 million and possibly as much as $760 million \nmore than was requested to fix the Space Shuttle just in fiscal year \n2005. If the administration cannot make accurate budget predictions \nfrom one year to the next in a 20-year old program, I am not confident \nthat we have any idea what a new exploration program will take. The go-\nas-you-pay approach is reckless and allows us to avoid difficult \nquestions regarding costs, timetables, and reaching a consensus on the \nfuture of human space exploration that will generate not only the \nsupport of the space and scientific communities, but of the Congress \nand the American people, too. It's a license to throw fiscal discipline \nout the window and drag out projects until they never finish.\n  Under the substitute I am introducing today, fiscal year 2005 will \nbecome a year of planning for a new program of human exploration. The \nsubstitute authorizes NASA a single year's funding to plan for the \ndecades of exploration ahead and to begin work on new space \ntransportation and robotic solutions. These solutions are the \npathfinders that will enable us to use earth's moon as a test-bed for \ndeveloping and demonstrating the know-how we need to conduct extended \noperations on another world's surface beginning by the year 2020.\n  The substitute attempts to put the proposed program of exploration in \ncontext. It embraces the principles of exploration and embraces the \nhuman exploration of deep space as a core mission of NASA, including \nthe demonstration of the human beings' abilities to explore and inhabit \nworlds far beyond the earth. It also embraces the ideals of space \nflight as expressed in 1958, when the original Space Act and NASA were \nfounded, and restates them in a way that makes them relevant for \ntoday--with clarity, division of purposes, and the claim that the \nUnited States shall have a U.S. space agency whose chief purpose shall \nbe to contribute to life on earth, learn more about the universe and \nthe mysteries of time and space, and provide leadership for our human \npursuits in space.\n  Under the President's plan, NASA will have a 4-year gap in our \nability to launch humans into space. The underlying bill calls for a \nstudy of the launch gap. My substitute declares it to be a matter of \nU.S. policy that any prolonged period of a year or more interruption in \nU.S. crewed space transportation shall cause the administrator of NASA \nto report and submit to the Congress a request for supplemental \nappropriations to resolve those circumstances. Since that is exactly \nthe posture we are headed into in the next decade, we require \nthe administrator to make such report and request within 60 days. In \naddition, my substitute calls on NASA to immediately begin work on the \ncrew exploration vehicle the next human-capable rocket even in the \nplanning year of FY 2005.\n\n  In addition to these three main pillars, the substitute calls for \nseveral reports to be prepared to lay the foundation for future \nprograms. It calls for a plan of objectives, capabilities, costs, and \nmilestones that will be used to\n\n[[Page S8469]]\n\nmanage the new program of human exploration.\n  The substitute requires an independent report on the changes to \nNASA's safety, operations, engineering, and management cultures to \nensure that these changes meet the requirements of the Columbia \nAccident Investigation Board and the Nation's expectations of the U.S. \nspace program. It requires NASA and the Departments of Defense and \nTransportation, each of which plays a key role in managing U.S. space \ntransportation, to report on the state of the U.S. launch industry and \nto propose how the United States can achieve reliable, affordable, and \nsafe space transportation by 2015. I also call for NASA to report on \nhow the NASA and the United States should be organized to best achieve \nour broad national goals for space, including the role of industry and \ninternational collaboration in the future.\n  In addition, consistent with the Columbia Accident Investigation \nBoard report, we apply its primary recommendation, to establish \nindependent technical and safety controls over human space flight, to \nall U.S. organizations conducting human flight in space.\n  Finally, we call for reports on the Hubble Space Telescope, peer-\nreview assessment of NASA's science programs, and grants to \ninstitutions of higher education offering advanced programs in \naeronautics and aeronautics-related disciplines. While our legislation \nattends to the primary matter at hand--the future of human space \nexploration--it does not ignore the importance of having a balanced \nprogram and view of the contributions of space and aeronautics to our \neconomy and society.\n  Mr. President, our mission to demonstrate humanity's future role in \nspace cannot be founded upon goals without solutions, means that are \nintangible and unknown, and resources tied to timelines that have no \ndefinite end-point or objective. Just this morning, the House VA-HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee reduced NASA's FY 2005 appropriation by \nover $1 billion, which makes it clear there are many doubts about this \nprogram and no consensus on how to move ahead.\n  The Congress must act now to ensure that our bold visions do not take \nthe place of the hard work of planning, budgeting, and executing \nprograms. Let us not pursue the folly of go-as-you-pay, but substitute \na reasoned course of ``pay and prove''-as-you-go, harnessing the proper \ncapabilities and assigning the necessary resources to the journey of \nhuman exploration needed to make it successful, affordable, and safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8469-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IGNORING THE ENVIRONMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the Senate is using scarce floor time \nto debate probably the most anti-environmental judicial nominee this \nbody has seen, it has blocked any attempts to strengthen environmental \nand public health protections. Sitting on deck are critical bills to \nhelp cut harmful air pollutants, combat climate change, clean up toxic \nwaste sites and protect our natural resources and improve our nuclear \nsecurity.\n  In fact, the Republican leadership only begrudgingly conceded six \nhours of floor time for Senators McCain and Lieberman's Climate \nStewardship Act after blocking its consideration during the energy \ndebate. Although the scientific and economic evidence of the toll \nclimate change is and will take on this country, the Senate leadership \ncontinues to bury its head in the sand.\n  That is 6 hours total this Congress for the environment.\n  No time to consider Senator Jeffords's Clean Power Act that would \nfinally require power plants to reduce emissions of toxic air \npollutants like mercury. No time to consider the Chemical Security Act \nthat would help ensure chemical plants are prepared for terrorist \nattacks. No time for the Toxic Cleanup Polluter Pays Renewal Act to \nreinstate fees paid by oil and chemical companies to cleanup waste \nsites across the country. No time for the Nuclear Infrastructure \nSecurity Act to improve security at over 100 nuclear facilities around \nthe country.\n  Despite bipartisan support, Republican leadership has also blocked \nconsideration of several bills to improve coastal protections. Of \ncourse, they also have failed to bring up any of the appropriations \nbills to fund our national parks, wildlife refuges and national forests \nor environmental cleanup programs.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans suffer every year from illnesses \nlinked to emissions from power plants. One-fourth of Americans live \nwithin four miles of a Superfund waste site. Shouldn't the Senate be \nspending time finding solutions to these issues instead of debating a \njudicial nominee who wants to dismantle many of environmental \nprotections?\n  Senate Republicans dare to come to the Senate floor to complain that \nDemocrats are obstructionists when we have already confirmed nearly 200 \nof President Bush's judicial nominees. The Republican leadership has \nscheduled hundreds of hours for debate on judicial nominations but has \nallowed only six hours for debate on the critical issues affecting the \nhealth of our environment.\n  Packing the bench is obviously a top priority for this \nadministration. Protecting our natural resources, along with our \nhealth, is not. By picking the most extreme judicial nominees, on the \nenvironment and other issues, the Bush administration demonstrates that \none of its real long-term goals is to roll back these important \nprotections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8469-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8469-S8470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CARL D. PERKINS VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Carl D. \nPerkins Vocational and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2004.\n  I am extremely pleased that this bill was written in a bipartisan \nfashion. I thank Senator Enzi, Senator Gregg, Senator Kennedy and their \nstaff members, Scott Fleming, Ilyse Schulman, Kelly Scott, and Jane \nOates, for working so hard and so quickly to make this happen. I \nsincerely hope that we continue in this spirit of bipartisanship as we \nwork together on future legislation coming out of the HELP Committee.\n  It is an often-overlooked fact that the Perkins program is the \nlargest Federal investments in our Nation's high schools. Over 66 \npercent of all public high schools have at least one vocational and \ntechnical education program and 96 percent of high school students in \nthis country will take at least one vocational or technical course \nwhile they are in high school. In New York, this means that over \n275,000 high school students benefited from Perkins Act programs last \nyear.\n  Perkins also plays a key role in postsecondary education. According \nto the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly 38 percent of \nall degree-seeking undergraduates are pursuing vocational careers. When \nI travel throughout New York, I hear about how important career and \ntechnical education is for tens of thousands of New Yorkers. \nInstitutions such as the Adirondack Community College and the Culinary \nInstitute of America in the Hudson River Valley and thousands of our \nNation's community colleges, skill centers and other postsecondary sub-\nbaccalaureate institutions rely on the Perkins program to help provide \nvocational and technical courses to students.\n  Last year, 65 New York community colleges received funding under the \nPerkins Act, directly benefiting over 200,000 community college \nstudents. These schools use the funds to provide career counselors and \nacademic curricula that guide students toward high-wage and high-skill \noccupations.\n  The Perkins program is extremely important--not just for the numbers \nof students it serves but for the communities that benefit from a \nbetter prepared workforce as a result of these programs. This is why \nfor the last 2 years I have spearheaded a letter to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee requesting additional funding for Perkins. I \nalso offered an amendment to the budget resolution in 2003 to protect \nthe Perkins programs from cuts because I was deeply concerned that \nPresident Bush's proposal to slash the Perkins program by 25 percent \nwould be reflected in the Senate's budget.\n  The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Improvement \nAct of 2004 will go a long way towards strengthening vocational and \ntechnical\n\n[[Page S8470]]\n\neducation in New York and across the country. Among other things, it \nwill provide for comprehensive professional development for career and \ntechnical education teachers, increase States' flexibility to meet \ntheir unique needs, and align secondary and postsecondary indicators \nwith those established in other programs to ultimately reduce \npaperwork.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill also improves programs and \nservices for women and girls pursuing nontraditional occupations. A few \nweeks ago at a HELP Committee hearing on vocational education, an \ninspiring woman from New York, Angela Olszewski, testified about how \nimportant it is that we support and encourage women and girls in their \npursuit of nontraditional, traditionally ``male'' careers--in \ntechnology, math, science, and the construction and building trades. \nUnfortunately, women are still significantly underrepresented in these \nfields. For example, we know that while the number of women carpenters \nhas tripled since 1972, they still only represent 1.7 percent of all \ncarpenters. You can say the same about many other high-skill, high-wage \ntrades.\n  Many of these skilled trades industries are experiencing a \nsignificant labor shortage and experts expect these shortages to get \nworse over the next two decades as many workers retire. If women were \nto enter these professions, most of which are unionized and pay a \nlivable paycheck and benefits, women would increase their earnings and \nstandard of living for their families. For example, a journey-level \nelectrician will make over $1,000,000 more than a typical cashier in a \n30-year career. That would go a long way toward putting many women on \nthe road towards selfsufficiency. I want all New York women--and women \nthroughout the country--to have the same opportunities. This bill helps \nus toward that goal.\n  I also want to highlight another successful program started in New \nYork called Project Lead the Way. This program builds partnerships \namong public schools, institutes of higher education, and the private \nsector to promote pre-engineering and technology courses for middle \nschool and high school students. Project Lead the Way is now a presence \nin more than 875 schools in 39 States and should serve as an example \nfor career and technical education of the future.\n  I am very pleased with this legislation; it shows that we are moving \nin the right direction, tweaking our education policies to better serve \nour Nation's career and technical students. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues as this bill goes to conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8470-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8470-S8471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ESSAY FROM THE 9/11 FAMILY STEERING COMMITTEE\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing essay be printed in the Record on behalf of Kristen \nBreitweiser, Patricia Casazza, Mindy Kleinberg and Lorie Van Auken who \nlost their husbands on September 11, 2001 and became advocates on \nbehalf of their own families and all who were affected by the tragic \nevents of that day.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        What Is A Citizen To Do?\n\n       How could 19 middle-eastern men simultaneously hijack 4 \n     commercial airplanes in two hours, crash them into the World \n     Trade Center and the Pentagon and murder 3000 innocent \n     people?\n       With the billions spent each year on defense and \n     intelligence, why did our nation do so little in a defensive \n     posture to mitigate the vast devastation that was brought \n     upon us by these 19 men?\n       Our research began with every agency and every policy that \n     could possibly shed some light on why the tragedy of 9/11 was \n     not averted. With each revelation and each new understanding, \n     our naivete waned and the challenges loomed large. The \n     problems were systemic in nature. Changes were needed \n     everywhere. Agencies, 20 years after the Cold War had ended, \n     were still operating in a Cold War posture. Terrorists were \n     not watch-listed. FBI computers were antiquated. Intelligence \n     agents and supervisors failed to analyze and investigate \n     creatively, aggressively, and with curiosity. Congress and \n     the Executive Branch failed to properly share their growing \n     National Security concerns and garner the will of the nation \n     to fight this new war against terrorism. The media was more \n     prone to cover scandal than terrorism.\n       Our research revealed that numerous indicators throughout \n     our intelligence history illustrated the use, or intended use \n     of planes as missiles. We found field reports, case files and \n     studies, eye witness testimony, intelligence community threat \n     matrices, and Department of Defense mock drills all \n     addressing the ``planes as missiles'' idea.\n       In fact, during the summer of 2001, President Bush attended \n     the G-8 summit in Genoa Italy where specific protections were \n     put into place to ward against an air attack. Moreover, FBI \n     agents testified in the Embassy bombing trial in NYC during \n     the spring of 2001 that al-Qaeda was interested in suicide \n     hijackers flying planes into buildings--buildings like the \n     World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Finally, we learned that \n     the Olympic Games in Atlanta and Salt Lake City had included \n     aerial attacks in their security protocols.\n       Indeed, most haunting is what we found out about al-Qaeda \n     and their attempt to attack Atlanta, Georgia during the \n     summer Olympics. Because of the heightened protection and \n     alert status during the Atlanta Games, al-Qaeda got \n     ``spooked'' and called off their planned attack. And thus \n     began the ``what ifs?''\n       What if the pre-9/11 national security apparatus', agencies \n     and institutions had matched themselves with similar alert \n     levels? What if the 19 hijackers on 9/11 noticed that same \n     type of vigilant security, gotten spooked themselves and \n     delayed their attack by days or even months? More potently, \n     would such a delay have given enough time to our Intelligence \n     Community to discover and/or minimize the damage of the plot?\n       Could the FBI have had enough time to receive the FISA \n     warrant on Zaccharias Moussaoui? After all, the FBI had \n     enough information to meet probable cause for a FISA warrant \n     because French intelligence in August 2001 had handed over a \n     huge file on Moussaoui linking him to terrorist groups. \n     Moreover, given the fact that Moussaoui was attending the \n     same flight school that the FBI had investigated since 1998 \n     because of the many known middle-eastern terrorists training \n     there, maybe the FBI could have applied for and received a \n     simple criminal warrant.\n       Perhaps, the internal decision in May 2001 by FISA Court \n     Chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth that had a ``chilling effect'' \n     on all FBI surveillance and wiretapping of terrorist \n     organizations--including Al-Qaeda cells in the US, during the \n     spring and summer 2001 could have been lifted or at the very \n     least tempered?\n       Or maybe the hijackers could have been watch-listed and \n     forbidden to fly on commercial flights? What if the airline \n     pilots were told that hijackers were capable of flying \n     commercial airliners and to not allow anyone into the \n     cockpit--whether or not they were in uniform? What if airport \n     security was told to be on the lookout for possible terrorist \n     suspects and/or contraband such as gas masks, mace, pepper \n     spray, guns and/or knives?\n       Could the NSA have translated the phone conversations or \n     intercepts of the hijackers, Bin Laden, Bin Laden family \n     members, and other Al-Qaeda operatives that they had in their \n     possession throughout the summer and early fall of 2001? \n     Could the NSA have acted on and/or communicated this \n     information to the FBI, CIA, and National Security Council in \n     time?\n       Perhaps, FBI Agent David Frasca may have had the time to \n     read the Phoenix memorandum and the Moussaoui information \n     both of which were on his desk by August 2001 and put the two \n     files together?\n       Could the FBI have had the time to find two of the \n     hijackers, Al-Midhar and Al-hazmi, who were already under \n     investigation for two years by the CIA after it had conducted \n     surveillance on a terrorist meeting in Malaysia in January \n     2000? After all, Al-Midhar and Al-Hazmi were living in San \n     Diego, listed in the phone book, had bank accounts in their \n     own names, trained at flight schools and resided with a known \n     FBI informant?\n       Could the CIA have found Marwan Al-Shehi? He was Mohammed \n     Atta's roommate and visited the same flight school that \n     Moussaoui was arrested at by the FBI. The CIA had the name \n     ``Marwan'' and a phone number given to them by the German \n     government. Could they have had the time to follow-up with \n     this information?\n       Could our National Security Council's Principals who first \n     met on September 4, 2001 had more time to hold a second \n     meeting where they could have discussed the threat spikes and \n     foreign government warnings from Russia, Israel, Germany, and \n     Egypt that Al-Qaeda was planning an imminent and spectacular \n     attack on the domestic US? Would our NSC Principals have had \n     the time to harden our homeland security?\n       Could NORAD have placed fighter jets on shorter alert \n     status, so that our air defense did not arrive too late like \n     it did on 9/11? Perhaps, with over an hour's worth of notice \n     before the attack on the Pentagon, the F-16's could have \n     arrived on time to protect our Department of Defense.\n       Could we learn from this tragedy so that it would not be \n     repeated? Could our fellow citizens be willing to shed \n     sunlight onto the inadequacies of our government's ability to \n     defend itself against terrorism? Could our elected officials \n     cease the diversionary tactics of ``mudslinging'' and ``name-\n     calling'' long enough to allow the facts to be revealed, \n     examined, and fixed? Could the media no longer fall prey to \n     sensational stories and feed the public information that \n     truly informs and educates them about our nation's ability to \n     fight terrorism?\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\n       Democracy cannot prosper on blind-faith. To work \n     effectively, democracy's foundation--the people, must be well \n     informed. And, in order to be more informed, more responsive, \n     and more prepared for the challenges ahead, we must continue \n     to ask questions to our leaders; that is our duty as \n     responsible citizens. It is why the 9/11 Independent \n     Commission's investigative work, public hearings, public \n     Final Report and public Recommendations are so vital.\n       The only way elected officials, agencies and institutions \n     can be held accountable and responsible is if we, the \n     American people, stay vigilant and informed. Before 9/11, the \n     will of the nation to fight terrorism was not present. Post \n     9/11, the will of this nation exists to confront the battle \n     of terrorism.\n       But fighting terrorism is not simply an offensive strategy. \n     It is a combined and cumulative process. We need the \n     intelligence agencies to investigate more creatively and \n     aggressively. We need our judicial process to permit the fair \n     and just prosecution of terrorists. We need our foreign \n     policy to issue sanctions to all countries that sponsor \n     terrorism, even if that means our foreign economic dependency \n     suffers. We need our Treasury Department to have the \n     resources to dry up money lines that fund terrorist \n     organizations. We need big business interests to yield to the \n     common good.\n       Our elected officials who take an oath of office to lead, \n     protect, and serve need to be held responsible and \n     accountable. They must have the courage and curiosity to ask \n     questions, to have established and reliable plans and back-up \n     plans, to demand action, reforms and to welcome personal \n     responsibility.\n       Most importantly, our elected officials need to remember \n     that they are serving at the will of the people. As our \n     public stewards, it should not be the sanctity of their own \n     political well-being that most consumes their actions and \n     decisions. More correctly, it should be the safety, security \n     and well-being of the people that they serve that should pre-\n     occupy their time.\n       In a post-9/11 world, it is the responsible preservation of \n     all life that must transcend politics.\n     Kristen Breitweiser,\n     Patricia Casazza,\n     Mindy Kleinberg,\n     Lorie Van Auken,\n       Members of the 9/11 Family Steering Committee for the 9/11 \n     Independent Commission.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. In light of the pending release of the 9/11 Commission \nreport, I wish to recognize the Family Steering Committee for the 9/11 \nIndependent Commission and their efforts to establish the National \nCommission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8471-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HONORING THE CITY OF MENNO\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I honor and publicly recognize the \n125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Menno, SD. The city of \nMenno has a proud past and a promising future.\n  The area that was to become the city of Menno was settled in 1874 by \na group of Black Sea Germans from Russia. The great majority of \nsettlers made their living off the land. According to a U.S. Government \nsurvey, Menno and the land surrounding it is made up of some of the \nrichest most fertile soil in the country. Menno owes its beginnings to \nthe railroad industry, which brought much-needed commerce.\n  The city of Menno bears the name intended for the town of Freeman, 10 \nmiles away. When railroad officials were nailing the signs bearing the \nnames of new towns to the depots, the name boards of the neighboring \ntowns of Menno and Freeman were accidentally interchanged. With the \nresult that Menno derives its name from the large settlement of \nMennonites at Freeman, called Mennonites because the sect was founded \nby Menno Simons, while the town of Freeman is named for an early \nsettler of Menno. The city of Menno was officially settled in 1879.\n  Currently, more than 800 people live in Menno. The city has already \nstarted celebrations for its 125th anniversary and will continue them \nthroughout the year. It is with great honor that I advise my colleagues \nof the achievements made by this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8471-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING THE MUHLENBERG CAREER DEVELOP\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I take the opportunity to \nhonor the Muhlenberg Career Development Center. Beginning with the \ngroundbreaking in 1973, this institution has been working diligently to \nbetter the lives of all its students. This has been acknowledged by a \nfour-star rating from the National Job Corps Association and by the \nNational Job Corps Award for Excellence it received from the same \nassociation earlier this year. The Career Center also received a ``Top \n50'' national ranking for Job Corps centers.\n  The Muhlenberg Career Development Center has a profound impact on the \nsurrounding community. The center employs 135 men and women, making it \nthe fourth largest employer in Muhlenberg County. The center also \ngenerates a substantial amount of revenue for the community through the \ncontract it has with the Department of Labor. The standard of \nexcellence set by the career development center is greatly appreciated \nby the 404 students who are currently working towards a GED and \nvocation there. The dedication exhibited by the Muhlenberg Career \nDevelopment Center towards its students, county, State, and country \ndeserves to be recognized and honored.\n  The citizens of Kentucky are proud to have the Muhlenberg Career \nDevelopment Center as a part of their community. Their example of hard \nwork and determination should be followed by all in the Commonwealth. \nThe Muhlenberg Career Development Center has successfully found a way \nto bring out the best in its men and women. I personally thank the \nleaders and supporters of this great organization for continually \nproducing strong and bright men and women committed to making Kentucky \na better place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8471-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8471-S8472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. NEAL R. BERTE\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to pay \ntribute to an outstanding citizen from my home State of Alabama. Dr. \nNeal Berte has been president of Birmingham-Southern College in Alabama \nsince 1976. He recently retired, ending his 29 years of service to this \ngreat liberal arts institution. It has been my pleasure to work with \nDr. Berte during my time in the Senate on issues affecting higher \neducation and community service in the Birmingham area.\n  Dr. Berte recognized early on in his career the need to produce \nfuture leaders rich in a background of service to others. Therefore, he \nmade service-learning a priority for himself and Birmingham-Southern \nstudents. Almost every student who graduates from Birmingham Southern \nCollege leaves the Hilltop having had some type of community-service \nexperience. From serving food at a homeless shelter to mentoring \nchildren at the local elementary school, the opportunities are endless \nand involvement is always encouraged. Dr. Berte has led this effort by \ndeeds, not words. He is the first to arrive at a service event and the \nlast to leave. His involvement in the local community is unparalleled \nand has led to his being awarded Birmingham's Distinguished Citizen \nAward, Citizen of the Year, and the Erskine Ramsey Award for \nOutstanding Civic Service.\n  While developing and implementing an aggressive service-learning \ncomponent to higher education has been a great achievement at \nBirmingham-Southern, it is far from being his only accomplishment. \nDuring the ``Berte years,'' Birmingham-Southern College's student \nenrollment has doubled, the academic profile of the student body has \nincreased and regularly leads other Alabama colleges and universities, \nthe number of faculty has increased by almost 70 percent, the student-\nfaculty ratio has lowered from 18-to-1 to 12-to-1, the campus has \nexpanded, and the college's endowment has grown from $11 million to \nmore than $122 million. It is difficult to fully gauge the impact Dr. \nand Mrs. Berte have had over the past 29 years, however, perhaps it is \nbest captured in Dr. Berte's relationship with the students that have \nflowed through the campus. Dr. Berte's support of the student body has \nbeen unwavering. From attending campus sporting events to carrying the \nboxes of new students on move-in day, Dr. Berte's face has been a \nconstant presence at events throughout each school year. Amazingly, he \nhas learned the name and face of almost every student who has walked \nthe halls at BSC and makes it a priority to greet each person he meets \nby name and to inquire about something occurring in his or her life at \nthe moment. I think this\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\ncommitment to the students, the life of any college, is what sets Dr. \nBerte apart and makes his retirement so poignant for so many of the \nschool's faculty, alumni, and friends. For many, Dr. Berte is \nBirmingham-Southern.\n  Birmingham-Southern has achieved great success during Dr. Berte's \ntime as president. The college has been consistently recognized by U.S. \nNews & World Report as one of America's top national liberal arts \ncolleges. It is currently a Tier I institution and ranked among the top \n66 liberal arts colleges in the country. Its other recognitions include \n``100 Best Values in Private Colleges,'' ``America's Best Christian \nColleges,'' ``Most Efficiently Operated Schools in America,'' \n``Colleges that Encourage Character Development,'' and ``Best Values.'' \nThe school is home to a Phi Beta Kappa chapter and annually ranks No. 1 \namong Alabama schools in percentage of all graduates accepted to \nmedical and dental schools.\n  When Dr. Berte took over at Birmingham-Southern things were not so \nrosy. There had been several short-term presidents and the college \nfaced many challenges. Few would dispute that his leadership has \nguaranteed that Birmingham-Southern is one of the premier liberal arts \ncolleges in America and that few, if any, such colleges have had better \nleadership in the past 30 years. Dr. Berte has led with vision, \ncompassion, constancy, faith, and courage. His superb graduates daily \nvalidate the value of the liberal arts curriculum. I have watched his \nsuccess over the years with growing admiration. He has truly been one \nof the best college presidents in America.\n  But, as it is with any great thing, Dr. Berte's tenure must end. He \nwill remain chancellor of Birmingham-Southern College and go on to \nincrease his involvement in the community, as well as spend some much \ndeserved time with his wife, children, and grandchildren. As \nBirmingham-Southern begins a new era with a new president, I would just \nlike to take a moment to thank Dr. Berte for his service to this \ninstitution and the State of Alabama. I wish him the best and would \nlike to echo his optimism that ``the best is yet to come.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8472-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING THE CITY OF ELKTON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish today to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Elkton, \nSD. The city of Elkton has a proud past and a promising future.\n  The first settler in the area had been E.D. Johnson, who in the \nspring of 1877 had obtained a tree claimed half a mile north of the \nfuture site of the town. Other families started to move into the area \nin 1878 just in time for the railroad to arrive in 1879. Railroad \nofficials wanted to place a station between the communities of Verdi \nand Aurora. Local railroad officials named it Ivanhoe, originally. Not \nuntil July 21, 1882 was its name changed officially from Ivanhoe to \nElkton. The name came from Elkton, MD, which was the early home of one \nof the railroad officials. The town was plotted in the spring of 1880 \nand soon sprouted a variety of different businesses.\n  In 1896, an Elkton man named Henry Heintz obtained a patent on what \nsome locals believe could have been the first airship in the United \nStates. Working with Henry Wulf of Arizona, Heintz built a machine \nwhich lifted off the ground in its trial flight, to the amazement and \ndelight of spectators. The craft wouldn't move ahead, however, and \nreturned almost immediately to earth. There are apparently no records \nof rebuildings and further attempts.\n  Currently, more than 600 people live in Elkton. The city has already \nstarted celebrations for its 125th anniversary and will continue them \nthroughout the year. These include an all-high school alumni reunion \nand a street dance. It is with great honor that I advise my colleagues \nof the achievements made by this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8472-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:23 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nHouse Resolution 719 the Senate is requested to return to the House of \nRepresentatives the bill (H.R. 4766) making appropriations for \nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and \nRelated Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, and for \nother purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 142.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to replace \nthe recapture bond provisions of the low income housing tax credit \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \ncorrect a problem that is impairing the efficiency of the Low-Income \nHousing Tax Credit program. As my colleagues know, the low-income \nhousing credit has been a remarkably successful incentive for \nencouraging investment in residential rental housing for low-income \nfamilies. Under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code, a tax credit \nis available for investment in affordable housing. The credit is \nclaimed annually over a period of ten years. Qualified residential \nrental projects must be rented to lower-income households at controlled \nrents and satisfy a number of other requirements throughout a \nprescribed compliance period which is generally 15 years from the first \ntaxable year the credit is claimed.\n  Today, virtually all of the equity for housing credit investments \ncomes from publicly-traded corporations investing through housing \ncredit funds. An investor wishing to dispose of an interest in housing \ncredit property during its 15-year compliance period is subject to a \nrecapture of housing credits previously claimed unless a bond or U.S. \nTreasury securities are posted to the Internal Revenue Service. The \namount of the bond to be posted is based on the amount of housing \ncredits claimed and the duration remaining in the compliance period. \nThe purpose of the bond is to guarantee to the IRS that it can collect \nthe appropriate recapture tax amount in the event that the property is \nno longer in compliance with the requirements of the housing credit \nprogram.\n  At the time the housing credit program was enacted in 1986, the \ndrafters of the statute were concerned that owners would claim the \nbenefits of the tax credits and then avoid the continuing compliance \nrequirements by transferring the credits to a straw party with minimal \nassets that the IRS could go after to collect recapture tax liability. \nThis was a potential concern because housing credits are provided on an \naccelerated basis in the sense that they are claimed over a ten-year \nperiod, while the property must remain in compliance with the targeting \nrules over a minimum 15-year period.\n  However, the experience with the housing credit over the past 15 \nyears demonstrates that this concern no longer has any validity. When \nthe housing credit program was enacted, policymakers were thinking in \nterms of previous affordable housing tax incentives that supported an \naggressive\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\ntax shelter market dominated by individual investors. As it turns out, \nover 99 percent of the investment capital in the housing credit program \ncomes from publicly-traded corporations that pose none of the risks of \nnoncompliance that motivated enactment of the recapture bond rules in \nthe first place. Ironically, sales of individual partnership interests \nin low-income housing fund public partnerships with more than 35 \ninvestors are exempt from the recapture bond rules.\n  There are also a number of other provisions in Code section 42 that \nadequately address potential noncompliance. In 1989, Congress added the \nrequirement that all state allocating agencies adopt ``extended use \nagreements'' to be recorded as restrictive covenants on housing credit \nproperties, which require the property to remain in compliance. In \naddition, the State allocating agencies were given oversight \nresponsibilities to ensure continued compliance through site \ninspections and property audits.\n\n  The requirement to purchase recapture bonds forces investors to incur \nunnecessary costs and has produced a complex administrative burden on \nthe IRS. Because bond filings are done building-by-building, and single \nsales transactions frequently involve hundreds of properties, each with \ndozens of buildings, bond filings may involve thousands of separate \nfilings. Worse yet, the few remaining surety companies writing this \ntype of business operate in a very inefficient market. Recapture surety \nbonds are priced in a fashion that does not measure the true risk of \nnon-compliance, but rather relies solely on the credit rating of the \ncompany requesting the bond. This is a function of the fact that surety \nunderwriters do not understand the housing credit program in general or \nthe risk of non-compliance in particular. At the same time, the \nincidence of non-compliance with housing credit program rules is \nexceedingly rare.\n  Meanwhile in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist acts and \nthe spate of corporate accounting scandals that occurred in 2002, the \nsurety market has been in turmoil. Recapture bond premiums, even for \nhighly rated public companies, have more than tripled over the past two \nyears. This has imposed dead weight costs on the housing credit \nprogram. By making it more difficult to transfer credit investments, \nthe recapture bond rule impairs the liquidity of housing credit \ninvestments, reducing credit prices generally, and undermining the \noverall efficiency of the program. In the absence of the recapture bond \nrequirement, more dollars would flow into affordable housing itself and \nless into the higher rate of return that must be paid to investors to \ncompensate for the dead weight costs that the bonds impose on the \nprogram.\n  The IRS recently responded to a series of questions posed about the \nrecapture bond requirement. According to the IRS, between 1997 and \n2003, recapture bonds covering approximately $1.8 billion of tax \ncredits have been posted with the Treasury but in the 17 years since \nthe requirement was enacted, the Service has never made a single claim \non a recapture bond. That works out to bond premium payments in excess \nof $150 million to ensure against an event that has never occurred. \nThese costs are unnecessary and are imposing a real drag on the market \nfor investments in housing credit properties.\n  My bill will solve this problem by repealing the recapture bond \nrequirement effective for disposition of interests in LIHTC properties \nafter the date of enactment. An owner of a building, or interest \ntherein, that has been the subject of a disposition and is still within \nthe remaining 15-year compliance period with respect to such building \nwould be required to submit a report to its former investors when a \nrecapture event with respect to such building occurs. A copy of \nrecapture event forms sent to investors would be required to be filed \nwith the IRS in order to provide the Service with the information \nnecessary to ensure that all recapture liabilities are timely paid.\n  The general statute of limitations applicable to taxpayers would also \nbe modified so that investors who dispose of a building after the \neffective date of the legislation would remain liable for any potential \nrecapture liability for a period extending through the compliance \nperiod for such building to provide the IRS with additional time to \naudit the partnership's return to ensure the building's continuing \ncompliance with the credit's requirements. Taxpayers who disposed of a \nbuilding (or interest therein) prior to the date of enactment would not \nbe required to maintain existing recapture bonds (or other alternative \nsecurity), but cancellation of existing bonds would trigger an \nextension of the statute of limitations provided for in the \nlegislation.\n  These changes will improve the overall efficiency of the housing \nprogram and ensure that more dollars actually flow into affordable \nhousing. This is a very important improvement in an otherwise excellent \nprogram, and I encourage my colleagues to join with me in cosponsoring \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. The legislation is identical to a bill that Congressmen \nHoughton, Johnson, Neal, and Rangel have introduced in the House. I \nalso ask unanimous consent to include a copy of a letter from 12 \nnational housing organizations to Chairman Bill Thomas endorsing the \nHouse bill, H.R. 3610.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2689\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

William M. Thomas,\n      Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thomas: We are writing in support of H.R. \n     3610, legislation introduced by Representatives Amo Houghton, \n     Nancy Johnson, Charles Rangel, and Richard Neal, to repeal \n     the recapture bond rules under section 42(j) of the Low-\n     Income Housing Tax Credit program. We believe that repeal of \n     the recapture bond rules will remove an unnecessary \n     impediment to the transferability of housing credit \n     investments, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the \n     LIHTC program and ensuring that more private resources wind \n     up in the production of affordable housing in return for \n     federal housing credits.\n       Our organizations play an active role in support of \n     affordable housing policies. We represent builders, owners, \n     investors, credit agencies, nonprofit housing groups, and \n     capital aggregators, all with extensive experience with the \n     housing credit program. The housing credit program has been a \n     remarkably successful federal initiative that has delivered \n     affordable housing to over a million low and moderate-income \n     households. The program has operated very successfully and \n     has been an efficient means of delivering federal support. \n     But one notable exception that has been of concern to the \n     industry for many years has been the requirement that when an \n     investor disposes of an interest in housing credit property, \n     a recapture bond must be purchased to guarantee payment to \n     the Treasury of any potential recapture tax liability.\n       We believe this requirement impedes the transferability of \n     credits, reduces investor demand for housing credits, and \n     causes yields to be higher than necessary, which means that \n     fewer federal resources wind up in housing credit properties. \n     More importantly, this requirement imposes a significant and \n     unnecessary cost on the program. While tens of millions of \n     dollars have been expended on recapture bond premiums, the \n     IRS has never collected on a recapture bond in the 17-year \n     history of the LIHTC. Furthermore, we believe there is no \n     public policy rationale for such bonds. The housing credit \n     market is made up almost exclusively of large corporate \n     investors who pose no risk to the Treasury that they will \n     ignore their responsibility to pay a potential recapture tax \n     liability. Indeed, there is no other provision in the \n     Internal Revenue Code that requires taxpayers to post a bond \n     to ensure payment of a potential tax liability. Moreover, \n     noncompliance in the housing credit program is very small. In \n     a recent letter to Reps. Houghton and Johnson, the Internal \n     Revenue Service points out that the typical means of \n     ownership through investment partnerships ``minimizes the \n     risk of recapture from any one project.'' In that letter, \n     the Service goes on to say that ``supporting the bond/\n     security process is administratively difficult.''\n       H.R. 3610 will correct this situation by removing the \n     requirement that a recapture bond be purchased when there is \n     a disposition of interests in LIHTC properties. The \n     legislation replaces this unnecessary and expensive \n     requirement with two new provisions that will improve the \n     ability of the Treasury to collect potential recapture tax \n     liability. First, investors who dispose of an interest in \n     housing credit property would automatically be subject to a \n     longer statute of limitations for any potential recapture tax \n     liability that is identified in the future in connection with \n     their ownership of housing credits. Second, improved \n     information reporting would be required whereby the owner of \n     housing credit property would be required to notify former \n     investors and the IRS of any recapture liability that arises \n     in connection with the period that the former investor owned \n     an interest in the property.\n       We believe these changes will improve the administration of \n     the housing credit program, better protect the interests of \n     the Treasury, and result in more private dollars going into \n     the development of affordable housing.\n       National Housing Conference; National Association of Home \n     Builders; Affordable Housing Investors Council; National \n     Multi Housing Council; National Leased Housing Association; \n     National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders; National \n     Association of State and Local Equity Funds; Affordable \n     Housing Tax Credit Coalition; Local Initiatives Support \n     Corporation/National Equity Fund; The Enterprise Foundation/ \n     Enterprise Social Investment Corporation; Council for \n     Affordable and Rural Housing; National Association of Local \n     Housing Finance Agencies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2692. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to make grants to States for affordable \nhousing for low-income persons, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nAffordable Housing Preservation Act of 2004, along with my colleagues, \nSenators Sarbanes and Feinstein. This bill provides matching Federal \nfunds to States and localities seeking help to acquire and rehabilitate \naffordable housing that would otherwise be lost from the affordable \nhousing inventory.\n  Affordable housing is facing a funding crisis. Across the country, \nthe administration's proposed $1.6 billion budget cuts for Section 8, \nwhich serves nearly 3.5 million low-income households nationwide, would \nseriously undermine the availability of quality affordable housing. In \nVermont, there are 6,080 authorized vouchers available this year. But \nwith the proposed budget cut, Vermont could lose more than 700 vouchers \nnext year alone. That's a loss of $4 million for housing assistance \njust in my small State. Over the next five years, it is estimated that \nVermont could lose as many as 1,770 housing vouchers.\n  Affordable housing is a basic and critical need in every town and \ncity, and these cuts are as indefensible as they are damaging. Cutting \naffordable housing is not about apartments and houses. It is about \nindividuals and families, including our seniors, not having a safe and \naffordable place to call home. I have joined with many of my colleagues \nto protest these cuts.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Affordable Housing Preservation \nAct of 2004, represents an effort to complement the good work being \ndone throughout the country on Section 8 initiatives, and it strives to \npreserve existing affordable housing. Specifically, this bill would \nconserve federally subsidized housing units by providing matching \ngrants to States and localities, seeking to preserve privately owned, \naffordable housing.\n  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would make \ndeterminations for the grants based on a number of factors, including \nthe number of affordable housing units at risk at being lost and the \nlocal market conditions in which displaced residents would have to find \ncomparable new housing options. These funds would make a great deal of \ndifference in keeping affordable housing affordable. States and \nlocalities could use the funds to acquire or rehabilitate affordable \nhousing. They could use the funds, in part, for administrative and \noperating expenses. Properties with mortgages insured by HUD, Section 8 \nproject-based assisted housing, and properties that are being purchased \nby residents would all be eligible for the matching grant funds. I \nbelieve that flexibility with the funding would make this program more \nefficient and cost effective, and, most importantly, more helpful to \nthe recipients themselves.\n\n[[Page S8478]]\n\n  Over the past several months, I have heard from many of my \nconstituents who are genuinely concerned about Vermonters who are \nthreatened with the loss of housing. This bill would give State and \nlocal housing authorities another tool to keep people in their homes. I \nbelieve we must act now to preserve our existing stock of affordable \nhousing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2692\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (H) the Nation would be well served by providing assistance \n     to such entities to aid in accomplishing this purpose.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to continue the partnerships among the Federal \n     Government, State and local governments, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the private sector in operating and \n     assisting housing that is affordable to low-income persons \n     and families;\n       (B) to promote the preservation of affordable housing units \n     by providing matching grants to States and localities that \n     have developed and funded programs for the preservation of \n     privately owned housing that is affordable to low-income \n     families and persons; and\n       (C) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants who \n     are currently residing in such housing, many of whom are \n     elderly or disabled persons and families with children.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Capital expenditures.--The term ``capital \n     expenditures'' includes expenditures for acquisition and \n     rehabilitation.\n       (2) Consortium.--The term ``consortium'' means a group of \n     geographically contiguous localities that jointly submit an \n     application under subsection (d).\n       (3) Eligible affordable housing.--The term ``eligible \n     affordable housing'' means housing that--\n       (A) consists of more than 4 dwelling units;\n       (B) is insured or assisted under a program of the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Department \n     of Agriculture under which the property is subject to \n     limitations on tenant rents, rent contributions, or incomes;

PRESERVATION PROJECTS.\n\n       Section 524(e)(1) of the Multifamily Assisted Housing \n     Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (42 U.S.C. 1437f note) \n     is amended by striking ``amounts are specifically'' and \n     inserting ``sufficient amounts are''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2694. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the automatic enrollment of medicaid beneficiaries for \nprescription drug benefits under part D of such title, and for other \npurposes; read the fist time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Medicare \nAssurance of Prescription Transition Assistance Act of 2004. It is my \nhope that this will be put on the Senate Calendar so it can be \nconsidered under rule XIV.\n  Let me give a little background about what this legislation is \nintended to correct.\n  As all of us know, this last year we passed a major revision, a major \namendment to the Medicare Act. The Medicare Act was passed in 1965. In \nthis last year, the prescription drug bill has been added to it. That \nwas a controversial piece of legislation which I wound up opposing in \nits final form. I supported the version we passed through the Senate \ninitially. I opposed the version that finally came from the conference \nand was sent to the President for signature.\n  But there was one part of that prescription drug legislation that \ncontained a very real benefit for a lot of low-income Americans. That \nis the $600 subsidy that was made available this year and again next \nyear for Medicare recipients with incomes in this category that allowed \nthem to take advantage of the benefit.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide simply that CMS \nautomatically enroll many of these low-income Medicare seniors and \npeople with disabilities into this prescription drug card in order that \nthey get the benefit of the discount card. Of course, that benefit is \nhard to quantify. They would get that benefit, but more importantly, \nthey would get access to\n\n[[Page S8480]]\n\nthis $600 subsidy this year and another $600 subsidy next year, which \nwould go against the cost of prescription drugs they incur during those \n2 years.\n  Underscoring the need for this legislation, yesterday Dr. Mark \nMcClellan, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, or CMS, testified before the Senate Special Committee on \nAging that only 1 million of the more than 7 million low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries who are eligible for the $600 subsidy under the \nMedicare prescription drug card are currently enrolled.\n  This chart makes that point very clearly. The title of this chart is \n``Low Enrollment Plagues Prescription Drug Plan.'' This first bullet \nstates that 7 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries are eligible \nfor this $600 subsidy. The number of low-income beneficiaries that CMS \nprojected would actually enroll would be 5 million. So 5 million of the \n7 million were supposed to enroll. In fact, the number of low-income \nbeneficiaries who have enrolled turns out to be 1 million.\n  So there are 6 million Americans eligible for the $600 transition \nassistance under the Medicare prescription drug bill who are not \nreceiving any help. In other words, 14 percent of those who are \neligible for this $600 subsidy are actually getting assistance at the \npresent time. Unfortunately, many of those seniors who are eligible \nlive in my home State of New Mexico, and I am very anxious that we \nprovide this benefit to them since it is a part of the law.\n  The President and the leadership in the Senate have vowed to bottle \nup any legislation that would reopen the Medicare prescription drug \nbill at this time, or before the end of this Congress. Unfortunately, \nthat would include bills such as the one I am reintroducing today, \nwhich is really intended to ensure that the people who are eligible for \nthe limited benefit provided under this bill actually receive that \nbenefit.\n  If we are serious about trying to provide assistance to our Nation's \nmost vulnerable low-income seniors and people with disabilities, then \nwe should undertake the rather straightforward but significant step \nthat is called for in this legislation, and that is automatically \nenrolling those who are eligible for the $600 subsidy into the discount \ndrug card program.\n  Considering that it is unclear whether the savings offered by the \ndrug discount card itself will amount to much, and that is just hard to \nquantify, frankly, the main benefit is not the discount card itself; it \nis the $600 credit which is available to low-income individuals.\n  Specifically, the $600 is available to any individual whose income is \nless than $12,569 per year or any married couple whose income is less \nthan $16,862 per year. For those Medicare savings program beneficiaries \nwho get cost-sharing assistance through Medicaid because they have \nincomes below 135 percent of poverty but are not receiving prescription \ndrug coverage, they clearly meet the income criteria under the act and \ntheir automatic enrollment is the only way to ensure they will receive \nthe $600 subsidy that those of us in Congress intended they receive.\n  In fact, when the prescription drug bill was passed, the \nadministration claimed that 65 percent of those eligible for the $600 \ntransitional assistance would actually be enrolled.\n  According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, \nthe agency expected 5 million people of the 7 million--again, as is \nstated on this chart--including 29,000 of the estimated 45,000 in my \nhome State of New Mexico, would actually enroll. Under the CMS \nassumptions, those beneficiaries combined would save $5 billion \nnationally, or $35 million in my home State of New Mexico, over this 2-\nyear period.\n\n  Much of that savings is not going to be realized by those seniors \nunless we pass the legislation I am introducing today.\n  Part of the explanation for the low enrollment is the poor \nadvertising campaign that the General Accounting Office has criticized \nand with which we are generally familiar. This poor advertising \ncampaign included running ads in Capitol Hill newspapers such as Roll \nCall and the Hill. Unfortunately, most of the low-income seniors in my \nState do not subscribe to either Roll Call or the Hill. In fact, they \ndo not know those publications exist.\n  According to a national survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, only \n18 percent of senior citizens are even aware that the low-income \ntransitional assistance program was included in the prescription drug \nbill. So it is hard to believe that 65 percent of those who are \neligible will enroll when less than one-fifth of them even know the \nprogram exists.\n  Fortunately, CMS has already laid the groundwork for this automatic \nenrollment. Two months ago, the agency issued guidance for how State \npharmacy assistance programs can automatically enroll their members who \nhave incomes below 135 percent of poverty in the low-income assistance \nbenefit. Those enrollees continue to represent the bulk of those who \nhave enrolled and they remain the model for how to ensure that low-\nincome beneficiaries get the prescription drug assistance they need.\n  CMS can take this additional step, which I am calling for in this \nlegislation, to automatically enroll MSP members who do not have \nprescription drug coverage. I believe CMS has the authority to take the \nstep on its own right now, but the legislation I have reintroduced \ntoday would clarify the law in this regard and would ensure that low-\nincome seniors and people with disabilities actually receive this \ntransitional assistance as promised by the administration and the \nCongress.\n  As the Medicare Rights Center has asked: Given their definite \neligibility and clear need for help to pay for their prescription \ndrugs, why not save these people and the Government the hassle of \napplication and automatically enroll them?\n  That is exactly the right question to be asked. There are a number of \nlow-income seniors and people with disabilities who are very sick, who \nhave cognitive and mental illnesses and do not have access to or feel \ncomfortable with the use of the Internet. Many will wrongly slip \nthrough the cracks and fail to get the $600 subsidy that could benefit \nthem substantially this year and next year. In such cases, if an \nindividual has not enrolled for whatever reason, it begs the question \nas to what choice automatic enrollment would take away at that point.\n  It is not enough to say, look, we believe these seniors have a choice \nof a great many discount cards and we do not want to prejudge that for \nthem. The truth is, most of the people I am talking about are \ncompletely unaware that there is such a thing as a drug discount card \nor that there is such a thing as a $600 subsidy for which they could \nqualify. This lack of knowledge on their part is through no fault of \ntheir own and we should do all we can, and CMS should do all it can, to \nget them enrolled so they can benefit from this $600 subsidy. Either \nCMS or the States should take the affirmative step of automatically \nenrolling these individuals in the program. If we fail to assist them \nin this manner, what is really lost is not the choice that they might \nhave between one card or another but the $1,200 in real prescription \ndrug assistance that they do today qualify for and that they should be \nreceiving.\n\n  As a Kaiser Family Foundation study last year indicated, Medicare \nbeneficiaries with no drug coverage were nearly three times more likely \nthan people with drug coverage to forgo needed prescription drugs. \nWhile CMS has estimated that 65 percent of the low-income beneficiaries \nwould sign up for the $600 subsidy, by any measure signing up just 14 \npercent of these beneficiaries can only be viewed as a major failure. \nIt has not been viewed as that so far either by the administration or \nby the Congress.\n  Once again, I call on the administration to take this important step \non its own and enroll these individuals for this benefit. In light of \nthe fact they have failed to do so, despite several calls from me and \nother Members of Congress for them to do so, I am reintroducing this \nbill, and I hope the Senate leadership will bring it to the floor for \nimmediate action.\n  There is over $1 billion of prescription drug assistance for over 1 \nmillion of our Nation's most vulnerable citizens at stake. It is time \nfor the Senate to pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S8481]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2694\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to expand the definition of firefighter to include \napprentices and trainees, regardless of age or duty limitations; read \nthe first time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the \nChristopher Kangas Fallen Firefighter Apprentice Act, a bill designed \nto correct a flaw in the current definition of ``firefighter'' under \nthe Public Safety Officer Benefits Act.\n  On May 4, 2002, 14-year-old Christopher Kangas was struck by a car \nand killed while he was riding his bicycle in Brookhaven, PA. The local \nauthorities later confirmed that Christopher was out on his bike that \nday for an important reason: Chris Kangas was a junior firefighter, and \nhe was responding to a fire emergency.\n  Under Pennsylvania law, 14- and 15-year-olds such as Christopher are \npermitted to serve as volunteer junior firefighters. While they are not \nallowed to operate heavy machinery or enter burning buildings, the law \npermits them to fill a number of important support roles, such as \nproviding first aid. In addition, the junior firefighter program is an \nimportant recruitment tool for fire stations throughout the \nCommonwealth. In fact, prior to his death Christopher had received 58 \nhours of training that would have served him well when he graduated \nfrom the junior program.\n  It is clear to me that Christopher Kangas was a firefighter killed in \nthe line of duty. Were it not for his status as a junior firefighter \nand his prompt response to a fire alarm, Christopher would still be \nalive today. Indeed, the Brookhaven Fire Department, Brookhaven \nBorough, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have all recognized \nChristopher as a fallen public safety officer and provided the \nappropriate death benefits to his family.\n\n  Yet while those closest to the tragedy have recognized Christopher as \na fallen firefighter, the Federal Government has not. The Department of \nJustice announced that Christopher Kangas was not a ``firefighter,'' \nand therefore not a ``public safety officer'' for purposes of the \nPublic Safety Officer Benefits Act. The DOJ based its determination on \nan arbitrarily narrow definition of ``firefighter,'' deciding that the \nonly people who qualify as firefighters are those who play the starring \nrole of spraying water on a fire or entering a burning building. \nAccording to this definition, those who play the essential supporting \nroles of directing traffic, performing first aid, or dispatching fire \nvehicles apparently don't count.\n  Any firefighter will tell you that there are many important roles to \nplay in fighting a fire beyond operating the hoses and ladders. \nFirefighting is a team effort, and everyone in the Brookhaven Fire \nDepartment viewed young Christopher as a full member of their team.\n  As a result of this DOJ determination, Christopher's family will not \nreceive a $267,000 Federal line-of-duty benefit. In addition, \nChristopher will be barred from taking his rightful place on the \nNational Fallen Firefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg, MD. For a young \nman who dreamed of being a firefighter and gave his life rushing to a \nfire, keeping him off of the memorial is a particularly cruel blow.\n  The bill I introduce today will ensure that the Federal Government \nwill recognize Christopher Kangas and others like him as firefighters. \nThe bill clarifies that all firefighters will be recognized as such \n``regardless of age, status as an apprentice or trainee, or duty \nrestrictions imposed because of age or status as an apprentice or \ntrainee.'' The bill applies retroactively back to May 4, 2002 so that \nChristopher can benefit from it.\n  My bill is a companion to H.R. 4472, introduced by Congressman Curt \nWeldon, Congressman Weldon, who is himself a former fireman and fire \nchief, is chairman of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus. There is \nno one in Congress better suited to understand this situation than \nCongressman Weldon, and I am honored to join him in the effort to right \nthis wrong.\n  I am submitting together with this bill a request under Senate rule \nXIV that the bill be placed directly on the Senate calendar and not be \nreferred to committee. This is a noncontroversial, technical bill. I \nhope that my colleagues will join me in ensuring its speedy passage \ninto law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 2697. A bill to authorize the President to posthumously award a \ngold medal on behalf of the Congress to the\n\n[[Page S8482]]\n\nseven members of the crew of the space shuttle Columbia in recognition \nof their outstanding and enduring contributions to the Nation; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nhonor seven individuals who last year made the ultimate sacrifice. The \ncrew of flight STS-107 was tragically lost aboard the space shuttle \nColumbia on February 1, 2003. Debris from the vehicle was found in \nseveral cities and towns in my home State of Texas, where memorials \nwill be raised to the mission's memory.\n  Commander Rick Husband, Pilot William McCool, Payload Specialist \nMichael Anderson, Mission Specialists Kalpana Chawla, David Brown and \nLaurel Clark, and Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon, Israel's first \nastronaut, admirably exemplified our commitment to human space \nexploration. These men and women labored for years to join the select \ngroup of NASA astronauts. Their 16-day mission was dedicated to \nresearch in physical, life, and space sciences. They conducted \napproximately 80 separate experiments comprised of hundreds of samples \nand tests, for 24 hours a day in alternating shifts. This selfless toil \nhas repeatedly formed the basis of NASA's significant discoveries about \nour universe.\n  The Columbia crew, by participating in this effort, fully endorsed \nmanned space exploration, which has been among NASA's missions since \nits inception in 1958. Beginning with NASA's earliest Mercury, Gemini, \nand Apollo missions which first put men on the moon, to this year's \nMars rovers, the benefits of space technology are far-reaching and \naffect the lives of every American. The work of people like those lost \nlast year has led to myriad tangible benefits here on Earth, such as \nthe life-saving CAT Scan. This very American desire to cross frontiers \nand explore our surroundings drives critical innovation and \ndevelopment, and it does not exist without people like those we \ncommemorate today.\n  I believe these cherished husbands and wives, sons, daughters, \nparents, and friends deserve to be counted among another exclusive \nnumber. For their bravery, dedication, audacity, and perseverance, \nthese astronauts should be posthumous recipients of the Congressional \nGold Medal, which is awarded as the highest expression of national \nappreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions. \nAccording to convention, this measure must be cosponsored by 67 \nSenators before it can be considered, and I am certain my colleagues \nhold the Columbia crew in the same high regard as I do. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2697\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On Saturday, February 1, 2003, the space shuttle \n     Columbia exploded upon re-entering the atmosphere following a \n     16-day mission.\n       (2) Before the Columbia started its tragic descent, the \n     shuttle crew completed some 80 scientific experiments and \n     much of their research data had already been relayed to \n     Houston where it has added to the pool of scientific \n     knowledge.\n       (3) The Nation pays tribute to the memory of Colonel Rick \n     Husband, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Anderson, Commander \n     Laurel Clark, Captain David Brown, Commander William McCool, \n     Dr. Kapana Chawla, and Ilan Ramon, a colonel in the Israeli \n     air force. The diversity of crew represented the ideals of \n     our Nation.\n       (4) These seven courageous explorers paid the ultimate \n     price to improve our understanding of the universe, to \n     advance our medical and engineering sciences, to make the \n     Nation safer and more secure, and to keep the United States \n     economy on the cutting edge of technology.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized, \n     on behalf of the Congress, to award a gold medal of \n     appropriate design to each of the seven crew members of the \n     space shuttle Columbia--\n       (1) Rick D. Husband;\n       (2) Michael P. Anderson;\n       (3) Laurel Clark;\n       (4) David M. Brown;\n       (5) William C. McCool;\n       (6) Kapana Chawla; and\n       (7) Ilan Ramon.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purpose of the \n     presentation referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of \n     the Treasury shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, \n     devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2 under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, and at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       The medals struck under this Act, are national medals for \n     purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5. FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Authority to Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund an amount not to exceed $30,000 to pay for the cost of \n     the medals authorized by this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals under section 3 shall be deposited in \n     the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2698. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrevoke the unique ability of the Joint Commission for the Accreditation \nof Healthcare Organizations to deem hospitals to meet certain \nrequirements under the medicare program and to provide for greater \naccountability of the Joint Commission to the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an issue that \nis vitally important--hospital safety. For too long, the Federal \nGovernment has not had the appropriate oversight authority to assure \nsafety in our Nation's hospitals.\n  I am proud to introduce the Medicare Hospital Accreditation Act, \nbipartisan legislation that will give the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services (CMS) the same oversight capacity over hospital \naccreditation that it has over all other health care accrediting \nbodies.\n  The Joint Commission for Accreditation of Health Organizations \n(JCAHO) is a private, not-for-profit organization. In 1965 Congress \ngranted JCAHO ``deeming authority'' for Medicare certification under \nSection 1865 of the Social Security Act. This sweeping authority gave \nhospitals accredited by JCAHO the ability to participate in Medicare \nwith minimal CMS oversight. Since then, JCAHO has accredited most of \nour Nation's hospitals--over 80 percent in 2002. No other health care \naccreditation program has had this same statutory exception.\n  Congress gave JCAHO an important role to detect and correct problems \nthat directly affect the lives of patients in hospitals. Congress, CMS \nand in turn the American people, rely upon JCAHO's work to ensure the \nquality and safety in our Nation's hospitals.\n  JCAHO's own mission claims to continuously improve the safety and \nquality of care provided to the public through the provision of health \ncare accreditation.\n  Unfortunately, JCAHO was entrusted with this responsibility without \nthe necessary checks and balances so crucial to a government responsive \nto the needs of the people it serves.\n  This GAO report is only the most recent evidence showing problems \nwith the Joint Commission. In June of 1990, the GAO found that CMS, \nwhich was then called the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), \nneeded to reevaluate the criteria used to evaluate the JCAHO's survey \nprocess and recommended that HCFA establish a means to detect \nsignificant differences between state agency and Joint Commission \nsurveys.\n  In May of 1991, the GAO published a report titled ``Hospitals with \nQuality-of-Care Problems Need Closer Monitoring'' and recommended that \nHCFA closely monitor the Joint Commission's follow-up of hospital \nefforts to correct deficiencies it found related to Medicare conditions \nof participation.\n  Then in 1999, the Inspector General for the Department of Health & \nHuman Services also raised serious concerns. The IG looked at how well \nthe Joint Commission identified deficiencies in hospitals and found \nthat the Joint Commission's surveys were not likely to identify \npatterns of deficient care.\n  Today's GAO findings are likewise significant. Over the course of 3 \nyears--\n\n[[Page S8483]]\n\nbetween 2000 and 2002--500 hospitals were surveyed by both JCAHO and by \na state survey agency on behalf of CMS. According to the GAO, a \ncomparison of these surveys revealed that the state surveys often found \nserious deficiencies--serious deficiencies that went overlooked or \nunnoticed by JCAHO.\n  In fact, the GAO found that out of the 157 hospitals found with \nserious deficiencies, JCAHO identified only 34. In other words, \ncompared to state surveyors, JCAHO missed hospitals with deficiencies \n78 percent of the time.\n  A hospital that prepared and administered drugs in violation of \nfederal and state laws is just one example of a serious deficiency \nfound by a state agency, but missed by JCAHO in its 2000 survey.\n  Serious deficiencies found by state agencies but missed by JCAHO \nrepresent a pattern of deficient care--not merely isolated incidents. \nUnlike isolated incidents, a pattern of deficient care raises grave \nconcerns because of the potential to place dozens of lives in danger, \ninvolving for example a floor or entire wing where many hospital \npatients are receiving their care.\n  Because JCAHO's hospital ``deeming authority'' is statutorily \nmandated, CMS cannot terminate this authority. Today, we are taking the \nfirst step to give CMS the same oversight capability over JCAHO that it \nhas over all other health care accrediting organizations.\n  This legislation will give CMS the authority and responsibility to \nhold JCAHO accountable and, if necessary, restrict or remove its \nhospital accreditation authority. It will bring uniformity to the \nhealth care accreditation process and will provide a more effective \nchain-of-command. JCAHO will have to answer to CMS--as it does in other \nsectors of health care accreditation.\n  The GAO recommends that Congress grant CMS greater oversight over \nJCAHO's hospital accreditation process. CMS agrees. JCAHO agrees. My \ncolleague from across the aisle and across the Capitol, Congressman \nStark--who as we speak is introducing the companion bill in the House \nof Representatives--agrees with this finding.\n  I urge your support for this much-needed legislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to call my colleagues' attention to \na very important matter--the safety of America's hospitals. This is an \nissue that affects every State and people of all political beliefs. In \nan effort to keep American hospitals safe and ensure they provide \nquality health care, Chairman Grassley and I are introducing the \nMedicare Hospital Accreditation Act of 2004, which is simultaneously \nbeing introduced by our colleagues in the House of Representatives.\n  As I can attest through personal experience, America's hospitals \nprovide outstanding health care. Every day, thousands of people receive \nthe treatment they need from dedicated and highly competent hospital \nstaffs working in well-run hospitals across the country.\n  But confidence in our hospitals should not be confused with \ncomplacency. Every so often, someone from outside a hospital must come \nin to each facility and look under the hood, so to speak, to read \nthrough patient charts, check clinical practices and to make sure that \nsprinklers are working and stairways are sound. We have put our trust \nin accrediting organizations to identify problems in hospitals so that \nthey may be corrected and quality and safety improved.\n  Most hospitals are accredited by the Joint Commission on \nAccreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), which has been \naccrediting hospitals for over 50 years. When JCAHO accredits a \nhospital, that hospital is deemed to be in compliance with the \nconditions of participation for Medicare. As today's report by the \nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) shows us, JCAHO's record of \nidentifying problems in hospitals is far from perfect. Furthermore, the \nGAO points out that government has little oversight authority over \nJCAHO's hospital accreditation process. Less oversight authority, in \nfact, compared to accrediting organizations for other kinds of \nhealthcare facilities.\n  While the GAO's findings are a reason for concern, the report does \nnot mean that American hospitals are unsafe. But it does send a clear \nmessage--one that the Congress and the Administration should heed--that \nthere is room for improvement in identifying problems at hospitals. \nGiven my commitment to keep hospitals as safe as possible, I view the \nGAO's recommendations as a call to action.\n  Therefore, I am pleased to join Chairman Grassley in introducing \nlegislation to remove JCAHO's unique status as an accreditation body \nand to give the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) the same \nauthority over JCAHO's hospital accreditation that it already has with \nrespect to the accreditation of other healthcare facilities. Putting \nall accrediting organizations on equal footing will result in better \naccreditation and better healthcare facilities for everyone. Expanding \noversight by CMS of JCAHO's hospital accreditation will help improve \nthe process, keep patients safe and ensure that hospitals continue to \nperform to our expectations.\n  The legislation we're introducing today is bipartisan and bicameral. \nI urge my colleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this bill and working \ntogether to get it passed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2699. A bill to deauthorize a certain portion of the project for \nnavigation, Rockland Harbor, Maine; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \ncould make the mooring of an historic windjammer fleet in Rockland \nHarbor a reality by deauthorizing a section of the Federal Navigational \nChannel that will allow a windjammer wharf to be built. Originally a \nstrong fishing port, Rockland retains its rich marine heritage, and it \nis one of the fastest growing cities in the Midcoast. Like many of the \nport cities on the eastern seaboard, Rockland has been forced to \nconfront an assortment of financial and environmental changes, but the \ncity has been able to respond to these challenges in positive and \nproductive ways.\n  The City of Rockland has hosted the Windjammer fleet since 1955, \nearning a well-deserved reputation as the Windjammer Capitol of the \nWorld. Rockland's Windjammers are now National Historic Landmarks, and \nas such, are vitally important to both the City and the State. The \nimage of The Victory Chimes--a three-masted, gaff-rigged schooner whose \nNational Historic Landmark designation I supported in 1997, and one of \nfive vessels slated to be berthed at the new wharf--graces the 2003 \nMaine quarter! This beautiful fleet of windjammers symbolizes the great \nseagoing history of Maine as well as the sense of adventure that we \nhave come to associate so closely with the American experience.\n  Lermond Cove is perfectly situated in the Rockland Harbor to be the \nnew and permanent home for these cherished vessels. The proposed \nWindjammer Wharf will also provide a safe harbor from storms, as it is \ntucked nicely near the Maine State Ferry and Department of Marine \nResources piers.\n  The State of Maine capitalizes on the visual impact of the \nWindjammers to promote tourism, working waterfronts and the natural \nbeauty that distinguishes our landscape. Over $300,000 is spent yearly \nby the Maine Windjammer Association to advertise and promote these \nbusinesses. Deauthorizing that part of the Federal navigational channel \nwill clearly trigger significant and unrealized economic gains for the \nregion, providing many beneficial dollars to the local area and the \nState of Maine.

Res. 408\n\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly requested the \n     International Court of Justice to render an opinion on the \n     legality of the security fence being constructed by Israel to \n     prevent Palestinian terrorists from entering Israel;\n       Whereas, on February 23, 2004, the International Court of \n     Justice commenced hearings on the legality of the security \n     fence;\n       Whereas, on July 9, 2004, the International Court of \n     Justice issued an advisory opinion that was critical of the \n     legality of the security fence and that accused Israel of \n     violating its international obligations;\n       Whereas the security fence is a necessary and proportional \n     response to the campaign of terrorism by Palestinian \n     militants;\n       Whereas, throughout Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, \n     terrorist groups have sent suicide bombers to murder Israeli \n     civilians in buses, cafes, and places of worship, have used \n     snipers to shoot at Israeli civilians in their homes and \n     vehicles and even in baby carriages, and have invaded homes \n     and seminaries in order to carry out acts of terrorism;\n       Whereas Palestinian terrorists routinely disguise \n     themselves as civilians, including as pregnant women, hide \n     bombs in ambulances, feign injuries, and sequence bombs to \n     kill rescue workers responding to an initial attack;\n       Whereas a security fence has existed in Gaza since 1996 and \n     that fence has proved effective at reducing the number of \n     terrorist attacks and prevented many residents of Gaza from \n     crossing into Israel to carry out terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas, from the onset of the Palestinian campaign of \n     terror against Israel in September 2000, until the start of \n     the construction of the fence in July 2003, Palestinian \n     terrorists based out of the northern West Bank carried out 73 \n     attacks in which 293 Israeli were killed and 1,950 were \n     wounded, and during the period since construction began, from \n     August 2003 through June 2004, only 3 attacks were \n     successfully executed, 2 of which were executed by terrorists \n     coming from areas where the fence was not yet completed;\n       Whereas this reduction in number of attacks represents a 90 \n     percent decline since construction of the security fence \n     commenced;\n       Whereas, on June 30, 2004, Israel's High Court of Justice \n     issued a dramatic ruling that supported the need for the \n     security fence to fight terror, but ruled that its route must \n     take into account Palestinian humanitarian concerns, thus \n     reinforcing the central role that the rule of law plays in \n     Israeli society;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 \n     (November 22, 1967) and United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 338 (October 22, 1973) require negotiated \n     settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the \n     demarcation of final borders and recognition of the right of \n     Israel to ``secure and recognized boundaries'';\n       Whereas, according to international law and as expressly \n     recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United \n     Nations, all countries possess an inherent right to self-\n     defense;\n       Whereas the security fence and associated checkpoints are \n     crucial to detecting and deterring terrorists among the \n     Palestinian civilian population;\n       Whereas there is concern that the International Court of \n     Justice is politicized and critical of Israel;\n       Whereas construction of the security fence does not \n     constitute annexation of disputed territory because the \n     security fence is a temporary measure and does not extend the \n     sovereignty of Israel;\n       Whereas the security fence is permitted under the \n     Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government \n     Arrangements, signed at Washington September 13, 1993, \n     between Israel and the P.L.O. (hereinafter referred to as the \n     ``Oslo Accord'') in which Israel retained the right to \n     provide for security, including the security of Israeli \n     settlers;\n       Whereas the case regarding the legality of the security \n     fence in the International Court of Justice violates the \n     principles of the Oslo Accord that require that all disputes \n     between the parties be settled by direct negotiations or by \n     agreed-upon methods; and\n       Whereas the United States, Korea, and India have \n     constructed security fences to separate such countries from \n     territories or other countries for the security of their \n     citizens: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes Israel's right of self-defense against \n     Palestinian terrorist attacks, and supports the construction \n     of a security fence, the route of which, with the support of \n     the Government of Israel, takes into account the need to \n     minimize the confiscation of Palestinian land and the \n     imposition of hardships on the Palestinian people;\n       (2) condemns the decision of the International Court of \n     Justice on the legality of the security fence; and\n       (3) urges the United States to vote against any further \n     United Nations action that could delay or prevent the \n     construction of the security fence and to engage in a \n     diplomatic campaign to persuade other countries to do the \n     same.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 409--ENCOURAGING INCREASED INVOLVEMENT IN SERVICE \n                  ACTIVITIES TO ASSIST SENIOR CITIZENS\n\n  Mr. BAYH submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

enabling seniors to maintain independence for as \n     long as possible; providing encouragement and friendship to \n     lonely seniors; and providing relief to family caregivers;\n       Whereas regular visitation and assistance is the best way \n     of assuring seniors that they have not been forgotten, and \n     State and local recognition of regular visitation programs \n     can call further attention to the importance of volunteering \n     on an ongoing basis;

Res. 412\n\n       Whereas the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was \n     created in 1973 to establish and improve standards of \n     financial accounting and reporting by publicly traded \n     companies for the guidance and education of the public, \n     including issuers of securities, auditors, and users of \n     financial information;\n       Whereas the FASB is composed of a diverse, seven-member \n     board of accounting experts representing the private sector, \n     public accounting, academia, and Wall Street, all of whom are \n     specifically qualified to set technical accounting standards;\n       Whereas the accounting standard setting process of the FASB \n     involves an extensive ``due process'' that is open to public \n     observation and participation;\n       Whereas on March 31, 2004, the FASB issued a proposed \n     statement entitled ``Share-Based Payment'' that addresses the \n     accounting of share-based payment transactions, including \n     stock options, in which an enterprise receives employee \n     services in exchange for equity instruments of the \n     enterprise, or liabilities that are based on the fair value \n     of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled \n     by the issuance of such equity instruments;\n       Whereas legislation has been introduced in Congress that \n     would undermine the independence of the FASB by nullifying or \n     delaying ongoing efforts by the FASB to improve accounting \n     for equity-based compensation;\n       Whereas Congressional action that dictates accounting \n     treatment of stock options by publicly traded companies would \n     inject Congress directly into the accounting standard setting \n     process mandating which types of stock-based compensation \n     should be expensed, how such expenses should be measured, \n     what enterprises should be exempt from expensing, and when \n     and under what circumstances the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission recognizes and enforces standards for the \n     accounting of stock-based compensation;\n       Whereas Congressional action to set accounting standards \n     would set the dangerous precedent of substituting provisions \n     advocated by special interests in place of standards that are \n     set independently and objectively by the FASB;\n       Whereas Congressional intervention in this area would not \n     only politicize but also compromise the integrity of the \n     accounting standard setting process of the FASB and undermine \n     the credibility of financial reporting by United States \n     companies;\n       Whereas Congress has long recognized the fundamental \n     importance of the independent private sector accounting \n     standard setting process to United States capital markets;\n       Whereas Congress reaffirmed this principle in the Sarbanes-\n     Oxley Act of 2002 by authorizing the FASB to obtain \n     independent funding through assessments on private industry \n     rather than through appropriations from Congress or donations \n     from private industry; and\n       Whereas the April 2003 Policy Statement of the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission endorsed the fundamental importance \n     of the independent private sector accounting standard setting \n     process: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the Senate--\n       (1) should continue to recognize and support the integrity \n     and independence of the accounting standard setting process \n     of the Financial Accounting Standards Board;\n       (2) should not interfere with the independence of the \n     Financial Accounting Standards Board; and\n       (3) should not dictate accounting standards to the \n     Financial Accounting Standards Board for stock-based \n     compensation or for any other financial accounting issue.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution on \nthe importance of maintaining the independence and integrity of the \nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). I am pleased to be joined \nby\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\nmy colleagues, Senator Levin, Senator McCain and Senator Durbin in this \ninitiative.\n  For the past 30 years, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has \nbeen responsible for establishing and improving standards of financial \naccounting and reporting that are deemed ``generally accepted \naccounting principles.'' In order to ensure that these accounting \nprinciples are ``generally accepted,'' the FASB utilizes a deliberative \nprocess that is open to comment from the public, including the users of \nthe financial statements and other third parties. The FASB has a \ndiverse, seven-member board of accounting experts representing not only \nusers of the financial statements but also preparers of financial \nstatements. Because of its open deliberative process, the FASB has been \nable to maintain the integrity of its work through the independence it \nenjoys in setting accounting standards, away from special interests.\n  But it appears that special interests are pressuring the FASB and \nlobbying Congress to take a different route than the norm on the \nfinancial accounting treatment of employee stock options. Several bills \nhave been introduced in Congress that would block the FASB's proposal \nto require the fair value of employee stock options to be expensed on \ngrant date. Instead, those bills dictate the specific accounting \ntreatment to be applied to employee stock options and when and under \nwhat circumstances the Securities and Exchange Commission should \nrecognize accounting standards for employee stock options.\n  Political interference with the FASB's standards setting process \nwould set a dangerous precedent. It is a bad idea for politicians in \nthe House and the Senate to be substituting political decisions for the \ndecisions by an expert private sector accounting standards board.\n  On July 6, 2004, The Washington Post published an editorial by Mr. \nWarren Buffett, Chief Executive Officer of Berkshire Hathaway, entitled \n``Fuzzy Math And Stock Options.'' Mr. Buffett points out that the House \nof Representatives' ``anointment of itself as the ultimate scorekeeper \nfor investors . . . comes from an institution that in its own affairs \nfavors Enronesque accounting.'' Accordingly, he urges Congress not to \ninterfere with the FASB's standard setting process and encourages chief \nexecutives who issue stock options ``to live with honest accounting.'' \nI ask unanimous consent that Mr. Buffet's op-ed be reprinted in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  We have been down this road before. A decade ago, the FASB proposed \nan accounting standard that would have required companies to record the \nvalue of employee stock options as a compensation expense on their \nincome statements. At that time, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a \nresolution that condemned the FASB's new standard, and a separate bill \nwas introduced that would have stripped the FASB of its rulemaking \nauthority. Under this threat of evisceration, the FASB withdrew its \nrecommendation. In my opinion, Congress' interference with that 1993 \nFASB proposal resulted in disastrous consequences with the accounting \nscandals at Enron, Global Crossing and WorldCom.\n  I believe congressional interference in this issue will ultimately \nundermine the FASB's credibility and make it more difficult in the \nfuture for the FASB to adopt standards when a powerful special interest \nstands in the way. If that occurs, the real losers will be the millions \nof investors who help drive our economy by investing in companies' debt \nand equity securities. Investors depend on financial statements to make \ncritical judgments about where to direct their capital investments. It \nis no exaggeration that the integrity of these investment decisions \nand, indeed, of U.S. financial markets as a whole, depend upon the \nintegrity of the accounting rules that ensure that each company's true \nfinancial condition is reflected in its financial statements.\n  I believe it is critical for the United States Senate to speak out at \nthis pivotal time. Therefore, the resolution I introduce today would \nexpress the sense of the Senate that the Senate: (1) should continue to \nrecognize and support the independence and integrity of the FASB's \naccounting standard setting process; (2) should not interfere with the \nFASB's independence; and (3) should not dictate accounting standards to \nthe FASB for stockbased compensation or for any other financial \naccounting issue.\n  As members of Congress, we must allow the FASB to do its job, free \nfrom political interference. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support \nexpeditious adoption of this resolution.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 6, 2004]\n\n                      Fuzzy Math and Stock Options\n\n                           (By Warren Buffet)\n\n       Until now the record for mathematical lunacy by a \n     legislative body has been held by the Indiana House of \n     Representatives, which in 1897 decreed by a vote of 67 to 0 \n     that pi--the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its \n     diameter--would no longer be 3.14159 but instead be 3.2. \n     Indiana schoolchildren momentarily rejoiced over this \n     simplification of their lives. But the Indiana Senate, \n     composed of cooler heads, referred the bill to the Committee \n     for Temperance, and it eventually died.\n       What brings this episode to mind is that the U.S. House of \n     Representatives is about to consider a bill that, if passed, \n     could cause the mathematical lunacy record to move east from \n     Indiana. First, the bill decrees that a coveted form of \n     corporate pay--stock options--be counted as an expense when \n     these go to the chief executive and the other four highest-\n     paid officers in a company, but be disregarded as an expense \n     when they are issued to other employees in the company. \n     Second, the bill says that when a company is calculating the \n     expense of the options issued to the mighty five, it shall \n     assume that stock prices never fluctuate.\n       Give the bill's proponents an A for imagination--and for \n     courting contributors--and a flatout F for logic.\n       All seven members of the Financial Accounting Standards \n     Board, all four of the big accounting firms and legions of \n     investment professionals say the two proposals are nonsense. \n     Nevertheless, many House members wish to ignore these \n     informed voices and make Congress the Supreme Accounting \n     Authority. Indeed, the House bill directs the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission to ``not recognize as ``generally \n     accepted'' any accounting principle established by a standard \n     setting body'' that disagrees with the House about the \n     treatment of options.\n       The House's anointment of itself as the ultimate \n     scorekeeper for investors, it should be noted, comes from an \n     institution that in its own affairs favors Enronesque \n     accounting. Witness the fanciful ``sunset'' provisions that \n     are used to meet legislative ``scoring'' requirements. Or \n     regard the unified budget protocol, which applies a portion \n     of annual Social Security receipts to reducing the stated \n     budget deficit while ignoring the concomitant annual costs \n     for benefit accruals.\n       I have no objection to the granting of options. Companies \n     should use whatever form of compensation best motivates \n     employees, whether this be cash bonuses, trips to Hawaii, \n     restricted stock grants or stock options. But aside from \n     options, every other item of value given to employees is \n     recorded as an expense. Can you imagine the derision that \n     would be directed at a bill mandating that only five bonuses \n     out of all those given to employees be expensed? Yet that is \n     a true analogy to what the option bill is proposing.\n       Equally nonsensical is a section in the bill requiring \n     companies to assume, when they are valuing the options \n     granted to the mighty five, that their stocks have zero \n     volatility. I've been investing for 62 years and have yet to \n     meet a stock that doesn't fluctuate. The only reason for \n     making such an Alice-in-Wonderland assumption is to \n     significantly understate the value of the few options that \n     the House wants counted. This undervaluation, in turn, \n     enables chief executives to lie about what they are truly \n     being paid and to overstate the earnings of the companies \n     they run.\n       Some people contend that options cannot be precisely \n     valued. So what? Estimates pervade accounting. Who knows with \n     precision what the useful life of software, a corporate jet \n     or a machine tool will be? Pension costs, moreover, are even \n     fuzzier, because they require estimates of future mortality \n     rates, pay increases and investment earnings. These guesses \n     are almost invariably wrong, often substantially so. But the \n     inherent uncertainties involved do not excuse companies from \n     making their best estimate of these, or any other, expenses. \n     Legislators should remember that it is better to be \n     approximately right than precisely wrong.\n       If the House should ignore this logic and legislate that \n     what is an expense for five is not an expense for thousands, \n     there is reason to believe that the Senate--like the Indiana \n     Senate 107 years ago--will prevent this folly from becoming \n     law. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), chairman of the Senate \n     Banking Committee, has firmly declared that accounting rules \n     should be set by accountants, not by legislators.\n       Even so, House members who wish to escape the scorn of \n     historians should render the Senate's task moot by killing \n     the bill themselves. Or if they are absolutely determined to \n     meddle with reality, they could attack the obesity problem by \n     declaring that henceforth it will take 24 ounces to make a \n     pound. If even that friendly standard seems unbearable to \n     their constituents, they can exempt all but the fattest five \n     in each congressional district from any measurement of \n     weight.\n       In the late 1990s, too many managers found it easier to \n     increase ``profits'' by accounting\n\n[[Page S8487]]\n\n     maneuvers than by operational excellence. But just as the \n     schoolchildren of Indiana learned to work with honest math, \n     so can option-issuing chief executives learn to live with \n     honest accounting. It's high time they step up to that job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/20/senate-section/article/S8487-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 127--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n   THE PRESIDENT SHOULD DESIGNATE SEPTEMBER 11 AS A NATIONAL DAY OF \n               VOLUNTARY SERVICE, CHARITY, AND COMPASSION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lieberman, and Mrs. \nBoxer) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 127\n\n       Whereas across the United States and around the world, \n     people of all ages and walks of life collectively witnessed \n     an event of immense tragedy on September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas the events of that day instantly transformed many \n     lives, some through personal loss and many others through an \n     unfamiliar sense of individual and national vulnerability;\n       Whereas an unprecedented, historic bonding of the people of \n     the United States arose from the collective shock, unifying \n     the United States in a sustained outpouring of national \n     spirit, pride, selflessness, generosity, courage, and \n     service;\n       Whereas on that day and the immediate days that followed, \n     many brave people heroically, tirelessly, and courageously \n     participated in an extraordinarily difficult and dangerous \n     rescue and recovery effort, in many cases voluntarily putting \n     their own well-being at risk;\n       Whereas September 11 will never and should never be just \n     another day in the hearts and minds of all people of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the creation of memorials and monuments honoring \n     the lives lost on September 11, 2001, as well as the efforts \n     of those who participated in rescue and recovery and \n     voluntary service efforts, are necessary, proper, and \n     fitting, but alone cannot fully capture the desire of the \n     United States to pay tribute in a meaningful way;\n       Whereas it is fitting and essential to establish a lasting, \n     meaningful, and positive legacy of service for future \n     generations as a tribute to those heroes of September 11, \n     2001;\n       Whereas many citizens wish to memorialize September 11 by \n     engaging in personal and individual acts of community service \n     or other giving activities as part of a national day of \n     recognition and tribute; and\n       Whereas to lose this opportunity to bring people together \n     for such an important endeavor would be a tragedy unto \n     itself: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) it is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     designate September 11 as an annually recognized day of \n     voluntary service, charity, and compassion; and\n       (2) Congress urges the President to issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe this \n     day with appropriate and personal expressions of service, \n     charity, and compassion toward others.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 128--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n    REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF LIFE INSURANCE, AND RECOGNIZING AND \n           SUPPORTING NATIONAL LIFE INSURANCE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself and Mr. Chambliss) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

Mr. HOLLINGS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 2541, to reauthorize and restructure the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, and for other purposes; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration Authorization Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) American space flight is imbued with the promise of \n     expanding the boundaries of human knowledge and human \n     adventure. It is a beacon of leadership and a proud \n     demonstration of human freedom, destiny, and progress.\n       (2) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is \n     uniquely qualified and positioned to develop space on behalf \n     of and for the American people, requiring its mission to be \n     broad and include many disciplines and interests that might \n     contribute to, or benefit from space flight.\n       (3) Like our other American institutions, American space \n     flight is founded upon the principle that human fallibility \n     and frailty can be overcome through personal dedication and \n     institutional strength and determination. The National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration must continue to listen \n     to the voices of change and restore its commitment to safety \n     and the protection of human life.\n       (4) In a year of tragedy, renewal, and re-envisioning, it \n     behooves the United States to reflect deeply on both the \n     strengths and weaknesses of American space flight, to build \n     upon foundations, and to reformulate purposes while not \n     abandoning proven purposes and capabilities needlessly nor \n     carelessly.\n       (5) Fiscal year 2005 should be a year of continued \n     reassessment and planning for the National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration, laying the groundwork for implementing \n     a United States space program for the future that reflects \n     the role of space flight in the everyday affairs of the \n     American people and the future prestige and betterment of the \n     Nation while ascertaining the specific roles that many other \n     American institutions could and should play in that future.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to authorize programs of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal year \n     2005 and to better define the policy of the United States \n     regarding the future of U.S. space flight.\n\n     SEC. 4. DECLARATION OF UNITED STATES SPACE POLICY.\n\n       (a) Section 102 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act \n     of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2451) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 102. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION OF POLICY AND PURPOSE.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The Congress hereby reaffirms that it is \n     the policy of the United States that activities in space \n     should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all \n     mankind.\n       ``(b) Purpose.--The United States shall conduct such \n     activities as are required to sponsor, guide, and secure the \n     development of space for the peaceful benefit of all mankind \n     through fostering the use of space for science, for the \n     preservation of the Earth, and for the advancement of peace \n     and worldwide economic well-being.\n       ``(c) Activities.--The Congress also reaffirms that the \n     general welfare and security of the United States require \n     that adequate provision be made for aeronautical and space \n     activities, including--\n       ``(1) the promotion and development of the use of space for \n     United States civil, economic, and national security \n     purposes;\n       ``(2) ensuring the safety of civil, commercial, and \n     military space operations; and\n\n[[Page S8488]]\n\n       ``(3) protection of the territorial and extraterritorial \n     claims and interests of the United States in space.\n       ``(d) Role of NASA.--The role of the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration shall be to foster the development \n     of space flight and aeronautical capabilities on behalf of \n     the United States, including--\n       ``(1) conducting a program of scientific discovery in and \n     from the vantage point of space;\n       ``(2) demonstrating the merit and ability of humans to \n     explore and inhabit deep space; and\n       ``(3) promoting the development of technologies and \n     capabilities to be used by the United States for the \n     preservation and development of the Earth.\n       ``(e) Other Activities.--The United States shall establish \n     other capabilities related to using space for peaceful \n     purposes, including the promotion and development of \n     national, state, local, tribal, and international \n     capabilities in--\n       ``(1) public safety, homeland security, and public health \n     management;\n       ``(2) telecommunications, transportation, and urban and \n     regional development;\n       ``(3) agriculture, wildlife, forestry, mineral, and energy \n     resource management; and\n       ``(4) other uses benefiting the Earth and the Earth's \n     people, natural resources, and economies.\n       ``(f) Commercial Use of Space.--It is the policy of the \n     United States to seek and encourage, to the maximum extent \n     possible, the fullest commercial use of space, including the \n     use of commercial capabilities to support United States civil \n     and national security purposes.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. EXPLORATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--In fiscal year 2005, the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration shall formulate plans, \n     develop requirements, and make recommendations for a multi-\n     decadal program of human travel, habitation, and exploration \n     of other bodies and locations in Earth's solar system, \n     beginning with the start of demonstration of human \n     capabilities on Earth's Moon by 2020.\n       (b) Plan for U.S. Human Space Exploration.--As part of the \n     budget request for FY 2006, the Administrator shall provide \n     an independent assessment of the status and plans for the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration's human \n     exploration program. The assessment shall include--\n       (1) the schedule, technical milestones, and costs for \n     design and construction of human crewed transport systems \n     including a crew exploration vehicle and launch systems and \n     other ground, in-space, and surface capabilities necessary to \n     conduct extended missions on Earth's Moon by 2020;\n       (2) the objectives of extended presence on Earth's Moon and \n     the proposed timetable for their accomplishment;\n       (3) the contribution of human presence to meeting those \n     objectives; and\n       (4) the program of basic and applied research and \n     development of advanced robotic and robotic-hybrid technology \n     that will be used to demonstrate human exploration \n     capabilities on Earth's Moon.\n       (c) Management Plan.--As part of the budget request for \n     fiscal year 2006 and each succeeding fiscal year, the \n     Administrator shall submit a management plan and life cycle \n     cost estimate for its human exploration program to the \n     Congress. The Administrator shall include all the assessment \n     items described in subsection (b) as baseline requirements \n     and specifications. The Administrator shall include in the \n     initial plan submitted under this subsection a description of \n     the process for making the annual revisions of the plan.\n       (d) Lunar Capabilities.--The National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration is hereby authorized to begin studies, tests, \n     demonstrations, and design of a crew exploration vehicle and \n     launch system to be used for future human exploration to \n     Earth's Moon and other destinations, subject to formal \n     approval of the program at the time of development, and of \n     robotic systems necessary to survey and demonstrate other \n     robotic and robotic-assisted capabilities to explore the \n     Earth's Moon.\n       (e) Continuity of U.S. Crew Transportation.--The Congress \n     hereby declares that a prolonged gap of 1 or more years in \n     the United States' capability to transport and return \n     American astronauts living in space is an emergency period of \n     space flight operations inconsistent with the safety and \n     management objectives of United States space flight. Whenever \n     such an emergency period is forseen, the Administrator shall \n     submit a plan to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee \n     on Science and make a request for supplemental \n     appropriations, if so required, to remedy this situation in a \n     safe, justifiable, and timely manner.\n\n     SEC. 6. HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Hubble Space Telescope is--\n       (1) the Hubble Space Telescope is a source of inspiration \n     to the American people and their support for the United \n     States space program; and\n       (2) a tangible measure of the success of the United States \n     space program, as reflected by the extraordinary \n     contributions made to scientific research and education, \n     without parallel since the Apollo missions to Earth's Moon.\n       (b) Servicing Mission.--The Administrator shall continue to \n     examine all possible options for carrying out alternative \n     servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope while continuing to \n     plan for a human-assisted servicing mission using the Space \n     Shuttle if alternative servicing cannot fully accomplish the \n     original objectives of the SM-4 mission.\n       (c) Hubble Servicing Plan.--Within 60 days after the \n     National Academy of Sciences issues its study on the future \n     of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Administrator shall submit \n     a plan for servicing the Hubble to the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of \n     Representatives Committee on Science. The plan should address \n     the risks, benefits, and costs of fully accomplishing the \n     original objectives of the SM-4 mission and shall propose \n     options for servicing of the facility.\n\n     SEC. 7. REPORTS.\n\n       (a) NASA Changes.--By May 1, 2005, or 30 days prior to the \n     return-to-flight of the Space Shuttle if earlier, the \n     Administrator shall report to the Congress summarizing and \n     independently reporting on the status and effectiveness of \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration's compliance \n     with all observations and recommendations of the Columbia \n     Accident Investigation Board, including changes at the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration in resolving \n     concerns about the safety, operations, engineering, and \n     management cultures of the agency. This report shall also \n     address the adequacy of these changes in achieving safe \n     design, management, and operation of any future human space \n     flight systems, including international and commercial crew \n     and cargo transportation and habitation systems used to \n     support the International Space Station or to support United \n     States human space flight and operation at other \n     destinations.\n       (b) United States Launch Technology.--As part of the budget \n     request for FY 2006, the Administrator, in concert with the \n     United States Department of Transportation and the United \n     States Department of Defense, shall produce a report on the \n     state of launch technology, systems, facilities, and programs \n     of the United States.

The act \nauthorizes the Treasury Department to mint and issue coins in honor of \nChief Justice John Marshall in the year 2005. Funds raised by sale of \nthe coin will support the Supreme Court Historical Society. Sales of \nthe coin also cover all of the costs of minting and issuing these \ncoins, so that the American taxpayer is not bearing any cost whatsoever \nof this commemoration.\n  It is fitting that sales of a coin that bears the likeness of Chief \nJustice Marshall will be used to support the Supreme Court Historical \nSociety. The society is a nonprofit organization whose purpose is to \npreserve and disseminate the history of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. Founded by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the society's mission \nis to provide information and historical research on our Nation's \nhighest court. The society accomplishes this mission by conducting \nprograms, publishing books, supporting historical research, and \ncollecting antiques and artifacts related to the Court's history. We \nare happy to assist a worthwhile organization like the Supreme Court \nHistorical Society.\n  In our successful efforts to obtain support for the bill, we gained \n75 cosponsors in the Senate over the past year. Given the noble cause, \nit was not a hard sell. Yet, the number of bipartisan supporters is a \nproper tribute to the great Chief Justice John Marshall. John Marshall \nis known as ``the great Chief Justice'' of the Supreme Court. Marshall \nserved on the bench for 34 years and established many of the \nconstitutional doctrines we revere today. He is best known and \nrespected for the fundamental principle of checks and balances of our \ndemocratic government.\n  I thank all the Senators and Representatives who supported this \nlegislation--too numerous to name. I also thank the Supreme Court \nHistorical Society for its dedication to this important tribute to \nChief Justice John Marshall.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Res. 411) to authorize document production \n     by the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Select Committee on Intelligence \nconducted a review in 2001 of United States assistance to Peruvian \ncounter-drug air interdiction efforts, following the mistaken shootdown \nof a civilian aircraft by the Peruvian Air Force in that same year. The \ncommittee prepared a report in which it made factual findings detailing \nthe shortcomings that led to this tragic incident. The committee report \nmade a number of recommendations about requirements that should precede \nfurther U.S. assistance to a foreign government engaged in a program of \ninterdicting drug trafficking aircraft.\n  The United States Department of Justice is now conducting an \ninvestigation of the involvement of U.S. government officials in the \nPeruvian counter-narcotics air interdiction program, which has been \noperating since 1995. During that time the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee has had oversight\n\n[[Page S8492]]\n\njurisdiction. As part of that investigation, the Justice Department is \nreviewing the testimony and briefings that CIA personnel gave to the \ncongressional oversight committees, including the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, from the inception of the air interdiction program.\n  To assist the Justice Department in its investigation, this \nresolution would authorize the chair and vice chair, acting jointly, to \nprovide to the Justice Department, under appropriate security \nprocedures, committee hearing transcripts and other committee records \npertinent to its oversight of the Peruvian counter-narcotics air \ninterdiction program.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2700, which was introduced \nearlier today by Senators Snowe and Kerry.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will state the bill by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2700) to provide an additional temporary \n     extension of programs under the Small Business Act and the \n     Small Business Investment Act of 1958 through September 17, \n     2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join Chairman Snowe in \nsupporting legislation to keep the Small Business Administration and \nits financing and counseling assistance available to small businesses. \nThis bill authorizes the SBA and most of its programs through the \nSeptember 17, 2004, which will allow time for the House to complete its \nwork on the SBA's 3-year reauthorization bill, passed by the Senate in \nSeptember 2003, and for the committee to find common ground with the \nadministration on needed program changes to SBA's venture capital \nprogram, the Small Business Investment Company program. In addition to \nthe 8-week extension, this bill includes a provision necessary to bring \nthe administration into compliance with a January 2004 recommendation \nby the SBA's Inspector General. This change will save the SBA hundreds \nof thousands of dollars by allowing the agency's fiscal and transfer \nagent for the 7(a) loan program's secondary market program to keep the \ninterest earned on fees lenders pay before they are remitted to the \ngovernment. Currently, the SBA does not have that authority. The \ncommittee wants the program to continue running smoothly and \nsuccessfully, and we think this change should accomplish this.\n  With passage of this bill, the committee expects the SBA to move \nforward on grants for all its programs and certification for minority \nbusinesses, and any other business it has been delaying.\n  I am pleased that this bill will extend all of SBA's programs and \npilot programs; however I am disappointed that the dire and urgent \nneeds of the Women's Business Center program have yet to be fully \naddressed.\n  As many of my colleagues know, there are currently 88 Women's \nBusiness Centers. Of these, 35 are in the initial grant program and 53 \nwill have graduated to the sustainability part of the program in this \nfunding cycle. These sustainability centers make up more than half of \nthe total Women's Business Centers, but under the current funding \nformula are only allotted 30 percent of the funds. Without changing the \nportion reserved for sustainability centers to 48 percent as the Snowe-\nKerry bill, S. 2266, contemplates, all grants to sustainability centers \ncould be cut in half, or worse, 23 experienced centers could lose \nfunding completely. In short, this change would simply direct the SBA \nto reserve 48 percent of the appropriated funds for the sustainability \ncenters, instead of 30 percent, which would allow enough funding to \nkeep open the most experienced centers, while still permitting the \nestablishment of new centers and protecting existing ones.\n  I believe it is not enough to merely extend the Women's Business \nCenter program and not make this critical and bipartisan change.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of small businesses and for \nconsidering immediate passage of this important small business \nbill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements regarding this matter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (S. 2700) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2700\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

We would like to proceed with \nthat at this juncture, until we see what the discussions entail. The \nresolution of that, I would expect, will be in the early afternoon, but \nit is uncertain.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that there are events tomorrow \nnight, so we should not be in late tomorrow night. Would it be \nappropriate to indicate that for Members on this side of the aisle?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, indeed, we will not be going late tomorrow \nnight. It will be early. I am not sure exactly what time, but there are \nevents planned tomorrow night. We don't expect to be in tomorrow night.\n  In terms of scheduling, because we are waiting for certain bills from \nthe House, we will be in close touch and let our Members know. We \nunderstand that we have events beginning this weekend and some \nbeginning on Friday as well. I had discussions with the Democratic \nleader earlier. We have a lot to do, and a lot of it is not seen on the \nSenate floor, but it is being produced. We have to address it before we \nleave.\n  The cloture vote I just filed on the circuit court judge we will be \ndebating for some time after tomorrow morning, so that may be what we \ndo tomorrow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
