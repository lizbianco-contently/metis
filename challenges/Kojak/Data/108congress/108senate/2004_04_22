Mr. President, this morning, following leader time, the \nSenate will be in a period of morning business for up to 60 minutes. \nThe morning business period will be divided. The Republican side will \ncontrol the first 30 minutes and the Democrat side will control the \nfinal 30 minutes.\n  After morning business, the Senate will begin 60 minutes of debate on \nthe motion to proceed to the asbestos bill. When the 1 hour of debate \nconcludes, the Senate will conduct a rollcall vote on invoking cloture \non the motion to proceed to the asbestos bill. We have heard from a \nnumber of Senators on this bill in the last couple of days. As the \ndebate has progressed, there have been a number of ongoing discussions \nwhich involved our options for moving forward on this important piece \nof legislation.\n  At this point, it is difficult to say exactly how the continued \nnegotiations are going to be carried out, but we are going forward with \nthe cloture vote today, and we will continue with discussions and \nnegotiations at the leadership level. If we are unable to invoke \ncloture and actually begin the asbestos bill, we will have an agreement \nto consider the victims' rights bill that was introduced yesterday by \nSenators Kyl, Feinstein, and others. That order provides for up to 2 \nhours of debate prior to a vote on passage of the bill.\n  I thank all of the Members who have assisted in bringing that to \nconclusion. Both the assistant Democratic leader and I mentioned last \nnight that they have done yeomen's work in bringing this legislation to \nthe point it is.\n   It is bipartisan. I know Senator Kyl has been very engaged in this \ndebate. And only through his efforts, working together with the efforts \nof Senator Feinstein and others, will we be able to finish that bill \ntoday.\n  I will be talking to the Democratic leadership about the schedule for \nthe remaining part of this week and next week as the course of the day \ngoes on.\n  I know my distinguished colleague from Missouri is here. I would be \nhappy for him to make a statement with regard to our visiting Chaplain \ntoday.\n  So people know, I have about a 4- or 5-minute statement to make \nbefore going to morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \ndistinguished minority whip.\n  I join with my colleagues today in welcoming a good friend to the \nSenate as guest Chaplain, Dr. Phillip McClendon of Joplin, MO. He is \nthe senior pastor of Calvary Baptist Church where for the past 20 years \nhe has served as a dynamic church and spiritual leader for southwest \nMissouri, ministering to all with whom he comes in contact, including \nhospital patients here and on his extensive missions\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\nabroad. While we claim him for Missouri, his pastoring and his services \nextend to many people beyond the borders of our State. We are extremely \ndelighted that he has been able to bring this body together and start \nus, we hope, on the right track today.\n  Dr. McClendon was educated in Georgia, Kentucky, and Missouri, and \nhas been pastor for lengthy periods of service in New Mexico and Texas \nbefore being elevated to the current status in Missouri.\n  In addition to his church responsibilities, Dr. McClendon is a widely \nrespected civic leader. He has served as trustee for the Ozark Mental \nHealth Center, on the board of directors for the Ronald McDonald House \nof the four States, and as a member of the Advisory Council for the \nCommunity Blood Center of the Ozarks.\n  Dr. McClendon's works can be read through his published works. He has \nbeen on numerous television broadcasts throughout the region and has \ndeveloped quite a wide following.\n  The interesting thing about Dr. McClendon is his ability to balance \nhis calling, his family duties, all the while contributing so much to \nthe Greater Joplin community. It underscores his dedication and active \ncommitment to doing God's work for the betterment of humanity and all \nof our spiritual lives.\n  Dr. McClendon and his wife Jackie have three children, Scott, Gwen, \nand Crystal. Today, we are very pleased to be able to welcome an \nenthusiastic group of friends and admirers as he opened the Senate for \nbusiness. We are truly delighted to welcome him and his group.\n  Thanks, Dr. McClendon, to you and your family, for your service.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to make these remarks. I thank the Chair \nfor giving me this opportunity.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, very briefly, I wish to comment on an event \nwe are celebrating throughout the United States today and indeed \nthroughout the world today. That is the fact that today is the 34th \nanniversary of Earth Day, an event that gives people the opportunity to \ncelebrate the environmental accomplishments that have been made over \nthe past three decades and, yes, to look ahead to see what progress can \nand should be made.\n  What has been so apparent to me as I travel back to Tennessee and \ntalk to people across Tennessee is the opportunity that this day and \nthis focus gives communities to discuss, to participate, and clean up \nof projects--to participate in conservation projects all across \nTennessee. And, thus, it is happening all across the country.\n  Thousands of volunteers today, right now as we speak, are \nparticipating in an event--and the next few weeks will continue that \ndiscussion and that activity--all of which will serve to raise \nenvironmental awareness and improve the cities and towns and the \nenvironment in which we live.\n  This year we have much to celebrate. The quality of our environment \nhas dramatically improved over the past 30 years. Federal, State, and \nlocal efforts have enhanced our air and enhanced our water quality by \nreducing pollution. Major steps have been taken to clean up \ncontaminated sites over the last 30 years and to protect our natural \nresources.\n  Since 1970--a little over 30 years ago--aggregate emissions of \nharmful pollutants have decreased by 25 percent. And that has \nhappened--this decreasing of the pollutants by 25 percent--at the same \ntime our gross domestic product has increased 161 percent. Energy \nconsumption has increased 42 percent.\n  Tennessee is home to some of our Nation's most diverse natural areas. \nWe have the Great Smoky Mountains in east Tennessee, a wonderful \nenvironment, a wonderful region, a wonderful space that I personally \nenjoy. I hike through it every year with my family--my wife Karyn and \nmy three boys.\n  It is our Nation's most visited National Park, the great Smoky \nMountains National Park. It is home to more than 100,000 different, \ndistinct species, hundreds of which are new to science. The park itself \nis one of the most biologically diverse, indeed, in the world. \nTennesseans know how critically important it is to protect and to \nconserve our limited resource.\n  In recognition of Earth Day, Tennesseans are volunteering all across \nthe State, in National Parks, community cleanup projects, in wildlife \nrefuges. A lot of the projects I mentioned are underway as I speak. In \nNashville, thousands turned out to Centennial Park to learn about the \nCumberland River and the region's water resources. Tennesseans are \ntaking part in cleanup activities in the Reelfoot National Wildlife \nRefuge which is in northwest Tennessee. In east Tennessee and Knoxville \nthere is the Fifth Annual Earthfest which is themed ``What's In Your \nWater,'' to highlight water resources and quality issues in east \nTennessee.\n  Federal agencies, in cooperation with national and grassroots \norganizations, are working together to educate Americans about how they \ncan participate in cleaning up their environment on a daily basis, what \nthey can do as individuals, as communities, initiatives such as the \nENERGY STAR Program, statewide recycling programs, and under the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Natural Resources Conservation Service \nis teaching people how to be good stewards of our planet.\n  Earth Day is, indeed, an opportunity to reflect our accomplishments \ntoday and think about how we can do more to improve the environment.\n  The administration has proposed several new initiatives that will \nreduce air pollution, which will support conservation and environmental \nstewardship programs and address our Nation's limited water resources \nissues. We also are working with international partners to address \nglobal climate change and assist developing countries with \nenvironmental challenges such as deforestation and illegal logging.\n  After more than 30 years, Earth Day has become an integral part of \nour Nation's environmental consciousness. No matter how you choose to \ncelebrate Earth Day, you will be taking part in an international effort \nto preserve our natural resources and build a healthier tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate will decide shortly what path \nto take on the pending asbestos liability legislation, otherwise known \nas the Fairness In Asbestos Injury Resolution Act, more frequently \nreferred to simply as the FAIR Act. This bill has inspired very strong \nsentiments from many Americans. Like my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, I am deeply sympathetic to those who have suffered severe \nmedical consequences from exposure to asbestos.\n  I am somewhat less sympathetic to those who may seek compensation \nwithout demonstrating a medical impact on their lives. While the number \nof mesothelioma claims has remained relatively steady at about 2,000 \nclaims\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\na year for the last 10 years, over 100,000 cases were filed in 2003.\n  According to the RAND Institute for Civil Justice, mesothelioma \nvictims receive only 17 percent of compensation awards, compared to 65 \npercent for nonmalignant claimants.\n  On top of that, trial lawyers may charge fees as high as 40 percent \nplus litigation expenses. The result of less justifiable lawsuits is \nmany real victims are denied compensation for actual injuries.\n  To date, 67 companies have been bankrupted and more than 60,000 \nAmericans have lost their jobs as a direct result of asbestos \nliability. Clearly, we have a problem in this country.\n  I followed the numerous Senate hearings held on this issue and I have \nmet with numerous Coloradans with a variety of perspectives. I met with \nthose who lost loved ones to mesothelioma, those who have lost jobs due \nto asbestos litigation, and those who are curtailing their \nmanufacturing operations in Colorado in anticipation of continued \nclaims.\n  The complexities of this issue are tremendous. I compliment my \ncolleagues, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the majority \nleader, for their work to date on this issue.\n\n  Beyond the FAIR Act, general litigation and litigation reform have \nbeen major topics of concern this session in the Senate. Last October, \nthe Senate focused on the Class Action Fairness Act. When a plaintiff's \ninjury is not worth enough to justify a legal suit to recover damages, \nindividuals similarly affected can combine damages for one lawsuit \nagainst a common defendant. In recent years, driven largely by a few \nunscrupulous attorneys, there has been an explosion in class action \nlitigation. Our economy bears an enormous burden due to this explosion \nof litigation. Unfortunately, much of that burden is carried by \nconsumers. Specific to these suits, these abuses of the system, the \nconsumer is often left out in the rain once there is a settlement. \nAttorneys can make millions, while the plaintiffs are often left with \nnothing more than a coupon for a service they were denied in the first \nplace.\n  Like so many things designed to protect consumers and ensure fair and \njust restitution, the tool of class action has been manipulated. Far \ntoo often, that manipulation has yielded tremendous wealth for \nattorneys driving these actions and little or nothing for the consumers \ninitially harmed.\n  The Center for Legal Policy recently reported from 1997 to 2000 \nUnited States firms saw a 300-percent increase in Federal class actions \nand a 1,000-percent spike in State class actions. The end result, as we \nwill see, is an increase in litigation, thus an increase in the cost of \ndoing business and higher costs passed along to the consumer. There \nare, in fact, a plethora of abuses that have contributed to the \ngeneration of this legislation in the Senate.\n  Nothing in the class action bill denied a consumer a right to make \nvalid claims. This point cannot be stressed enough. Our legal system \nhas functioned under this guiding principle for generations. We will do \nnothing in this Chamber to challenge that principle.\n  There are those in this body who see this bill differently. There are \nthose in this body who can look at the class action brought against \nBlockbuster Video where attorneys will collect a little less than $10 \nmillion and class members will get coupons toward future video rentals \nand say this is justice. This case, and cases like it, are \nrepresentative of the systematic denial of valid claims by class \nmembers and it is incumbent upon us to rectify this situation.\n  One such tool at our disposal is increased oversight of such \nsettlements. The Founding Fathers, in their infinite wisdom, envisioned \nproblems like this. The Constitution was drafted explicitly to provide \nfor Federal jurisdiction over all lawsuits between the citizens of \ndifferent States. These cases involving parties of diverse citizenship \nhave evolved into what we see today as national types of litigation or \nbig-dollar suits against large companies engaged in interstate \ncommerce. Over time, Congress has more narrowly defined constitutional \ndiversity and created a requirement that all plaintiffs be diverse from \nall defendants. The result today is venue shopping, attorneys seeking \nfavorable State courts through which to pursue an action that is \nnational in scope. The Founders knew such nebulous venue requirements \ncould lead to local biases in cases of broad significance and we have, \nunfortunately, arrived at that point. The Constitution provides for \nFederal jurisdiction over citizens of different States so local bias \nwill never become an issue. National, multimillion-dollar suits should \nnot be barred from Federal courts. The egregious practice of venue \nshopping flies in the face of the Founders' intent.\n\n  Class actions are a valuable part of the legal system. Recent abuses \nand a shift in the benefits of an action from class members and toward \nattorneys should not signal the end of access to appropriate legal \nrecourse. The system as it exists today is untenable.\n  Medical liability has become another increasingly important matter on \na national scale. In February, the Senate debated the Patient Crisis/\nAccess to Care Act. Skyrocketing medical liability premiums have \ntranslated directly to physicians limiting services, retiring early, or \nmoving out of the State--one State to another--to escape escalating \ncosts of liability insurance.\n  This cost is deeply felt and extends well beyond the physician-\npatient relationship. Emergency departments are losing staff and \nscaling back critical services, even trauma units. OB/GYNs and family \ndoctors have stopped delivering babies, and all too often high-risk \nprocedures--for example, neurosurgery--are postponed because surgeons \ncannot find or afford insurance.\n  The result is a serious threat to patient access to care. Twenty-six \npercent of health care institutions have cut back services or \neliminated patient care units. Seventy-eight percent of Americans fear \nthat skyrocketing medical liability costs will limit access to care \neven further.\n  If we look at the root of this problem, we see that median medical \nliability awards have increased 43 percent in 1 year from $700,000 in \n1999 to more than $1 million in the year 2000. In 2001, malpractice \ninsurers paid $1.53 in claims and costs for every $1 received in \nrevenue. This system is not sustainable and will not serve those \nAmericans in need of better health care.\n  We are suit happy. At some point Americans stopped bargaining and \nnegotiating in good faith. At some point we became less concerned with \njustice and more focused on assigning blame. More than assigning blame, \nwe now assign dollar amounts to virtually every major, minor, and \nperceived slight. We live in a country where family disputes are \nsettled in court.\n  Mr. President, at the risk of sounding too folksy, people where I \ncome from, where I was raised, simply do not see it this way. If this \nbody does nothing else today, we should commit to an overall effort to \nrecast our approach to the judicial system--a system that has grown \nobese and focused on greed rather than justice.\n  These are just a few examples of the cost of continued and increased \nlitigation and the importance of reform.\n  The FAIR Act, which faces a cloture vote later today, marks another \nattempt to deal with a pressing national issue. It is clear, however, \nthat the FAIR Act will not be permitted to come to an up-or-down vote \nin the Senate.\n  A variety of important bills have been effectively defeated before \nthey have ever come to an up-or-down vote in this body. Parliamentary \ntricks and filibuster by the Democrats have jammed numerous issues.\n  The following examples should clearly illustrate this obstruction.\n  The JOBS bill would both repeal a European tariff on nearly 100 \nAmerican-made products and cut taxes for manufacturers in the United \nStates. Although the JOBS bill passed the Finance Committee 19 to 2 and \nenjoys broad, bipartisan support, Democrats voted to block a vote on \nthe measure in March.\n  The medical liability legislation I discussed--patients across \nAmerica are denied critical health care, including emergency and \nobstetric care, because doctors and hospitals are closing their doors \nfrom skyrocketing liability costs. Opponents blocked a comprehensive, \nbipartisan bill in July of 2003. In February of 2004, Senate Democrats \nagain blocked an effort to protect women's access to obstetric and \ngynecological care. That was S. 2207.\n\n  The energy bill--a comprehensive energy bill would deliver nearly 1 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S4240]]\n\nAmerican jobs, increase renewable and alternative sources of energy, \nand reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. This bill has been \nblocked in the Senate for 3 years, including a provision to open ANWR \nand dramatically reduce America's dependence on foreign oil and create \nhundreds of thousands of more American jobs.\n  The Workforce Investment Act is projected to help more than 940,000 \ndislocated workers get the training they need to get good jobs. It was \npassed by both the House and the Senate--I might add unanimously in the \nSenate. Senate Democrats now refuse to appoint conferees so that the \nbill can become law.\n  Judges--the unprecedented, unconstitutional challenge to the Senate's \nadvise-and-consent role continues. A minority of Democrats have \nprevented six highly qualified Federal appeals court nominees from \nreceiving a fair, up-or-down confirmation vote and are threatening to \nuse partisan filibusters to prevent confirmation of additional judges. \nIf given an up-or-down vote, all these nominees would be serving on the \nbench today.\n  The class action legislation I mentioned would create a consumer bill \nof rights to ensure that victims are not denied fair compensation while \ntheir trial lawyers escape with the lion's share of court awards. On \nOctober 22, 2003, Senate Republicans and nine Democrats came one vote \nshort of overcoming the Democrat leadership's parliamentary \nobstruction.\n  Faith-based/charities legislation passed the Senate on April 9, 2003, \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support, 95 to 5, and similar legislation \nresoundingly passed the House on September 17, but the Democrat \nleadership is blocking a conference committee to resolve House-Senate \ndifferences and even allow a final vote. The CARE Act will spur more \ncharitable giving and assist faith-based organizations and community \ncharities.\n  Welfare reform--on April 1, 2004, Senate Democrats voted to block a \nmeasure to reauthorize the landmark 1996 welfare reforms. H.R. 4 would \nbuild on the successes of the 1996 reforms to strengthen work \nrequirements and promote healthy families, as well as provide an \nadditional $6 billion in childcare funding.\n  It is time to move forward with an agenda in the Senate. I think it \nis time for us to put aside the partisan politics we are experiencing \nin the Senate today and move forward with, I think, very important \nlegislation. I talked about some of that: liability reform, that \naffects both class actions as well as medical care; trying to ensure \nthat we have voluntarism. Welfare reform has been extremely successful. \nYet we find that obstructed in the Senate.\n  I hope, even though this is a Presidential year, and many of us are \nnot surprised by some of the Presidential politics, that the Democrats \nwill seek to cooperate more with the Republican majority so we can move \nforward with the agenda in the Senate.\n  There is a terrible cost being exacted for our delinquency on these \nmatters. Every day the outlook for health care, the burden of an un-\nreformed tort system run amuck, and opportunities for America's small \nbusinesses grows increasingly difficult. I pledge to work with my \ncolleagues on each of these issues, some of which I support and others \nwhich I may not, but I will work with colleagues to see that each bill \nreceives a fair up and down vote. Our constituents deserve better than \nto watch while the legislative process is held hostage for the \npolitical or ideological desires of a few members of this body.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield back my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4240-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4240-S4241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OBSTRUCTION TACTICS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern about what \nseems to be an all-too-apparent pattern in the Senate when we earnestly \ntry to work together to bring up issues that are important to the \nfuture of this country, such as the jobs in manufacturing bill, the FSC \nbill, where we have been trying to avoid more tariffs, which now have \nbeen levied against many manufacturers by the European Union, that are \nincreasing month by month. We are trying to get a bill passed to help \nour manufacturers, to help our manufacturing economy, and that is being \nblocked on the floor of the Senate.\n  Medical liability: We have had three votes just to bring the bill up \nto discuss it, to discuss an issue that is devastating my State. I have \nhad numerous town meetings across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \nDoctors, nurses, health professionals, hospital administrators, \npatients, and patient groups are coming and saying: We have to do \nsomething to deal with the skyrocketing cost of health insurance as a \nresult of medical liability insurance costs.\n  We have lost 1,100 doctors in Pennsylvania alone. We have great \nmedical schools, but we are almost last in the country now in \nphysicians under the age of 35. Yet we produce--next to New York and \nCalifornia, maybe Texas--more young physicians than any other State in \nthe country. It is a huge problem; yet we can't even debate it in the \nSenate because we are being blocked.\n  Energy is another one. It came very close. We worked out a bipartisan \nbill. It had bipartisan support. We couldn't get an energy bill passed \nbecause of a filibuster in the Senate. The same is true with workforce \ninvestment. We passed it. It is being blocked from going to conference. \nThat is a new obstruction tactic which is a sort of bait and switch. It \nis the idea that, yes, we will give you this, we will pass it, and then \nafter everybody believes we passed it and we have done our job, we are \nnot allowed to go to conference to work out the differences between the \ntwo bodies. So we can't get a bill done.\n  We have talked about judges over and over and spent many late nights \nhere talking about the obstructionism. Again, it is a new tactic, a new \nlevel of obstruction heretofore never seen in the Senate--requiring \njudges to get 60 votes for confirmation. So we have this new threshold \nfor judges. We have a new threshold for passing legislation which is \nnot allowing us to go to conference and requiring a 60-vote majority to \ngo to conference, not to pass a bill, not to bring a bill up. It is \nobstruction on top of obstruction.\n  We had a bipartisan welfare reform bill we were working on. We were \nworking to do more for daycare--many on the other side of the aisle \nwanted to do that--$7 billion more for daycare, a huge increase in \ndaycare funding with a very small increase in work requirement and in \nparticipation standards. It was blocked on the floor of the Senate.\n  On class action we came close--one vote. Again, we came close; not \n51, not passage, it came close to the 60 votes that are now required on \nevery single measure that comes before the Senate. We came one vote \nshort, and we still have no assurance of the ability to bring the bill \nup and to come to conclusion.\n  Faith-based charities is another example of a bill that passed with \n90-plus votes. We can't go to conference. This was a bill that was \nbipartisan in nature. Senator Lieberman and I were sponsors of the \nlegislation. There was no controversy surrounding it. Anything that was \ncontroversial was excised from the bill. Still we can't get the bill to \nconference to be able to get something that will infuse billions of \ndollars into charitable organizations across the country.\n  Now we add to it asbestos care and jobs. We have this bill. Again, \nwhat is this about? What is this vote about? This is about discussing \nthe bill. Is anyone in this Chamber saying there isn't a problem? There \nwas a settlement that was just agreed to wherein the average person in \nPennsylvania received $12,000, and the average claimant in Mississippi \nreceived $250,000 per person. Is this is a fair system, where people in \nMississippi, because of a ridiculous court situation that goes on and \nthe fraudulent court system in some counties in Mississippi, where \nlawyers have bought off the judiciary, that that is somehow or another \na fair\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\nsystem, that claimants in those communities should get more than \nsomeone who is similarly situated in another State?\n\n  This is a situation that is crying out for Federal intervention. If \nwe had this kind of discrimination going on in any other area, other \nthan the fact that trial lawyers are involved, personal injury lawyers \nare involved, if we had any of this discrimination going on between \nStates, both sides of the aisle would be screaming for a Federal \nsolution. But when you have a situation where 50 percent of the money \ngoes to lawyers and court costs and that money seems to finds its way \nback, interestingly enough, in the political system, then all of a \nsudden we don't mind discrimination between States.\n  We don't mind if some States do very well under this lottery system \nthat has evolved in these asbestos cases. We don't care if people who \nare sick and dying of mesothelioma get $10,000 in claims, and someone \nwho walked through a construction site where there was asbestos, who is \nnot sick, never will be sick, gets hundreds of thousands of dollars. We \ndon't care, just as long as our buddies, the personal injury lawyers, \nget their cut. That is what is going on here.\n  This is outrageous, with the severe problem we have in asbestos \nlitigation, as severe a problem and as inequitable a situation as we \nhave, as destructive to the economy as this is. Twenty-five percent of \nthe companies that have gone bankrupt have gone bankrupt in \nPennsylvania; 25 percent of those companies are Pennsylvania based.\n  We have a company Senator Hatch talked about the other day, Crown \nCork & Seal. Crown Cork & Seal makes bottle caps. If you opened up a \nCoke bottle, you used to have cork on the inside of the bottle cap. Now \nthey have plastic. But they make plastic containers and bottle caps, \nall those things. They bought a bottling company in 1963, a cork \ncompany, as part of their growth. That company also had an insulation \nbusiness. They owned the insulation business for 90 days--they never \noperated it--90 days in 1963. They spent $7 million on the acquisition. \nThey have already paid out $400 million in claims on a business they \nnever operated. What has that done? It has crippled that business. It \nis still surviving because it is a great company and it is still a \nworld leader, but $400 million out of a bottom line of a company that \nnever made the product, that owned it for 90 days and sold it as soon \nas they could find a buyer. They never operated the business and they \nstill have tens of thousands of claims outstanding. This is wrong. If \nyou want to talk about hurting manufacturers, I would like someone on \nthe other side to stand up and say how this is fair to manufacturing.\n  By the way, most of these claims and most of the money being paid out \nis going to lawyers, not people who are sick. Most of the claims are \ngoing to people who are not sick, not people who are sick, because most \nof the claims are filed by people who are not sick. This is an outrage, \nand we can't even discuss it here in the Senate. We can't even bring \nthe bill up and have an amendment. We can't let the Senate work its \nwill. I hear so much the complaint, if you just let the Senate work its \nwill, bring these bills up. We can have a discussion. We have our \nmessage amendments that we want to do. But let's bring the bill up.\n  Well, here we are. Let's bring the bill up. When it comes to our \nfriends, the personal injury lawyers, we can't bring those bills up. We \nwill bring up other bills but not when it comes to our buddies, the \npersonal injury lawyers. Because it is a campaign season, we have \ncampaigns to fund.\n  This is an outrage. I don't want to hear any more complaints from the \nother side of the aisle about how manufacturing is in the doldrums when \nthis particular bill could do more to stimulate capital investment in \nmanufacturing and growth in the manufacturing sector and stop those \ncompanies from moving offshore. Why? Because they don't want these \nclaims and the litigation environment--asbestos is probably the poster \nchild for that--that they have to live with.\n  We have an obligation to those who are sick to set up a fund so \npeople who are sick, have health care expenditures, and are going \nthrough difficult times, who are disabled, get the resources they need \nand deserve as a result of being exposed to asbestos. We have an \nobligation. I can tell you the insurance companies, the manufacturers, \nare willing to put up over $100 billion to help people who are sick, \nand by the way, there is very little money for lawyers. That is the \nproblem here. We are OK with the $100 billion or more for folks who are \nsick, but what about our friends, the lawyers? What are they going to \ndo? How are they going to feed their families? Is that the real concern \nhere?\n\n  The concern in asbestos cases should be the people who are sick, not \nthe lawyers who are making right now the lion's share of the money on \nthis issue. That is what we are trying to get to here.\n  All we are trying to do is discuss it. The bill that is before us I \nthink puts $114 billion in the trust fund. I would be willing to \ncontinue to work on this point and see if we can get that money up \nhigher. I am willing to look at all sorts of aspects of this bill to \nsee if we can find a way to create a system to help people who are sick \nin this country as a result of exposure to asbestos and stop the \nbleeding of these people--the bleeding of these people--by personal \ninjury lawyers who care more about their bottom line than helping \npeople who are sick. If they really were concerned about people who are \nsick, there would not be tens of thousands of cases being filed in \nAmerica today by people who are not sick because that money is being \ndrained away from people who are sick to people who are not sick and to \nlawyers who are suing on their behalf.\n  What is happening in this system is criminal, in my opinion, and for \nthe Senate to say we simply do not want to discuss it is an outrage.\n  I know the negotiations are continuing among labor, the insurance \ncompanies, and manufacturers, and I assume trial lawyers are involved, \nalthough probably objecting to everything, but we need to come to a \nconclusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, we need to help those people who are \nsick, and we need to help them now.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today I rise to recognize one of our most \nprominent Wisconsinites, Gaylord Nelson, the founder of Earth Day, the \nman who fundamentally changed the way American people view the \nenvironment.\n  Before Gaylord Nelson came along, pollution and ecology were fringe \nsubjects, a concern of only a few academics. After Gaylord Nelson \ncreated Earth Day in 1970, environmental issues exploded into our \npublic debate. In that first year, almost 20 million people \nparticipated in Earth Day events--an instant success. By last year, 500 \nmillion people in 167 countries took part in Earth Day, spreading the \nmessage of environmental stewardship.\n  Earth Day laid the foundation for landmark environmental legislation. \nAll over the country, Americans heard about the dangers of lead in our \nwater, pesticides in our drinking water, and chemicals in our soil. An \ninformed public brought pressure on Congress and the President to act. \nThe movement that started that first Earth Day led to the Clean Air \nAct, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, \nand Superfund legislation. These are the foundations of environmental \nlaw today, and they would not have been possible without the work and \nthe vision of Senator Gaylord Nelson.\n  That vision is still necessary today as we struggle to complete the \nwork Gaylord Nelson started in 1970. Congress and the administration \nstill must address arsenic in the water, mercury in the air, and the \nimpact of outdated coal-burning powerplants, just to name a few \noutstanding environmental problems.\n  Gaylord Nelson's dream is not yet a reality, but it is worth fighting \nfor, as is so much Gaylord Nelson has championed.\n  Senator Nelson entered public service in 1948 after serving 4 years \nin the\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\nmilitary during World War II. He served as a Wisconsin State senator, \nGovernor, and then as a U.S. Senator for 18 years. As Governor, he was \nknown for conservation efforts and preserving wetlands long before \nthose causes became popular nationally. As a Senator, he built on his \nenvironmental reputation to further issues, including the preservation \nof the Appalachian Trail corridor and the creation of a national trail \nsystem.\n  While he left the Government in 1981, Gaylord Nelson never stopped \nfighting for the environment. He joined the Wilderness Society where he \nhas worked tirelessly ever since. Even today at age 87, he is an active \nadvocate for fragile lands around the country.\n  This year, Earth Day is a reminder of how much progress we have made \nand how much further we have yet to go. In the 1970s, the symbol of \nenvironmental decay was the burning Cuyahoga River, a waterway turned \ninto a drainage ditch for industry. While Cleveland suffered much \nridicule for that ecological disaster, they were not alone. At that \ntime, our natural resources were being squandered and scarred in \ncommunity after community.\n  Today such obvious examples of irresponsibility are harder to find. \nNow we struggle with pollution that is more diffuse and harder to \ntrack, but still dangerous. In Wisconsin, our northern lakes contain so \nmuch mercury the fish caught there are often unsafe to eat. And in the \nsoutheastern part of my State, the air is contaminated with pollutants, \nmany of which traveled hundreds of miles before impacting our \nenvironment.\n\n  Challenges such as these require everyone in the region, the country, \nand even the world to work together to lower emissions and limit \ndischarge. Global connectedness was what the original Earth Day was all \nabout, and that message still needs to be heard today. Gaylord Nelson \nwanted us all to realize we could not escape the consequences of \npollution by burying our garbage somewhere else or sending it up ever \ntaller smokestacks.\n  Earth Day also reminds us we need to work internationally. We need to \nengage developing economies, such as China, India, and Russia, to head \noff major environmental disasters. We are not on this planet alone, and \nwe can no longer pretend environmental damage around the globe does not \ncome back to haunt us here at home. Senator Nelson understood that \nlesson almost 40 years ago, and he has been teaching it to the rest of \nus ever since.\n  We have made progress in heeding Gaylord Nelson's call to action over \nthe last 34 years. Water quality is better off than it was in 1970. \nMany dangerous toxins are off the market, and some large environmental \ndisasters of the past are clean today. But we certainly are not ready \nto declare we do not need Earth Day anymore, and we are not ready to \nlet Gaylord Nelson retire. We are more aware today of the global and \nlong-term impact our actions have on our Earth, and with that greater \nawareness comes a greater responsibility to leave the planet cleaner \nand healthier.\n  Earth Day is an opportunity for Members of Congress to recommit \nourselves to that goal, and Earth Day is a day to thank Gaylord Nelson \nfor focusing us on how we impact the environment that sustains us and \nthe legacy we owe to the generations that follow us.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there is no one here from the majority. I \nknow this is time that has been set aside for morning business, and we \nhave assigned speakers on this side. Senator Durbin came over early \nthis morning and expressed a desire to speak regarding Mary McGrory, \nwho was a friend of a number of people in this body and thousands of \npeople around the country. Senator Dorgan also came here to speak on \nher behalf. We have some extra time now.\n  Since there is no one here--and if the majority needs additional \ntime, we will give that to them--I ask unanimous consent that there be \nan additional 10 minutes in morning business so that Senators on this \nside may speak about Mary McGrory. We also add that time in morning \nbusiness for the majority. That will be an additional 20 minutes if, in \nfact, the majority wants that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4242-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4242-S4244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY McGRORY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \ntrying to accommodate a number of us who are anxious to come to the \nfloor and say a few words about a great woman.\n  America lost one of its greatest journalists last night. Washington \nPost columnist Mary McGrory filed her last story at George Washington \nHospital. Mary McGrory has been described by her peers as a ``luminous \nwriter,'' ``the clearest thinker in the business,'' ``a pioneering \nforce in today's journalism,'' ``a lyrical writer.''\n  She hailed from the same Boston Irish roots as Tip O'Neill. She found \nthe love of her life in the written word. She made it to the top in a \nman's world of reporting and sharp-elbow politics. There are those who \nply their journalistic trade with blunt instruments and short-lived \nprose, but there are a few who make their word march and sing. Mary \nMcGrory was one of those few.\n  I first heard her name 38 years ago when I was a college intern in \nthe Senate. I can recall Senator Paul Douglas' personal secretary \ntelling the Senator Mary McGrory was waiting to see him. Thirty years \nlater, elected to the Senate, my staff would tell me, Mary McGrory is \nwaiting to see you.\n  One could not help but be drawn to Mary, her Irish wit, her boundless \nenergy, even in the later years. Her blunt criticism of hypocrisy and \nvenality were a joy to witness.\n  It was my good fortune to be a member of Mary McGrory's ``fruitcake \nclub.'' It was a loose conspiracy drawn together for dinner at Mary's \nhome at least once a year to celebrate the much honored but seldom \neaten fruitcake which Senator Max Cleland sent to Mary at Christmas. We \nwould all arrive late after votes on the House and Senate floor--Max \nCleland, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter of New York, Phil and Melanne \nVerveer, longtime friends and a few new aspirants to the club. What \nfollowed were endless rounds of wine and a beef roast that always \nseemed to need a return trip to the oven.\n  After dinner, we would move to the living room surrounded by the \nmementos of Mary's storied career, reminders of her proud mention on \nRichard Nixon's enemy's list, rollcalls from the Watergate hearing and \nmore. Over her desk, where she sat down to write at home, was a poem by \nher beloved W B. Yeats entitled ``Adam's Curse.''\n  I spotted it and started to read it one evening at the party, and \nMary saw me. She walked over and recited from memory this part of the \npoem:\n\n     Better go down upon your marrow-bones\n     And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones\n     Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;\n     For to articulate sweet sounds together\n     Is to work harder than all these, and yet\n     Be thought an idler by the noisy set\n     Of bankers, schoolmasters and clergymen\n     The martyrs call the world.\n\n  Mary McGrory understood the burden of good writing. Yeats tells us in \nthis poem that producing something beautiful is not easy, though it has \nthe curse of looking easy. Mary McGrory did indeed make it look easy. \nMary's poetry and beauty were shared in her word and in her life, and \nmany of us were blessed to be a very small part of it.\n  Before she was cruelly silenced by a stroke last year, Mary would \nwrite and speak with the emotion of a poet's heart. I recall our last \ndinner when she turned and recited to me one of her favorite poems by \nWilliam Butler Yeats. It is entitled ``When You Are Old.''\n\n     When you are old and grey and full of sleep,\n     And nodding by the fire, take down this book,\n     And slowly read, and dream of the soft look\n     Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\n     How many loved your moments of glad grace,\n     And loved your beauty with love false or true,\n     But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\n     And loved the sorrows of your changing face;\n     And bending down beside the glowing bars,\n     Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\n     And paced upon the mountains overhead\n     And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\n\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\n\n  In the clear night sky over our Nation's Capital there will always be \none bright star called Mary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I personally express my appreciation to Senator Durbin for \nhis remarkable words on behalf of a tremendously interesting woman. I \ndid not know Mary McGrory when she was a young woman; I only knew her \nwhen she was an older woman. She would come to my office and say: You \nhave got more to tell me than that.\n  She was a wonderful person, and I was a newcomer to her fruitcake \nsociety gatherings, but I do say that one of the things that did break \nher heart was the defeat of Max Cleland. She talked to me about that \nmore than she talked to me about many other things. She cared a great \ndeal about Max, and of all of the unfairness in life that she had seen \nthat was at the top of her list.\n  Mary McGrory is somebody who stood for fairness. A lot of people in \nthe world are for fairness and level playing fields, but very few \npeople are gifted. She was gifted. There are gifted athletes in the \nworld. She was a gifted writer. She could write and you would say to \nyourself, that is how I feel, why can I not express it the way she \ndoes?\n  I will miss Mary very much. She was a wonderful woman, someone I will \nalways remember as a person who not only believed in level playing \nfields but created many level playing fields during her lifetime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, Mary McGrory was not always easy on me. \nIn fact, sometimes I thought she was a little tough on me. On the other \nhand, I have to acknowledge she was a great writer. I enjoyed her \npersonally. We had a number of conversations where we had very pleasant \nexchanges.\n  There is no question she was truly one of the most important \njournalists in this town. She was critical to the Washington Post. She \nbelieved what she did, she believed what she wrote, and she wrote well \nand set journalistic standards for many young journalists to follow.\n  I personally respected her and am grieved at her death. It was not \nunexpected. We know she had some difficulties over the last few years. \nBut I, for one, will grieve at her death.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Kennedy family, the city, and the \nnation lost a respected and valued friend yesterday with the passing of \nMary McGrory.\n  My brothers, Jack and Bobby, admired her, as America does and did. \nMary was Boston Irish to the core. Boston is proud of its many sons and \ndaughters who have played a role in the country's life, and Mary \nMcGrory was certainly in our nation's Hall of Fame as one of the all-\ntime greats in journalism.\n  Here in the Nation's Capital, in this city of America's monuments, \nMary McGrory belongs among them. She will always be remembered and \nrespected for her keen intellect, her deep allegiance to the truth, her \nunquestioned integrity, her respect for principled leadership, as well \nas her impatience for empty policies and hollow politics.\n  Mary loved the issues, but she also loved her flowers and she loved \nto quote the poet Yeats. She was steeped with a keen sense of the \nlevity of life, and she held everyone she met to the same high \nstandards that she expected for herself. No other journalist could cut \nto the heart of a complicated issue as quickly or as beautifully as \nMary McGrory could. Millions across the Nation eagerly looked for her \nwritings, and the glow of her morning columns could last the entire \nday. I often thought she should win a Pulitzer Prize every year.\n  Vicky and I had the chance to visit with Mary last month. We were \nsaddened by her long illness, but she remained the same beautiful, \ninquisitive, insightful, and full-of-life Mary to the very end. We'll \nmiss her very much. We love you, Mary, and we always will.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, it is with a great deal of sadness that I \nrise in memory of an outstanding journalist and a good friend, Mary \nMcGrory, who passed away last night at the age of 85.\n  Mary was truly one of the most accomplished journalists of our time. \nShe was a real news reporter--one who spent enormous amounts of time \nand energy getting to the bottom of a story, and then spent hours more \nputting it into the right words. With her trademark wit and Pulitzer-\nPrize winning prose, Mary McGrory helped millions of Americans \nunderstand some of the most significant events of the past 50 years--\nfrom the McCarthy hearings, the Kennedy assassination, and Watergate to \nthe attacks of September 11 and the buildup to the war in Iraq.\n  She began her career in journalism writing book reviews and other \npieces for the Boston Herald-Traveler. In 1947, she transferred to the \nWashington Star, and it was there that she made her mark as a reporter. \nShe remained at the Star until the paper shut down in 1981. From then \non, she wrote for the Washington Post for over two decades. The only \nthing that could stop Mary from writing was the stroke she suffered a \nlittle over a year ago.\n  Mary's skill, integrity, and relentless effort won her tremendous \nesteem from her colleagues, as well as from the public figures whose \nlives and actions she detailed. Mary broke into a field that was very \nmuch a man's world, and she established herself as one of its giants. \nHer stature was clear to anyone who ever saw her during a political \ncampaign, when fellow reporters and even the candidates themselves \nwould literally carry her bags.\n  Mary came from the old school of reporting. During her later years, \nwhile many of her younger colleagues traveled with laptops, digital \nrecorders, and cell phones, Mary made do with her pen and notebook.\n  Mary was never one to beat around the bush in her writing. You always \nknew where she stood. Her no-nonsense approach could delight those who \nagreed with her, and infuriate those who did not. But regardless of \nwhether you were on her side or not, Mary McGrory earned your respect.\n  I was fortunate to experience not only Mary's writing, but her \nsingular personality. She was truly someone who enjoyed life and tried \nto squeeze every last drop out of it.\n  I would like to share a few thoughts on Mary from some of her \ncolleagues:\n  David Broder of the Washington Post said:\n\n       If you traveled with Mary, you watched a consummate \n     craftsman hard at work, an interviewer whose soft purr put \n     citizens at ease and disarmed the most hard-shelled old pols. \n     She talked with everyone, and everyone, great and small, \n     wanted to talk with her.\n\n  Leonard Downie, Jr., the Executive Editor of the Washington Post:\n\n       Mary was simply one of the best opinion columnists of her \n     time.\n\n  Maureen Dowd of the New York Times called Mary:\n\n     the most luminous writer and clearest thinker in the \n     business.\n\n  Finally, Brian McGrory of the Boston Globe, who is also Mary's \ncousin, described Mary's life as:\n\n     one of the most important, colorful, and enduring newspaper \n     careers that the American public has had the pleasure to \n     read.\n\n  I mourn Mary's passing. But I also celebrate her life. She was truly \nan outstanding reporter and writer, and a remarkable human being. We \nwill all miss her very much.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

How much time remains in morning business on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 28\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me yield as much time as I may consume to myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. This morning's news is very sad news for those of us who \nknew and loved Mary McGrory, one of the wonderful writers of our age, \none of the really interesting thinkers and warm and wonderful human \nbeings. According to the news reports, she died last evening at a \nhospital here in Washington, DC.\n  I wrote her a letter some months ago telling Mary, after she had \nfallen ill:\n\n       I have been waiting and hoping that I may again see your \n     byline in the Washington Post. I remain hopeful that we will \n     once again be able to start the day by reading a Mary McGrory \n     column and then shaking our fist in the air, shouting: Yes \n     that is what I should have said.\n\n  Mary never did get back to work. Her column never again appeared. But \nthis Capitol Building, the op-ed pages of the Washington Post, and \npolitical discourse in this country for 50 years have been affected by \nwhat Mary thought, what Mary said, and what Mary wrote.\n  She was quite a remarkable person. She won a Pulitzer Prize. She \ncovered the major events for over 50 years, and she wrote columns using \nwords that were extraordinary. She would find ways to say things that \nmost of us are at a loss to explain.\n  Often in the morning I would open the newspaper to see the Mary \nMcGrory column and think how wonderfully she wrote. More than that, she \nwas also a very special friend to many of us, in many ways. She would \nstand outside this Chamber, sometimes early in the morning, sometimes \nlate at night, and she would get the story. She would do the hard work, \nask the questions, follow people until she got answers, and then she \nwould write her column. Her cousin, Brian McGrory, wrote a piece that \nappeared in the Boston Globe and the Washington Post about Mary. He \nprobably describes her best, and in many ways brings a smile to those \nof us who knew Mary. He said:\n\n       While most Washington pundits closet themselves with their \n     own profound thoughts, interrupted only by lunch at the Palm \n     with the Secretary of Something, Mary employs old-fashioned \n     tools: a sensible pair of shoes, a Bic, and a notebook. She \n     haunts congressional hearings. She sits with the unwashed in \n     the back of the White House briefing room.\n\n  He also said at the end of his article--this is an article that was \nwritten last November when Mary was ill:\n\n       Hers is a world of soft irony. She checks into elaborate \n     spas in Italy every year, but while there, always gains a few \n     pounds. She was audited by the Nixon administration and got a \n     refund. At a stiff Washington party she once whispered to me, \n     ``Always approach the shrimp bowl like you own it.''\n\n  Mary McGrory was a wonderful human being with a great sense of humor. \nBut she wrote like the wind. I wish I could again see her byline. David \nBroder in January wrote a wonderful piece about Mary Mack. He began:\n\n       I am headed out this week for my 12th presidential \n     campaign, but unlike the first 11, I will not have the \n     company of my favorite traveling companion, Mary McGrory. The \n     great liberal columnist, surely the most elegant newspaper \n     writer Americans have read over the past half-century, has \n     been ill since last March and recently accepted the generous \n     buyout offer given to veteran employees by the Post. \n     Incomprehensible as it seems, she has finished her \n     journalistic career.\n\n  Then David Broder, in his own inimitable style, describes Mary \nMcGrory.\n  I think of Mary McGrory. I think of not just seeing her here in the \nCapitol, or having lunch with Mary, I think of the questions she would \nask politicians. I was on the receiving end of a number of those \nquestions: Always coming from the oblique, always a bit different, from \na slightly different angle, always from a slightly different \nperspective. Often they were the questions others didn't ask or \nwouldn't ask. She had a very inquiring mind and she had a wonderful \nability to write.\n  So we will no longer be blessed with the presence of Mary McGrory \nhere in this Capitol Building and in this Capitol of the United States, \ncovering the major events, which she started doing 50 years ago in the \nMcCarthy hearings. But she will be in our thoughts forever. My thoughts \nand prayers go out to Mary's relatives.\n  I attended a service once at which Senator Byrd spoke. He finished \nwith a quote from Thomas Moore. The last two lines were:\n\n     You can shatter, you can break the vase if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.\n\n  Although Mary has passed and all of us are saddened by the loss of a \nfriend and America has lost one of the great writers in the last half \ncentury, Mary will remain with us forever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. It is my understanding we are still in morning business \nand we have about 5 or 6 minutes remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed and use that \ntime up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Montana, that is true. We extended \nyour side an additional 10 minutes. Your time was gone, but now you \nhave additional time. As to when it is used now--you were to get the \nfirst half; we were to get the second half. It is kind of a jump ball \nright now, so you have the floor for 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4244-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4244-S4245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EARTH DAY\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I thank my friend from Nevada and my good \nfriend from Vermont. Today is Earth Day. Of course, most of us who are \ninvolved in agriculture, we don't set aside one specific day. Every day \nis Earth Day for those of us who use the Earth to produce the wealth of \nthe country.\n  Anyway, every year about this time they always release the index of \nleading environmental indicators, which gives us an overall measuring \nstick on how good or how bad we are doing in dealing with the \nenvironment. This press release came out of San Francisco. It is \nreleased by a group that is a think tank in Bozeman, MT. They brought \nout some information that we tend to forget when we talk about the \nenvironment. Steven Hayward wrote the press release. Of course we are \ndoing better than a lot of people think we are doing.\n  Environmental quality is improving steadily, in some cases \ndramatically, in key areas with which we try to deal. Vehicle emissions \nare dropping about 10 percent per year as the fleet turns over to \ninherently cleaner vehicles, including SUVs. We are making progress. \nNinety-four percent of the population is served by water systems that \nhave reported no violation of any health-based standards.\n  We are getting better in trying to provide clean water for our \ncitizens. There has been a 55-percent decline in toxic releases since \n1988 even while total output of industries covered by this measurement \nhas increased 40 percent. We are making progress. That is dramatic \nprogress as far as quality is concerned.\n  Despite most popular assumptions, U.S. air quality tends to be found \nat least equal, if not slightly better, than in Europe. It seems we \nhave a lot of people who distract and criticize us for our \nenvironmental policies.\n  This year's index includes a list of the media's best environmental \nreporting on that, which includes the Boston Globe, the Washington \nPost, the Atlantic Monthly, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, \nthe New Republic, and the Wall Street Journal.\n  In other words, all of these folks have earned their spurs, so to \nspeak, in keeping the public informed on such matters.\n  There have also been notable improvements in our Government reporting \nwith the EPA's first ever composite on national trends and State-based \ninitiatives to improve water quality reporting and monitoring.\n  Private conservation efforts, such as Ducks Unlimited, and private \nwater trusts have been highly successful as reported this year.\n  The index reports one of the few areas to show a decline in the \nquality is that of public lands. While funding and land allotments have \nincreased, quality has deteriorated by the most significant measures. \nThe root of the problem is excess of political management, and the \nanswer can be found in innovative solutions such as land trusts and \nresource leases.\n  This year's index includes a special section comparing quality \nbetween the U.S. and Europe. We are winning that also.\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\n  The other ways:\n\n       Doomsaying and know-nothingism gets better headlines and \n     work well for direct-mail fundraising . . . but a serious \n     look at the data helps us to appreciate how far we've come, \n     and helps us set priorities for the next generation of \n     environmental activism.\n\n  Whenever we hear a lot of doomsaying that we are doing very badly, \nthe scorecard reports to us overall a different kind of story. The only \nplace we are not making any improvements at all is on the lands the \nFederal Government manages, not the land that is managed in the private \nsector.\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire text of the press release be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Earth Day Is Cause for Celebration: Environmental Trends Mostly \n                                Positive\n\n (By Steven Hayward, with Michael De Alessi, Holly L.

Environmental quality has improved \n     so much, in fact, that it is nearly impossible to paint a \n     grim, gloom-and-doom picture anymore.\n       Environmental quality is improving steadily and in some \n     cases dramatically in key areas: Average vehicle emissions \n     are dropping about 10 percent per year as the fleet turns \n     over to inherently cleaner vehicles, including modern SUVs; \n     ninety-four percent of the population is served by water \n     systems that have reported no violations of any health-based \n     standards; there has been a 55-percent decline in toxic \n     releases since 1988, even while total output of the \n     industries covered by this measurement has increased 40 \n     percent; and despite most popular assumptions, U.S. air \n     quality trends are found to be at least equal, if not \n     slightly better, than in Europe.\n       This year's Index includes a list of the media's best \n     environmental reporting.

Because the climate models have been based \n     on flawed economic assumptions, there is even greater \n     uncertainty now in the range of CO2 emissions projections. \n     This means the prognosis is probably not as grim as \n     conventional wisdom would have us believe.\n       The Index shows that one of the few areas to show a decline \n     in quality is that of public lands. While funding and land \n     allotments have increased, quality has deteriorated by most \n     significant measures.

Madam President, Earth Day usually marks the beginning of \nthe President's and his green team's migration out to our Nation's \nparks, forests, and wildlife refuges.\n  Since this is an election year, I am sure they are ramping up their \nefforts to greenwash their environmental record with very nice photo \nops.\n  Greenwash, like whitewash, doesn't stick. You have only to open the \ndaily newspaper to see the laserlike focus the Bush administration has \ntaken to rolling back our environmental laws, and while doing so \nrewarding special interests and corporate polluters. The starkest \nexample is their outright assault on the most bipartisan environmental \nlaw of the 20th century, the Clean Air Act. I say bipartisan because \nleading Republicans and leading Democrats across the political \nspectrum, in the House and in the Senate, came together to pass the \nClean Air Act. My predecessor, the senior Senator from Vermont, Bob \nStafford, was one of those leaders.\n  You would think of all acts, one that would be put together by \nRepublicans and Democrats would be safe from assault by this \nAdministration. That is not the case.\n  By stealthy executive fiat, the Administration has dismantled the \nClean Air Act bit by bit to let polluting industries off the hook when \nit comes to cleaning up dirty coal-fired powerplants that each year \nbelch hundreds of thousands of tons of soot and toxic pollutants--\npollutants like mercury.\n  The administration's actions to retreat from strong mercury controls, \nto undermine current lawsuits against the biggest utility companies, \nand to allow new coal-fired powerplants to be built without the best \ncontrols amounts to a triple whammy for public health and the \nenvironment.\n  We often speak about being family friendly in this body. How do we \ntell a pregnant mother or a parent with small children how family \nfriendly it is to allow more mercury into our air and into our water \nand the fish we eat.\n\n  When the Clean Air Act was passed, Congress gave coal-fired \npowerplants a grace period to either clean up or shut down. At the end \nof the Clinton administration, we were making real progress toward \nmeeting that goal. States such as my State of Vermont, which have been \nthe dumping ground for toxic pollutants like mercury for decades, were \nfinally going to get some relief. But, unfortunately, the only people \nletting out a sigh of relief now are the CEOs and corporate attorneys \nin the boardrooms of multibillion dollar energy companies. They are the \nonly ones celebrating this Earth Day.\n  Despite all of the administration's public relations tactics, I \nbelieve the American people are catching on, and enough is enough. To \ndate, this Administration has made well over 300 rollbacks to our \nenvironmental protections. Think of that, three years in office and \nthey have had 300 rollbacks of our environmental laws.\n  There is certainly a lot about which the American people should be \noutraged. But I think it is important to take note of the strong \nbipartisan and growing outcry about the Administration's latest retreat \nfrom the Clean Air Act in the form of its mercury proposal.\n  Senators Snowe, Jeffords, Dayton, and I were joined by 41 other \nSenators in calling on the administration to withdraw its mercury \nproposal. The concerns are building so swiftly they may soon reach \ncritical mass.\n  Look at this map. It gives some indication why the concerns are so \ngreat and why the objections are bipartisan.\n  This is the Environmental Protection Agency's own map: ``Mercury \nDeposition in the United States.''\n  This is the Canadian border along here. Look how the mercury, because \nthey are willing to violate and allow\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\nviolations of the Clean Air Act, comes across. Look how it inundates \nthe States in this area. My own State of Vermont is basically hidden \nunder the deepest red of mercury pollution on the chart.\n\n  The new EPA proposal to reduce mercury emissions was supposed to \nbring the powerplants into the 21st century and clean up their \nemissions. It does not do that. It falls short of what is necessary and \nfalls far short of what is possible.\n  Despite the Administration's best efforts to use every tactic in its \npublic relations arsenal to convince Americans more mercury in the \nwater, food, and environment over a long period of time is the best we \ncan do, it is not working.\n  In the last 2 months, much has come to light about the \nAdministration's close collusion with polluting industries and devising \nits policy on mercury. The lobbyists from the industry sent their \nproposal to the Administration. The Administration does not even \npretend to look at this scientifically or be independent. They just \ntake it verbatim. They might as well have kept the letterheads from \nsome of these companies. Instead of using the EPA letterhead, they \ncould put ``Polluters 'R Us,'' or whatever industry sent to them. There \nare 20 examples where industry helped ghostwrite the mercury proposal.\n  In a way, it is almost humorous that they would be so blatant about \nturning this over to the polluters, except that it suggests a very \nserious breach of the public rulemaking process and undermines the \npublic trust in EPA's ability to be an independent decision-maker and \nperform its mission to protect human health and safeguard the natural \nenvironment.\n  This Administration has a credibility problem about its approach to \nthe Clean Air Act and to mercury pollution. New warnings about mercury \nrisk from tuna, increasing numbers of pregnant women with mercury \nlevels above safe levels, more newborns being born with high mercury \nlevels, all are adding up to widespread and growing public demand for \nprompt action. We know from reports in the New York Times that the Bush \nadministration employed a favorite tactic of sweeping science under the \nrug when it was drafting the mercury proposal.\n  But we cannot ignore the facts. This chart shows the estimates of \nnewborn children and women with unsafe mercury blood levels. They have \ndoubled. These are some of the estimates from EPA scientists about \nwhich the White House wished the American people did not know.\n  Anyone who has children or grandchildren should worry about this \nissue. Anybody who is expecting a child should worry about what this \nadministration is doing. Anybody who has young children should worry \nabout what they are doing. The estimate of women of childbearing age \nwith mercury levels above what EPA considers safe has doubled. \nApparently, the administration does not want the public to know that \ntheir mercury proposal does not go far enough fast enough to protect \nmothers and newborns from mercury.\n  The same strategy is to ignore career staff and public health experts \nin the administration's proposal to write a giant loophole into the \nClean Air Act New Source Review, called NSR. For anyone who has not \nseen it, I suggest a careful reading of the New York Times magazine \narticle from several weekends ago titled ``Up In Smoke'' to see how the \nBush administration strategically placed industry lawyers in key \npositions at EPA, spending the last few years helping the biggest \nutility companies in the country get off the legal hook of pollution \ncontrol plans. They put the fox in to guard the henhouse. They have \nsaid to industry--and these are industries that contributed mightily to \nthis administration--they have said: We will set aside the nonpartisan \nnonpolitical scientists; we will set aside the people whose sworn duty \nis to be here to protect the American public; we will put your lawyers \nin place, and we will let them write the rules for the rest of the \ncountry.\n  Agency experts repeatedly warned the political appointees at the EPA \nthat through new policy, this new NSR policy would undercut the \nlawsuits.\n  And they went even further. They gave industry even more than they \nasked for and now industry attorneys are going to court where cases \nhave been brought and are saying they should be dismissed because of \nthe administration's actions. This is a very real problem in States \nlike mine, if you are downwind.\n  If Government wins the NSR cases despite the administration's back-\ndoor tactics and hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic pollutants will \nbe cut.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration is not satisfied. Retreating \nfrom strong mercury controls, undermining the NSR cases, is not enough. \nWe now have reports that say the administration is considering new \nguidelines to States to limit their ability to require that new coal-\nfired plants use the best available technology to reduce emissions. \nThat should set off alarm bells in the Northeast.\n  This chart shows where new proposed plants are. The power industry \nhas plans to build nearly 100 new coal-fired powerplants in the United \nStates over the next 10 years, but the administration is trying to make \ndarn sure they do not have to put in the kind of technology necessary \nto cut pollutants. These plants, located mostly in the Midwest and \nGreat Lakes, will add thousands of pounds of new pollutants to our \nNation's air.\n  Over the last several decades, we have learned what comes out of the \nplants ends up in the lakes, rivers, and streams, as well as the food \nsupplies of the children in the Northeast.\n  If coal really is making a come back, as people predict, we should \nensure it is not at the expense of our health and environment. On every \nfront, the Bush administration is selling American technology and \nAmerican ingenuity short. The administrations is setting the bar way \ntoo low, and they have set the clock for far too long. The technology \nexists to go much further. The administration needs to start putting \nthe public interest ahead of special interests and tell the industry to \nuse it. Just think of that, putting the public interest ahead of \nspecial interest. What a novel idea. If we did that, the American \npeople would much better served.\n  I hope the administration will withdraw its industry-ghostwritten, \nscientifically unjustifiable mercury rule, withdraw its NSR policy and \ndrop plans to allow new powerplants to be built without the best \nenvironmental controls. I worry that the industry stalwarts within the \nadministration will continue with their schemes to let corporate \npolluters off the hook.\n  Remember, this is the same White House that tried to put more arsenic \nin our drinking water. The American people know their real slogan is, \n``Go ahead and pollute, we don't give a hoot.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I do not know how anybody can walk on the \nSenate floor and say Republicans--any Republicans or Democrats--are not \nfor the environment.\n  Now, I have to say we from the West understand the importance of \nbalancing the environment with jobs and families and opportunities. I \nthink we do a pretty good job. We have to continue to be vigilant about \nthe environment. But I think to try to make the case that this \nadministration is anti-environment is not only a stretch, it is false.\n  This administration is pro-environment, but it is also pro-jobs, pro-\nfamily, pro-geographical areas, pro-West, and pro-proper utilization of \nFederal lands--almost all of which the environmental extremists decry.\n  To accuse the administration of putting arsenic in the water or being \npart of something that puts arsenic in the water is, I think, beyond \nthe pale. The fact is, in many municipalities and towns the small bits \nof arsenic in the water are not dangerous, according to the EPA and \nothers, but the costs of trying to change their water systems are so \nexorbitant they could not exist as towns.\n  Nobody wants any dilatory substance in our water. In fact, for years \nthis\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\ntown has been run by people from both parties, and, of course, we know \nthe water in this town has all kinds of problems. Yet this is the \ngreatest city in the world. So I think it is basically a stretch and an \nexaggeration and, of course, a seizure of political opportunity to \ncriticize this administration environmentally in the way some of my \ncolleagues have chosen to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4247-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2290, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the bill (S. 2290) to create a fair \n     and efficient system to resolve claims of victims for bodily \n     injury caused by asbestos exposure, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes for debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee or their designees.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my colleagues and I have been talking all \nweek about the long overdue reforms that the Hatch-Frist-Miller bill \nwill deliver.\n  I think it is clear to anybody that asbestos litigation has been \nspinning out of control with no end in sight for far too long. The \nshortcomings of the current system are crippling businesses, and, at \nthe same time, depriving asbestos victims of prompt and adequate \ncompensation for their injuries.\n  One of the most outrageous aspects of the current asbestos litigation \nsystem is that it allows--indeed, encourages--some lawyers of \nquestionable ethics to find and bring claims that may be of \nquestionable merit. In some egregious and hopefully rare instances, an \nentire plan of action has apparently evolved to track down potential \nclaimants based more upon whether they can be properly coached to \npresent a colorable claim than whether their claim has actual merit.\n  For example, I am told that several years ago, a first-year associate \nattorney at the law firm of Baron & Budd apparently inadvertently \ndisclosed to defense counsel a memorandum that provides a sad but \nstartling insight into how asbestos claims are created and spun into \nrecoveries.\n  The memorandum, titled ``Preparing for Your Deposition,'' offers \nclients detailed instructions. They are shown how to sound credible \nwhen giving testimony that they worked with particular asbestos \nproducts. The memorandum seems to make every effort to instruct clients \nto assert particular points that will act to increase the value of \ntheir claim, without regard to whether those assertions are actually \ntrue. The memorandum even goes so far as to inform clients that a \ndefense attorney will have no way of knowing whether they are lying \nabout their exposure to particular asbestos products.\n  One excerpt from the memorandum appears to help claimants identify \ndefendant companies and prepares them for a cross-examination that \ncould reveal how flimsy their claim might be. It reads as follows. This \nis from the Baron & Budd memo ``Preparing for Your Deposition'':\n\n       You may be asked how you are able to recall so many product \n     names. The best answer is to say that you recall seeing the \n     names on the containers or on the product itself. The more \n     you thought about it, the more you remembered! If the defense \n     attorney asks you if you were shown pictures of products, \n     wait for your attorney to advise you to answer, then say a \n     girl from Baron & Budd showed you pictures of MANY \n     products, and you picked out the ones you remembered.\n\n  Well, as you can see, that is pretty serious. Another excerpt from \nthe memorandum steers claimants away from admissions that would \nundermine their claims. On this point, the memorandum equips witnesses \nwith the following admonition. Again, from the Baron & Budd memo--one \nof the leading firms in these asbestos plaintiffs cases, to which more \nthan $20 billion in fees--that is with a ``B''--have been given. Here \nis this counseling or coaching. Here is what this law firm memorandum \nsaid:\n\n       You will be asked if you ever saw any WARNING labels on \n     containers of asbestos. It is important to maintain that you \n     NEVER saw any labels on asbestos products that said WARNING \n     or DANGER.\n\n  Finally, apparently to drive home the point that cross-examination \nmay be of little value in certain circumstances, the memorandum advises \nclaimants as follows--again, the same law firm:\n\n       Keep in mind that these [defense] attorneys are very young \n     and WERE NOT PRESENT at the jobsites you worked at. They have \n     NO RECORDS to tell them what products were used on a \n     particular job, even if they act like they do.\n\n  Law Professor Lester Brickman has studied the asbestos litigation \nprocess extensively and has written detailed analyses of that process. \nProfessor Brickman reviewed the law firm's memorandum and said:\n\n       In my opinion . . . this is subornation of perjury. Now, \n     after the memorandum was discovered, the Dallas Observer \n     conducted an investigation of the Baron law firm's asbestos \n     practices. That investigation appeared to uncover an \n     extensive process geared toward manipulating the asbestos \n     litigation system.\n\n  As the Dallas Observer wrote:\n\n       Two former paralegals . . . both say that a client-coaching \n     system was in place at the firm. Workers were routinely \n     encouraged to remember seeing asbestos products on their jobs \n     that they didn't truly recall.\n\n  Still another aspect of the Dallas Observer investigation into the \nBaron firm's handling of asbestos cases revealed a process that put a \npremium on schooling claimants by planting the right bits of \ninformation in their heads.\n  As the Dallas Observer reported:\n\n       A paralegal says that in many cases, the client had no \n     specific recollection of some products before she interviewed \n     them. ``My original caseload was a thousand, but I didn't \n     interview that many people. It was in the hundreds. I'd say \n     that probably in 75 percent of those cases I had people \n     identify at least one product they couldn't recall \n     originally.''\n\n  Now, manipulation of claimant memories and stories appear to have \ngone beyond implanting valuable facts to improve their claims. The \nDallas Observer found that the Baron law firm also conveniently helped \nclaimants eliminate facts from their stories where that would suit \ntheir purpose. The Observer reported the following:\n\n       According to the paralegals, their job didn't stop with \n     implanting memories; there were also the asbestos products \n     they had to encourage clients not to recall. Two lawyers told \n     her to discourage identification of Johns-Manville products \n     because the Manville Trust was not paying claims rendered \n     against it at the time. ... Thus, when a client would say he \n     saw, for instance, a Johns-Manville pipe covering, the \n     paralegal says, she would hand them a line. ``You'd say, `You \n     know, we've talked to some other people, other witnesses, and \n     they recall working with Owens-Corning Kaylo. Don't you think \n     you saw that?' And they'd say, `Yeah, maybe you're right.' ''\n\n  Finally, another document obtained by the Observer consisted of \nhandwritten notes apparently taken by a Baron & Budd attorney during an \ninternal training session. I will just say these are the things that \nare wrong with asbestos litigation. Is this counseling or coaching? The \nmemorandum states: ``Warn plaintiffs not to say you were around it--\neven if you were--after you knew it was dangerous.''\n  These practices, if they indeed took place--and I hope they did not \ntake place in the way the Dallas Observer described them in its \ninvestigative report--distort a system that is already struggling to \nprovide fairness. If lawyers for purported asbestos victims coach \nclients to lie in this manner, they may win some big fees for \nthemselves along with some unjustified awards for clients who aren't \nactually sick, such practices have a sinister effect: They deprive \nseriously injured asbestos victims of the swift and fair recoveries \nthat they deserve for their injuries and they cheat the payer firm out \nof money, they cheat employees of these firms out of their jobs, and \nthey cheat investors and individual retirees of these firms out of \ntheir investments.\n  The time to act is now. I urge my colleagues to vote to invoke \ncloture against the minority's obstructive tactics. We owe it to these \nvictims to put a halt to these abusive practices that\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\nenrich the few at the expense of many and enrich those who are not sick \nat the expense of those who are. We owe it to hardworking Americans who \nstand to lose their jobs and pensions because of this asbestos mess. \nAnd we owe it to everyday Americans to provide them a civil justice \nsystems that works.\n  Ray Klappert lives in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and is actively supporting \npassage of legislation establishing an asbestos trust fund. His support \nis not surprising given the serious asbestos health problems he may be \nfacing in the future. Here is Ray's story:\n  Ray's father, Fred Klappert, was a Korean War veteran and self-\nemployed in the construction business. In 1973, Fred contracted to work \non the renovation of the interior of a commercial building in Miami \nBeach. During the renovation, which lasted several months and involved \na partial demolition of the old building, Fred was exposed to asbestos.\n  Twenty-five years later, Fred Klappert developed a severe cough and \ndoctors eventually diagnosed him with asbestosis. Fred has since passed \naway. Unfortunately, the Klapperts had nowhere to turn for help and no \nsource from which to be compensated for their loss.\n  Ray has since learned about the dangers of asbestos and has grown \nquite concerned for his own health. Ray worked with his father on that \nsame building in 1973. Ray fears he may also acquire an asbestos-\nrelated disease and, like his father, have nowhere to turn for help.\n  An asbestos trust fund ensures a potential asbestos victim like Ray \nKlappert that there will still be adequate compensation in the future--\nthat will not be the case if asbestos litigation remains our method in \nthe tort system. If a trust is established, Ray will not have to worry \nwhether the defendant companies come insolvent, and thus the prospect \nof collecting pennies on the dollar from some bankruptcy trust. He also \nknows that the legislation will ensure that if he needs it, he will \nhave access to medical monitoring as soon as the bill is enacted. This \nkind of security is essential for the peace of mind of all future \nasbestos victims.\n  What is wrong with asbestos litigation? It is running out of control \nand ruining our legal system. Compensation for victims such as Fred and \nRay Klappert, under the current system, nothing. Under the FAIR Act, \nthey get compensated.\n   Passage of S. 2290 will give Ray confidence that help is available \nshould he need it in the future. If the legislation fails, Ray \nKlappert, like his father, will become just another victim of a tort \nsystem that has failed and will continue to fail thousands of Americans \nwho have been exposed to asbestos.\n   As the asbestos litigation crisis continues unabated, nearly all of \nthe major asbestos manufacturers are bankrupt. Consequently, more and \nmore small businesses are forced to defend these costly lawsuits--some \nof which are without merit. A compelling illustration of this epidemic \nis the case of Monroe Rubber and Gasket, a small Monroe, Louisiana \nbusiness with only 15 remaining employees--a number down 33 percent \nsince asbestos litigation began against the company just 4 years ago.\n   Prior to 1986, Monroe Rubber and Gasket used a compressed asbestos \nsheet in manufacturing its gaskets. Mike Carter, one of its owners, \ncalled for a thorough examination of the company's gasket manufacturing \nprocess in order to determine whether any asbestos was actually \nreleased into the air when this sheet was cut. The results were \nnegative. Additionally, not a single Monroe Rubber and Gasket employee, \nincluding Mr. Carter, who has worked around his company's products for \ndecades, has acquired an asbestos-related disease.\n   In 2000, despite its decision to end the practice of using any \nproducts containing asbestos in its gasket manufacturing process nearly \nfourteen years earlier, Monroe Rubber and Gasket began to be named in \nlawsuits on behalf of individuals who worked at chemical plants and \npaper mills that used the company's gaskets in their own machinery. \nThere are approximately 75 lawsuits currently pending against the \ncompany. In some cases, Monroe Rubber and Gasket is the only defendant. \nIn others, Monroe Rubber and Gasket is simply one of dozens. I must \npoint out that not one such lawsuit against Monroe Rubber and Gasket \ninvolves a current or former employee of the company. Needless to say, \nthat reeks of irony.\n   Fighting these kinds of lawsuits is cost-prohibitive, especially for \na small business that is at best a peripheral defendant. According to \nMr. Carter, asbestos litigation costs his company more than $250,000 a \nyear, and, if you can believe it, not one such claim against Monroe \nRubber and Gasket has actually gone to trial. In addition to not \nincluding a case that has reached final disposition, this cost also \nfails to include the loss of productivity resulting from the thousands \nof hours spent on the litigation by Mr. Carter himself.\n  What is wrong with asbestos litigation? Take the case of Monroe \nRubber and Gasket: The cost of litigation so far, $250,000 a year; the \nlawsuits filed against the company, 75; the workforce loss, 33 percent; \nthe number of company employees who are sick throughout eternity has \nbeen zero; the number of company employees who have sued, zero. Yet \nthis company is being torn apart by litigation that it should not have \nto face.\n  The impact of these considerable losses is felt not only by Mr. \nCarter and his fellow small business owners, but also by the employees. \nMoreover, Monroe Rubber and Gasket has been forced to cancel plans to \nopen a new facility in Arkansas. The money that was going to be used to \nunderwrite the expansion has gone instead to the lawyers. Some of them \nwere not so voracious. They are defense lawyers who had to be retained \nunder these circumstances.\n  For Mike Carter and the employees at Monroe Rubber and Gasket, the \nissue is simple--unless we choose to act, they will be out of work. At \nthe moment, most of the costs of the litigation are covered by \ninsurance, but it is uncertain how long that will last. In fact, the \nemployees don't know who will go bankrupt first--the company or its \ninsurance carrier. What they do know, however, is that if we fail to \nact, they will soon join thousands and thousands of other American \nworkers who are out of work or who lost their pensions or their health \nplans because of the nightmare of asbestos litigation. This is not a \nfair and just result, and Congress should act to rectify the situation.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed my friends across the \naisle are insisting on proceeding to this partisan asbestos bill. I say \nthat because the legislation is not ready for prime time. It is not \nready for floor consideration. I am one who believes the Senate should \npass legislation to establish a national trust fund to compensate \nasbestos victims. Actually, I chaired the first Judiciary Committee \nhearing on this subject back in September of 2002.\n  This bill would create a trust fund with unfair compensation, \ninadequate funding, no startup protections, delayed sunset provisions, \nand major solvency problems. Despite its title, this partisan bill is \nfar from fair.\n  It is a mistake for the Republican leadership to insist on proceeding \nto a bill with so many major problems still unresolved. Again, this \nbill is not ready for floor consideration.\n  We did have a bipartisan dialog over the past year, and I hoped that \nwould yield a fair and efficient compensation system we could in good \nconscience offer to those suffering today from asbestos-related \ndiseases and also to those victims who we know are going to come in the \nfuture.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate majority leadership decided to walk away \nfrom those negotiations and resort to unilateralism by introducing a \npartisan bill, and that is a shame. I believe so many of my friends on \nthe Republican side would like to have a good bill, but to have a good \nbill of this complexity requires real work and we have to work as \nlegislators and we have to have substance, not symbolism. We have to \nhave reality, not rhetoric.\n  The introduction of this bill raises many questions--most notably \nwhat\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\nthe sponsors are trying to achieve because it is certainly not a fair \ncompensation model for asbestos victims. By breaking off the bipartisan \nnegotiations and hastily pushing a bill to the floor, the Republicans \nhave turned their back on all of us who have worked so hard for so long \nto find a fair solution.\n  Creating a fair national trust fund to compensate asbestos victims is \none of the most complex legislative undertakings I have been involved \nwith in nearly 29 years in the Senate. The interrelated aspects \nnecessary for a fair national trust fund are like a Rubik's Cube, and \nthat is all the more reason why we should have a fair national trust \nfund bill and have it be a consensus piece of legislation. Otherwise it \ndoes not work, it does not become law.\n  That is why I have been involved in months of bipartisan \nnegotiations. I worked so hard to encourage the interested stakeholders \nto reach agreement on all these critical details.\n  I thank Senators Daschle, Dodd, Feinstein, Specter, and other \nSenators, the representatives from organized labor, the trial bar, and \nindustry who worked so hard to try to reach consensus on a national \ntrust fund that would fairly compensate asbestos victims and also to \nprovide the financial certainty for their defendants and their \ninsurers.\n  We did reach bipartisan agreement on two of the four cornerstones of \na successful trust fund. Senator Hatch and I brought together the \nLeahy-Hatch amendment that gave appropriate medical criteria to \ndetermine who should receive compensation and an efficient, expedited \nsystem for processing claims. But we have yet to reach consensus on the \nother two cornerstones of a successful trust fund--fair award values \nfor asbestos victims and adequate funding to pay for the compensation. \nEven if we have the medical criteria and if we lowball the amounts, if \nwe do not adequately handle it, it makes no difference.\n\n  Bipartisan medical criteria have already eliminated what businesses \ncontend were the most troublesome claims, but that kind of fair \ncompensation is not free.\n  The Judiciary Committee's unanimous agreement on the Leahy-Hatch \nmedical criteria is meaningless if the majority, in effect, rewrites \nthe categories by failing to compensate those who fall within them. \nEven with consensus on medical criteria, if the award value is unfair, \nthen the bill is unfair and it is unworthy of our support. That is the \ncase with this partisan bill.\n  Since my first hearing on this issue nearly 2 years ago, I have \nemphasized one bedrock principle: It has to be a balanced solution. I \ncannot support a bill that gives inadequate compensation to victims. I \nwill not adjust fair award values into some discounted amount to make \nthe final tally come within a predetermined and artificial limit. That \nis not fair.\n  It is critical that there is adequate funding at the inception of a \nnational trust fund since there are more than 300,000 current pending \ncases in our legal system. Upfront contributions from defendants and \ninsurers will be necessary to accommodate the inevitable, and that is \nthousands of these pending claims coming in on the very first day of \nthe trust fund.\n  The new Hatch-Frist bill actually provides less upfront funding and \nless overall funding than we voted out of the Judiciary Committee. That \nis not fair. The partisan emphasis in this bill on behalf of the \nindustrial and insurance companies involved, to the detriment of \nvictims, has produced an unbalanced bill. This bill is a reflection of \nthe priorities that went into it.\n  Many of us have worked hard for more than a year toward the goal of a \nconsensus asbestos bill. So this new partisan bill is especially \nsaddening and confounding. We could have a bill that protects \ndefendants; it would protect the insurance companies; it would protect \nthe corporations; and it would protect the people who have been \nsickened by asbestos. We could have done that. We could have brought \nfinality to this issue. We could have ended endless litigation. We \ncould have let corporations go on with their business. We could have \nmade sure the victims knew they were going to get adequate \ncompensation. We have missed a golden opportunity.\n  After the cloture vote on this partisan asbestos bill, the Senate \nwill take up and pass the Kyl-Feinstein-Hatch-Leahy crime victims' \nrights legislation. This bipartisan legislation is a good example of \nwhat the Senate can do when we work together to reach consensus. \nUnfortunately, the bipartisan process of the crime victims' rights \nlegislation is being abandoned by the majority on this partisan \nasbestos bill.\n  We should be asking ourselves this question: Does this partisan turn \nthe sponsors of this bill have taken help or hurt our efforts to \nproduce and enact a consensus asbestos bill? I say it does not help.\n  We have enough of a debate going on behind me, so I will yield to \nsomeone in a different part of the Chamber, Senator Kennedy, so he can \nmake himself heard for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I am curious as to \nhow long the Senator will be speaking.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the real crisis which confronts us is not \nan asbestos litigation crisis, it is an asbestos-induced disease \ncrisis. Asbestos is the most lethal substance ever widely used in the \nworkplace. Between 1940 and 1980, there were 27\\1/2\\ million workers in \nthis country who were exposed to asbestos on the job and nearly 19 \nmillion of them had high levels of exposure over long periods of time, \nand that exposure changed many of their lives.\n  Each year more than 10,000 of them die from lung cancer and other \ndiseases caused by asbestos. Each year, hundreds of thousands of them \nsuffer from lung conditions which make breathing so difficult they \ncannot engage in the routine activities of daily life. Even more have \nbecome unemployable due to their medical condition.\n  Because of the long latency period of these diseases, all of them \nlive with a fear of a premature death due to asbestos-induced disease. \nThese are the real victims. They deserve to be the first and foremost \nfocus of our concern. The victims are average, hard-working Americans. \nThey are the construction workers who build our houses, machinists who \nkeep our factories running, assembly workers who make products for our \nhome, shipbuilders who help make our country strong and secure. They \ndid their jobs faithfully and now it is time for us to do right by \nthem.\n  All too often, the resulting tragedy these seriously ill workers and \ntheir families are enduring becomes lost in a complex debate about the \neconomic impact of asbestos litigation. We cannot allow that to happen. \nThe litigation did not create these costs. Exposure to asbestos created \nthem. They are the costs of medical care, the lost wages of \nincapacitated workers, the cost of providing for the families of \nworkers who died years before their time. Those costs are real. No \nlegislative proposal can make them disappear. All legislation can do is \nshift those costs from one party to another.\n  Any proposal which would have the effect of shifting more of the \nfinancial burden on to the backs of injured workers is unacceptable to \nme, and I would hope that it would be unacceptable to every one of us. \nUnfortunately, that is precisely what the Frist bill would do.\n  The bill before us does not reflect what is necessary to compensate \nthe enormous numbers of workers who suffer from asbestos-induced \ndisease. It reflects only what the companies who made them sick are \nwilling to pay.\n  The compensation levels in the Frist bill are unreasonably low, \nespecially for the most seriously ill worker. They would receive much \nless compensation under the bill than they are currently getting on \naverage in the tort system. For example, workers with 15 years of \nexposure to asbestos, who are dying of lung cancer, would get as little \nas $25,000 under the Frist bill. That is absurd.\n  While most of these workers smoke, a person who smoked and was \nexposed to asbestos is over four times more likely to get lung cancer \nthan a person who smoked but was not exposed to asbestos. Asbestos was \nclearly a major contributing factor to their lung cancers. Yet this \nbill would give them next to nothing. Not only does this bill not \nprovide adequate levels of compensation, there is no guarantee that \nsufficient funds will be available to fully\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\npay all injured workers who are eligible, even what the bill promises \nthem.\n  According to a CBO analysis, the Frist bill is underfunded by nearly \n$30 billion. If the asbestos trust fund does become insolvent, workers \nwill have to wait years before they can return to the tort system, and \nmany of them will be dead by then.\n  Any proposal which would merely create one new, large, unfunded trust \nin place of the many smaller underfunded bankruptcy trusts which exist \ntoday is unacceptable. Injured workers need certainty even more than \nbusinesses and insurers. The Frist bill merely shifts more of the \nfinancial burden of asbestos-induced disease to the injured workers by \nunfairly and arbitrarily limiting the liability of defendants.\n  Sick workers would receive lower levels of compensation than they \nreceive on average in the current system, and payment of even those \nlower levels of compensation would not be guaranteed. That is no \nsolution at all.\n  I hope we would not consider this bill before us but go back to the \ndrawing board and get a bill that will meet the needs of all the \nparties.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I rise today to say I most regretfully oppose the motion \nto invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the bill. I do not think \nwe are quite ready. I do not think we are ready to tackle this \nimportant and complex legislation at this time.\n  This is a bill that would end for decades the rights of individual \ncitizens to seek justice and compensation for their injuries in a court \nof law. That is not something we should act on too quickly; that is, \nbefore we have a complete understanding of what it is that we are doing \nand how it will impact asbestos victims, businesses, insurers over the \nlong run.\n  Senators Hatch, Leahy, and Specter, though, and many others, have \nworked very hard on this bill. Because of their efforts, we have come \ncloser to a final compromise than I think anyone would have believed \npossible early last year. That is why I am puzzled, frankly, that we \nfeel the need to rush to the floor to finish this bill before we have \nexhausted all opportunities to come to a compromise on the outstanding \nand very tough issues. Negotiations have yielded significant progress \nin certain areas. I believe there is no reason to believe that \ncontinued negotiations will not yield even more progress.\n  Being in the Senate, I have learned if one sticks to it and with it, \none can find ways to work out solutions to very difficult problems.\n  My primary concern, though, has always been protecting the people of \nLibby, MT, in any asbestos legislation that Congress considers. I know \nI do not need to go into the details of the Libby tragedy because my \ncolleagues have heard them many times, but I will emphasize that their \nsituation for me, and for them especially, is unique. An entire town \nwas poisoned with asbestos for decades by W.R. Grace, a company that \nlied to its workers, lied to the community about the deadly dust which \nit was exposing its workers to, lied to the families, and lied to the \nwhole community. Hundreds of people have already died or become very \nsick, and hundreds more will likely follow.\n  I have pledged to the people of Libby that I will do everything in my \npower to help them make their community whole again, to make sure their \nlong-term health care needs are met. The health care costs associated \nwith treating asbestos-related diseases are crippling to families who \ndo not have health care and are uninsurable and to a community that is \nstruggling to get its economy back on track. Simple, routine procedures \nto help a person breathe more easily can cost at least $30,000.\n\n  The Libby dust, or fiber, is also unique. The Libby fiber is \nespecially vicious. It is made up of what is called tremolite, a \nspecial kind of asbestos, and other similar fibers, fibers that doctors \nand scientists are now only beginning to realize are more deadly than \nordinary asbestos.\n  Not only is it more likely to cause asbestos-related diseases, it \noften causes disease to progress more rapidly than traditional \nasbestos-related disease. Libby asbestos disease also looks different. \nIt is hard to identify and hard to detect on x rays and CAT scans, much \nharder than traditional asbestos-related disease. That is why I was so \nconcerned about Libby at the beginning of this debate.\n  Because Libby is unique in terms of the type and duration of asbestos \nexposure, the manner in which asbestos disease manifests itself in \nLibby, and the fact that an entire community was affected, it was clear \nthat the medical and exposure criteria in the bill would unfairly \nexclude most of the population of Libby. That would pile injustice on \ntop of injustice on these people, and I could not accept that.\n  Senators Hatch and Leahy worked very closely with me and my staff, \nand I want to thank them for the very important provisions in the bill \nthat would exempt people in Libby from both the exposure and the \nmedical criteria in S. 2290. This was a huge step forward.\n  However, as we moved past these larger issues for the Libby victims, \nnew concerns arose about the level of compensation that would be \nawarded to a Libby claimant. I was concerned that the administrator of \nthe trust had absolute discretion to determine that a panel of medical \nexperts was wrong, and that a Libby claimant was not that sick and was \nnot entitled to the level of compensation they truly deserved.\n  I was also concerned that the compensation levels were tied directly \nto the medical criteria in the bill, medical criteria that we had \nalready determined just would not work for the Libby victims. This \nraised the possibility that the Libby victims would not be fairly \ncompensated.\n  Senator Hatch and I have spoken about this concern and we have tried \nto work out an acceptable way to address it. Again, I thank Senator \nHatch for the concern he has always shown for my constituents and I \nthank him for the effort he has undertaken.\n  However, this important concern has yet to be addressed in S. 2290. I \nhave heard from people in Libby that they would rather we not proceed \nto this bill until we find a way to solve this outstanding uncertainty \nin the bill. I know they also share some of the concerns of my \ncolleagues about other factors of the bill and whether it will indeed \nbe workable and solvent over the long term. This is obviously important \nto me and to the people of Libby.\n  I believe that asbestos legislation is very important. I believe that \nCongress should complete work on an asbestos bill this year. It is \nimportant to the victims, many of whom are not being fairly compensated \nbecause the system is overloaded and so many companies have filed for \nbankruptcy. That is one of the reasons I will continue to work hard to \nprotect Libby in asbestos legislation.\n  The people of Libby face a very uncertain future right now, depending \non what happens with the Grace bankruptcy proceedings. I believe that \nif we get the Libby provisions right in the asbestos bill, they stand a \nfar better chance of receiving fair compensation under an asbestos \ntrust than they would through the Grace bankruptcy.\n  A bill is also immensely important to the business community that is \nseeking some level of certainty about what their future asbestos \nliabilities will be. Providing them with that business certainty, while \nat the same time providing the victims with equal certainty that they \nwill be fairly and promptly compensated for their asbestos exposure and \ndisease, should be our goal.\n  We are very close to achieving that goal, thanks to the efforts of \nmany different players in this debate. Let's go back to the negotiating \ntable and see how far we can get before we take this very complex bill \nto the floor for amendment and debate, a process that will not allow us \nto be as considerate and thoughtful as we should be with this issue.\n  For the sake of the people of Libby, and ensuring that they receive \nthe highest degree of justice and certainty that they deserve, I must \noppose the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. \n2290. I pledge to continue to work together with my colleagues to find \nan acceptable compromise as soon as possible. I also state, if we can \nwork out this Libby language, then I will be for the bill. I very much \nhope that happens.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President and my colleagues, in a few minutes we will \nvote on whether to proceed to debating and amending this legislation on \nasbestos. It is an important issue and an important vote.\n  Before I say anything else, I wish to express my thanks to Senator \nHatch and Senator Leahy and others on the Judiciary Committee who have \nworked on this issue for years. I express our thanks for trying to help \nus narrow our differences. I think they have been narrowed.\n  I spent a good part of the 2 years myself learning about this issue \nand coming up to speed on it so I might be able to participate in a \nconstructive way. I have certainly learned a lot and hopefully made at \nleast a modest contribution.\n  As we have tried to develop consensus on this issue, I think there \nare about four basic principles that we can agree on and ought to agree \non.\n  One is that when people are sick and dying from exposure to asbestos, \nthey ought to get the money they and their families need and they \nshould get it now.\n  When people become sick later on from an earlier exposure, they \nshould receive reasonable compensation and it should come promptly.\n  People who are not sick, who may have had an exposure to asbestos and \nmay not become sick, they should have medical monitoring at no cost but \nthey should not be siphoning off the moneys from folks who truly are \nsick and are in desperate straits.\n  Finally, the last principle is we ought to reduce the transaction \ncosts, essentially the legal costs, that are involved in this whole \nprocess.\n  Those are four basic principles. My guess is if we could vote on \nthose principles, we would all vote for them. We are not ready to vote \nyet on bringing this bill to the floor. I say that with some \nreluctance.\n  I have these four core values. The Presiding Officer and I talked \nabout core values before. One of my core values is just never give up. \nI have another way of saying that. I say sometimes: ``No'' means ``find \nanother way.'' The ``no'' vote I am going to cast--in the ``no'' votes \nthat are going to be cast, I want to be clear what ``no'' means.\n  First, I will say what it doesn't mean. ``No'' doesn't mean let's \ngive up. ``No'' doesn't mean this bill is dead in this session. So it \ndoesn't mean that asbestos legislation is dead for all time.\n  This is what ``no'' means. ``No'' means let's build on the work that \nhas been done, the good work that has been done within the Judiciary \nCommittee. ``No'' means let's build on the good work that has been done \nin the so-called Specter-Becker process, involving retired Federal \nJudge Becker. Let's build on that.\n  There are a number of important issues that still have to be \nresolved. This is not a bill to write on the floor. I think among the \nissues we agree on is that this is complex stuff. I know it is for me \nand for a lot of our colleagues. This is not a bill to be written on \nthe floor, and there is still too much that needs to be written for us \nto take the bill up today. There is a process taking place \nthat yesterday, my leader, Senator Daschle, and the Republican leader, \nSenator Frist, have bought into. I have urged them both for some time \nto build on the Specter-Becker process, which has focused mostly on \nadministrative issues and with some real success, but to build on that \nprocess, given the kind of role Judge Becker has come to play as a \nmediator, one trusted by labor, by the trial bar, by the insurers, by \nthe manufacturers, and by many of the defendants in these legal cases.\n\n  This is not something we ought to start doing next month or maybe in \nJune or July. This is work that needs to continue today, tomorrow, next \nweek, and in the weeks that follow.\n  There is an old saying that work fills up the time that we allocate \nto do a particular job. If we say we will take a year to do something, \nwe will take a year to do it. In this instance, we need to keep our \nfocus and our energy concentrated on resolving most of the outstanding \nissues. I don't think the Specter-Becker process will resolve all of \nthe outstanding issues, but I think it will get us a lot closer to \nresolution to enable us, on the floor, to then finally debate, amend \nthe bill, and send something good, something solid to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Let me close by saying there is too much at stake.\n  By the way, Judge Becker said he has cleared his schedule starting \nnext week, next Monday. He was here several days this week. He \naddressed our caucus yesterday. He met with leaders on both sides and \ntalked to any number of our colleagues. He met with manufacturers, \ninsurers here, organized labor, the trial bar, just this week in this \nbuilding. We need to not let one bit of our momentum on this issue go \naway with a ``no'' vote today. What we have to do is build on that \nmomentum.\n  Let me close by saying there is too much at stake for us not to do \njust that. There are too many people who are sick. They are counting on \nus doing something about it and helping them now. Too many companies \nhave gone bankrupt. Some 70 companies have gone bankrupt. I understand \nsome 70,000 people have lost their jobs.\n  That doesn't even begin to say how much people who were working for \nthose companies that have gone bankrupt have lost in their 402(k) \nplans. They have lost it all. How about the common stockholders? They \nhave lost everything because the company went bankrupt. There is a \ngreat need there.\n  Finally, the other thing at stake is the loss of manufacturing jobs. \nWe have seen an erosion of over 2 million jobs in this country over the \nlast 3 years. That is a lot of manufacturing jobs. One of the reasons \nis because of the legal problems we have in this country. We have lost \nour sense of balance. We can do better, and we need to.\n  What does ``no'' mean? No means get to work and let us resolve these \nissues. Before we break for Memorial Day, I hope we can bring this bill \nto the floor and vote yes. Let us get it done.\n   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am voting against cloture on S. 2290 \nbecause I do not believe that it is fair to asbestos victims or meets \ntheir needs for compensation adequately.\n   Asbestos kills 10,000 Americans every year. For more than 50 years, \nmanufacturing companies, asbestos producers, and insurance companies \nignored evidence of the threat of asbestos to their employees and their \nfamilies, as well as the public. They failed to warn their workers and \nmust be held responsible for thousands of deaths and thousands made \nill.\n   Asbestos victims are people not statistics. Bill and Geneva Hornsby \nfrom Fontana, CA are not a statistic. Geneva was diagnosed with lung \ncancer in 1998. It was caused by asbestos that her husband brought home \nfrom work on his clothes. Then, in March 2003, her husband Bill was \ndiagnosed with malignant mesothelioma. Again, it was cause by exposure \nto asbestos at work. Three weeks after the diagnosis, Bill died.\n   Angela Ruhl from Long Beach, CA, is not a statistic. She was exposed \nto asbestos through the work clothes of her uncle who worked in the \nNavy. Now she has peritoneal mesothelioma. She has undergone three \nsurgeries and two rounds of chemotherapy. She deserves justice.\n   Sam Silvestro from San Mateo, CA, is not a statistic. He was exposed \nto asbestos for decades, diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma \nin June 2001, and died in November of that year. His wife Doris still \nlives in San Mateo.\n   The issue is not whether we do something or nothing. Most Democrats, \nif not all, could support an asbestos resolution fund that was fair to \nvictims. But this proposal is not fair.\n   First, the funding proposed in this legislation is inadequate. The \nFAIR Act provides $29 billion less in funding than the bill that was \napproved by the Judiciary Committee.\n   Also, the FAIR Act would delay for years compensating victims with \nterminal cancer, mesothelioma, and other asbestos diseases. That is \nbecause while asbestos companies would be required to pay $2.5 billion \nannually into the fund, the fund will immediately be hit with 450,000 \nclaims representing a cost to the fund of $54 billion in its initial \nyears. That means victims with claims today will have to wait until the \nfund acquires enough contributions to compensate them.\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\n   This legislation also creates a windfall for large corporations. \nMany companies that failed their workers and owe asbestos victims under \nsettlement agreements would have those agreements suspended and the \nsettlements voided under this bill. Halliburton, for example, would pay \nonly a small fraction of the billions of dollars it has already agreed \nto pay asbestos victims.\n   And, most important, the compensation for victims proposed in this \nlegislation is inadequate. Even the sickest victims--those with \nmesothelioma and other fatal cancers--would receive less compensation \nunder this bill than under the current system. And the tens of \nthousands of people with non-fatal diseases caused by asbestos, such as \npermanent repressive lung damage, would receive wholly inadequate \nassistance.\n   For these and other reasons, we need to go back to the table and \nnegotiate a bill that would really be fair to victims.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to S. 2290, the \nFairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2004, or the FAIR Act. \nLast July, I voted to pass S. 1125, the original asbestos litigation \nreform bill, out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in an effort to fix \nthe Nation's broken asbestos litigation system. And indeed it is \nbroken.\n  There have been too many losers under the current tort system. \nClaimants who are not sick receive disproportionate jury awards, \nseverely sick claimants have been made to wait too long for \ncompensation, companies are going bankrupt, jobs are being lost, and \nattorneys' fees are cutting away at nearly half of all money spent on \nasbestos-related litigation.\n  More than 60 defendant corporations have declared bankruptcy due to \nasbestos-related litigation, leading to the direct loss of as many as \n60,000 jobs, with each displaced worker losing an average of $25,000 to \n$50,000 in wages.\n  Indeed, the system is broken.\n  The constituents from my home State of Idaho have written to me \nasking me to fix the asbestos problem. The United States Supreme Court \nhas called upon Congress to resolve the asbestos litigation crisis. And \ntoday, Senators Hatch, Frist, and others are calling upon the Senate to \npass S. 2290 with the same purpose in mind.\n  I commend these Senators for their work on this issue, especially \nSenator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who, through \nstudy, compromise, and countless hours of negotiations, produced a 250-\npage bill to resolve the asbestos litigation crisis. The actions of the \nSenator from Utah, from the beginning, truly have been those of a \nstatesman.\n  However, these good-faith efforts have not been matched by those on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  In the original asbestos litigation reform bill, the trust fund was \nto be administered by the Court of Federal Claims, a special court \nrelatively removed from the political realm. However, Democrats and \nlabor unions wanted the fund to be administered by the Department of \nLabor, which has the potential to keep Congress and the American \ntaxpayer on the political hook of paying for claims that cannot be paid \nby the asbestos trust fund. They wanted it, and we gave it to them.\n  In the original asbestos bill, those on the other side of the aisle \nwanted to increase the price tag of the bill by raising the levels of \ncompensation for asbestos claims. They wanted it, and before passing \nthe bill out of committee, we gave it to them. During negotiations over \nS. 2290, they wanted new levels of payouts even higher than those \nagreed to in committee. Accordingly, half of the award levels have been \nincreased by an average of more than 20 percent in S. 2290. They wanted \nit, and we gave it to them.\n  In the ``Additional Views'' to the committee report on S. 1125, I and \nseveral fellow Republican colleagues voiced concern over the bill's \nunscientific medical criteria. In fact, in addition to several \nfinancial experts' testimony about the unpredictability of future \nclaims into the fund, Dr. James Crapo, a hearing witness and medical \nexpert who specializes in asbestos-related disease, wrote that:\n\n     the other categories compensated by the bill . . . pay \n     compensation for illnesses that, according to the clear \n     weight of medical evidence, either are not caused by asbestos \n     or do not result in a significant impairment. Simply put, \n     when medical research concludes that a condition is not \n     caused by asbestos, or is not an illness at all, medical \n     research will not be able to predict the number of such \n     claims.\n\n  Despite these deep reservations, and in response to Democrats' \ndemands, we agreed to criteria that ``erred on the side of being over-\ninclusive'' with regards to asbestos-related diseases. Many financial \nand medical experts suggested that as a result of doing so, the fund is \nlikely to run the risk of insolvency as a result of paying claims for \nillnesses not caused by asbestos. They wanted it, and we gave it to \nthem.\n  They wanted it, and we gave it to them. Yet, they still withhold \ntheir support from S. 2290. As a result, not only has the integrity of \nthe bipartisan negotiations been compromised, but the integrity of the \nasbestos litigation reform bill itself.\n  Though no asbestos bill will be perfect, any reform measure in \npassable form will provide the certainty needed by all involved \nparties: businesses will know the amount of their liability and will be \nable to adjust accordingly in order to prevent bankruptcy, and, most \nimportantly, injured workers will be adequately compensated by the \ncompanies that caused them injury.\n  However, the certainty I held hope in only a few months back has \nlargely been replaced by skepticism--skepticism in the solvency of the \nasbestos trust fund, skepticism in the handling of asbestos claims by \nthe Department of Labor, and skepticism in the integrity of the medical \ncriteria.\n  However, my hope resides in further consideration and debate of the \nbill. The time for fair and efficient resolution of the asbestos \nlitigation crisis is now, and I will vote for the cloture motion before \nthe Senate.\n  I look forward to any amendments that will strengthen the solvency of \nthe bill by making defendant companies--not taxpayers--fiscally \nresponsible for their actions, amendments that will restore integrity \nto the medical criteria section of the bill, and any others that \nrestore S. 2290 to its principled purpose.\n  Whatever a Senator's position on the bill may be, the issue of \nasbestos litigation reform must be considered and debated. Let us not \nsit this one out. This one is too important to sit out.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss S. 2290, the newest \nversion of the asbestos bill. Like many of my colleagues, we want to \nsupport an asbestos bill that ensures that sick people get compensated \nquickly. The current system is broken, leaving terminally ill victims \nto spend years waiting for compensation. Congress must act to solve \nthis problem, but it must do so in a bipartisan fashion. I fear that \nwill not happen this week, even though we want to remain optimistic \nthat there is still a chance for this legislation.\n  That said, over the past year we have made more progress than many of \nus would have thought. But now we are at an impasse. What is most \nfrustrating is that the remaining issues are not irreconcilable. Let's \ndiscuss a few of the major outstanding issues that must be resolved in \norder to broker a compromise.\n  First, more than any other issue, the size of the fund is preventing \nprogress on this bill. We appear unable to negotiate, or have yet to \nnegotiate what this number should be. To be sure, this is a complicated \nissue and it is especially important to get it right if we want to \nadequately compensate asbestos victims for the next 50 years. There is \njust not enough money to cover all the claims that will be made against \nthis fund. As a result, some of us have serious concerns that this bill \nfails to go far enough to compensate asbestos victims suffering serious \ndisease.\n  Though the base funding in the new bill is roughly the same as S. \n1125, $104 billion, the overall funding falls far short because the new \nversion eliminates a contingency amendment I introduced with Senator \nFeinstein last summer in the committee. Our amendment would have \nprovided up to an additional $45 billion over the life of the fund. The \nnew Frist-Hatch version replaces it with a $10 billion contingency a \nsource of funding which could not even be tapped until year 24 of the \nfund.\n  Second, in order to reach a better understanding of how much this \nbill will\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\ncost, we must better come to a final agreement on the individual awards \nthat will be granted victims. Quite simply, this agreement will drive \nthe overall cost of the fund, and not surprisingly, projections vary on \nthis point. Proponents of the new bill predict that there will be $114 \nbillion in total claims. The Congressional Budget Office, however, \nestimates that, based on the new award values present in S. 2290, the \nfund will need $134 billion to pay out all current and future claims. \nAnd labor believes that the number will be even greater if we were to \nraise award values to a more equitable level. Of course, any increase \nin award values will require a increase in the overall fund amount. But \nthese are exactly the sort of tough choices and negotiations that need \nto take place if we are going to find a compromise.\n  Third, those of us opposed to this bill still feel that an unfair \nrisk falls onto the victims if the fund goes bankrupt. Those in favor \nof the bill will argue that if they underestimate how much money the \nfund will need, victims can simply return to the court system. But it \nis not as simple at that. At the earliest, victims cannot return to the \ncourts until year seven and there is a real risk that certain types of \nvictims may be precluded from any further compensation for new injuries \nrelated to asbestos exposure.\n  Furthermore, the new version of the asbestos bill also results in \nunfair treatment of victims with pending claims. There are currently \nmore than 300,000 asbestos victims with pending claims in the court \nsystem, many who have been waiting for years for a court date or \nsettlement. The asbestos bill would eliminate most pending claims and \neven final settlements and throw them into the fund. So some victims \nwho won a large verdict will be forced to start over from scratch in \nthe fund. This hardly seems fair.\n  Finally, it is difficult to support a new bill that is the product of \na flawed and one-sided negotiating process. Much of the new asbestos \nbill we are considering was negotiated by Senators Frist and Hatch with \nbusiness and insurance representatives. This process, lacking any \nparticipation from Democrats or labor, resulted in a bill that is not \neven as good as the version we opposed last July. To be fair, Senator \nSpecter has been working hard in a bipartisan group mediated by retired \nFederal Judge Becker. The group has had some modest success in \nnegotiating ``non-economic'' issues, but has yet to broker any deal on \naward values or overall fund financing. Perhaps a consensus solution is \npossible if we allow that bipartisan process to proceed.\n  Until then, I cannot support this bill in its current form. The new \nasbestos bill actually retreats from the progress made last summer in \nthe Judiciary Committee. Until my major concerns regarding the overall \ndollar amount for the fund--an amount that will adequately satisfy the \nhundreds of thousands of asbestos victims for years to come--is \nresolved, I will vote against S. 2290. To be sure, there are several \nother issues to solve in this bill, but we must reach a consensus on an \noverall dollar amount, lest we regret supporting a fund that runs out \nof money, fails to compensate victims, and provides businesses no more \ncertainty than they have today.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Fairness in \nAsbestos Injury Resolution Act or the FAIR Act.\n  Over the past decade, asbestos-related lawsuits have increased \ndramatically and have shown no sign of lessening. According to reports, \nat least 730,000 claimants have sued more than 8,400 defendant \ncompanies alleging some kind of injury by asbestos exposure. The number \nof defendant companies that have been sued has increased by 8,100 since \n1983 according to the RAND Institute for Civil Justice.\n  There is no doubt that the current asbestos litigation system is a \nfailure. The system is harmful on two fronts: it is harmful to the \neconomy and harmful to the asbestos victims, who currently wait years \nfor their cases to be resolved. Sadly, some of these victims die before \neven having their day in court.\n  I view this measure as a jobs bill. Some would ask: How is this \nlegislation going to help create jobs? I would answer that while we are \nsteadily recovering from an economic downturn exacerbated by the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and our necessary response in \nthe war on terrorism, we need to make sure that willing men and women \ncan find jobs. Employment is improving. However, if the Senate does not \nact on this important reform legislation, the numbers of unemployed \nAmericans will increase.\n  The fact is that asbestos-related bankruptcies inflict a staggering \ntoll on the American workforce. Companies that have declared bankruptcy \nbecause of asbestos-related litigation employed more than 200,000 \nworkers before their bankruptcies. So far, asbestos-related \nbankruptcies have led to the direct loss of as many as 60,000 jobs, \nwhile each displaced worker will lose an average of $25,000 to $50,000 \nin wages over his or her career, according to Joseph Stiglitz, cowinner \nof the 2001 Noble Prize in Economics.\n  One economic study by the Financial Institutions for Asbestos Reform \nfound that, considering the multiplying effect of private investment, \nfailure to enact asbestos legislation could reduce economic growth by \n$2.4 billion per year, costing more than 30,000 jobs annually. Extended \nover a 27-year time frame, this would translate into the loss of more \n800,000 jobs and $64 billion in economic growth. And RAND concluded \nthat 423,000 new jobs will not be created due to asbestos litigation, \nand $33 billion in capital investment will not be made.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle preach the need for job \ngrowth and argue that Republicans are not doing enough to spur the \neconomy and preserve and create jobs. This bill helps preserve jobs. \nBut unfortunately, if we continue to allow this dysfunctional system to \nexist and let partisan politics run rampant, we will see a major \ndilemma in the American workplace--thousands of Virginians and \nAmericans unemployed.\n  In addition, a failure to resolve this situation will have an adverse \neffect on employee pensions and retirements. Each worker who loses \ntheir job from an asbestos bankruptcy loses on average at least 25 \npercent of the value of their 401(k) retirement accounts. Thus, a \nfailure to act will not only lead to job loss, but could hamper their \nlong-term financial well-being. Furthermore, individuals use their \npensions and 401(ks) for a number of things. An individual may use it \nto retire, to pay for their children's college education or for \nincurred health expenses as they grow older.\n  Unfortunately, the crisis does not stop there. Opponents seem to \nforget that many victims are unable to receive just compensation \nbecause the courts have been burdened by the sheer volume of cases--\nlegitimate and less meritorious alike. They have been unable to ensure \nthat even a majority of asbestos compensation goes to plaintiffs who \nare actually injured.\n  Shipyard workers and Navy veterans from my Commonwealth of Virginia \nshould not have to suffer in the current system. The RAND study that I \nreferenced earlier found that the vast majority of new claims--\napproximately 90 percent--are made by people who do not have any sort \nof cancer or mesothelioma. These individuals prevent the claims of \nthose who are truly ill from being heard and given their day in court \nand zap the limited resources available to compensate true victims now \nand in the future.\n  This bill will provide some consistency in the settlements that are \nawarded to victims. Far too often, the awards are unfair, inconsistent, \nand erratic. Currently, victims can only expect to see 43 cents of \nevery dollar in compensation awarded. The rest of the money goes to \nlawyers and administrative costs.\n  The FAIR Act seeks to remedy this injustice. This legislation will \nmake sure that victims receive immediate compensation in full. By \ncapping the litigation costs, we are making sure that awards are going \ninto the bank accounts of the truly injured, rather than legal fees for \ncompanies and claimants.\n  As the Chicago Tribune said in September 2002, ``Today's \ndysfunctional system benefits primarily trial lawyers and healthy \nplaintiffs--and that drains resources from those who are sick and dying \nbecause of asbestos. That's a national shame.'' The Fairness in \nAsbestos Injury Resolution Act is a long overdue attempt to correct \nthat terrible wrong.\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\n  So what does this bill do? In short, the FAIR Act would establish a \nprivately funded trust fund composed of mandatory contributions from \ncurrent corporate defendants and their insurers as well as moneys from \nexisting bankruptcy trusts. Plaintiffs who believe they have been \ninjured by asbestos exposure would submit claims to the administrator \nof the trust fund with evidence that they were exposed to asbestos for \na period of time sufficient to cause their medical condition. Qualified \nclaimants would be paid a clear compensation depending on eligibility \nand disease type on a no-fault basis. Properly administered, the trust \nfund will ensure that nearly all defendants' and insurers' asbestos \nexpenditures end up in the hands of injured claimants. And by paying \nfixed generous award amounts depending on the severity of the disease, \nthe FAIR Act would ensure that the truly impaired are compensated.\n  I urge my colleagues to move to consider this bill. Too many jobs are \nbeing lost in bankrupted companies while Virginians and Americans with \nasbestos-related diseases receive inadequate compensation. The \nprincipal point is that action and leadership has been needed for \nyears. There is no reason to procrastinate and avoid responsibility to \nremedy this current dysfunctional, failed situation. The FAIR Act is a \nreasonable, responsible way to move forward jobs and equity; to \nfilibuster and block this bill is an avoidance of responsibility.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to speak today on S. 2290, the \nrevised, but still misnamed, Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution \nAct. Reluctantly, I will oppose the motion to proceed to this bill.\n  I say ``reluctantly'' because I support the concept of a national \ntrust fund to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases and \naddress the severe strain that cases brought by those victims have \nplaced on our legal system and our economy. Ten thousand Americans now \ndie each year--a rate approaching 30 deaths per day--from diseases \ncaused by asbestos. My home State of Wisconsin ranks 16th in the Nation \nin asbestos-related deaths.\n  I was encouraged when the defendant companies in some of the many \nlawsuits that have been filed, their insurers, and organized labor \nbegan serious negotiations back in 2002 to try to develop legislation \nfor a national trust fund that the Congress could enact on a consensus \nbasis to address this serious problem. This was an issue that called \nout for a bipartisan solution.\n  Unfortunately, those discussions were short-circuited before an \nagreement could be reached. What began then was a process that has \nturned the asbestos issue into a partisan issue when it really \nshouldn't be. A bill very much slanted toward the defendants and \ninsurers was introduced last spring by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Although I disagreed with the chairman's decision to call a \nhalt to negotiations, I do give him credit for at least allowing the \nJudiciary Committee to work on the bill, in contrast to the process \nthat was followed on the series of ill-advised medical malpractice \nbills that have been brought directly to the floor during this \nCongress. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing and then an \nextraordinary four meetings to mark up the bill. Two dozen amendments \nwere debated and voted on.\n  The bill that emerged in July 2003 after that intensive work by the \ncommittee still did not win my support. But all of the committee \nmembers who voted against it agreed that it was much improved over the \noriginal bill. The committee's work could have been the foundation for \nfurther bipartisan negotiation that might have led, if all parties were \nwilling to come to the table and compromise, to a bill that could be \noverwhelmingly approved by the Senate.\n  So what happened over the last 10 months? Well, the first thing that \nhappened is that the insurers went to the Republican leadership and \nsaid they couldn't live with even the limited improvements that the \ncommittee approved. So no sooner had an amended bill come out of \ncommittee then its supporters started backing away. Instead of trying \nto make the bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee more \nacceptable to victims of asbestos in a serious effort to solve what we \nall agree is a difficult and important problem, the proponents of this \nlegislation went backward.\n  And so in many respects the bill that the Senate is being asked to \ntake up is worse than the committee bill. Important amendments adopted \nin committee that provide some certainty that money will be available \nto future victims of the horrible diseases caused by asbestos, and we \nknow with certainty that there will be thousands of such victims, were \nremoved by the sponsors of S. 2290. By what definition does that \nrepresent ``fairness''?\n  Let me talk for a minute about some of the specific provisions that \nhave led me to conclude that I cannot in good conscience vote to \nproceed to this bill.\n  The first issue is money. CBO estimates that between $124 billion and \n$136 billion will be needed to pay an expected 1.7 billion asbestos \nclaims over the 27-year life of the fund. Some experts think that \nestimate might be too low. S. 2290 provides for a maximum of only $114 \nbillion for the fund. The bill reported from the committee, as a result \nof amendments offered in committee by Senators Feinstein and Kohl, \nincluded total funding of $154 billion. How can it be fair for a \ncompensation fund to be doomed to failure from the start because it is \nunderfunded?\n  Another issue is related to the issue of the adequacy of the fund. \nSenator Biden offered an amendment that was approved by an overwhelming \nbipartisan majority of the committee. It basically said to people who \nhave claims that if the fund isn't adequately funded they will not be \nleft empty-handed. It called for a return to the tort system for \nclaimants who do not receive the payments that the bill calls for. S. \n2290 substitutes a much weaker sunset amendment that would leave \nvictims waiting for years and years without compensation before they \nare permitted to again pursue their claims in court. How is that fair?\n  I am concerned in addition that this bill treats certain companies \nsuch as Halliburton very favorably by capping their liability to the \nfund at a fraction of what they have already set aside to pay claims to \nasbestos victims. These companies have already agreed to settle claims \nagainst them and agreed to pay billions of dollars in compensation. \nThose settlements have been on hold as Congress considers this \nlegislation and if it passes, the companies will save literally \nbillions of dollars that they otherwise were prepared to pay to \nasbestos victims. How is that fair?\n  I am also very concerned that this bill would overturn longstanding \nsettlements under which some victims have been receiving regular \npayments for years. How can it be fair to people who have settled their \nclaims already, or who have even received jury verdicts in their favor \nthat are now on appeal, to have to start over in an administrative \nprocess that could take years to get up and running and years to \ncomplete? An amendment offered by Senator Feinstein in committee would \nhave postponed the effective date of the bill until the fund was up and \nrunning. That would have allowed at least some far-advanced cases to \nproceed to final judgment. The deletion of the Feinstein amendment is \nanother step backward taken by the sponsors of this bill.\n  We have an asbestos crisis not only because lawsuits are threatening \nthe financial well being of American companies but because people are \ngetting sick and dying. Some companies knew that exposure to asbestos \ncaused asbestosis, a tragic lung disease, as early as 1918. In 1966, \nthe Director of Purchasing for Bendix Corporation, now a part of \nHoneywell, stated in an internal memo `` . . . if you have enjoyed a \ngood life while working with asbestos products, why not die from it.'' \nThere are countless other industry documents that have been uncovered \nto show that the industry knew it was endangering its workers' health \nby continuing to use asbestos. A 1958 National Gypsum Memo, for \nexample, stated: ``Because just as certain as death and taxes is the \nfact that if you inhale asbestos dust you get asbestosis.''\n  We need to make sure that any national solution to the asbestos \nlitigation issue keeps faith with people who have been injured by this \ndangerous product. And we now know that the problem is not limited to \npeople who worked with asbestos. It is also the families of the men and \nwomen who\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\nworked with asbestos who have contracted asbestos-related diseases. \nEven consumers who used hair dryers, electric blankets, attic \ninsulation, home siding and ceiling and floor tiles have suffered \ninjury from asbestos exposure. These victims need compensation, and \nthis hazardous substance needs to be banned once and for all.\n  We all want to see a resolution to this crisis, we want these victims \nto get the compensation they deserve. That is why I am so disappointed \nin the final version of this bill. Instead of working toward a \nnegotiated solution that the whole Senate can support, the sponsors of \nthis bill have assured its failure by going backward. Again I ask, how \nis that fair? Reluctantly, I will vote against the motion to proceed, \nand I hope the message that comes from the failure of this bill is not \nthat no solution to the asbestos problem is possible, but rather that \nthe only way to reach a solution is to involve all the interested \nparties, and Senators from both sides of the aisle, and try to arrive \nat a truly fair bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose S. 2290, the so-\ncalled ``FAIR Act.'' I oppose this bill because it is anything but fair \nto victims of asbestos exposure. This bill puts the interests of \ninsurance companies and industry before those who are sick and often \ndying because of asbestos exposure. How can we call a bill fair--when \nit makes those who suffer as a result of asbestos exposure worse off \nand further delays their compensation. We need a balanced and fair \napproach to asbestos reform that will have bipartisan support. \nDemocrats want it, business wants it, labor wants it and many of our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle want it. Unfortunately, the FAIR \nAct is not it.\n  Even the process by which this bill came to the floor is not fair. \nThis is not the bill that came out of the Judiciary Committee, its not \nthe product of the negotiations that Senators Specter, Leahy, Daschle \nand others have been pursuing, it is not a bill that has had any input \nfrom Democrats. Senators Frist and Hatch decided what should be in the \nbill and put it on the floor. They skirted the usual Senate process and \nintroduced a partisan bill.\n  This bill is not fair.\n  Is it fair that those who are seriously ill as a result of asbestos \nrelated illnesses would receive far less on average under this bill \nthan they would in our court system?\n  Is it fair that victims who are suffering from lung cancer may only \nreceive $25,000 when they were exposed to asbestos for 15 years and \nwill likely die within a few years of diagnosis?\n  Is it fair that businesses will only put $109 billion into the fund \nwhen conservative estimates expect the fund's claims to reach at least \n$134 billion?\n  Is it fair that victims will be left with no recourse if, as many \nexpect, the fund runs out of money and those who are sick are forced to \nwait years more for compensation?\n  And I ask you, is it fair that those who have already spent years in \nthe court system will have their settlements and judgments wiped out \nand have to wait years more for compensation under the new system? \nThese defects are simply unacceptable in a bill that is supposed to \nsolve the asbestos nightmare and get victims real relief now.\n  None of these provisions is fair to the workers, mechanics, miners, \nand family members who have been exposed to asbestos and are now \nsuffering from disease. These are the people who are relying on the \nCongress for help so they can spend their last days enjoying their \nfamilies and loved ones and not litigating their claims. The U.S. \nSenate can do better than getting caught up in a political game when \npeople's lives are at stake.\n  This legislation has three major flaws--it gives victims far too \nlittle, forces victims into a fund that has too few resources, and \ncloses the courthouse door for victims of asbestos exposure.\n  Too many victims receive far too little under this bill. This new \nFrist/Hatch bill may have increased the awards for some victims over \nprevious version of the bill, but it still leaves many of the most \nseriously ill victims with awards far below what they would receive if \nthey went to court. For example, overall awards in this bill are far \nlower than what victims would receive in court. And to top it all off \nvictims could see their awards reduced even further because of workers' \ncompensation or insurers' liens, which this bill allows. That's not \nfair.\n  This bill forces victims out of the courts and into a fund that may \nrun out of money. The level of funding under this Frist/Hatch bill is \nwell below what even conservative estimates put as the likely cost of \nthe fund. How can we ask all these victims to give up their right to go \nto court and then put them in a fund that will run out of money? They \nwill be left holding the bag and waiting years more to get relief. \nCertainly business can do more for the trust fund in exchange for a \nreprieve from their litigation liability.\n  I am not only worried about the fund running out of money in the long \nterm--but also up front. Over 300,000 cases are currently pending and \nit is expected that 90,000 additional cases will be filed each year of \nthe first few years of the trust. Under this bill there simply is not \nenough funding in the early years to cover those costs. So what \nhappens? Victims again are left waiting, as they have been in the tort \nsystem, for years for some compensation and sadly many of them will die \nbefore they ever see a cent.\n  This legislation shuts the courthouse door for victims. Many victims \nof asbestos exposure have already spent years in court and have \nreceived a settlement or judgment. The Frist/Hatch bill wipes out all \npending claims, including those where a settlement has been reached or \nwhere a judge or jury has reached a judgment. These victims have spent \nyears and often most of their resources litigating these cases. Now \nCongress wants to come in and say ``Sorry, you have to file your claim \nagain and wait for the fund to get your relief.'' That undermines the \ncivil justice system, the faith we put in judges and juries and is \nsimply not fair to victims who have been waiting years.\n  Senator Feinstein had offered an amendment to the original bill in \nCommittee that helped take care of part of this problem. It was based \non a simple idea--victims have waited long enough and they ought to be \nallowed to pursue their claims while the fund was getting off the \nground. But the Frist/Hatch bill gets rid of that provision and makes \nvictims wait. Wait till the money is in the fund, wait till the \nadministrative system is set up, wait till Administrators are appointed \nand then wait some more. It might take years to get the fund off the \nground and until then victims have no where to go to pursue their \nclaims.\n  I, like my colleagues, wanted a to be able to vote for legislation \nthat would help victims, that would make sure they got the compensation \nthey deserve and would also ensure that problems with the current legal \nsystem were addressed. But this bill is the wrong vehicle--it actually \nrolls back the progress that was made in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand through months of negotiations between labor, business and \ninsurance.\n  I know that Senators Daschle, Leahy, Dodd, Feinstein and others have \nbeen working tirelessly with those on the other side of the aisle and \nwith industry, insurance and labor to create a consensus bill. I have \nsupported those efforts and am disappointed that Senator Frist \nintroduced this bill which sends us in exactly the opposite direction. \nIt sends us away from common ground and negotiated positions to a \nstrongly partisan bill that does not reflect any of those efforts. I \nthink we should go back to the table, to finish the conversations, to \nreach a balanced agreement that the majority of us can support.\n  We need to protect those who have been exposed and are suffering from \nasbestos related diseases by putting sufficient amounts in the trust \nfund, by making sure that compensation levels are fair and awards are \ndispensed quickly, by ensuring that the fund is solvent and provides \nvictims with the ability to go back to court if the system runs out of \nmoney. We also need to make sure that those who are in court can \ncontinue their cases until the fund is set up and that those who have \nreached a settlement or received a judgment can get the remedy their \nlitigation has entitled them to.\n  I stand with my Democratic colleagues in saying ``we want a bill.'' I \nwant a bill that helps victims get just\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\ncompensation, and that provides financial certainty for industry and \ninsurers. But that cannot come at the cost of the rights and remedies \nfor those who are and will become seriously ill as a result of asbestos \nexposure.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I voted against the cloture motion to S. \n2290 because I did not believe this bill was ready to be debated on the \nSenate floor. Unfortunately, the process that created this bill did not \ngive stakeholders an adequate opportunity to fully discuss and debate \nhonest differences. As a result, significant issues remain that can and \nshould be addressed before proceeding to consideration on the floor. I \nam confident, however, these issues can be resolved if the interested \nparties will come to the table and work in good faith until a \ncompromise can be reached. In my conversations with asbestos victims, \nindustry officials, and labor leaders a common thread has emerged; we \nare too close to walk away now.\n  I have consistently expressed support for a legislative solution to \nthe asbestos crisis that would establish a trust fund to pay legitimate \nclaims in a fair and efficient manner. However, if we ask American \ncitizens to give up their right to a day in court, we must ensure they \nwill be treated equitably by the alternative. Further, we must ensure \nthat the trust fund remains solvent and efficient. We also must make \ncertain that the fund will be up and running as quickly as possible.\n  All of the parties in this discussion have a vested interest in \nmaking the trust fund work. For the victims, many have waited far too \nlong to receive the compensation they deserve in a timely and efficient \nmanner. For the business community, they have agreed to commit a \nsignificant amount of money to this fund. It is in their best interest \nto make sure the fund works by paying victims a fair amount in a timely \nway to ensure they are not threatened by non-meritorious claims if this \nprocess returns to the courts\n  We can reach agreement on this vital legislation if all sides stay at \nthe table. Legislation is rarely a work of art, it is a work in \nprogress. We must continue to push forward until a solution is found.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to the arguments of \nmy colleagues from the other side of the aisle.\n  I thank Senators Carper, Nelson, Miller, and Baucus, who indicated \nthey will vote for this bill in the end if we can resolve some of the \nproblems. These Senators in every sense have worked extraordinarily \nhard on this bill, especially Senator Miller.\n  I believe we can accommodate Senator Baucus so he can literally vote \nfor this bill. I do not want to see people from Montana be mistreated. \nFrankly, I believe we can make the appropriate change. We have talked \nabout what it will be. It is what he has told me he would accept. I \nthink we can make that change. But that is what you do on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Having said that about these colleagues who have worked so hard with \nus, including Senator Feinstein, who has worked with us on these \nmatters, all of them are going to vote against cloture today, at least \nas far as I know.\n  Having said that, I was interested in the comments of the \ndistinguished ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, that we have \nto get into reality here; reality the way the Senate is supposed to \nwork, the way the legislative process works. After 15 months of meeting \nwith everybody from one end of this country to the other, everybody in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, and virtually everybody in the Senate, \n15 months of intensive negotiations, where are we? In reality, they are \nfilibustering even a motion to proceed which I think shows where this \nis all going. They are not filibustering the bill which would be next. \nThey are filibustering the motion to even proceed to the bill. The \nreality is if we want to be legislators and we want to legislate, then \nwe bring the bill up and we fight it out on the floor.\n  We have a filibuster here on the motion to proceed. We have had 15 \nmonths of negotiations. We have bent over backward to try to \naccommodate our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. There is \nvirtually only one thing many of them want more of; that is, more \nmoney. That is after putting in the original $108 billion, which nobody \nthought we could get done; that almost everybody said if you get that \nwe will go--virtually everybody involved, including the unions. We are \nnow up to $114 billion, and it is still not enough. If that is not \nenough, then bring an amendment to the bill on the floor. Make it more, \nif you can.\n  The problem is I think they know the vast majority of Senators in \nthis body know it is enough. They know it is probably too much and know \nwhat a burden it is going to be on these companies that are basically \nnear bankruptcy to pay for this. But we have done that.\n  I heard the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \nsay we should be legislators. If the funds are enough, they would go. \nBring amendments. Let us fight out. That is what we do. That is what \nthis floor is for--not just filibustering a motion to proceed so we \ncan't fight it out, so we can't have amendments. I think they should \nquit hiding behind outrageous figures everybody around here knows can't \nbe done.\n  I believe my friend said one of the problems is solvency protection. \nHow can you protect from insolvency, if these companies start going \ninto bankruptcy? We have had 70 so far. We will have more loss of \nhealth benefits, loss of pensions, and loss of jobs.\n  By the way, on the award values, it is interesting to me that I am \nhearing it is not enough in award values to individual people and the \nindividual categories, and yet the award values were approved by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee 14-3. Only two Democrats did not vote. All \nthe other Democrats voted for the award values we have in this bill--\nevery one of them. The only three members on our side who didn't vote \nfor the award values said they felt they were too high. The Democrats \nall agreed they were decent award values.\n  If we are going to be legislators, let us be legislators. Let us not \nhide behind a filibuster of a motion to proceed.\n  There have been a lot of comments by my friend on the other side \nabout the fairness and adequacy of the claim values. He said they are \nlow. What he failed to mention today in his remarks is the Feinstein \nbipartisan claims values amendment was adopted by the committee 14-3. \nIt was a bipartisan vote. The only three who voted against it were \nRepublicans who thought the claims values we had were too high. All of \nthe votes from the other side of the aisle were 100 percent for the \nclaims values.\n  I am not sure why my friend from Vermont is now saying the claims \nvalues we have adopted in a bipartisan fashion--he was there last \nJuly--are now too low. It is amazing to me. It is typical of what we \nhave gone through for 15 months trying to work this out. I think they \nmay figure as long as they can keep this going, there will be more and \nmore demands on these few companies that are now stuck after the main \ncompanies that caused the problem are all bankrupt. These companies, \nsuch as Monroe, which I mentioned earlier, are stuck having to try to \nwin but the defense costs alone would eat them alive and put them into \nbankruptcy.\n  We can talk about this forever. We can negotiate forever. But if it \nmeans more and more money, bring amendments to the floor. Maybe they \nwill win on it. I don't know. All I can do is show how exorbitant they \nare under the circumstances.\n  We still have a hedge factor in this matter. If for some reason there \nare not enough funds at the end of this process to pay off claims--and \nwe believe not only there will be, but there will be more than enough \nfunds--then this will revert back to the tort system again.\n  Nobody will want that to happen. Nobody will let that happen. But \neven if it does, then these voracious claims lawyers, these personal \ninjury lawyers--about 10 percent or even less of the American \nAssociation of Trial Lawyers--will be able to do the same things we \nhave just mentioned they have been doing in this matter.\n  I think everybody is protected. There is no question about it.\n  Why are we not going to invoke cloture here and kill this bill? Why \naren't we going to have amendments to make this bill more pure, if we \ncan? Why don't we have amendments to increase the funding, if that is \nwhat they think should occur? The fact is they don't\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\nwant to do it because they know darned well if they did, they probably \ncouldn't win on these outrageous claims. But if they did, then the \nSenate will have worked its will. That is what legislators do. They \ndon't hide behind filibustering every bill. They do not have \nobstruction tactics on every bill. Around here, we have to get 60 votes \nfor virtually any bill that means anything. That is pretty pathetic. \nSooner or later, we are going to have to address that. That includes \njudges for the first time in history.\n  But this bill is important. I acknowledge cloture will not be invoked \ntoday. I have known that for a long time. The fact of the matter is at \nleast everybody is going to know where everybody stands on this matter. \nDoes that mean we are going to quit negotiating and quit trying to \nbring people together? No. We will. But if we don't get that down in \nanother week, it seems to me this bill is going to be dead. If it is \ndead, then I pity those 8,400 companies plus all the insurance \ncompanies--about 16 of those--because they are all headed toward \nbankruptcy and this country is going to suffer a tremendous problem \nwhile the truly sick are not going to get compensated. The truly sick \nare not going to get compensated. We have seen the sleazy approach of \nat least one of the personal injury law firms toward manipulating the \nprocess so those who aren't getting sick get a recovery which they \nshould never have gotten. That takes money away from those who are \nsick. Guess who the beneficiaries of this whole process are. These \npersonal injury lawyers, some of whom are honest, but probably some who \nare not.\n  This chart shows it all. The word ``filibuster'' comes from the \nSpanish word ``filibustero,'' meaning pirating and hijacking. I shudder \nto think we will consign all of these people who have asbestos-related \nillnesses to oblivion and not do the best we can to help them when we \nhave a system that is broken.\n\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time and proceed to \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. Under the previous \norder, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the \npending cloture motion which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 472, S. 2290, a bill to create a fair \n     and efficient system to resolve claims of victims for bodily \n     injury caused by asbestos exposure, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Orrin Hatch, Gordon Smith, Lamar Alexander, \n           Saxby Chambliss, Ted Stevens, Michael B.

On this vote, the ayes are 50, the nays are \n47. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we did not invoke \ncloture on the asbestos reform bill. As I have said numerous times in \nrecent days, this is an important issue, an issue we are not going to \ngive up on. It is too important to the American people. It is an issue \nwith victims, with veterans, with all people who are affected by \nasbestos. It would be a great disservice just to drop this issue; \ntherefore, we are not going to drop it.\n  We have devoted now more than 300 days trying to work out the details \nof this bill, which I do believe is more than adequate time to reach \nconsensus. Thus, later today, the Democratic leader and I--we have been \nin discussion over the course of the morning--will be discussing on the \nSenate floor a possible method of moving these discussions forward with \nthe stakeholders over the next several days and possibly weeks. We will \nengage in a colloquy later in the day as to what that specific proposal \nwill be.\n  I am confident we can make progress on this important issue, that we \ncan move the stakeholders to a final agreement. I say that because \npeople just saw the vote and that does not close the door in any way. \nIn fact, it inspires us to work together more over the next several \ndays and weeks.\n  For the information of Senators, next we will begin consideration of \nS. 2329, which is the victims' rights bill. It was introduced yesterday \nby Senators Kyl, Feinstein, and others. The order provides for up to 2 \nhours of debate before the vote on passage of that bill. That vote will \nlikely be the last vote of this week.\n  Following the victims' rights bill, we will turn to, in the early \npart of next week, Monday, the Internet access tax bill. Discussions \nhave been underway over the course of the morning and afternoon on that \nbill as to when we will actually begin consideration, and later this \nafternoon, I will have more to say about that bill.\n  As I believe I said this morning, following completion of the \nInternet tax bill, we will be turning to FSC/ETI, the JOBS bill. That \nis several days from now.\n  Mr. President, again, I am very disappointed in the cloture vote \ntoday, but we will be back, and I will talk more about that this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of comments about \nthe asbestos bill. I see my colleague from Delaware. Does he want to \nsay something before I make a short speech?\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, yes, I want to mention to Senator Frist, \nas I did to Senator Daschle in the last few minutes, my appreciation \nfor the way each of them are, as leaders, engaging in a bipartisan way \nto address the asbestos issue as something we have to get done; we can \ndo better than the status quo and take up the bill under the good work \nof the Judiciary Committee and the Specter-Becker process. There is a \ngood process in place showing results, and I am delighted both Senator \nFrist and Senator Daschle are embracing that process and enabling us to \nwork together and resolve the remaining issues.\n  I mentioned when Senator Frist was not here that work has a way of \nexpanding to fill the amount of time we allocate to a project. Senator \nFrist\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nknows that better than I do. If we say we are going to take the rest of \nthe year to resolve the asbestos bill, it will take the rest of the \nyear. There is value in setting a date certain. Senator Frist may want \nto consider returning to this bill right before the Memorial Day \nrecess. That gives us 3 weeks to buckle down, get the interested \nparties in a room together, and Senators who want to participate and \ntheir staff, along with Judge Becker, our leaders, and let's get this \njob done.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, briefly in response, I understand the \nimportance of setting dates and also of having a sense of urgency, \nsince we do have victims who are suffering today. We will have more to \nsay about overall timing when I have a colloquy with the Democratic \nleader a little bit later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nremarks of Senator Nickles we proceed to consideration of the \nlegislation which the leader announced so that Senator Feinstein can \ncommence her presentation and hopefully have her first presentation \nconcluded before 1 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks concerning \nthe asbestos legislation we failed to reach cloture on a motion to \nproceed. I am disappointed that we did not go to the legislation. I \ncame down yesterday to speak and others were engaged. Maybe it is more \nappropriate that I speak now.\n  We have a very serious problem dealing with asbestos in this country. \nI held a hearing in the Budget Committee 2 years ago and stated that \nsome of the biggest problems that we face, as far as our economy, is \nregulations and litigation abuse. And heading the list of litigation \nabuse in this country is asbestos litigation. We have 8,000 companies \nnow listed as defendants in suits, and 60 or 70 companies have already \ngone bankrupt. Thousands of jobs have been lost. I believe over 60,000 \njobs have been lost from the bankrupt companies that have gone out of \nbusiness. Maybe another 100,000 jobs have not been created as a result \nof the negative impact that asbestos litigation has on the economy, and \nit is wrong. When we find out that two-thirds of the awards or \nsettlement payments have been going out to people who are not sick, \nsomething is wrong. So this system needs to be fixed.\n\n  I also want to compliment Senator Hatch, Senator Frist, and Senator \nSpecter for their efforts. There has been a lot of work going into this \nlegislation.\n  However, I have very serious problems with this particular \nlegislation, S. 2290. In my opinion, a legislative solution that would \npropose creating a large federal trust fund is a mistake. I think there \nsimply is a better way to do it. I asked the Congressional Budget \nOffice to provide the Budget Committee analysis of the legislation, \nthat we had before us, and the essence of its potential cost effects. I \nnow ask to include their entire statement into the record. It states \nthat CBO estimates operations of the fund would increase federal budget \ndeficits by $13 billion over the first 10 years of the fund.\n  Thus, they estimate, that even though it will take in $118 billion of \ncontributed funds over the life of trust, in the first 10 years it is \ngoing to add $13 billion to the deficit. Though the legislation says \nyou can borrow against future anticipated revenues, it is still going \nto add to the deficit, and the Fund itself will become insolvent at \nsome point because fund resources will be overwhelmed by anticipated \nclaims liability. There are going to be major problems with this fund, \ntoo many problems.\n  As a matter of fact, I estimate that if we go with the trust fund \napproach there are going to be a lot of unqualified claimants saying, \n``We want to be covered under this fund.'' We can expect that, unless \nthere is very strict medical criteria enforced, and this bill does not \nhave very strict medical criteria. By very strict medical criteria, I \nmean there should be legislation in place that requires claimants to \nprove that they have an asbestos-related disease before they are \ncompensated by the fund. And this bill does not do that.\n  Also, I hope we would abandon the idea of creating a trust fund, \nunder this legislation, that has a fixed, capped, amount that must be \ncontributed into the fund by insurers and defendant companies involved, \nwhile the liability remains virtually unlimited. What one should easily \nsee, is that the insurers are limited in what they must contribute and \nthe defendant companies are limited in what they must contribute, but \nthe extent of liability is unlimited. This should indicate to my \ncolleagues that this Fund may not work. The claims may greatly exceed \nthe fund, there is a shortage, and we end up with an insolvent fund.\n  The bill says, well, we presume if the fund goes insolvent, the fund \nwill terminate from a Government-funded fund managed by the Department \nof Labor, and then claimants who did not get in on the money are going \nto simply seek redress in the federal courts. I question that. I can \nsee people coming back to Congress and saying: ``Hey, we want the \nFederal Government to pay for it.'' This puts the taxpayer at risk.\n  So what is the solution? I am not trying to be critical. But, I think \nwe should come up with realistic solutions. I have a couple of ideas I \nthink we could do. One is to impose strict medical criteria in the \nexisting tort system. The American Bar Association has said Congress \nshould establish strict medical criteria in the tort system: in other \nwords, a person must prove they have an asbestos related injury before \nthey file a claim and get compensated. Let's make sure we are not \npaying payments to people who have lung cancer resulting from other \ncauses, like a life-long smoking habit. My mother had lung cancer and \nmy brother had cancer as a result of smoking. They should not be \ncompensated out of an asbestos compensation fund. We should hold to the \nprinciple that if people are going to receive compensation from \nasbestos exposure they should have an asbestos-related disease; and \nthey must prove it was the substantial contributing factor to the \ninjury. If they prove it, they should be compensated.\n\n  We should also toll the statute of limitations for asbestos injuries \nto protect the legal rights of claimants who should develop a disease \nor impairment in the future. If they discover they have an asbestos-\nrelated disease in the distant future, the statute of limitations \nshould not begin to run until that time. They would be able to file \nsuit. That would eliminate a lot of these bogus claims and the mass \naction claims where people are filing claims saying, ``We think we \ncould develop asbestos disease in the future, and we understand the \nstatute of limitations is going to run out, so therefore we are going \nto file claims now.'' Over two-thirds of the claimants today do not \nhave asbestos-related disease, but they are filing claims. Let's enact \nlegislation to toll the statute of limitations, so if it is proven that \n10 or 20 years from now an individual develops asbestos-related \ndisease, and it is proven, they can be justly compensated.\n  Finally, let's eliminate the abusive venue shopping. Let's keep it in \ncourt jurisdiction where the claim belongs, and stop bargain-hunting \nplaintiffs from shopping their claims in only the most lucrative \ndistrict or State courts in the country.\n  There does not have to be a new Federal fund, or a new entitlement \nprogram, created to provide a reasonable solution to this problem. If \nwe simply require claimants to prove in court that they have an \nasbestos-related disease or impairment, then we can compensate those \nwho are truly sick and they can be compensated well. The defendants \ncompanies and the insurance companies could all pay a lot more to the \nmost deserving victims of asbestos exposure, if they did not have to \nneedlessly pay money to the two-thirds who do not have asbestos-related \ndisease.\n  Many of these plaintiffs lawyers who are involved in these mass \naction suits, those who represent legitimate victims who are being \npushed aside by the non-injured, actually say that a medical criteria \nbill would be the right solution. We do not need take away anybody's \nability to go to court. The truly sick can be truly compensated. And do \nnot need to pay false or premature claims. We simply do not need to pay \nclaims to people who, frankly, should\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\nnot be receiving benefits. The fact is, people who do not have \nasbestos-related disease are clogging the courts, and they are denying \npeople who do have the disease just compensation.\n  I have introduced such legislation that will go a long way to solving \nthese problems. I have kind of held back to see whether or not this \ntrust fund approach would work, and, frankly, I do not believe it will \nwork, whether it is $118 billion or $153 billion.\n  I heard many of my Democratic colleagues say if it had a little more \nmoney maybe they could support it. It will not work. My guess is if \nthere was a fund of $153 billion or even $173 billion, as much money as \nthat is, with the medical criteria being lax as it is in this bill \nespecially for smokers, it will not work because you will still have \nthousands of unqualified people saying, ``My lung cancer should be \ncovered too.''\n  As a matter of fact, if one looks at one of the compensation plans \nunder this bill, yes, under levels VII, VIII and IX section C, smokers \nget compensation without having clear proof it was caused by their \nasbestos exposure. Now, maybe they worked in a plant that might have \nhad asbestos present, but if they cannot prove that it was the cause of \ntheir cancer and not, for example, the five packs of cigarettes they \nsmoked each day for thirty years, then they should not be compensated, \nbut this Trust Fund bill would do this.\n  My point is, let's go back to the drawing board. I do not believe a \ntrust fund approach is the right approach. I happen to think that S. \n2290 is almost an invitation for people to say here is a bunch of \nmoney, probably not enough money, so let's make sure we run our claims \nearly, fast, and get in while the money is still there. So the claims \nwould greatly exceed the money available no matter what size the pot of \nmoney is on the table. And when it runs out the net result will be that \npeople will come to the Federal Government to keep it going. This trust \nfund will simply not be adequate to compensate all the claims, \nespecially not with lax medical criteria.\n  So I urge our colleagues to rethink this. Let's establish medical \ncriteria in the courts using medical evaluation standards proposed by \nthe American Medical Association, and consistent with a resolution \nendorsed by the American Bar Association, that calls on Congress to \nestablish criteria standards along those lines and toll the statute of \nlimitations for those who may become sick in the future. Let's \ncompensate those families, those individuals, who are truly sick. Let's \nhelp the victims, and not reward people who do not even have asbestos \ndisease or injury by giving them two-thirds of the benefits under this \npresent flawed system.\n  I urge my colleagues to seriously review such an alternative approach \nwhen we reconsider this bill in the not too distant future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the CBO letter of April 20, 2004, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 2004.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you requested, CBO has prepared a \n     cost estimate for S. 2290, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury \n     Resolution Act of 2004, as introduced on April 7, 2004. The \n     bill would establish the Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution \n     Fund (Asbestos Fund) to provide compensation to individuals \n     whose health has been impaired by exposure to asbestos. The \n     fund would be financed by levying assessments on certain \n     firms. Based on a review of the major provisions of the bill, \n     CBO estimates that enacting S. 2290 would result in direct \n     spending of $71 billion for claims payments over the 2005-\n     2014 period and additional revenues of $57 billion over the \n     same period. Including outlays for administrative costs and \n     investment transactions of the Asbestos Fund, CBO estimates \n     that operations of the fund would increase budget deficits by \n     $13 billion over the 10-year period. The estimated net \n     budgetary impact of the legislation is shown in Table 1.\n       S. 2290 contains both intergovernmental and private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). CBO estimates that the aggregate direct cost of \n     complying with the intergovernmental mandates in S. 2290 \n     would be small and would fall well below the annual threshold \n     ($60 million in 2004, adjusted annually for inflation) \n     established in UMRA. CBO also estimates that the aggregate \n     direct cost of complying with the private-sector mandates in \n     S. 2290 would well exceed the annual threshold established in \n     UMRA ($120 million in 2004 for the private sector, adjusted \n     annually for inflation) during each of the first five years \n     those mandates would be in effect.\n\n                                                     TABLE 1.--ESTIMATED BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 2290\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                        By fiscal year, in billions of dollars--\n                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  2005     2006     2007     2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     2013     2014\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nClaims and administrative expenditures of the Asbestos Fund:\n    Estimated budget authority................................        *     18.5     12.8     12.9      5.3      5.3      5.3      5.2      5.0      4.9\n    Estimated outlays.........................................        *      7.5     10.7     14.6      9.8      7.6      5.3      5.3      5.2      5.0\nInvestment transactions of the Asbestos Fund:\n    Estimated budget authority................................      5.4      2.0     -4.8     -3.3        0        0        0        0        0        0\n    Estimated outlays.........................................      5.4      2.0     -4.8     -3.3        0        0        0        0        0        0\nTotal direct spending:\n    Estimated budget authority................................      5.4     20.6      8.0      9.6      5.3      5.3      5.3      5.2      5.0      4.9\n    Estimated outlays.........................................      5.4      9.5      5.9     11.3      9.8      7.6      5.3      5.3      5.2      5.0\n                                                                   CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nCollected from bankruptcy trusts \\1\\..........................      1.0        0        0      4.6        0        0        0        0        0        0\nCollected from defendant firms................................      3.3      2.8      2.8      2.8      2.7      2.7      2.7      2.7      2.7      2.6\nCollected from insurers.......................................      2.7      7.5      2.2      1.6      1.6      1.6      1.6      1.6      1.6      1.6\n                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total revenues..........................................      7.0     10.3      5.0      9.0      4.4      4.3      4.3      4.3      4.3      4.3\nEstimated net increase or decrease (-) in the deficit from         -1.5     -0.8      1.0      2.3      5.5      3.2      1.0      1.0      0.9      0.8\n changes in revenues and direct spending......................\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Cash and financial assets of the bankruptcy trusts have an estimated value of about $5 billion. The federal budget would record the cash value of\n  the noncash assets as revenues when they are liquidated by the fund's administrator to pay claims.\n \nNotes.--Numbers in the table may not add up to totals because of rounding. * = less than $50 million. CBO estimates that by 2014 the Asbestos Fund under\n  S. 2290 would have a cumulative debt of around $15 billion. Borrowed funds would be used during this period to pay claims and would later be repaid\n  from future revenue collections of the fund. We estimate that interest costs over that period would exceed $2.5 billion, and CBO's projections of the\n  fund's balances reflect those costs. However, they are not shown in this table as part of the budgetary impact of S. 2290 because debt service costs\n  incurred by the government are not included in cost estimates for individual pieces of legislation.\n\n     Major provisions\n       Under S. 2290, a fund administrator would manage the \n     collection of federal assessments on certain companies that \n     have made expenditures for asbestos injury litigation prior \n     to enactment of the legislation. Claims by private \n     individuals would be processed and evaluated by the fund and \n     awarded compensation as specified in the bill. The \n     administrator would be authorized to invest surplus funds and \n     to borrow from the Treasury or the public--under certain \n     conditions--to meet cash demands for compensation payments. \n     Finally, the bill contains provisions for ending the fund's \n     operations if revenues are determined to be insufficient to \n     meet its obligations.\n       S. 2290 is similar in many ways to S. 1125. A more detailed \n     discussion of the fund's operations and the basis for CBO's \n     estimates of the cost of compensation under these bills is \n     provided in our cost estimate for S. 1125, the Fairness in \n     Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003, which was transmitted \n     to the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 2, 2003.\n     Budgetary impact after 2014\n       CBO estimates that S. 2290 would require defendant firms, \n     insurance companies, and asbestos bankruptcy trusts to pay a \n     maximum of about $118 billion to the Asbestos Fund over the \n     2005-2031 period. Such collections would be recorded on the \n     budget as revenues.\n       We estimate that, under S. 2290, the fund would face \n     eligible claims totaling about $140 billion over the next 50 \n     years. That projection is based on CBO's estimate of the \n     number of pending and future asbestos claims by type of \n     disease that would be filed with the Asbestos Fund, as \n     presented in our cost estimate for S. 1125. While the \n     projected number of claims remains the same, differences \n     between the two bills result in higher projected\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\n     claims payments under S. 2290. The composition of those \n     claims and a summary of the resulting costs is displayed in \n     Table 2.\n       Although CBO estimates that the Asbestos Fund would pay \n     more for claims over the 2005-2014 period than it would \n     collect in revenues, we expect that the administrator of the \n     fund could use the borrowing authority authorized by S. 2290 \n     to continue operations for several years after 2014. Within \n     certain limits, the fund's administrator would be authorized \n     to borrow funds to continue to make payments to asbestos \n     claimants, provided that forecasted revenues are sufficient \n     to retire any debt incurred and pay resolved claims. based on \n     our estimate of the bill's likely long-term cost and the \n     revenues likely to be collected from defendant firms, \n     insurance companies, and certain asbestos bankruptcy trust \n     funds, we anticipate that the sunset provisions in section \n     405(f) would have to be implemented by the Asbestos Fund's \n     administrator before all future claimants are paid. Those \n     provisions would allow the administrator to continue to \n     collect revenues but to stop accepting claims for resolution. \n     In that event, and under certain other conditions, such \n     claimants could pursue asbestos claims in U.S. district \n     courts.\n\n TABLE 2.--SUMMARY OF ESTIMATED ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND AWARDS UNDER S. 2290\n                          [Dollars in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Initial 10-year        Life of fund\n                                     period        ---------------------\n                             ----------------------\n                              Number of             Number of   Cost of\n                                claims      Cost      claims     claims\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClaims for malignant             59,000        $36    127,000        $82\n conditions.................\nClaims for nonmalignant         627,000         17  1,230,000         36\n conditions.................\nPending claims..............    300,000         22    300,000         22\n                             -------------------------------------------\n    Total...................    986,000         75  1,657,000        140\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Major differences in the estimated costs of claims under S. \n         1125 and S. 2290\n       You also requested that CBO explain the major differences \n     between our cost estimates for S. 1125 and S. 2290. On March \n     24, 2004, in a letter to Senator Hatch, CBO updated its \n     October 2, 2003, cost estimate for S. 1125, principally to \n     reflect new projections about the rate of future inflation \n     and an assumed later enactment date for the bill. That letter \n     explains that we now estimate enactment of S. 1125 at the end \n     of fiscal year 2004 would result in claims payments totaling \n     $123 billion over the lifetime of the Asbestos Fund (about 50 \n     years).\n       Three factors account for the difference between the \n     estimated cost of claims under S. 1125 and that under S. 2290 \n     (see Table 3):\n       The award values specified in S. 2290 are higher for \n     certain types of diseases. That difference would add about \n     $11 billion to the cost of claims, CBO estimates.\n       Under S. 2290, most asbestos claims could not be settled \n     privately once the bill is enacted. In contrast, under S. \n     1125, asbestos claims could continue to be settled by private \n     parties between the date of enactment and the date when the \n     Asbestos Fund is fully implemented; defendant firms could \n     credit any payments made during that period against required \n     future payments to the fund. Consequently, CBO estimates that \n     the fund created by S. 2290 would face about $5 billion in \n     claims that, under S. 1125, we anticipate would be settled \n     privately.\n       S. 2290 specifies that administrative expenses of the \n     program would be paid from the fund. Under S. 1125, in \n     contrast, administrative costs would be appropriated from the \n     general funds of the Treasury. That difference would increase \n     costs to the fund by about $1 billion over its lifetime.\n       In the limited time available to prepare this estimate, CBO \n     has not evaluated the differences between the two bills in \n     administrative procedures. Under S. 2290, the Asbestos Fund \n     would be operated by the Department of Labor rather than the \n     U.S. Court of Federal Claims. This and other differences \n     between the two bills could affect the cost of \n     administration, the timing and volume of claims reviewed, and \n     the rate of approval for claims payments.\n\n   TABLE 3.--DIFFERENCES IN ESTIMATED CLAIMS AGAINST THE ASBESTOS FUND\n                        UNDER S. 1125 AND S. 2290\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   In\n                                                                billions\n                                                                   of\n                                                                dollars\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated cost of asbestos claims under S. 1125:                     123\n  Added costs due to higher award values under S. 2290.......         11\n  Additional claims not privately settled after enactment              5\n   under S. 2290.............................................\n  Administrative costs under S. 2290 \\1\\.....................          1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total estimated claims against the fund under S. 2290....        140\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Under S. 1125 administrative costs would be appropriated from the\n  general fund of the Treasury.\n\n     Major differences in estimated revenue collections under S. \n         1125 and S. 2290\n       CBO estimates that the Asbestos Fund under S. 2290 would be \n     limited to revenue collections of about $118 billion over its \n     lifetime, including contingent collections. CBO has not \n     estimated the maximum amount of collections that could be \n     obtained under S. 1125, but they could be greater than $118 \n     billion under certain conditions. In our cost estimate for S. \n     1125, we concluded that revenue collections and interest \n     earnings were likely to be sufficient to pay the estimated \n     cost of claims under that bill. That is not the case for S. \n     2290.\n       Over the first 10 years of operations, we estimate that \n     revenue collections under S. 1125 would exceed those under S. \n     2290 by $7 billion. Thus, under S. 2290 we estimate that \n     there would be little interest earnings on surplus funds and \n     that the Asbestos Fund would need to borrow against future \n     revenues to continue to pay claims during the first 10 years \n     of operations.\n     Estimates of the cost of resolving asbestos claims are \n         uncertain\n       Any budgetary projection over a 50-year period must be used \n     cautiously, and as we discussed in our analysis of S. 1125, \n     estimates of the long-term costs of asbestos claims likely to \n     be presented to a new federal fund for resolution are highly \n     uncertain. Available data on illnesses caused by asbestos are \n     of limited value. There is no existing compensation system or \n     fund for asbestos victims that is identical to the system \n     that would be established under S. 1125 or S. 2290 in terms \n     of application procedures and requirements, medical criteria \n     for award determination, and the amount of award values. The \n     costs would depend heavily on how the criteria would be \n     interpreted and implemented. In addition, the scope of the \n     proposed fund under this legislation would be larger than \n     existing (or previous) private or federal compensation \n     systems. In short, it is difficult to predict how the \n     legislation might operate over 50 years until the \n     administrative structure is established and its operations \n     can be studied.\n       One area in which the potential costs are particularly \n     uncertain is the number of applicants who will present \n     evidence sufficient to obtain a compensation award for \n     nonmalignant injuries. CBO estimates that about 15 percent of \n     individuals with nonmalignant medical conditions due to \n     asbestos exposure would qualify for awards under the medical \n     criteria and administrative procedures specified in the \n     legislation. The remaining 85 percent of such individuals \n     would receive payments from the fund to monitor their future \n     medical condition. If that projection were too high or too \n     low by only 5 percentage points, the lifetime cost to the \n     Asbestos Fund could change by $10 billion. Small changes in \n     other assumptions--including such routine variables as the \n     future inflation rate--could also have a significant impact \n     on long-term costs.\n     Intergovernmental and private-sector mandates\n       S. 2290 would impose an intergovernmental mandate that \n     would preempt state laws relating to asbestos claims and \n     prevent state courts from ruling on those cases. In addition, \n     the bill contains private-sector mandates that would:\n       Prohibit individuals from bringing or maintaining a civil \n     action alleging injury due to asbestos exposure;\n       Require defendant companies and certain insurance companies \n     to pay annual assessments to the Asbestos Fund;\n       Require asbestos settlement trusts to transfer their assets \n     to the Asbestos Fund;\n       Prohibit persons from manufacturing, processing, or \n     distributing in commerce certain products containing \n     asbestos; and\n       Prohibit certain health insurers from denying or \n     terminating coverage or altering any terms of coverage of a \n     claimant or beneficiary on account of participating in the \n     bill's medical monitoring program or as a result of \n     information discovered through such medical monitoring.\n       S. 2290 contains one provision that would be both an \n     intergovernmental and private-sector mandate as defined in \n     UMRA. That provision would provide the fund's administrator \n     with the power to subpoena testimony and evidence, which is \n     an enforceable duty.\n       CBO estimates that the aggregate direct cost of complying \n     with the intergovernmental mandates in S. 2290 would be small \n     and would fall well below the annual threshold ($60 million \n     in 2004, adjusted annually for inflation) established in \n     UMRA. CBO also estimates that the aggregate direct cost of \n     complying with the private sector mandates in S. 2290 would \n     well exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA ($120 \n     million in 2004 for the private sector, adjusted annually for \n     inflation) during each of the first five years those mandates \n     would be in effect.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.

Under the previous order, each of the \nfollowing Senators control 30 minutes: Senators Kyl, Hatch, Leahy, and \nFeinstein.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Following the use or yielding back of the time, the Chair \njust announced we will vote on this measure; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 8 years ago the Senator from Arizona \nasked me if I would join with him in a pursuit to give victims basic \nrights under the Constitution of the United States. It was something I \nknew a little bit about and I was delighted to do it. What I didn't \nknow a lot about was the drafting of a constitutional amendment and how \ndifficult it was. The next 8 years actually proved to be one of the \nmost rewarding times of my Senate experience.\n  First, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his collegiality, for the \nease with which we have been able to work together, and for his \nleadership on this issue, which has been absolutely 100 percent \nunrelenting.\n  In a time of increasing partisan separation in this body, the \nfriendship, the collegiality, and the leadership has been so \nappreciated by me. It has been one of the bright spots in my Senate \ncareer. I want him to know how much I appreciate it.\n  I also thank victims, about 30 or 40 of whom are present in the \ngallery. These are victims who have had terrible things happen to them, \nbut rather than sink back into the depths of despair, have decided they \nwould fight for something so that anyone who had similar things happen \nto them could have a part in the criminal justice system. Particularly, \nI would like to acknowledge a few of those victims.\n  The first is Colleen Campbell. Colleen Campbell has lost two members \nof her family as a product of murder. Senator Kyl, in his remarks, will \nmake that clear. She has become an ardent supporter of our efforts, and \na small pin that Senator Kyl and I are wearing today is the pin which \nrepresents a group called ``Force 100.'' These are victims who have \nbeen asking Congress to take this action. The pin depicts an angel \nholding a checkered flag. Her brother, Mickey Thompson, who was \nmurdered, was a race car driver, and therefore the checkered flag. Her \nson, Scott Campbell, was also murdered. Colleen, a brilliant leader and \na wonderful woman, has lost two members of her family--her son and her \nbrother--to murder.\n  The other was Roberta Roper. Roberta is one of the first people I \nmet. She hails from Maryland. Again, Senator Kyl will say more about \nthe circumstances of that crime.\n  The third is Steve Twist, who has represented the victims with \nintegrity and steadfastness over these past 8 years, to try to get for \nthem as much as could be possible in the recognition of their rights.\n  Essentially, bottom line, what we have found after numerous Judiciary \nCommittee subcommittee hearings, committee hearings, markups, putting \nthe victims' rights constitutional amendment out on the Senate floor in \na prior session, taking it down because we didn't have the votes, \nbeginning anew in this session, going through the processes in \ncommittee, and recognizing that we didn't have the 67 votes necessary \nfor a constitutional amendment--both Senator Kyl and I, as well as the \nvictims and their advocates, decided that we should compromise. There \nare Members of this body who very much want a statute. There are \nMembers of this body who very much want a constitutional amendment. We \nhave drafted a statute which we believe is broad and encompassing, \nwhich provides enforcement rights for victims, provides funding for the \nDepartment of Justice victims' rights programs, for legal clinics, for \nenforcement to carry out this law federally and also to spread the word \nto local and State jurisdictions to enact similar laws.\n  We basically provide a set of eight rights:\n  The right to be reasonably protected from the accused; the right to \nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of public proceedings so that \nyou know what is happening as well as notice if the accused is released \nor escapes from custody--\n  I can't tell you how many victims who may have testified against \ntheir assailant live in dread of the fact that an assailant will be \nreleased, they won't know it, they won't be able to protect themselves, \nand the assailant will come after them. That is not theory. It has \nhappened over and over again. There are cases of that, with which I am \nintimately, unfortunately, knowledgeable--\n  The right to be present at public proceedings, not to be barred from \na court hearing, not to be barred by a public proceeding involving a \nplea agreement;\n  The right to be reasonably heard at critical steps in the process, \nthose involving release, plea, or sentencing; the right to confer with \nthe prosecutor;\n  The right to full and timely restitution, as provided by law;\n  The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay;\n  And the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the \nvictim's dignity and privacy.\n  At one time the system of criminal justice in the United States of \nAmerica provided these rights. Victims had rights until about the mid-\n19th century, the 1850s, when the concept of the public prosecutor was \ndeveloped in our Nation. Up to that time, victims brought cases. \nVictims hired lawyers. Victims even hired sheriffs to prosecute cases. \nThat changed in the mid-19th century, and in that change the victim \nbecame left out of the process.\n  Nowhere was the need for this legislation made more clear than during \nthe trials over the Oklahoma City bombing.\n  Because we got involved, the Senate and the House, because victims \nwere not being given the rights afforded to them by prior legislation, \nvictims then went to a district court of appeals and victims were then \nsubsequently still told that they had no standing.\n  A brief account of the trial in the Oklahoma City bombing case \nillustrates this point:\n  During pre-trial conference in the case against Timothy McVeigh, the \nDistrict Court issued a ruling to preclude any victim who wished to \nprovide victim impact testimony at sentencing from observing any \nproceeding in the case.\n  In a hearing to reconsider the issue of excluding victim witnesses, \nthe trial court denied the victims' motion asserting standing to \npresent their claims and denied the motion for reconsideration.\n  Three months later in February 1997, the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, rejected, without oral argument, the victims' claims on \njurisdictional grounds finding they had no ``legally protected \ninterest'' to be present at the trial and had suffered no ``injury in \nfact.''\n  Congress reacted the next month by overwhelmingly passing the \nVictims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997, which provided that watching \na trial does not constitute grounds for denying the chance to provide a \nvictim impact statement at sentencing. President Clinton signed the \nbill into law on March 20, 1997.\n  When the victims filed a motion with the District Court seeking a \nhearing to assert their rights under the new law, the District Court \nconcluded ``any motions raising constitutional questions about this \nlegislation would be premature and would present issues that are not \nnow ripe for decision.''\n  The court then entered a new order on victim-impact witness \nsequestration, and refused to grant the victims a hearing on the \napplication of the new law, stating that its ruling rendered the \nrequest ``moot.''\n  I believe the result would be different if the bill we are \nconsidering today was law then. The victims and the families would have \nhad standing, and would have been able to avail themselves of the \nmandamus proceeding to get a timely ruling on the merits from the Court \nof Appeals. Perhaps that would not have been necessary--the District \nCourt judge, armed with the standing provision of this bill, perhaps \nwould have reached a different result during the trial.\n  We have written a bill that we believe is broad. We have written a \nbill that provides an enforcement remedy; namely, the writ of mandamus.\n  This part of the bill is what makes this legislation so important, \nand different from earlier legislation: It provides mechanisms to \nenforce the set of rights provided to victims of crime.\n  These mechanisms fall into four categories:\n  A direction to our courts that they ``shall ensure that the crime \nvictim is afforded the rights described in the law.''\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\n  A direction to the Attorney General of the United States to take \nsteps to ensure that our Federal prosecutors ``make their best \nefforts'' to see that crime victims are aware of, and can exercise \nthese rights.\n  A specific statement that the victim of a crime, or their \nrepresentative, may assert these rights; the result is that, for the \nfirst time victims will have clear standing to ask our courts to \nenforce their rights.\n  And a new use of a very old procedure, the writ of mandamus. This \nprovision will establish a procedure where a crime victim can, in \nessence, immediately appeal a denial of their rights by a trial court \nto the court of appeals, which must rule ``forthwith.'' Simply put, the \nmandamus procedure allows an appellate court to take timely action to \nensure that the trial court follows the rule of law set out in this \nstatute.\n\n  These procedures, taken together, will ensure that the rights defined \nin the first section are not simply words on paper, but are meaningful \nand functional.\n  The bill also has two separate resource provisions, which together \nwill authorize the appropriation of $76 million over the next five \nyears to ensure that the federal government assist crime victims in \nasserting these rights, and to encourage states to do the same: The \nbill authorizes a total of $51 million over five years for crime victim \nassistance grants administered by the Department of Justice to \nestablish and maintain legal assistance programs throughout the nation.\n  These institutions are key to the success of this legislation, for \nthis is how victims' rights will be really asserted and defended--by \nlawyers, standing up in court, and explaining to judges and prosecutors \nwhat the law means, and how it applies in the case at hand. Rights and \nremedies need articulation to work, and this money will help make that \nhappen.\n  These grants, championed by my colleague Senator Leahy, provide a \ntotal of $25 million over five years for a specific, and critical, \npurpose: to ``develop and implement'' the type of notification systems \nthat take full advantage of modern technology.\n  Computers, linked to sophisticated telephone or automatic mailing \nsystems, can help us ensure that the right to notice, set out in the \nfirst section of this bill, is not simply abstract, but is made real by \na notification system that can provide ``accurate, and timely'' notice \nto victims' of crime and their families.\n  This act, of course, binds only the federal system, but is designed \nto affect the states also. First it is hoped that states will look to \nthis law as a model and incorporate it into their own systems. This law \nencourages that by allowing both types of grants--legal assistance and \nvictim notification--to be provided to state entities, and for use in \nstate systems, where the state has in place ``laws substantially \nequivalent'' to this act.\n  Never before have these three critical components, rights, remedies \nand resources, been brought together. It has been said ``a right \nwithout a remedy is no right at all,'' and this law would couple \nvictims' rights with victims' remedies in a way that has never been \ndone before in the federal system. I believe that taken together we \nhave a formula for success, and this law will work, and hopefully \nbecome the model for our States.\n  So why is the law needed?\n  Senator Kyl and I have been working on this issue for the past 8 \nyears. We offer this legislation because the scales of justice are out \nof balance--while criminal defendants have an array of rights under \nlaw, crime victims have few meaningful rights.\n  In case after case we found victims, and their families, were \nignored, cast aside, and treated as non-participants in a critical \nevent in their lives. They were kept in the dark by prosecutors to busy \nto care enough, by judges focused on defendant's rights, and by a court \nsystem that simply did not have a place for them.\n  The result was terrible--often the experience of the criminal justice \nsystem left crime victims and their families victimized yet again.\n  Let me be clear. I am not talking about the necessary emotional and \npsychological difficulties which are almost inevitable in our adversary \nsystem. Cross examination can be hard. The legal system sometimes must \nseem complex and irrational to those who do not work in it. Sometimes \njudges and juries make decisions that victims of crime do not like. But \nthat is not the problem that this law addresses.\n  That problem is one of process and fairness. The rights I have spoken \nabout are basic, and do not come at the expense of defendant's rights.\n  Boiled down, they involve the simple right to know what is going on, \nto participate in the process where the information that victim's and \ntheir families can provide may be material and relevant, and the right \nto be safe from violence.\n  I mentioned earlier the dramatic disparity between the rights of \ndefendants in our constitution and laws, and the rights of crime \nvictims and their families. My point is to illustrate that our \ngovernment, and our criminal justice system, can and should care about \nboth the rights of accused and the rights of victims. That is what this \nlaw addresses.\n\n  Some have said that current law is adequate. For instance, the Victim \nof Crime Act of 1984 sets out rights for victims--in fact the bill \nbefore us restates many of those rights. But prior laws did not have \nthe critical combination of rights and remedies that we now offer.\n  In fact, a number of victims' rights laws have been passed:\n  1982, the Victim and Witness Protection Act, mentioned before, which \nprovided for victim restitution and the use of victim impact statements \nat sentencing in federal cases;\n  1984, the Victims of Crime Act, which encouraged the States to \nmaintain programs that serve victims of crime, and established a Crime \nVictims' Fund, which now matches up to 60 percent of the money paid by \nStates for victim compensation awards;\n  1990, the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act, which increased \nfunding for victim compensation and assistance, and codified a victims' \nBill of Rights in the federal justice system;\n  1994, the Violence Against Women Act, which authorized over $1.6 \nbillion over six years to assist victims of violence and prevent \nviolence against women and children;\n  1996, the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which required courts to \norder restitution when sentencing defendants for certain offenses;\n  1996, the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, which appropriated \nfunds to assist and compensate victims of terrorism and mass violence;\n  And 1997, the Victim Rights Clarification Act, which reversed a \npresumption against crime victims observing any part of the trial \nproceedings if they were likely to testify during the sentencing \nhearing, an issue which developed during the Oklahoma City bombing \ncase. Specifically, this legislation prohibited courts from (1) \nexcluding a victim from the trial on the ground that he or she might be \ncalled to provide a victim impact statement at sentencing, and (2) \nexcluding a victim impact statement on the ground that the victim had \nobserved the trial.\n  All of these laws represent a step in the right direction. But they \nare not enough. They don't really work to protect victims' many had \nhoped. Why is this? I believe it because they fail to provide an \neffective procedure for victims to assert standing and vindicate their \nrights. The bill before us builds on these earlier attempts, and goes \none very important step farther--linking rights to remedies, and, I \nhope, fixing the problem with these earlier laws.\n  Some have asked--why proceed with a statute, rather than a \nConsitutional amendment? Why a law and not a constitutional amendment?\n  Senator Kyl and I have been working for many years towards a \nconstitutional amendment to establish these rights. I have always \nbelieved that amending the Constitution is the best way to ensure \nvictims' rights are protected in the criminal justice process. But many \nhave disagreed, arguing that we should try, once again, a legislative \napproach.\n  It is clear to me that passage of a Constitutional amendment is \nimpossible at this time. If we tried, and failed, it could be years \nbefore we could try again. Victims of crime have waited years for \nprogress, and a compromise approach, resulting in the bill now under \nconsideration, will result in meaningful progress.\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\n  Will it work? I hope so. The bill before us is a new and bolder \napproach, than has ever been tried before in our Federal system.\n  The standing provision, coupled with the mandamus provision, may have \nthe desired effect. This will be a test, and I, for one, will be \nwatching it closely.\n  I think for both Senator Kyl, and now for Senator Hatch, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Leahy, \nthe distinguished ranking member, who join us as major cosponsors of \nthis bill, that we will follow this bill carefully and we will see \nwhether the enforcement rights contained in this bill are adequate. If \nnot, you can be sure as the Sun will rise tomorrow, we will be back \nwith a constitutional amendment.\n  This bill is named after some of the victims. Both Senator Kyl and I \nbriefly want to state the story of the victims after whom the bill is \nnamed. I would like to tell the Senate a little bit about Louarna \nGillis, who was 22 years old when she was slain on January 17, 1979, as \npart of a gang initiation. Her murderer wanted to enter the world of \nnarcotics as part of the Mexican Mafia and was told the quickest way to \ndo so was to murder the daughter of a Los Angeles Police Department \nofficer. Can you believe it? It is true.\n  Louarna Gillis was targeted by the killer. He knew her in high \nschool. That was the reason he targeted her. The murderer picked her up \na few blocks from her home, drove her to an alley in East Los Angeles \nwhere he shot her in the head as she sat in the car. He pushed her into \nthe alley and fired additional shots into her back.\n  Louarna's murderer was apprehended 6 months later. He had a long \nhistory of violence, including felony convictions.\n  Louarna's family was not notified of the arraignment, nor were they \nnotified of other critical proceedings in this case. Her family's \nrights were largely ignored. The first trial resulted in a hung jury, \n11 for first-degree murder, 1 not guilty. Louarna's father, John \nGillis, was not allowed in the courtroom.\n  At the second trial, the murderer pled guilty to second-degree murder \nto avoid the death penalty. He was sentenced to 17 years to life. \nParole for Louarna's murderer has successfully been blocked by her \nfamily to this day. He will be eligible for parole again in the next 6 \nto 8 months. Louarna's father, a former homicide detective with LAPD, \nhad just left an intelligence assignment working against street gangs \nand the Mexican Mafia at the time of her murder. Can you imagine?\n  Mr. Gillis was later appointed by President George W. Bush as the \nDirector of the Justice Department's Office for Victims of Crime. He \ntestified before Congress on July 17, 2002. I said:\n\n       I know firsthand the personal, financial, and emotional \n     devastation that violent crime exacts on its victims. As a \n     survivor of a homicide victim, I testify . . . with the \n     unique advantage of understanding the plight that victims and \n     their families face in the criminal justice system . . . When \n     a person is victimized by crime, he or she is thrust into a \n     whole new world in which the State's or the government's \n     needs take priority.\n       This is the most devastating time in a person's life, when \n     they have lost a loved one to homicide or violent crime; they \n     need protection.\n       They need to let the court know how this crime has impacted \n     their lives, because it will have a long-lasting, traumatic \n     impact in their lives. It's important that they have the \n     opportunity to say something to defend their loved one.\n\n  This terrible story took place in my home State of California. This \nbill will help fathers like Mr. Gillis: he would be notified of key \nproceedings, and be able to participate in a meaningful way.\n  I would like to tell you about Nila Ruth Lynn. Here is her picture. \nShe was 69 years old. She was murdered at a homeowners association \nmeeting on April 19, 2000, when an angry man stormed into the meeting \nand announced: ``I'm going to kill you.''\n  He was unhappy with the way the association had trimmed the bushes in \nhis yard the previous month. Nila and another woman were killed and \nseveral other men were injured during the rampage. She died on the \nfloor in the arms of her husband Duane. They had been married 49 years \nand 9 months. Nila left behind Duane and six children. The money the \nchildren had been saving for a 50th wedding anniversary gift was \ninstead used to pay for her casket.\n  Duane Lynn suffered through long delays and continuances in this \ncase. Despite clear State constitutional and statutory rights, Duane \nwas not allowed to make a sentencing recommendation for his wife's \nmurderer. Nila's killer was sentenced to death. Duane wanted the \ndefendant to be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility \nof parole, rather than deal with the continuing appeals involving the \ndeath sentence.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has denied its petition for a review of the \nArizona Supreme Court's refusal to protect the right. He testified \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 8. Here is what he said:\n\n       We, as a family of the victim, which was my wife, my love, \n     the person I still expect to walk through my front door every \n     day--she was a real person, not just a name and a number on a \n     document. We could say nothing about the consequences of that \n     man who took all this away from me. You have no idea what \n     this feels like. The evil done by a murderer inflicts \n     tragedy, and that is bad enough. But injuries inflicted by \n     our legal system are even harder to take. I felt kicked \n     around and ignored by the very system the government has in \n     place to protect law-abiding citizens.\n\n  This is not the way criminal justice should be practiced in the \nUnited States of America. The time has come to give victims of crime \nthe right to participate in the system, the right to notice of a public \nhearing, the right to be present at that public proceeding, the right \nto make a statement when appropriate, the right to have restitution, if \nordered by a judge, the right to know when your assailant or attacker \nis released from prison, and the right to be treated by our prosecutors \nand by our criminal justice system with respect and dignity. That is \nnot too much for the Congress of the United States to strive \nenergetically to achieve for the 22 million victims in this country.\n  It is with great pleasure that over the years I have worked with \nSenator Kyl to achieve this. Once again, I cannot thank him too much.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the remainder of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, it isn't always possible for us to schedule \nmatters in the Senate in a convenient way. I am aware Senator Feinstein \nmust leave to attend another meeting. It is my hope she will able to be \nhere before we vote.\n  While she is still here, I must say I share her sentiment that some \nof the most gratifying work I have done in the Senate has been my work \nwith Senator Feinstein and her good staff in putting together a \nconstitutional amendment and working hard to try to get it passed and \npreparing for the hearings--speaking with the victims, meeting with the \nJustice Department--literally hundreds of hours of time we have spent \ntogether working on this issue. It has helped to foster a bond of trust \nand friendship between us that I think could be used as a template for \nour colleagues in this body to work together in a bipartisan way.\n  I can never thank Senator Feinstein enough for her work on this \namendment. I know the many victims who are here in the gallery share \nthat sentiment.\n  This legislation would not be before us today without Senator \nFeinstein. That is simply a fact. For all of the hard work we have put \nin with her cooperation and her commitment to this, I thank Senator \nFeinstein deeply. She knows that bond of trust will continue to exist \nbetween us.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator. I do appreciate \nthose words. They mean a great deal to me.\n  If I might, I ask unanimous consent to add the Senator from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski, as a cosponsor of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to retain the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nNickles and Inhofe be added as original cosponsors of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I join Senator Feinstein in supporting S. \n2329, which is the statutory version of the constitutional amendment we \nhave prepared and about which Senator Feinstein has spoken.\n  The legislation, as I will describe in a moment, will attempt to \naccomplish as much as possible the same goals the constitutional \namendment which has been pending before us would have accomplished.\n  But before I discuss the details of that, there are several people I \nwould like to thank. In addition to Senator Feinstein--again it is \nimpossible to express my appreciation enough for all of the hard work \nshe put into this effort. We simply couldn't be here, because in order \nto get things passed in the Senate it is critical there be a bipartisan \nconsensus, especially so for something that requires a supermajority. \nWithout Democrats and Republicans working together, we would have never \ngotten to this point. Certainly Senator Feinstein was largely \nresponsible for the work on the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  I appreciate all of my colleagues' understanding and support on this \nas well.\n  Senator Frist, who is willing to trust us in scheduling this for time \non the floor--and there is very little time to take up matters, as the \nPresiding Officer knows--understood this was a very important \ncommitment we had made to the victims of crime. During Crime Victims' \nRights Month was the time to try to accomplish this. I appreciate his \nsupport.\n  I appreciate the support of Senator Hatch who throughout the years \nhas never stood in the way but always lent us a hand in setting up a \nhearing and getting a time and a room for markup on the constitutional \namendment and supporting its passage.\n  Again, it is not easy to get a constitutional amendment through even \nthe Judiciary Committee, let alone to get it adopted. But Senator Hatch \nwas supportive of that effort. I very much appreciate his cosponsorship \nof the statutory version of this amendment, as well as the support of \nSenator Leahy.\n  I think I would be remiss if I didn't make the point that the first \ncosponsors of this legislation were Senator Feinstein, myself, and \nSenators Hatch and Leahy, chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Obviously this legislation has very strong support. We anticipate it \nwill pass overwhelmingly and will be quickly sent to the House for \naction there, and hopefully to the President, who I am confident will \nbe supportive of it and will sign it.\n  Let me at this point thank some of the victims' rights organizations. \nAgain, they were responsible for bringing the issue to our attention \nand for providing a lot of the information we needed to be able to make \nthe cases and for, frankly, the moral support to keep going. When \nSenator Feinstein and I would get discouraged, after meeting with \nvictims' rights groups we were no longer discouraged; we were even more \ncommitted to pursue this head on. Some of them are headed by remarkable \npeople. There is a whole page of groups I will thank.\n  Specifically, I thank Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the National \nOrganization for Victim Assistance, Parents of Murdered Children, and \nForce 100, and especially Colleen Campbell for her leadership of Force \n100. Senator Feinstein has already spoken of Colleen Campbell, and this \npin in memory of Mickey Thompson speaks volumes about her leadership of \nthis effort.\n  The fact this is Crime Victims' Rights Month and week I think is \nimportant. President Reagan actually had the first recognition of crime \nvictims in a week that was designated for that purpose.\n  I think it is important at this time we especially recognize the \nvictims of crime all over America; that with this year's memorial of \nvictims' rights, America's values will be vindicated to some extent \nwith the passage of this legislation.\n  It is especially poignant we would be waiting at this time to \nrecognize these rights of victims of crime. Indeed, it is right to take \nup this issue. The right to fairness for crime victims and the right to \nnotice and presence and participation are deeply rooted concepts in the \nUnited States of America. This country is all about fair play and \ngiving power to the powerless in our society. It is about recognizing \nthe values of liberty of the individuals against encroachments of the \nGovernment.\n  Fair play for crime victims, meaningful participation of crime \nvictims in the justice system, protection against a government that \nwould take from a crime victim the dignity of due process--these are \nconsistent with the most basic values of due process in our society.\n  I was involved in Arizona issues for victims of crime even before I \never ran for the U.S. House of Representatives, so this was to some \nextent a cause for me before I became a public official. It was after I \nbecame a public official and people really came to me with these \nstories that I realized I had an opportunity to do more than the things \nI had done before. I have come to see the need for these protections as \ncritical for our country.\n  While engaged in all of the other important activities, at bottom, it \nis a country about individuals who have inherent rights recognized and \ngiven to us by God. That is the basis for the creation of this country. \nHuman dignity and the right that all people are made in God's image is \nsuch an important part of the foundation of our country that we would \nbe remiss if we did not recognize that concept, that value, especially \nfor those who have been victimized in our society because we could not \nas a government provide adequate protection for them.\n  I came to realize in many cases these victims were being victimized a \nsecond time because while we were asking them sometimes to come into \ncourt and testify against the perpetrators of the crime so they could \nbe incarcerated or dealt with in an appropriate way for the further \nprotection of society, we were not helping these victims at all. They \nwere suffering through the trauma of the victimization and then being \nthrown into a system which they did not understand, which nobody was \nhelping them with, and which literally prevented them from \nparticipation in any meaningful way. I came to realize there were \nliterally millions of people out there being denied these basic rights, \nbeing victimized by our criminal justice system.\n  Let me mention two circumstances, but we will discuss all of the \nrights in a moment. The one circumstance that seemed to be the most \nfrequent is: My mother was murdered, my daughter was murdered--whatever \nthe situation--and I could not attend the trial. That is what our \nsystem says today.\n  While there are statutes in States and even some State constitutional \nprovisions that purportedly guarantee a victim will not be denied \naccess to the courtroom, it is still the case today that the victims, \nthe victims' families, cannot even go into the courtroom. The defendant \nis there, the defendant's family is there seated in a reserved row \nseats, but the victim and the victim's family cannot be present. That \nis fundamentally wrong. We are not talking even about them saying \nanything. Obviously, everyone in the courtroom has to behave. The judge \ncan throw anybody out if they do not behave or if they express emotions \nor try to communicate with the jury. That is not the issue.\n\n  They could not attend sometimes because the defendant's lawyer would \nsay: It would be prejudicial to my client if the victims are seen in \nthe courtroom. This was one of the circumstances that I could not \nbelieve our criminal justice system was imposing. It is one of those \nthings that is fixed in this statute.\n  The other circumstance--and there is an especially telling, emotional \ncase in Arizona I became familiar with which induced me to pursue this \nwith all the vigor I could--is the circumstance where a crime has been \ncommitted, the perpetrator has been convicted and is in prison or jail, \nbut unbeknown to the victim and the victim's family, the individual \ngets out of jail. The individual escapes, has some kind of a parole \nhearing or in some other way is able to leave before the sentence is \nup, and the victims are not even notified, let alone given an \nopportunity to appear before that parole board and say: Wait a minute, \nthis person has a 15-year sentence and you are letting him out after 8 \nyears. Let me tell you what he did to me.\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\n  Not to go into detail but to finish that story, in one of the Arizona \ncases with which I am familiar, the woman having been brutally raped \nand slashed and left to die recovered. Her perpetrator was convicted \nand put into prison. He had a parole hearing and the parole board \ndecided to release him prematurely. She got no notice of that. She got \nno opportunity to be present.\n  By not quite coincidence but enormous alertness and compassion on the \npart of an individual in the Governor's office at the time routinely \nreading through the notices of the parole board, a staff person saw \nthis and again almost coincidentally thought, Wait a minute, I don't \nthink that is right under our law. He tracked down this individual who \nhad by then moved to California and asked her if she would like an \nopportunity to appear before another parole board hearing if that could \nbe arranged. She said yes. The parole board agreed to revisit the issue \nin a subsequent hearing and she testified. She told her story. After \nshe told her story, the parole board reversed its opinion.\n  I asked her later: Were you afraid he would come after you if he were \nreleased? She said: No. My victimization was random. I was trying to \nhitchhike. I should never have done it.\n  He--and, by the way, his wife--picked her up and she was then \nbrutalized as I described it. She said: It was random. I don't think he \nwould come after me again. What I was concerned about was knowing the \nnature of the kind of individual that commits this kind of crime, he \nwould do it again to somebody else. I didn't want him to have that \nopportunity to hurt somebody else like he hurt me.\n  That tells you about the motivation of these victims of crime who are \nwilling, despite the hurt that it causes them, to participate in the \ncriminal justice system--not just for themselves because they get \nnothing out of it--because they know what it is like and they want to \nprevent that harm to others.\n  Those are the kind of people whose portraits are behind me and who \nSenator Feinstein was talking about. That is why we are trying to do \nsomething about righting this wrong, about balancing the scales of \njustice. Rightly, defendants in this country are protected better than \nin any country in the world through constitutional amendments that give \nthem rights. We are not trying to take one single right away from any \ndefendant. That would be wrong under our system. But we do think it is \ntime to balance the scales of justice. That was the motivation for \nSenator Feinstein and me.\n  Let me talk about some of these individuals. Senator Feinstein talked \nabout Duane Lynn. Duane is from Arizona. I will not repeat the entire \nstory, but he enjoyed the Navy as a young man. He performed in the \nmilitary. He had a successful career as a highway patrolman upholding \nthe laws of the State of Arizona. He and his wife Nila literally fell \nin love as teenagers and had been married 49 years and 9 months, just 3 \nmonths shy of their 50th anniversary when she was brutally murdered as \nSenator Feinstein talked about. They had left their home to attend this \nhomeowners' meeting and just happened to be in the wrong place at the \nwrong time because the murderer, who was a disgruntled and enraged \nformer resident of the community, burst into the room saying, I am \ngoing to kill you, and he started shooting.\n  As I said, Duane and Nila had been married not quite 50 years when \nshe was brutally murdered. In anticipation of the golden anniversary of \ntheir parents, the Lynn children had secretly been saving money to \nthrow a surprise anniversary party, and that money was used to pay for \nNila's casket.\n  It is at this point that Duane's journey through the legal system \nreally started. As Senator Feinstein recounted, he did not really \nunderstand what it meant to participate in the judicial system at that \ntime but at least understood that he would have some voice in what \nhappened.\n  Under the Arizona law and constitution, he had a right, for example, \nto make a recommendation to the judge when the judge sentenced the \nperpetrator. But despite having that right in the Arizona \nConstitution--and, by the way, Arizona judges are pretty good about \nenforcing these rights--he was denied the right to even appear at the \ntime of sentencing to tell the judge the sentence he thought the \nperpetrator should get.\n  He lost an appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court and a petition for \ncertiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. They all told him his rights were \nunenforceable because for him to speak would violate the defendant's \neighth amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment.\n  Now, that is one of the reasons that Senator Feinstein and I believed \nthat a constitutional amendment was necessary, because as long as the \ndefendant's rights are always asserted as Federal constitutional \nrights, a mere statutory right, such as we are creating today, is going \nto be subservient to that. It will be very difficult for victims to win \nin cases where the defendant's right is asserted under the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Even as a State constitutional right, Duane Lynn was denied the right \nto speak because the court perceived that the Federal eighth amendment \nsuperseded the Arizona State Constitution. So we may still have \nproblems, even with the adoption of a statute here. But Senator \nFeinstein and I are committed to moving the cause forward, to see \nwhether it is possible to make statutes work, so that we do not need a \nFederal constitutional amendment. If, as it turns out, we do, then we \nwill revisit the issue, as she said. Hopefully, we will not need to do \nthat.\n  Just a final I think paradoxical or ironic ending in the Duane Lynn \nmatter. He wanted to speak at the time of sentencing, not to urge the \ncourt to impose the death sentence but to impose life without parole. \nThat recommendation was denied because, as I said, the court held that \nthe defendant's rights outweighed his rights.\n  Let me talk about some of the other victims. I just briefly want to \nmention Louarna Gillis, because John Gillis, her father, who was a Los \nAngeles police officer at the time, is now a very important person in \nour Government in protecting victims' rights because he heads up the \nOffice for Victims of Crime in the Department of Justice.\n  One of the reasons the Attorney General and the President wanted him \nin that position is because he felt firsthand the sting of being a \ncrime victim when his daughter was killed, picked out at random by a \ngang member because the gang member, to be initiated in the gang, had \nto kill the child of a cop. She just happened to be a child of a cop \nand she was killed.\n  John could not be here today, but his wife Patsy is in attendance. I \ncommend her for her support of this effort as well.\n  Their family has suffered further tragedy in the very recent death of \ntheir only other child, their son John. So it reminds us that it is \nimportant not only for people to have rights as victims of crime, but \nto recognize that these very people are the people who are willing to \ntake up the cause here to right this injustice.\n\n  By John Gillis' efforts, he literally became the person in charge of \nthis issue in our Government. He is doing an incredibly great job. Part \nof this legislation is to give him some additional responsibility and a \nlittle bit more in the way of resources to see to it that our Federal \nGovernment, through the Department of Justice, the Attorney General, \nand the Office for Victims of Crime, can continue to support the effort \nof crime victims. I applaud John Gillis very much and appreciate his \nwife Patsy being with us today.\n  Let me mention three other people, because this legislation is named \nfor five people--the two I mentioned and then the other three I will \nmention. Let me discuss each of them.\n  Roberta Roper is also in attendance. There is nobody who has pursued \nthe cause for victims' rights more strongly than Roberta Roper. She has \nmade numerous trips to Washington. She has testified before the \nJudiciary Committee in support of the constitutional amendment. She has \ngiven us incredible advice and strength. What she did, after her \nvictimization, when her daughter Stephanie was murdered at the age of \n22, was to start a foundation in her daughter's name, and that \nStephanie Roper Foundation has been a tremendous asset in pursuing the \ncause of victims around the country.\n\n[[Page S4266]]\n\n  Her daughter, on April 3, 1982, was kidnapped and raped, tortured and \ndismembered by two men. The killers had just come upon her when \nStephanie's car had been disabled. They had kidnapped her and over a \nperiod of 5 hours had repeatedly tortured her. She tried to escape but \nwas caught and killed in a most brutal manner.\n  Her parents were not even notified of the many continuances that were \ngranted in this case. They were excluded from the courtroom for the \nentire first trial that occurred. They could not even go into the \ncourtroom. In 1982, the defense convinced the court that the victims \nwould be emotional, irrelevant, and probable cause for a reversal of an \nappeal. The court agreed and, therefore, denied Vince and Roberta Roper \nthe right to be a voice for their daughter.\n  That is one of the things that will be corrected by this legislation. \nWe hope a statutory correction will serve to be sufficient.\n  Roberta Roper is in attendance, and I thank her from the bottom of my \nheart. She and Collene Campbell--who I will mention next--have been two \nof the real troopers in this battle.\n  I also want to say, with regard to Collene Campbell, when Senator \nFeinstein discussed the death of her son Scott, it is unfortunately the \ncase in many of these situations that more than once people are \nvictimized. Collene and Gary Campbell have been victimized twice. \nCollene's brother was killed as well and that has been discussed as \nwell.\n  One of the killers of their son Scott was released from prison. By \nthe way, the circumstances of Scott's murder were especially gruesome. \nHe met an individual who was going to fly him to North Dakota, and \nsomewhere between Los Angeles and Catalina Island, Scott Campbell was \nkilled. His body was literally thrown out of the airplane into the \nocean and has never been located.\n  His parents were not permitted to enter the courtroom during the \ntrials for the men who murdered their son. They were not even notified \nof a district court of appeals hearing. When one of the killers was \nreleased, as I said, the Campbell family was not notified. They only \nlearned of the developments through the newspaper.\n  You can argue that a defendant might be prejudiced in certain \nsituations by victims having certain rights, but to treat victims this \nway is not to treat them with the fairness and dignity any American \ndeserves under our values as a nation. Even when these rights exist in \nstatute, when they are not observed, it is time for the Congress to \nact. That is why we act here, so that no one else will have to suffer \nthrough this kind of unfair treatment.\n  Scott Campbell is shown in this picture. I mentioned Nila Lynn \nbefore, as shown in this picture. Roberta Roper's daughter Stephanie is \nthis beautiful young lady shown in this picture right here. As I said, \nher mother is with us today.\n  I would also like to mention Robert Preston. In the case of Bob \nPreston's 22-year-old daughter, Wendy--the beautiful young lady shown \nin this picture right here--she was murdered in his home on June 23, \n1977. She was killed when a man broke into the home to steal money to \nbuy drugs. Her body was found 6 days later. Wendy's murderer was \narrested and charged with first-degree murder. Her parents were told \nthat the State of Florida was the victim in the case and they would be \nnotified if and when they were called as witnesses. That was it.\n  After nearly 6 years, the murderer was allowed to plead to a second-\ndegree murder charge, and he was sentenced to life in prison. In 1987, \nthe Florida Supreme Court overturned the killer's conviction, and in \nthe decision also held that the victims had no rights. This is the kind \nof example that needs to be brought to light so Americans can \nappreciate that it is time for Congress to act.\n  This is Wendy Preston, yet another example of victims being treated \nunfairly.\n  There are a lot of other cases we could talk about. Wendy Preston and \nStephanie Roper, Scott Campbell, Mickey Thompson, Nila Lynn, and \nLouarna Gillis are the best of America. We owe them our best. Our best \nis to ensure the families of future victims will not suffer through the \nsame indignity their families have had to endure.\n  That is why Senator Feinstein and I began the effort to try to \npersuade our colleagues a constitutional amendment was necessary to \nprotect these rights, because the defendant's right was always \nconstitutional. Unless we had an equal constitutional right, there was \nno chance in a conflict the court would ever afford the victim an equal \nright. That is why we still have reservations about a statutory remedy.\n  But a lot of our colleagues have said, try a statutory remedy and \nlet's see if by bringing these situations to light, by providing \nincentives for States to follow the Federal example, by embodying these \nsame rights that were in the constitutional proposal in a statute and \ngiving the victims a right to sue, a remedy, a mandamus remedy, let's \nsee if that can work.\n  After 8 years of work on the Federal constitutional amendment, \nsupported by President Bush and the Attorney General, we were able to \nschedule, after we passed the bill through the Judiciary Committee, \nthat constitutional amendment for floor action today. Knowing we would \nnot have the 67 votes to pass it, we decided it was time to get \nsomething tangible in statute to protect the rights of victims, and \naccompanying it could be a modest appropriation of money to help \nactually support these victims in court when that was necessary and \ncalled for. We believed despite the potential that it would not serve \nadequately, it was time to try something, to be successful, and to at \nleast move the ball forward.\n  As Senator Leahy said in a press conference we had earlier: The \nJudiciary Committee of the Senate will provide very strong oversight of \nimplementation of this statute so we will know if it is not working. If \nit does not work, we will be able to come back and pursue the \nconstitutional remedy. But we consulted with the victims' rights groups \nthat have been most active in support of this. They concurred it was \ntime to pursue the statutory remedy, if we could get some assurance we \nwould be successful in that pursuit and that it would not be simply a \nfool's errand.\n  Through the significant help of an individual who I am sure all would \nacknowledge has been the national leader of this effort, Steve Twist, a \nlawyer from Phoenix, AZ, communicating with the various victims' rights \ngroups, the consensus was reached it was time for us to convert the \nconstitutional proposal into a statute. This occurred within the last \n48 hours. Through the cooperation of Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, \nstaff, and several other Senators, but most importantly because of the \nvery hard work done by Senator Feinstein's staff and mine, they were \nable to literally convert these rights in the constitutional proposal \ninto the statutory proposal for submission. That is what is before us \ntoday and what we will be voting on.\n  These are the rights that are set forth in the new statute: That the \nvictim would be reasonably protected from the accused; afforded \nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public proceedings \ninvolving the crime or any release or escape of the accused; included \nin public proceedings; ensured proceedings are free from unreasonable \ndelay; that they could confer with the attorney for the government in \nthe case; that they would be given a voice to be heard at any public \nproceeding involving release or plea or sentencing.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to take time from the time under the control \nof Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I noted in a rather inaccurate Washington Post editorial of \nyesterday that somehow victims would have a right to speak to the jury. \nThat is what the Washington Post thought. They were very wrong, as they \nwere in other comments in the editorial. There is nothing in here about \nanything like that. It is only during the time of a release, like the \nparole hearing I talked about earlier, or sentencing or pleading there \nwould be an opportunity to speak.\n  They would have a right to full and timely restitution in appropriate \ncases, and the right to be treated fairly, with respect for their \ndignity and privacy. Most importantly, they would be granted the right \nto enforce these rights. They would have legal standing to enforce \ntheir rights in court with the appropriate writ procedure to be able to \ntake the court's decision to the higher court. That is one of the \nproblems with existing Federal law which\n\n[[Page S4267]]\n\nthe Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals noted did not grant the victims the \nstanding to sue. So that had to be corrected here.\n  Finally, we authorized an appropriation of funds to assure the proper \noversight of these rights is exercised, that moneys would be made \navailable to enhance the victim notification system, managed by the \nDepartment of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime, and the resources \nadditionally to develop state-of-the-art systems for notifying crime \nvictims of important states of development.\n  To pursue that a moment, all courts notify attorneys for the \ndefendant, the prosecutor's office, and it is a relatively simple \nmatter to add another name and telephone number or address to that \nlist. That is what we are talking about here. It is now being done \nelectronically. It is very easy. So the notice to victims of crime is \nnot something that should be seen as an impediment.\n  I would like to conclude by thanking some people. Since I know \nSenator Feinstein did have to attend another meeting, let me thank some \nfolks. Before I do that, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Lott \nand Nickles as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. As soon as Senator Leahy is here, I will relinquish the \nfloor to him.\n  I do want to thank President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft; the \nOffice for Victims of Crime Director John Gillis and the administration \nfor their help; Colleen Campbell and her husband Gary; Roberta Roper; \nBob Preston; Duane Lynn; Earlene Eason from Indiana, whose son \nChristopher was murdered; Sally Goelzer from Arizona, whose brother was \nmurdered; Myssey Hartley from Arkansas, whose brother was murdered; Dee \nEngles, also from Arkansas, a family member murdered; the National \nOrganization for Victim Assistance, especially Beth Rossman, president, \nMarlene Young, executive director, and John Stein, deputy director, who \nhas been a tremendous help; the National Organization of Parents of \nMurdered Children, Nancy Ruhe-Munch, executive director; Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving, Wendy Hamilton, president, and Stephanie \nManning; Professor Douglas Beloof, director of the National Crime \nVictim Law Institute, one of the entities integral to ensuring these \nrights are enforced--he has done a tremendous job in Oregon in setting \nup the programs and the lawyers who can defend victims' rights--\nAttorney Meg Garvin, lead staff attorney at NCVLI; Attorney General \nJane Brady and the National Association of Attorneys General--this has \nbeen a bipartisan effort and almost every attorney general in the \ncountry has signed on; the National District Attorneys Association; the \nFraternal Order of Police, strongly in support of what we are doing; \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police; the National \nRestaurant Association; U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Maricopa County \nattorney Rick Romely and county attorney Barbara LaWall in Arizona, who \nhave helped me a lot in this effort; District Attorney Josh Marquis; \nthe Arizona Voice for Crime Victims.\n\n  On Senator Hatch's staff, I thank Grace Becker, and on Senator \nCornyn's staff, Jim Ho. On Senator Feinstein's staff, I can't thank \nenough Steve Cash and David Hantman who have been tremendously helpful \nin providing great advice and counsel, particularly in the last 3 or 4 \ndays, helping us to convert the amendment to a statutory provision and \nin working on the Democratic side to make this a truly bipartisan \nprocess.\n  Without their assistance, we would not have the statute before the \nbody either.\n  I have a couple legal interns, Tom Stack and Kevin Wilson, who \nprovided tremendous help to me, and finally I wish to thank my chief \nperson on my staff, Stephen Higgins and I mentioned Steve Twist.\n  All of these organizations and individuals have been of tremendous \nhelp in getting to this point and ensuring we will be able to get this \nstatutory provision passed and sent over to the House for action.\n  Madam President, I am going to conclude with a couple of points. As \nsoon as Senator Leahy arrives, I am going to relinquish the floor to \nhim because Senator Feinstein has the remainder of the time, and I \nadvise colleagues, if anyone wishes to speak, they should do so right \naway because I suspect at the conclusion of Senator Leahy's remarks and \nanything Senator Hatch and Senator Feinstein wish to say, we will \nproceed to the final passage vote.\n  The act before us, in addition to setting forth the rights and \nproviding a remedy for the victims of crime, has an authorization of \nfunding. Let me describe that authorization.\n  In the first year, fiscal year 2005, $16.3 million will be available \nto the U.S. Attorney's Victims Witness Office for the Victims of Crime \nOffice in the Department of Justice; $300,000 is for the Office of \nVictims of Crime to administer these new rights; $7 million to the \nOffice of Victims of Crime for the National Crime Victim Law Institute \nto provide grants and assistance to lawyers to help victims of crime in \ncourt. It is the only entity in the country that provides lawyers for \nvictims in criminal cases, and it will provide for two new regional \noffices and nine specific clinics. Finally, borrowing a provision from \na bill Senator Leahy had earlier, there is $5 million for grants to \nStates to develop and implement state-of-the-art victim notification \nsystems.\n  In the following 4 years, there will be each year authorized an \nappropriation of $26.5 million generally to the same entities and \noffices to ensure that these programs are carried out, that victims \nwill have the support they need, and that the notice that is guaranteed \nin the legislation will be provided. Those are the authorizations for \nthe funding. That is a description of the legislation.\n  I will close by again referring to the people who have driven this \neffort, the people who represent the families and who are themselves \nvictims of crime, who did not simply retreat into a shell following the \ntragedy that befell them but who were willing to muster the courage and \nthe strength to do something about the issue, not necessarily so that \nthey could receive any particular kind of vindication, but so future \nvictims would not have to suffer through the same kind of problems and \nthe same indignities they did.\n  This is the real spirit of great people, of leaders, and it is the \nspirit of America. I commend all of these victims for the leadership \nrole they have played in being willing to step out in very difficult \ncircumstances to prod those of us in the legislative body to move this \nprocess forward and to get this legislation adopted. They are the ones \nwho deserve the primary thanks today.\n  The victory, when we pass this legislation, will be largely a victory \nfor them and all of the future victims who will never have to suffer \nthe same kind of indignities that they did.\n  Mr. President, as the sponsor of this bill, I would like to enter \ninto a colloquy with the Senator from California. She is the primary \ncosponsor of this bill. After extensive consultation with our \ncolleagues, we have drafted a bill with a broad bipartisan consensus. \nIt is not the intent of this bill to limit any laws in favor of crime \nvictims that may currently exist, whether these laws are statutory, \nregulatory, or found in case law. I ask Senator Feinstein if she \nagrees.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, it is not our intent to restrict victims' rights \nor accommodations found in other laws. I would like to turn to the bill \nitself and address the first section, (a)(1), the right of the crime \nvictim to be reasonably protected. Of course, the Government cannot \nprotect the crime victim in all circumstances. However, where \nreasonable, the crime victim should be provided accommodations such as \na secure waiting area, away from the defendant before and after and \nduring breaks in the proceedings.\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to address the notice provisions of section 2, \n(a)(2). The notice provisions are important because if a victim fails \nto receive notice of a public proceeding in the criminal case at which \nthe victim's right could otherwise have been exercised, that right has \neffectively been denied. Public proceedings include both trial level \nand appellate level court proceedings. It does not make sense to enact \nvictims' rights that are rendered useless because the victim never knew \nof the proceeding at which the right had to be asserted. Simply put, a \nfailure to provide notice of proceedings at which a right can be \nasserted is equivalent to a violation of the right itself.\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\n  Equally important to this right to notice of public proceedings \ncontained in this subsection is the right to notice of the escape or \nrelease of the accused. This provision helps to protect crime victims \nby notifying them that the accused is out on the streets.\n  For these rights to notice to be effective, notice must be \nsufficiently given in advance of a proceeding to give the crime victim \nthe opportunity to arrange his or her affairs in order to be able to \nattend that proceeding and any scheduling of proceedings should take \ninto account the victim's schedule to facilitate effective notice.\n  Restrictions on public proceedings are in 28 CFR Sec. 50.9, and it is \nnot the intent here today to alter the meaning of that provision.\n  I ask Senator Feinstein, if she can comment on her understanding of \nsection (a)(2)?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. My understanding of this subsection is the same the \nSenator's. Too often crime victims have been unable to exercise their \nrights because they were not informed of the proceedings. Pleas and \nsentencings have all too frequently occurred without the victim ever \nknowing that they were taking place. Victims are the persons who are \ndirectly harmed by the crime and they have a stake in the criminal \nprocess because of that harm. Their lives are significantly altered by \nthe crime and they have to live with the consequences for the rest of \ntheir lives. To deny them the opportunity to know of and be present at \nproceedings is counter to the fundamental principles of this country. \nIt is simply wrong. Moreover, victim safety requires that notice of the \nrelease or escape of an accused from custody be made in a timely manner \nto allow the victim to make informed choices about his or her own \nsafety. This provision ensures that takes place.\n  I would like to turn to section 2, (a)(3) of the bill, which provides \nthat the crime victim has the right not to be excluded from any public \nproceedings. This language was drafted in a way to ensure that the \ngovernment would not be responsible for paying for the victim's travel \nand lodging to a place where they could attend the proceedings.\n  In all other respects, this section is intended to grant victims the \nright to attend and be present throughout all public proceedings.\n  This right is limited in two respects. First, the right is limited to \npublic proceedings, thus grand jury proceedings are excluded from the \nright. Second, the Government or the defendant can request, and the \ncourt can order, judicial proceedings to be closed under existing laws. \nThis provision is not intended to alter those laws or their procedures \nin any way. I ask the Senator is that is his understanding of this \nsection.\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. That it is my understanding as well. There may be \norganized crime cases or cases involving national security that require \nprocedures that necessarily deny a crime victim the right not to be \nexcluded that would otherwise be provided under this section. This is \nas it should be. National security matters and organized crime cases \nare especially challenging, and there are times when there is a vital \nneed for closed proceedings. In such cases, the proceedings are not \nintended to be interpreted as ``public proceedings'' under this bill. \nIn this regard, it is not our intent to alter 28 CFR Sec. 50.9 in any \nrespect.\n  Despite these limitations, this bill allows crime victims, in the \nvast majority of cases, to attend the hearings and trial of the case \ninvolving their victimization. This is so important because crime \nvictims share an interest with the government in seeing that justice is \ndone in a criminal case and this interest supports the idea that \nvictims should not be excluded from public criminal proceedings, \nwhether these are pretrial, trial, or post-trial proceedings.\n  This right of crime victims not to be excluded from the proceedings \nprovides a foundation for the next section, section 2, (a)(4), which \nprovides victims the right to reasonably be heard at any public \nproceeding involving release, plea, or sentencing. This provision is \nintended to allow crime victims to directly address the court in \nperson. It is not necessary for the victim to obtain the permission of \neither party to do so. This right is a right independent of the \nGovernment or the defendant that allows the victim to address the \ncourt. To the extent the victim has the right to independently address \nthe court, the victim acts as an independent participant in the \nproceedings. When a victim invokes this right during plea and \nsentencing proceedings, it is intended that the he or she be allowed to \nprovide all three types of victim impact--the character of the victim, \nthe impact of the crime on the victim, the victims' family and the \ncommunity, and sentencing recommendations. Of course, the victim may \nuse a lawyer, at their own expense, to assist in the exercise of this \nright. This bill does not provide victims with a right to counsel but \nrecognizes that a victim may enlist counsel on their own.\n\n  It is not the intent of the term ``reasonably'' in the phrase ``to be \nreasonably heard'' to provide any excuse for denying a victim the right \nto appear in person and directly address the court. Indeed, the very \npurpose of this section is to allow the victim to appear personally and \ndirectly address the court. This section would fail in its intent if \ncourts determined that written, rather than oral communication, could \ngenerally satisfy this right. On the other hand, the term \n``reasonably'' is meant to allow for alternative methods of \ncommunicating a victim's views to the court when the victim is unable \nto attend the proceedings. Such circumstances might arise, for example, \nif the victim is incarcerated on unrelated matters at the time of the \nproceedings or if a victim cannot afford to travel to a courthouse. In \nsuch cases, communication by the victim to the court is permitted by \nother reasonable means. Is this the understanding of the Senator of \nthis provision?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. That is my understanding as well. The victim of \ncrime, or their counsel, should be able to provide any information, as \nwell as their opinion, directly to the court concerning the release, \nplea, or sentencing of the accused. This bill intends for this right to \nbe heard to be an independent right of the victim, and thus cannot \nprevent the victim from being heard.\n  It is important that the ``reasonably be heard'' language not be an \nexcuse for minimizing the victim's opportunity to be heard. Only if it \nis not practical for the victim to speak in person or if the victim \nwishes to be heard by the court in a different fashion should this \nprovision mean anything other than an in-person right to be heard.\n  Of course, in providing victim information or opinion it is important \nthat the victim be able to confer with the prosecutor concerning a \nvariety of matters and proceedings. Section 2, (a)(5) provides a right \nto confer with the attorney for the Government in the case. This right \nis intended to be expansive. For example, the victim has the right to \nconfer with the Government concerning any critical stage or disposition \nof the case. The right, however, is not limited to these examples. I \nask the Senator if he concurs in this intent.\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. The intent of this section is just as the Senator says. \nThis right to confer does not give the crime victim any right to direct \nthe prosecution. Prosecutors should consider it part of their \nprofession to be available to consult with crime victims about concerns \nthe victims may have which are pertinent to the case, case proceedings \nor dispositions. Under this provision, victims are able to confer with \nthe Government's attorney about proceedings after charging.\n  I would like to turn now to the section on restitution, section 2, \n(a)(6). This section provides the right to full and timely restitution \nas provided in law. This right, together with the other rights in the \nact to be heard and confer with the Government's attorney in this act, \nmeans that existing restitution laws will be more effective.\n  I am interested in the Senator's views of this restitution provision.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I join his comments.\n  I would like to move on to section 2, (a)(7), which provides crime \nvictims with a right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay. This \nprovision does not curtail the Government's need for reasonable time to \norganize and prosecute its case. Nor is the provision intended to \ninfringe on the defendant's due process right to prepare a defense.\n\n[[Page S4269]]\n\nToo often, however, delays in criminal proceedings occur for the mere \nconvenience of the parties and those delays reach beyond the time \nneeded for defendant's due process or the Government's need to prepare. \nThe result of such delays is that victims cannot begin to put the crime \nbehind them and they continue to be victimized. It is not right to hold \ncrime victims under the stress and pressure of future court proceedings \nmerely because it is convenient for the parties or the court.\n  This provision should be interpreted so that any decision to continue \na criminal case should include reasonable consideration of the rights \nunder this section.\n  I am eager to hear the Senator's view on this.\n  Mr. KYL. I concur in the Senator's comments. I would add that the \ndelays in criminal proceedings are among the most chronic problems \nfaced by victims. Whatever peace of mind a victim might achieve after a \ncrime is too often inexcusably postponed by unreasonable delays in the \ncriminal case. A central reason for these rights is to force a change \nin a criminal justice culture which has failed to focus on the \nlegitimate interests of crime victims, a new focus on limiting \nunreasonable delays in the criminal process to accommodate the victim \nis a positive start.\n  I would like to turn to section 2, (a)(8). This provision contains a \nnumber of rights. The broad rights articulated in this section are \nmeant to be rights themselves and are not intended to just be \naspirational. One of these rights is the right to be treated with \nfairness. Of course, fairness includes the notion of due process. Too \noften victims of crime experience a secondary victimization at the \nhands of the criminal justice system. This provision is intended to \ndirect Government agencies and employees, whether they are in executive \nor judiciary branches, to treat victims of crime with the respect they \ndeserve.\n  Does the Senator agree?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  It is not the intent of this bill that its significance be whittled \ndown or marginalized by the courts or the executive branch. This \nlegislation is meant to correct, not continue, the legacy of the poor \ntreatment of crime victims in the criminal process. This legislation is \nmeant to ensure that cases like the McVeigh case, where victims of the \nOklahoma City bombing were effectively denied the right to attend the \ntrial and to avoid federal appeals courts from determining, as the \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals did, that victims had no standing to \nseek review of their right to attend the trial under the former \nvictims' law that this bill replaces.\n\n  I would also like to comment on section 2, (b), which directs courts \nto ensure that the rights in this law be afforded and to record, on the \nrecord, any reason for denying relief of an assertion of a crime \nvictim. This provision is critical because it is in the courts of this \ncountry that these rights will be asserted and it is the courts that \nwill be responsible for enforcing them. Further, requiring a court to \nprovide the reasons for denial of relief is necessary for effective \nappeal of such denial.\n  Is that the understanding of the Senator?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, it is.\n  Turning briefly to section 2, (c), there are several important things \nto point out in this subsection. First, where there is a material \nconflict between the Government's attorney and the crime victim, this \nprovision protects crime victims' rights. This means that if Government \nlawyers interpret a right differently from a victim, urge a very narrow \ninterpretation of a right, or do not believe a right should be \nasserted, they are in conflict with the victim and this provision \nrequires that they inform the victim of this and direct the victim to \nindependent counsel, such as the legal clinics for crime victims \ncontemplated under this law. This is an important protection for crime \nvictims because it ensures the independent and individual nature of \ntheir rights. Second, the notice section immediately following limits \nthe right to notice of release where such notice may endanger the \nsafety of the person being released. There are cases, particularly in \ndomestic violence cases, where there is danger posed by an intimate \npartner if the intimate partner is released. Such circumstances are not \nthe norm, even in domestic violence cases as a category of cases. This \nexception should not be relied upon as an excuse to avoid notifying \nmost victims.\n  Is that the Senator's understanding of this section?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  I would now like to address the enforcement provisions of the bill, \nspecifically section 2, subsection (d)(1). This provision allows a \ncrime victim to enter the criminal trial court during proceedings \ninvolving the crime against the victim and assert the rights provided \nby this bill. This provision ensures that crime victims have standing \nto be heard in trial courts so that they are heard at the very moment \nwhen their rights are at stake and this, in turn, forces the criminal \njustice system to be responsive to a victim's rights in a timely way. \nImportantly, however, the bill does not allow the defendant in the case \nto assert any of the victim's rights to obtain relief. This prohibition \nprevents the individual accused of the crime from distorting a right \nintended for the benefit of the individual victim into a weapon against \njustice.\n  The provision allows the crime victim's representative and the \nattorney for the Government to go into a criminal trial court and \nassert the crime victim's rights. The inclusions of representatives and \nthe Government's attorney in the provision are important for a number \nof reasons. First, allowing a representative to assert a crime victim's \nrights ensures that where a crime victim is unable to assert the rights \non his or her own for any reason, including incapacity, incompetence, \nminority, or death, those rights are not lost. The representative for \nthe crime victim can assert the rights.\n  Second, a crime victim may choose to enlist a private attorney to \nrepresent him or her in the criminal case--this provision allows that \nattorney to enter an appearance on behalf of the victim in the criminal \ntrial court and assert the victim's rights. The provision also \nrecognizes that, at times, the Government's attorney may be best \nsituated to assert a crime victim's rights either because the crime \nvictim is not available at a particular point in the trial or because, \nat times, the crime victim's interests coincide with those of the \nGovernment and it makes sense for a single person to express those \njoined interests. Importantly, however, the provision does not mean \nthat the Government's attorney has the authority to compromise or co-\nopt a victim's right. Nor does the provision mean that by not asserting \na victim's right the Government's attorney has waived that right. The \nrights provided in this bill are personal to the individual crime \nvictim and it is that crime victim that has the final word regarding \nwhich of the specific rights to assert and when. Waiver of any of the \nindividual rights provided can only happen by the victim's affirmative \nwaiver of that specific right.\n  Does all of this correspond with Senator Kyl's understanding of the \nbill?\n  Mr. KYL. Absolutely. The enforcement provision the Senator addressed \nis critical to this bill. Without the ability to enforce the rights in \nthe criminal trial and appellate courts of this country any rights \nafforded are, at best, rhetoric. We are far past the point where lip \nservice to victims' rights is acceptable. The enforcement provisions of \nthis bill ensure that never again are victim's rights provided in word \nbut not in reality.\n  I want to turn to section 2, subsection (d)(2) because it is an \nunfortunate reality that in today's world there are crimes that result \nin multiple victims. The reality of those situations is that a court \nmay find that the sheer number of victims is so large that it is \nimpracticable to accord each victim the rights in this bill. The bill \nallows that when the court makes that finding on the record the court \nmust then fashion a procedure that still gives effect to the bill and \nyet takes into account the impracticability. For instance, in the \nOklahoma City bombing case the number of victims was tremendous and \nattendance at any one proceeding by all of them was impracticable so \nthe court fashioned a procedure that allowed victims to attend the \nproceedings by close circuit television. This is merely one example. \nAnother may be to allow victims with a right to speak to be heard in \nwriting or through\n\n[[Page S4270]]\n\nother methods. Importantly, courts must seek to identify methods that \nfit the case before that to ensure that despite numerosity of crime \nvictims, the rights in this bill are given effect.\n  Does the Senator agree with this reading of the bill?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely. It is a tragic reality that cases may \ninvolve multiple victims and yet that fact is not grounds for \neviscerating the rights in this bill. Rather, that fact is grounds for \nthe court to find an alternative procedure to give effect to this bill.\n  I now want to turn to another critical aspect of enforcement of \nvictims' rights, section 2, subsection (d)(3). This subsection provides \nthat a crime victim who is denied any of his or her rights as a crime \nvictim has standing to appellate review of that denial. Specifically, \nthe provision allows a crime victim to apply for a writ of mandamus to \nthe appropriate appellate court. The provision provides that court \nshall take the writ and shall order the relief necessary to protect the \ncrime victim's right. This provision is critical for a couple of \nreasons. First, it gives the victim standing to appear before the \nappellate courts of this country and ask for review of a possible error \nbelow. Second, while mandamus is generally discretionary, this \nprovision means that courts must review these cases. Appellate review \nof denials of victims' rights is just as important as the initial \nassertion of a victim's right. This provision ensures review and \nencourages courts to broadly defend the victims' rights.\n  Mr. President, does Senator Kyl agree?\n  Mr. KYL. Absolutely. Without the right to seek appellate review and a \nguarantee that the appellate court will hear the appeal and order \nrelief, a victim is left to the mercy of the very trial court that may \nhave erred. This country's appellate courts are designed to remedy \nerrors of lower courts and this provision requires them to do so for \nvictim's rights. For a victim's right to truly be honored, a victim \nmust be able to assert the rights in trial courts, to then be able to \nhave denials of those rights reviewed at the appellate level, and to \nhave the appellate court take the appeal and order relief. By providing \nfor all of this, this bill ensures that victims' rights will have \nmeaning.\n  I would like to turn our attention to section 2, subsection (d)(4) \nbecause that also provides an enforcement mechanism. This section \nprovides that in any appeal, regardless of the party initiating the \nappeal, the government can assert as error the district court's denial \nof a crime victim's right. This subsection is important for a couple of \nreasons. First, it allows the Government to assert a victim's right on \nappeal even when it is the defendant who seeks appeal of his or her \nconviction. This ensures that victims' rights are protected throughout \nthe criminal justice process and that they do not fall by the wayside \nduring what can often be an extended appeal that the victim is not a \nparty to.\n  Is that the Senator's understanding of the bill?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  I would like to turn to the next provision, section 2, subsection \n(d)(5). This subsection provides that a failure to afford a right under \nthe act does not provide grounds for a new trial. This provision \ndemonstrates that victim's rights are not intended to be, nor are they, \nan attack on defendants' protections against double jeopardy. This \nprovision is not intended to prevent courts from vacating decisions in \nnontrial proceedings in which victims' rights were not protected and \nordering those proceedings to be redone. It simply assures that a trial \nwill not be redone. Thus, defendants' and victims' rights are both \nprotected.\n  Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, it is. We have, over the years, tried to reassure those \nthat oppose victims' rights that they are not an attempt to undermine \ndefendants' rights. This provision reiterates that. It is important for \nvictims' rights to be asserted and protected throughout the criminal \njustice process, and for courts to have the authority to redo \nproceedings other than the trial such as release hearings, pleas, and \nsentencings where victims' rights are abridged, but to not tread upon \ndefendant's rights against double jeopardy in the process. Victims' \nrights are about a fair and balanced criminal justice system--one that \nconsiders defendant's rights as well as victims' rights. This provision \nprotects that careful balance.\n  I want to turn to the definitions in the bill, contained in section \n2, subsection (e). There are a couple of key points to be made about \nthe definitions. A ``crime victim'' is defined as a person directly and \nproximately harmed as a result of any offense, felony or misdemeanor. \nThis is an intentionally broad definition because all victims of crime \ndeserve to have their rights protected, whether or not they are the \nvictim of the count charged. Additionally, crime victims may, for any \nnumber of reasons, want to employ an attorney to represent them in \ncourt. This definition of crime victim allows crime victims to do that. \nIt also assures that when, for any reason, crime victims are unable to \nassert rights on their own, those rights will still be protected.\n  Is that the Senator's understanding of the bill as well?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is.\n  Now I would like to turn to the portion of the bill concerning \nadministrative compliance with victims' rights, section 2, subsection \n(f). The provisions of this subsection are relatively self-explanatory, \nbut it important to point out that these procedures are completely \nseparate from and in no way limit the victim's rights in the previous \nsection.\n  Is that Senator Kyl's understanding?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Let me comment briefly on section 4, Reports. Subsection (a) requires \nthe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to report annually the \nnumber of times a right asserted in a criminal case is denied the \nrelief requested, and the reasons therefore, as well as the number of \ntimes a mandamus action was brought and the result of that mandamus.\n  Such reporting is the only way we in the Congress and other \ninterested parties can observe whether reforms we mandate are being \ncarried out. No one doubts the difficulty of obtaining case-by-case \ninformation of this nature. Yes, this information is critical to \nunderstanding whether Federal statutes really can effectively protect \nvictims' rights or whether a constitutional amendment is necessary. We \nare certain that affected executive and judicial agencies can work \ntogether to implement effective administrative tools to record and \namass this data. We would certainly encourage the National Institute of \nJustice to support any needed research to get this system in place.\n  Is this Senator Feinstein's understanding?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  One final point. Throughout this act, reference is made to the \n``accused.'' Would the Senator also agree that it is our intention to \nuse this word in the broadest sense to include both those charged and \nconvicted so that the rights we establish apply throughout the criminal \njustice system?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, that it is my understanding.\n  Mr. President, I anticipate Senator Leahy's arrival. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I see my good friend, the Senator from \nArizona, in the Chamber. I know the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia will be joining us shortly. What is the time allocation? I \nknow the distinguished Senator from Arizona wants to make sure we all \nhave time, but I was just curious where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont and the Senator from \nUtah each have 30 minutes. The Senator from California has 6 minutes 34 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I do not anticipate using all my time by any means. I \nappreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Arizona who had indicated \nearlier that he fit us in because of conflicting schedules that the \nSenator from California and I have. Before I even begin, I want to \nagain thank the distinguished Senators from Arizona and California for \nall they have done on this issue.\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\n  This past Sunday, as we all know, marked the start of National Crime \nVictims' Rights Week. We set this week aside each year to refocus \nattention on the needs and rights of crime victims. One would almost \nthink we would not have to do that, but as a matter of fact, too often, \nthe needs of victims are not met, and their rights are not fully \nhonored. I learned this during my time as a prosecutor. I think all of \nus have learned this, from the experiences and some terribly gripping \nstories that we have heard from our constituents.\n  This year, the Senate had been scheduled to mark the occasion of \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week by taking up S.J. Res. 1, a \nproposed constitutional amendment. It was going to end up being days, \nmaybe weeks, of debate even though everyone knew that the \nconstitutional amendment was not going to pass. We went through this \nprocess back in April of the year 2000, during the last Presidential \nelection year.\n  I said then, during that earlier debate on the constitutional \namendment, that I have worked long and hard to protect and advance \ncrime victims' rights, as have many on both sides of the aisle in this \nbody. As a prosecutor for 8\\1/2\\ years, I worked day to day, year to \nyear alongside victims, seeking justice on their behalf. This was back \nat a time before people spoke much about victims having rights. I like \nto think that my office was a model in this regard, for making sure \nthat victims were heard.\n  I have worked on and have led many legislative efforts on behalf of \nvictims throughout my service in the Senate. One of the most recent of \nthose efforts was the creation of the September 11 Victim Compensation \nFund. I am grateful to have been able to take part in something that \nhas brought some relief to so many victims.\n  But I will never forget the victims I worked with as a prosecutor or \nthe needs of the new victims minted each day through the crimes \ncommitted against them.\n  For years, at Christmas time, I received a very poignant letter from \na woman who was the victim of a very serious crime. She told me how she \nwas doing, how her children were doing.\n  When I go to the grocery store in Vermont, or I'm walking down the \nstreet, I run into people who were helped during those years and who \nhad a voice during those years. It is gratifying, but I have to think \nabout the fact that every single day, there are a whole lot more \ncrimes, and a whole lot more victims.\n  I have always believed that victims should be afforded certain basic \nprotections. I believe victims should be notified when the defendant is \nin court or when he is about to be released. I believe victims should \nbe heard at critical stages of the prosecution. I believe victims are \nentitled to restitution from offenders.\n  In recent years, the debate has never been about whether victims \nshould be protected. Of course they should. Rather, the debate has been \nabout how victims should be protected.\n  I did not think the proposed constitutional amendment was the best \nway forward. I still believe that. We all agree, and every witness who \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee on this issue agreed, that \nevery right provided by the victims' rights amendment can be, or \nalready is, protected by State or Federal statutory law.\n  So we have long had the power to enhance victims' rights through \nregular legislation, passed with a simple majority vote, and make an \nimmediate difference in the lives of crime victims. Legislative \nenhancements are more easily enacted, more directly applied and \nimplemented, and more able to provide specific, effective remedies. In \naddition, as Chief Justice Rehnquist and others have pointed out, \nstatutes are more easily corrected if we find, in hindsight, that they \nneed correction, clarification, or improvement.\n  When we pass the Kyl-Feinstein-Hatch-Leahy Victims' Rights Act, we \nwill take a step that I have long advocated. So I thank and commend the \nprincipal sponsors of S.J. Res. 1, the distinguished Senators from \nCalifornia and Arizona. We came from both sides on the constitutional \ndebate, but all of us are deeply committed to the cause of victims' \nrights, and that is why we came together on this legislation.\n  This legislation will provide crime victims in the Federal system \nwith all the rights and protections that the proposed constitutional \namendment would have provided. In fact, our statute goes further than \nthe constitutional amendment because it gives the same rights and \nprotections to all crime victims, not just to the victims of violent \ncrimes. The elderly woman who is defrauded out of her life savings will \nget the same protection from this statute as other crime victims.\n  This statute, S. 2329, also spells out how victims' rights are to be \nenforced, using language that Senator Kennedy and I developed in S. \n805, the Crime Victims Assistance Act. In addition to providing victims \nwith standing to assert their rights in mandamus actions, S. 2329 will \nestablish an administrative authority in the Department of Justice to \nreceive and investigate victims' claims of unlawful or inappropriate \naction on the part of criminal justice and victims' service providers. \nDepartment of Justice employees who fail to comply with the law \npertaining to the treatment of crime victims could face disciplinary \nsanctions, including suspension or termination of employment.\n  We have incorporated other proposals from S. 805 as well, to help \nStates implement and enforce their own victims' rights laws. And we \nhave called for two annual reports, one by the Administrative Office of \nthe Courts, and the other by the General Accounting Office, to make \nsure we get some feedback on how the rights and procedures established \nby the statute are working in practice. Over time, we will be able to \nmodify and fine-tune the statute so that it provides an appropriate \ndegree of protection for the rights of crime victims.\n  I have no doubt we are going to pass this law today. I believe the \nother body will pass the law, and the President will sign it. Then part \nof our duty is going to have to be to follow up to see how it works.\n  I said to some of the representatives of victims' groups this \nmorning, keep our feet to the fire. Make sure we follow up. Passage of \nthis bill will necessitate careful oversight of its implementation by \nCongress. If, as I hope, federal judges and prosecutors take victims' \nrights seriously, there should be little need for victims to bring \nmandamus actions to enforce their rights. But if, for whatever reason, \nvictims feel that they are not being treated fairly, we may see a wave \nof new litigation in the federal courts, with victims and their lawyers \nhaving to insert themselves into criminal cases. We will need to \nmonitor the situation closely.\n  I am committed to giving victims real and enforceable rights. But I \nam convinced that prosecutors should be capable of protecting \nthose rights, once we make them clear. In my experience, prosecutors \nhave victims' interests at heart.\n\n  Senator Kennedy and I proposed in the Crime Victims Assistance Act a \nlimited-standing provision, which applied with respect to the victim's \nright to attend and observe the trial, and under which a victim could \nassert her right if the prosecutor refused to do so. Passing such a \nprovision would have allowed us to observe over a period of time \nwhether direct participation of victims in criminal proceedings has any \nunanticipated consequences for the administration of justice.\n  This Victims' Rights Act proposes a bolder experiment, entitling \nvictims to assert a panoply of rights, regardless of whether the \nprosecution is already asserting the same rights on their behalf. For \nexample, at the insistence of other sponsors, this bill will enable \nvictims to bring mandamus actions alleging the denial of their \nstatutory right ``to be treated with fairness and with respect for the \nvictim's dignity and privacy,'' which may be difficult claims to \nadjudicate.\n  I note with some regret that S. 2329 picks up language from S.J. Res. \n1 denying victims any cause of action for damages in the event that \ntheir rights are violated. Allowing victims to vindicate their rights \nthrough separate proceedings for damages instead of through mandamus \nactions in the criminal case could well be a more efficient as well as \na more effective way of ensuring that victims' rights are honored. \nCertainly the prospect of being held to account in such proceedings \nwould provide a powerful incentive to take victims' rights seriously. \nBut the\n\n[[Page S4272]]\n\nRepublican sponsors of the bill did not want to provide for damages.\n  Similarly, some Republican Senators did not want to allow courts to \nappoint attorneys to help crime victims. It is my hope and belief that \nvictims will seldom need representation, since they already have \npowerful advocates in our public prosecutors. Still, it is possible \nthat a judge would want to appoint an attorney for a victim in an \nextraordinary case, as for example if there is a material conflict \nbetween the victim's interests and the interests of the prosecution. By \nfailing to provide for this possibility, S. 2329 may perpetuate a \nsystem of unequal justice for victims, where the wealthy have the \nbenefit of counsel, and the poor do not.\n  There are other provisions that were also, regrettably, left on the \ncutting-room floor during negotiations on this bill. First, we dropped \na provision that was in the proposed constitutional amendment, which \nwould have given victims certain rights in the context of clemency \nproceedings. I know Attorney General Ashcroft, when he was a Member of \nthe Senate, felt strongly that victims should have a voice in these \nproceedings. I would welcome the chance to work with him, to have him \nprovide for that within the Federal system, to do in the Federal system \nwhat he wanted to do while a member of this body.\n  A second provision that I would have liked to include in the bill \nwould have authorized funding for a broad range of compliance \nauthorities to help enforce the rights of crime victims in the state \nsystems. Senator Kennedy and I proposed such a program in the Crime \nVictims Assistance Act, but I was unable to persuade my colleagues to \ninclude it in this bill.\n  There are a variety of remedies for violations of rights that are \noperating at the State level, all of which have strengths and \nweaknesses. Some States use more than one approach. Arizona has a non-\nstatutory ombudsman staff position in the Attorney General's office, to \nreceive and investigate victim complaints; a victims' legal assistance \nproject run by a non-profit and the Arizona State University College of \nLaw, and a system of auditing those who receive grants to implement \nvictims' rights. Wisconsin uses a State employee to receive and attempt \nto resolve victim complaints, as well as a victims' rights board that \ncan formally receive complaints and seek sanctions for violations. \nAlaska has a State Office of Victims' Rights. South Carolina has an \nindependent victim ombudsman. Connecticut has a State Victim Advocate. \nVermont is exploring various options. We do have a Center for Crime \nVictims Services, which advocates informally for victims and is one of \nthe premier victims' services sites in the country.\n\n  Finally, I want to comment on the unusual genesis of this bill, and \nthe extraordinary procedure that has brought us so swiftly to a vote in \nthe Senate. As I mentioned earlier, the Senate was scheduled to begin \nwork this week on the proposed constitutional amendment, S.J. Res. 1. \nOn Wednesday, the Republican leadership moved to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed. I would not have opposed this motion. I voted to \nproceed to an earlier iteration of this constitutional amendment four \nyears ago, and I would have been prepared to proceed to it again this \nweek. Even given the time this would have taken and the expected \noutcome, I would not have opposed a debate on the constitutional \namendment.\n  It was under these circumstances that we had so little opportunity to \nwork on crafting the crime victims' statute. I would have liked to have \ngotten the views of the Office for Victims of Crime and other \ncomponents of the Department of Justice, for example. Many victims' \ngroups and domestic violence organizations opposed the constitutional \namendment, as did many law professors, judges, and prosecutors. I would \nhave liked to hear their views on this statute. I am personally \nconcerned that the statute may not adequately address the special \nproblems raised in domestic violence and abuse situations. If it does \nnot, then we may need to amend it again.\n  Given the Republican leadership's insistence on proceeding to the \nconstitutional amendment today, there was not as much time as I would \nhave liked to develop the statutory alternative that we vote on today, \nand no time to hold hearings on it or improve the bill in Committee. \nFortunately, however, this is to be a statute, not a constitutional \namendment, and it can be modified and improved. We will be able to make \nit better as we go along.\n  I commend my good friend, Senator Feinstein, for mediating this \nconsensus legislation. I know that she would have preferred to pass a \nconstitutional amendment. She has made that clear. Nevertheless, she \nworked hard to produce a bill that we all can support, showing once \nagain that she is first and foremost a legislator who wants to get \nthings done. Due in large part to Senator Feinstein's efforts, we now \nhave an opportunity to advance the cause of victims' rights with \nstrong, practical, bipartisan legislation. I have never doubted Senator \nFeinstein or Senator Kyl's commitment to victims' rights. I am \ndelighted that we have come together to advance that common cause.\n  My friend and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch, is another lead sponsor of this legislation. He and I have \nworked together on the Judiciary Committee in this area. He has been a \ntireless advocate for the rights of crime victims, and more generally \nfor fairness in the administration of justice.\n  I want to thank David Hantman and Steve Cash of Senator Feinstein's \nstaff; Bruce Artim and Grace Becker of Senator Hatch's staff; Steven \nHiggins of Senator Kyl's staff; Robin Toone of Senator Kennedy's staff; \nBob Schiff and Alex Busansky of Senator Feingold's staff; Neil MacBride \nand Louisa Terrell of Senator Biden's staff; Chris Kang of Senator \nDurbin's staff; Mark Childress and Jennifer Duck of Senator Daschle's \nstaff; and, most especially the members of my own staff for their hard \nwork on this bill over the last several days under extraordinary \ncircumstances and pressures.\n  I also want to commend and thank the many victims' advocates and \nservice providers in Vermont and across the country who show their \ndedication every day of the year to crime victims. I want to thank \nthose who work in the area of domestic violence and abuse in \nparticular. I am thankful for their dedication and grateful for their \nadvice and insights over the years.\n  For more than 20 years I have sponsored and championed legislation to \nhelp victims. I have mentioned the recent September 11 Victim \nCompensation Fund, and I am also proud of such other advancements on \nbehalf of victims as a law to provide assistance to victims of \ninternational terrorism, and bills to raise the cap on victims' \nassistance and compensation programs and to protect the rights of the \nvictims of the Oklahoma City bombing. Today's vote provides us the \nopportunity to make progress on yet another important measure to \naddress the needs of victims.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Center for \nVictims of Crime stating strong support for S. 2329 be printed in the \nRecord as well as, for the sake of completeness, a number of editorials \nthat appeared on this subject recently.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The National Center for\n\n\n                                             Victims of Crime,\n\n                                                   April 21, 2004.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Center for Victims of \n     Crime strongly supports the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, \n     Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' \n     Rights Act. This landmark piece of legislation would provide \n     clear and enforceable legal rights to all direct victims of \n     crime at the federal level. We are pleased to see a long \n     overdue recognition that victims of all crime, violent and \n     nonviolent crime alike, deserve these important rights.\n       This bill also sets a new standard for federal victims' \n     rights compliance, giving victims and prosecutors the legal \n     standing to assert victims' rights; clearly authorizing \n     victims and the government to seek writs of mandamus to \n     enforce victims' rights; and calling on the Attorney General \n     to develop regulations to promote victims' rights through \n     training, disciplinary sanctions for violations of rights, \n     and the creation of an office to receive and investigate \n     complaints.\n       By making new funding available to jurisdictions with laws \n     substantially equivalent to those established in this bill, \n     this bill legislation will promote a strengthening of \n     victims' rights across the country. By providing funding to \n     promote victim notification and compliance with victims' \n     rights at the state\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\n     level, this bill will improve the implementation of victims' \n     rights nationwide. We urge Congress to go further--to broaden \n     this funding to support other mechanisms to promote \n     compliance, such as state-level victim advocates and other \n     authorities to receive and investigate the complaints of \n     victims, and not limit funding for enforcement to one method.\n       This legislation represents a real Congressional commitment \n     to improve our nation's response to victims of crime. The \n     National Center for Victims of Crime commends you for your \n     hard work and dedication to this issue, and we urge your \n     colleagues to join you in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n     Susan Herman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 19, 2004]\n\n                             Amendmentitis\n\n                             (By Bob Barr)\n\n       The circus is back in town. Every 2 years, as we roll \n     around to another grand Olympics of federal, state and local \n     elections, the hopper in Congress begins to fill up with \n     dangerous and unnecessary amendments to our U.S. \n     Constitution.\n       Few, if any, are for ``great or extraordinary occasions,'' \n     the bar James Madison set for changing our Founding document. \n     In fact, most are either one or two things: a cheap ploy to \n     get votes or an attempt to streamroll through right- or left-\n     wings social policies--think gun control or marriage--that \n     have been unable to get any traction through normal channels \n     of government.\n       Just this session alone, Congress has seen or will see \n     votes on the Flag Desecration Amendment, the Victims Rights \n     Amendment, the Federal Marriage Amendment, even the \n     Continuity in Government Amendment. Frankly, I would like to \n     see one last constitutional amendment--the No More Amendments \n     Amendment.\n       In the American political system, the Constitution was \n     meant to operate like people who freeze their credit cards in \n     a block of ice. That is, when faced with supremely important \n     and emotional decisions involving things like the censorship \n     of unpopular ideas or the seizure of firearms, the \n     Constitution makes us walk to the corner and take a time out.\n       Specifically, we have to get a two-thirds supermajority in \n     both chambers of Congress and then tree-quarters of the \n     States to agree. It is an amazingly onerous process.\n       The last amendment to the Constitution--the 27th--which set \n     limits on congressional pay, was initially proposed in the \n     States' petitions to the first Constitutional Congress in the \n     1780s but only started to move in the 1990s. It took more \n     than two centuries to finally earn a spot alongisde free \n     speech and the right not to self-incriminate.\n       During the Cold War, Americans of conscience like to brag \n     we were a Nation of laws, not men. That is, the main \n     difference between American representative democracy and \n     Soviet tyranny was that the latter's government did not have \n     to abide by a piece of yellowing parchment with some petty \n     clear instructions on what it could or could not do to its \n     citizens.\n       And, while we have failed to meet those lofty goals on a \n     number of important occasions, for the post part, we have \n     managed to pedal through without too many monumental \n     abridgements of personal liberty. That is why we are still \n     here and they went long ago to a nursing home for evil ideas.\n       However, we risk betraying that proud history in the \n     political imperative to fiddle with the Constitution. Take, \n     for instance, the Victims Rights Amendment. Pushed by a a \n     mixture of Democrats and Republicans feeling the need to \n     burnish their tough-on-crime badges, the VRA would be a \n     disaster for basic principles of fairness and dispassion in \n     our criminal justice system.\n       It would guarantee victims of crime--a loosely defined term \n     in the legislation--the ``right'' to notice, to be present \n     and to speak at an array of judicial proceedings, including \n     those dealing with bail, trial, sentencing and parole. It \n     also requires the court to take victims into account in \n     deciding whether to release prisoners or when to schedule a \n     trial.\n       As with many of these amendments, on its face the measure \n     hits all the right notes. It is tough on crime and soft on \n     victims. It is bipartisan--as a lawmaker, if you oppose \n     it, the other side will accuse you of being ``anti-\n     victim,'' whatever that means. It cost no federal tax \n     dollars (at least, not directly); states have to foot the \n     bill. Finally, it makes for a feel-good, ``I supported \n     such and such'' speech on the campaign trail.\n       But, as with many of these other amendments, it is \n     seriously flawed. Foremost among its problems is that it \n     will, ironically, obstruct justice. In 2000, Beth Wilkinson, \n     the lead federal prosecutor in the Oklahoma City bombing \n     case, explained in testimony against the amendment that, had \n     it been in force, she might not have successfully sent \n     Timothy McVeigh to death row and Terry Nichols to jail for \n     life.\n       Their convictions hinged on the testimony of one Michael \n     Fortier, who plea bargained to 12 years in federal prison, \n     for knowing about the impending bombing but not informing \n     authorities, in exchange for taking the witness stand. Had \n     the relatives of the 168 people killed in that horrible \n     tragedy been able to address the courtroom in opposition to \n     Fortier's plea, it could have sunk the whole case.\n       In addition to these practical concerns, the VRA also \n     threatens basic due process protections and objectivity in \n     the criminal justice system by making it more about vengeance \n     than justice. We trust our adversarial process--which pits \n     zealous advocates against one another in front of a judge and \n     jury--to arrive at the best approximation of the truth in \n     criminal prosecution, which helps ensure the guilty are \n     punished and the innocent go free.\n       However, when one injects the emotion of a murder victim's \n     family into a bail or a parole hearing, that adversarial \n     system is thrown directly out of whack. The defense counsel \n     then faces an onslaught of vindictiveness that cannot be \n     countered by facts or logic. Justice must remain blindfold to \n     be effective. Otherwise, we will have vigilante posses \n     waiting outside with lit torches and nooses tied every time \n     something really senational goes to trail.\n       Finally, in an ironic twist that really hammers home the \n     folly of such constitutional amendments, the vast majority of \n     states--and the federal government--already have laws on the \n     books protecting victims and ensuring their interests are not \n     forgotten as their cases progress through the system.\n       The bottom line with the Victims Rights Amendment and its \n     ilk is that the Constitution should not be co-opted as the \n     tag line for a political attack ad. It is arguable the most \n     sacred secular document in the history of the world, as it \n     has kept humanity's strongest democracy healthy long enough \n     to also make it humanity's oldest democracy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [From the Chicago Tribune Online Edition, Apr. 18, 2004]\n\n                  A Phony Proposal for Victims' Rights\n\n\n   There is no need to tinker with the Constitution to Guarantee the \n rights of victims--our entire judicial system is already set up to do \n                               just that\n\n                           (By Steve Chapman)\n\n       Americans cherish and revere the Constitution. But often \n     their attitude brings to mind the Broadway show: ``I Love \n     You, You're Perfect, Now Change.'' It seems that the only \n     thing many of them like more than the Constitution is the \n     opportunity to fix its grievous flaws. The latest suggestion \n     for improvement stems from a belief that it shortchanges the \n     needs of crime victims.\n       The entire criminal justice system, of course, could be \n     seen as a giant apparatus set up to vindicate the interests \n     of crime victims. Every year in the United States, we arrest \n     more than 13 million suspects and keep more than 1.4 million \n     offenders in prison. All those police, prosecutors, judges, \n     parole officers and prison guards are there mainly to detect, \n     investigate, prosecute and punish criminals for what they do \n     to their victims.\n       But critics say the system often abuses the people it's \n     supposed to protect. And they insist that the only way to \n     assure fairness to victims is to enshrine their rights in the \n     Constitution. President Bush has endorsed the amendment. Sen. \n     John Kerry has not.\n       Americans often have a tendency to see a problem and \n     conclude, ``There oughta be a law.'' In this instance, \n     though, there is already a multitude of laws. Every state has \n     passed legislation to protect victims' rights, and at least \n     33 have such provisions in their state constitutions.\n       But Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), co-sponsor of the amendment, \n     says these efforts have been a bust. He says one study found \n     that even in states with strong measures in place, 44 percent \n     of victims weren't alerted to the sentencing hearing, and \n     nearly half weren't notified of plea negotiations.\n       Why don't existing laws do the job? Because, according to \n     Kyl, ``criminal defendants have a plethora of rights that are \n     protected by the Constitution that are applied to exclude \n     victims rights.''\n       The only way to correct the imbalance is to give victims' \n     rights equal status.\n       But where are the constitutional provisions that work \n     against victims?\n       Defendants do have a right to a speedy public trial by \n     jury, to be represented by a lawyer, to avoid self-\n     incrimination and so on. But nothing in the Constitution \n     prevents authorities from informing victims of proceedings, \n     from letting them speak during trials, sentencing and parole \n     hearings, from altering them when an assailant is about to be \n     released, or from requiring criminals to pay restitution. \n     Those are the victims' rights specified in the constitutional \n     amendment, all of which can be (and often are) safeguarded \n     without the drastic step of altering the nation's charter.\n       Supporters complain that some courts have been so eager to \n     assure the defendant a fair trial that they bar victims from \n     the courtroom. But that happens only before a victim is \n     scheduled to testify, and it's simply meant to prevent \n     victims from tailoring their testimony (intentionally or not) \n     to match what other witnesses say.\n       By protecting the truth-seeking function of a trial, the \n     practice works to the benefit of victims--who, after all, \n     gain absolutely nothing from sending the wrong person to \n     jail.\n       If we want to abolish this custom, despite its virtues, we \n     don't need an amendment. Duke University law professor Robert \n     Mosteller says many states allow victims to\n\n[[Page S4274]]\n\n     be present throughout a trial even if they are going to \n     testify. The practice of excluding victims until they \n     testify, Mosteller notes, ``is generally a matter of \n     statutory or common law'' and ``rarely even approaches \n     constitutional significance.'' It was an issue in Timothy \n     McVeigh's Oklahoma City bombing trial--but in the end, all \n     victims were allowed to attend even if they were expected to \n     appear as witnesses.\n       Victims' rights, it's true, have not always been enforced. \n     But that's partly because they're a new concept and take time \n     to be fully implemented. And it's partly because they are \n     administered by large, fallible government bureaucracies \n     trying to keep track of a lot of people and information, \n     sometimes without adequate funds.\n       Amending the Constitution won't make the bureaucracies less \n     fallible. The obvious way to do that is to make them pay for \n     their mistakes by letting victims collect damages when their \n     rights are ignored. But this proposal explicitly forbids that \n     remedy. It's all bark and no bite.\n       Unless, of course, the opponents hope to curtail the \n     protections we grant to those accused of crimes. The \n     supporters deny that, but they also decline to include a \n     section stating that the amendment wouldn't diminish any \n     existing guarantees.\n       So maybe the amendment would be an attack on longstanding \n     constitutional rights, or maybe it would be an ineffectual \n     piece of symbolism. Either way, we're better off without it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Washington Times, April 20, 2004]\n\n                        We, the Clutterers . . .\n\n            (By Bruce Fein, special to the Washington Times)\n\n       The Senate should balk at cluttering the Constitution when \n     it votes next Friday on a crime victims' rights amendment \n     [VRA].\n       To forgo the VRA is not to cherish victims' rights less, \n     but to venerate the brevity and accessibility of the \n     Constitution more. Amendments are appropriate only when \n     flexible and adaptable statutes would be insufficient to \n     achieve a compelling objective; or, to protect discrete and \n     insular minorities from political oppression. Neither reason \n     obtains for the VRA.\n       Crime victims deserve and evoke legal sympathy. Every state \n     and the District of Columbia feature statutes that endow \n     victims with participatory rights in the criminal justice \n     system. Further, 33 states have amended their state \n     constitutions by overwhelming majorities to protect crime \n     victims.\n       Congress has enacted a cornucopia of victim-friendly \n     statutes since 1982, including a right to restitution, victim \n     impact statements, and a victims' Bill of Rights. According \n     to the latter, federal law enforcement agencies must treat \n     putative victims with fairness and respect; protect them from \n     accused offenders; provide them notice of court proceedings; \n     offer opportunities to attend public sessions under certain \n     conditions and to confer with government prosecutors; and \n     transmit information about the conviction, sentencing, \n     imprisonment, and release of the offender.\n       A crime victim's authenticity remains in doubt, it should \n     be remembered, unless and until the accused is convicted.\n       As I previously testified before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee: ``Crime victims have no difficulty in making their \n     voices heard in the corridors of power; they do not need \n     protection from the majoritarian political process, in \n     contrast with criminal defendants whose popularity \n     characteristically ranks with that of Gen. William Tecumseh \n     Sherman in Atlanta, Ga.'' A recent vignette from Lake County, \n     Mich., corroborates the political hazards of slighting crime \n     victims. In September 2003, a county prosecutor was recalled \n     by voters angry over a lenient plea bargain that had outraged \n     the family of a murder victim: a 23- to 50-year sentence for \n     the killer. The prosecutor's explanation he was seeking to \n     avoid costly trials on a penurious $200,000 annual budget \n     proved unavailing.\n       VRA proponents insist statutory rights are second-class \n     rights compared with constitutional rights enjoyed by the \n     accused. Statutes fortified by strong pubic sentiments, \n     however, command virtual constitutional sanctity. The 1964 \n     Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the National \n     Labor Relations Act, and the Sherman Antitrust Act are \n     illustrative. As to the latter, the Supreme Court in United \n     States vs. Topco Associates [1972] amplified: ``Antitrust \n     laws in general, and the Sherman Act in particular, are the \n     Magna Carta of free enterprise.''\n       Moreover, the elevation of victims' rights from a statutory \n     to a constitutional plateau does not guarantee greater \n     effectiveness. The 14th and 15th Amendment rights of blacks, \n     for instance, slept for 80 years in the chambers of \n     prosecutors and judges because of public indifference. In any \n     event, government officers are every bit as bound by oath to \n     obey statutes as to comply with the Constitution.\n       VRA crusaders speciously argue victims' constitutional \n     rights in criminal prosecutions should reasonably mirror \n     those of the accused. Unlike a putative victim, a criminal \n     suspect confronts the loss of life, liberty, or property and \n     a formidable arsenal of government investigatory and \n     prosecutorial weapons. The victim, moreover, may seek damages \n     from the defendant, including restitution, in parallel civil \n     proceedings a la the O.J. Simpson wrongful death judgments.\n       History has also demonstrated a government propensity to \n     persecute by overzealous prosecutions. The Declaration of \n     Independence denounced King George III, ``For transporting us \n     beyond the seas to be tried for pretended offenses.''\n       Former Attorney General and Associate Justice of the \n     Supreme Court, Robert Jackson, worried that prosecutors are \n     routinely tempted to pick a man to indict for personal or \n     ideological reasons, and then to scour the books to pin an \n     offense on him, in lieu of discovering a crime and then \n     searching for the culprit. To blunt the potential for \n     vindictive or wrongful convictions, the Constitution endows \n     defendants with a modest array of rights, for example, proof \n     beyond a reasonable doubt, jury unanimity, and the right to \n     counsel. Crime victims, however, can point to no \n     corresponding history of government oppression. Indeed, they \n     are the contemporary darlings of state legislatures and \n     Congress.\n       The VRA would also vitiate the truth-finding objective of \n     trials by injecting victim concerns that could undermine the \n     impartiality and reliability of verdicts. The amendment would \n     require judges in jury selection, evidentiary rulings, or \n     jury instructions to ``consider the victim's safety, interest \n     in avoiding unreasonable delay, and just and timely \n     restitution from the offender.'' It would permit victims who \n     intend to testify to avoid sequestration, a customary \n     requirement to foil the tailoring of witness stories. \n     Sequestration has been celebrated by an icon in the law of \n     evidence, however, as ``one of the greatest engines that the \n     skill of man has ever invented for the detection of liars in \n     a court of justice.''\n       Thus, the biblical Apocrypha relates how Daniel exonerated \n     Susanna of adultery by sequestering two accusing elders and \n     eliciting conflicting answers as to where the alleged crime \n     occurred.\n       Much additional mischief besets the VRA, but their telling \n     must be forgone as a concession to the shortness of life. The \n     proposed amendment should be smartly defeated.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 21, 2004]\n\n                            Wrong on Rights\n\n       The Senate is due to take up a constitutional amendment \n     designed to grant rights in criminal court proceedings to \n     victims of violent crimes. The last time the proposal arose, \n     its sponsors, Sens. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) and Dianne Feinstein \n     (D-Calif.), had to yank it back to avoid defeat. But support \n     for the idea has grown. Nobody likes to oppose crime victims, \n     and on its face the amendment's promises seem \n     unobjectionable: ``reasonable and timely notice'' of \n     proceedings; the right of victims to attend those proceedings \n     and to speak at sentencing, clemency and parole hearings; and \n     the right to seek restitution from perpetrators. What harm \n     can there be in placing victims' rights even with the rights \n     of the accused?\n       Quite a lot, actually. For starters, none of the \n     amendments' terms are defined--including, critically, who \n     counts as a ``victim.'' Is it limited to immediate relatives \n     or can extended family members qualify? Nor does the \n     amendment specify a remedy for violations of victims' rights. \n     In fact, it specifically says that it does not ``authorize \n     any claim for damages.'' So it is unclear how exactly a \n     victim is supposed to take advantage of his rights. The \n     result will be litigation--a lot of it--as victims seek to \n     exercise their new constitutional rights and defendants seek \n     to ensure that victims' rights don't come at the expense of \n     their own.\n       The fundamental trouble is that victims' rights, if taken \n     seriously, will come at the expense of the rights of the \n     accused. Sometimes a defendant's right to a fair trial cannot \n     be reconciled with a victim's right to speak to the jury. \n     Right now, the victims' rights yield in such cases, as they \n     should. The state, after all, is not seeking to deprive the \n     victim of liberty or, in the extreme case, life. The rights \n     of the accused flow out of the jeopardy in which the state \n     puts them.\n       Though the criminal justice system's treatment of victims \n     has improved, it could and should be better. But it would be \n     a profound error to place such obligations on the same plane \n     as the Constitution's essential protections against unchecked \n     government power.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Crime \nVictims' Rights Act. As a former county prosecuting attorney, this is \nan issue about which I feel very strongly. All too often, our criminal \njustice system overlooks the victims of crime in efforts to ensure the \nlegitimate rights of accused defendants.\n  Crime victims simply have not been given the equal footing that they \ndeserve. From start to finish, the legal system sometimes can be a \nterrible ordeal for victims--a bureaucratic nightmare that seems to and \nin fact many times does go on and on and on.\n  We substantially protect the rights of defendants, as well we should. \nWe ensure that they have every reasonable benefit--and that is good--so \nas to ensure the acquittal of the innocent. But, in the process, I \nbelieve that many times, we don't give the victims of crime the rights \nthat they, too, deserve. When I was a county prosecutor in Greene \nCounty, OH in the 1970s I saw too many crime victims--people who\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\nhad already been hurt--hurt a second time by a callous legal system. \nThat is why I did everything that I could to protect the rights of \nthose victims. Our bottom line has to be this: To be victimized once by \ncrime is already once too often. To be victimized yet again by an \nuncaring judicial system is totally unacceptable.\n  Accordingly, I am pleased to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation \nthat will afford these victims, the fundamental right to participate in \nthe criminal justice system. It just makes good sense for the innocent \nvictim of a crime to be given the right to know if his or her assailant \nis released or escapes from prison. It is simply fairness to recognize \na crime victim's right to reasonable notice of public proceedings \ninvolving the crime; the right to not be excluded from such public \nproceedings; and the right to be heard at the public release, plea, \nsentencing, reprieve, and pardon proceedings involving that victim's \nassailant. It's about time that we guarantee crime victims their rights \nto court decisions that duly consider their safety, their rights to \nhave the courts avoid unreasonable delay in adjudicating those charged \nwith harming them, and their rights to just and timely restitution from \ntheir offenders. This legislation is about victims. This legislation is \nabout working to keep victims safe from further harm. This legislation \nis about keeping their concerns at the forefront.\n  When I was Green County prosecuting attorney, I had seen the victims \nof murder and other terrible crimes. I interviewed people who had been \nabused, assaulted, and raped. I learned a lot from talking to these \ninnocent people. I learned that we have to make the crime victim a full \nparticipant--not a forgotten person, not a neglected person--in the \ncriminal justice system.\n  That is why I cosponsored this bipartisan legislation. It is designed \nto help guarantee that the victims of crime have access to our criminal \njustice system. It is time to stop treating the victims like they are \nthe criminals. Let's move the legitimate concerns of victims toward \ncenter stage in our criminal justice system and finally provide these \ninnocent victims with the rights they deserve.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Scott \nCampbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn \nCrime Victims' Rights Act.\n  This week is National Crime Victims' Rights Week--a time to recognize \nthe impact of crime and the rights and needs of victims. In 2002, there \nwere 23 million criminal victimizations in the United States, and many \nof these crime victims feels as if the criminal justice system has \nwronged them. These people were innocent victims, but they feel \ndeprived of the fundamental need to participate in the process of \nbringing the accused to justice.\n  I support crime victims' rights, and I believed that every effort \nshould be made to ensure that crime victims are not victimized a second \ntime by the criminal justice system. At the same time, I agree with \nJames Madison, who wrote that the United States Constitution should be \namended only on ``great and extraordinary occasions,'' and I am \nreluctant to amend our Constitution for only the 18th time since the \nadoption of the Bills of Rights.\n  This is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Crime \nVictims' Rights Act, which reaches all of the goals that the proposed \nconstitutional amendment sought to achieve, by providing crime victims \nwith the same rights, including the following: No. 1, the right to \nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime or of any release \nor escape of the accused; No. 2 the right not to be excluded from any \nsuch public proceeding; No. 3, the right to be reasonably heard at any \npublic proceeding involving release, plea, or sentencing; No. 4, the \nright to full and timely restitution; and No. 5, the right to \nproceedings free from unreasonably delay.\n  By enacting legislation rather than amending the Constitution, our \napproach today also addresses my concerns regarding the rights of the \naccused. The premise of criminal justice in America is innocence until \nproven guilty, and our Constitution therefore guarantees certain \nprotections to the accused. These include the Fifth Amendment \nprotection against double jeopardy, as well as the Sixth Amendment \nrights to a speedy trial, the assistance of counsel, and an impartial \njury.\n  Although these protections for the accused sometimes are painful for \nus to give, they are absolutely critical to our criminal justice \nsystem. When the victim and the accused walk into the courtroom, both \nare innocent in the eyes of the law, but when the trial begins, it is \nthe defendant's life and liberty that are at stake.\n  During the Judiciary Committee debate on the proposed constitutional \namendment regarding victims' rights, I offered an amendment that would \nhave ensured that the rights of the accused as guaranteed under the \nConstitution would not be diminished or denied. However, this language \nis unnecessary in the bill we are debating today, because rights \nprovided in a statute can not supercede those guaranteed by the \nConstitution.\n  For example, I believe this statute would allow courts to protect \ndefendants from possible violations of due process and to preserve the \naccused's right to an impartial jury, by excluding victims from a \npublic proceeding if the victim is to testify and the court determines \nthat the victim's testimony would be materially affected if the victim \nhears other testimony at trial.\n  This statutory approach also provides Congress with the flexibility \nto modify this legislation if we find it is not perfect.\n  I would like to commend Senators Feinstein and Kyl for their efforts \nto provide rights to crime victims and for introducing this statutory \nalternative. I am pleased to join them in this effort.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this bill to provide \nenforceable rights to victims of crime, and I urge the Senate to \napprove it.\n  For too long, our criminal justice system has neglected the hundreds \nof thousands of victims of crime whose lives are shattered by violence \nor other crime each year. Victims deserve better from our criminal \njustice system.\n  Too often, the current system does not provide adequate relief for \nvictims of crime. They are not given basic information about their \ncase--such as notice of a defendant's arrest and bail status, the \nschedule of various court proceedings, and the terms of imprisonment. \nVictims deserve to know about their case. They deserve to know when \ntheir assailants are being considered for bail or parole or adjustments \nof their sentences. They certainly deserve to know when offenders are \nreleased from prison.\n  Since 1997, Senator Leahy and I have sponsored legislation to provide \nenhanced protections for victims of violent or non-violent crimes and \nestablish an effective way to implement and enforce these protections. \nOur legislation is designed to give victims a greater voice in the \nprosecution of the criminals who injured them and their families, fill \nexisting gaps in Federal criminal law, guarantee that victims of crime \nreceive fair treatment and the respect they deserve, and achieve these \ngoals in a way that respects the efforts of the States to protect \nvictims in ways appropriate to each State's unique needs.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Kyle and Senator Feinstein, who are the \nlead sponsors of the proposed Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment, \nin moving forward on victims' rights legislation now. Our bill is \ncalled the ``Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Lourana \nGillis and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act,'' and is named in honor \nof five persons who were victims of crime. Our bill provides victims \nwith a number of important rights, including the right to receive \nnotice of public proceedings; to receive notice of the release or \nescape of the accused; to attend and be heard at proceedings involving \nrelease, plea, or sentencing; to confer with the government's attorney; \nand to receive full and timely restitution as provided by law. The bill \nalso provides for the enforcement of these rights, by directing \ngovernment officials to notify victims of their rights, requiring \ncourts to grant these rights to victims, and giving standing to both \nprosecutors and victims or their legal representatives to assert the \nrights at trial and on appeal.\n  The legislation will protect all victims of crime, including victims \nof identity theft, personal property theft, fraud, embezzlement, \nvandalism, and other non-violent offenses. The National Center for \nVictims of Crime has\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\nemphasized the great importance of including protections for victims of \nnon-violent crime. Our legislation does so, and I commend the Center \nfor its leadership on this important aspect of the issue.\n  Our Victims' Rights Act also directs the Attorney General to act \nwithin a year to issue regulations to enforce the rights of crime \nvictims and ensure compliance by all relevant officials. The bill \nstrengthens victims' rights at the Federal, State, and local levels by \nauthorizing the use of Federal funds to establish programs to promote \ncompliance and develop state-of-the-art systems for notifying victims \nof important dates and developments in their cases.\n  Once this bill is enacted into law, we intend to monitor its \nimplementation by the Justice Department, other law enforcement and \ncriminal justice agencies, and the courts, so that we can take \nappropriate action, if necessary, to ensure that the victims' rights \nare protected, and also ensure that the effective functioning of the \nlaw enforcement and criminal justice system is not impaired. I commend \nmy colleagues for their leadership in making this legislation possible, \nand I urge the Senate approve it. We know that victims of crime have \nbeen waiting too long for our action, and hopefully this long-needed \nmeasure is finally on the fast track for enactment into law.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Crime Victims' \nRights Act.\n  America is a country ruled by law and not by individuals. For that \nreason, our criminal justice system serves as a beacon of light for \nmany who live in the shadow of tyranny. Nowhere is this better \ndemonstrated than those rights of the accused protected by the U.S. \nConstitution. A defendant has the right to due process under law, the \nright to a speedy trial, the right to counsel, the right against self-\nincrimination, the right to confront witnesses as well as a host of \nother protections. These constitutional rights aim to protect the \ninnocent and punish only the guilty. No American should be wrongly \nincarcerated and denied the most basic liberties.\n  While the Constitution provides a panoply of rights for the accused, \nit does not guarantee any rights to crime victims. Victims do not have \nthe right to be present during prosecution. Victims do not have the \nright to be informed of the defendant's hearing. They do not have the \nright to be heard at sentencing or at parole hearings. Victims have no \nrights to restitution or notification even if they may be endangered by \nthe release of their attacker.\n  To maintain the integrity of our judicial system, a careful balance \nmust be struck between the rights of the accused and the rights of \nvictims. Unfortunately, the scales of justice have been tilted. As a \nresult, 32 States have enacted constitutional amendments to provide \nsome protections for victims. Today, I am proud to have joined my \ncolleagues in sponsoring and voting in favor of the Crime Victims' \nRights Act which would extend rights to victims of federal crimes as \nwell. Nationally, this sends a clear message to victims that they will \nfinally be given a voice in the Federal criminal process.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to recognize the leaders of the \nvictim's rights movement in my home state. Established in 2000, the \nNational Crime Victim Law Institute has been committed to the \nenforcement and protection of victims' rights in the criminal justice \nsystem. While there has been a flood of legislation at the State level \non victims' rights, there has been a dearth of academic attention paid \nto this area of the law. The National Crime Victim Law Institute, at \nthe Lewis and Clark School, is one of the first academic institutions \nto undertake a focused effort to study and enhance the effectiveness of \nvictim rights laws. The Institute's Executive Director, Doug BeLoof, \nhas authored Victims in Criminal Procedure, the first casebook to be \npublished in this area of law.\n  Along with this important legal scholarship, passage of this \nlegislation is an important step in the fight to protect victims' \nrights. I look forward to President Bush signing this legislation into \nlaw.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I do not see others seeking time so I \nreserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding Senator Leahy still \nhas time remaining under his control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. How much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19.5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, using Senator Leahy's time, I will proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Patriot Act and Senator Kerry\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during this lull, prior to the vote on this \nlegislation that has been changed from a constitutional amendment to a \nstatute, I would like to take a few minutes hopefully to clear some of \nthe confusion about the record of my colleague, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, John Kerry. This relates to the PATRIOT Act.\n  First of all, everyone should understand John Kerry voted for the \nPATRIOT Act. This, of course, is a man who volunteered to fight for our \ncountry in the jungles of Vietnam. He risked his life to keep America \nsafe. He was wounded on three separate occasions, received two medals \nfor heroism for his acts above and beyond the call of duty. These were \nall in an effort to keep our Nation safe and strong.\n  Like most of us who voted for the PATRIOT Act, Senator Kerry believed \nit gave law enforcement officials essential tools they needed in the \nwar against terror.\n  He not only voted for the PATRIOT Act, he actually authored parts of \nit. Senator Kerry helped draft the money-laundering provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act. He believes that provision should be strengthened to \ninclude nonbank institutions and increase funding for information \ngathering and sharing. These provisions have helped choke financial \nsupport to terrorist groups.\n  When Congress enacted the PATRIOT Act we gave it a sunset clause so \nwe, the Senate, the Congress, and the American people, could see how it \nworked. We understood we were giving the Government unprecedented power \nand we would want to come back later and fine-tune the balance between \nthe power of Government and the personal rights of citizens.\n  Some parts of the PATRIOT Act will expire in approximately 20 months. \nFrankly, with all the important issues and business this Senate has yet \nto address, I don't understand why we have had a series of speeches on \nthe Senate floor about making permanent the PATRIOT Act. It will not \nexpire, as I have indicated, for 20 more months. At some point we will \nhave to decide which parts of the PATRIOT Act should be reviewed, \nrenewed, expanded, or in some way limited in some instances.\n  Senator Kerry wants to extend more than 95 percent of the provisions \nof the PATRIOT Act. That is, so everyone is very clear, Senator Kerry \nbelieves 95 percent of the PATRIOT Act should remain as it is. But \nkeeping America strong, as Senator Kerry believes, also means \nprotecting our individual rights and privacy. Keeping America free \nmeans keeping a rein on the power of Government, so Senator Kerry does \nsupport some adjustments to the PATRIOT Act along with a number of \nother Senators, including the ``liberals'' Craig and Sununu. I say that \nfacetiously because Senator Craig and Sununu are anything other than \nprogressives.\n  I am also a cosponsor of the amendment Senator Kerry suggests should \nmake adjustments to this act.\n  Nobody has ever accused any of these Senators--Senators Craig, \nSununu, or Kerry--of being soft on terrorism. They are resolute in \ntheir commitment to protect our Nation from terror. But they are also \nresolute in their commitment to protect our individual rights and our \nfreedom--just like John Kerry.\n  Senator Kerry believes we need to improve the PATRIOT Act by making \nsome changes in the provisions of a\n\n[[Page S4277]]\n\ncouple of wiretaps, sneak-and-peek warrants, and the seizure of \nbusiness and library records.\n  He isn't alone. The House of Representatives voted 309-118 to ban \nfunds for these so-called ``sneak and peek'' searches, which allow \ngovernment agents to surreptitiously search the homes of citizens, \nwithout ever notifying them.\n  Senator Kerry wants to strengthen the Patriot Act in other areas, by \nadding new legal and organizational tools to fight terror.\n  He has been and will be tough on terror, and he will keep America \nsafe. He knows that the Patriot Act is just one of the many weapons we \nneed in that fight against terror.\n  Senator Kerry understands that we need to improve the lines of \ncommunication between different intelligence agencies, and between \nfederal and local officials. He believes that appropriate state and \nlocal authorities should have immediate access to national terrorist \nlists and 24-hour operations center should be created to link local and \nfederal law enforcement. It is called communication.\n  Senator Kerry has called for tighter protection of chemical factories \nthat could be targeted by terrorists. I am a cosponsor of that \nlegislation. Bowing to the chemical industry, the Bush administration \nhas opposed common sense measures to improve security of 123 chemical \nplants where the EPA says a terrorist attack could kill or injure one \nmillion people. John Kerry knows that we have to do a better job \nprotecting these potential targets.\n  Senator Kerry understands that we must give our police, firefighters \nand other first responders the equipment and training they need to \nrespond to terrorist attacks. Right now, they aren't getting everything \nthey need, and the result could be tragic.\n  Finally, Senator Kerry knows that we aren't doing everything we \nshould to keep our seaports safe. Ninety five percent of our trade \noutside North America moves by sea, and most of that is concentrated in \na handful of ports. Senator Kerry understands that our economy and our \nnational security both depend on keeping our ports safe. We need to \ndevelop security standards for our ports, invest in a system of \ncontainer security and provide more customs inspectors.\n  These are common sense measures to protect our homeland. Every day \nthat we delay, we leave ourselves open to potential acts of terrorism.\n  I hope my colleagues won't impugn Senator Kerry's commitment to \nnational security just because he is concerned about safeguarding our \npersonal rights and privacy.\n  I understand we don't all agree on the need for measures like ``sneak \nand peek'' searches of American citizens or improving security at our \nseaports.\n  Let's debate those differences--but let us never suggest that any \nMember of this body is not committed to keeping America strong and \nsafe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, be added as a cosponsor of \nthe legislation before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will say a few words in conclusion \nto my remarks.\n  I believe the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, will be coming back \nto the floor to make a small technical modification to the amendment \nsince questions have been developed and they can be easily taken care \nof. I believe he will do that. Otherwise, I think everyone who is going \nto speak on this has spoken.\n  I would like to end by saying how grateful I am for this day. This is \nan important day for many of us who care about victims' rights--I think \nevery Member of this Senate--because for the first time we have a \nstrong and comprehensive measure to be able to achieve a compendium of \nvictims' rights. That compendium will give victims access to the \ncriminal justice system so they may retain their dignity; so they have \nan opportunity to know when there is a trial and be present at the \ntrial; to make statements if there is a public proceeding with respect \nto a plea bargain; to be there to make a statement; to receive \nrestitution, if offered by a judge; to know when their attacker is \nreleased from jail or prison--not too much, but certain basic, \nelemental rights for anyone who has either been the victim of or has \nbeen dramatically affected by a crime.\n  I am very proud of the work on this. I have worked with Senator Kyl \nfor a long time, and now with Senators Hatch and Leahy as well.\n  I thank everybody who has been involved.\n  I particularly would like to thank my staff, Steven Cash and Dave \nHantman, who over the years I think have grown more determined to get \nthis job done.\n  I am hopeful we will have a unanimous vote in this body, that the \nbill will be accepted by the House, and we will be able to say to \nvictims all across this country there is a Federal statute with a \nremedy and a method of enforcement that will guarantee the very basic \nrights in Federal crimes; and also the funding to be able to go out and \nsecure some of those same rights under State law.\n  I thank everybody. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia for her excellent work, and also the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona for his excellent work on this. They have worked on this \nyear after year until we have finally reached this point where I \nbelieve we can get a bill through the Congress even though it is almost \nimpossible to get a constitutional amendment through the Congress on \nthis very important subject.\n  I rise today in support of S. 2329, The Crime Victims' Rights Act. \nThe issue addressed by this legislation--protecting the rights of \nvictims of crime--is one of utmost importance to the American people.\n  At the outset, let me commend the efforts of Senators Kyl and \nFeinstein, who have worked tirelessly since 1996 to try to get the \ncrime victims' rights constitutional amendment passed.\n  No one has worked harder than these two Senators in trying to protect \nvictims' rights. Over the last 8 years, they have met with countless \nvictims, listened to their tragic stories, held hearings, drafted and \nredrafted constitutional language, and consulted with academics, \noutside experts and governmental officials to make sure they got it \njust right.\n  While I know their preference is to pass a constitutional amendment--\nand that would have been my preference as well--they have now prudently \nopted to pursue a statutory remedy.\n  I am especially pleased that the ranking minority member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, is joining us in this initiative.\n  When we last debated victims' rights, it was in April of 2000. There \ncan be no question that the world has irrevocably changed since then.\n  Four years ago, many could not truly appreciate what it means to be a \nvictim of violence. Today, in the post-9/11 era, it is impossible not \nto empathize with victims. I am sure that none of us will forget the \nimage of planes crashing into the World Trade Center. None of us will \nforget the image of victims jumping out of windows to avoid the flames \nthat were creeping up the buildings. None of us will forget the images \nof two of the tallest buildings in the world crumbling to the ground \nlike a house of cards with the victims trapped underneath the rubble. \nAnd none of us will forget the gaping hole in the side of the Pentagon \nand the grief of the families of those that died that day.\n  In that single day, nearly 3,000 victims died in New York City and \nWashington, D.C. Yet as horrific as that statistic is, it cannot be \ncompared to the more than five million violent crimes that are \ncommitted in the United States every year. Yet the victims of these \nviolent crimes, as well as their families and loved ones, continue to \nsuffer in silence. Some of them are not able to obtain notice of \ncriminal proceedings; they are not permitted to remain in the courtroom \nwhile the trial is ongoing regardless of whether they are expected to \nbe called as a potential government witness. That is why I am an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 2329.\n\n  Let me give a couple of examples of why we need this legislation.\n  On December 2, 1998, Jeffrey Weller, who was only 23 years old, was \nmurdered by his childhood friend. The\n\n[[Page S4278]]\n\nfriend showed up at Jeff's home, where he lived with his new wife of 2 \nmonths. While the two men were sitting in a car, the murderer attacked \nJeff with a knife. Jeff managed to get out of the car and run, but was \nshot once in the back. The man then shot Jeff again at point-blank \nrange in the head. Although the defendant was arrested, convicted and \nsentenced to 10 years in prison, he was released after serving only 4 \nyears. Jeff's family was denied a restraining order against the killer \nand was told to contact local law enforcement if he comes on the \nproperty. In January 2002, the killer kidnapped and murdered Jeff's 5-\nyear old son and committed suicide. It is for families like the Wellers \nthat we need to pass this bill--and there are so many. Yet, S. 2329 \ngives victims the right to be reasonably protected from the accused.\n  In my home state of Utah, Pam Kouris lost her 11-year old son, \nMichael, when he was hit by a car while riding his bicycle. The \nnegligent driver was a police officer who was under the influence of \npain killers, muscle relaxers and Valium. He ultimately pled guilty but \nhe was not sentenced until 5\\1/2\\ years after Michael's death and he \nreceived probation. It is for people like Pam that we are passing this \nlegislation to protect her right to proceedings free from unreasonable \ndelay.\n  In addition to those rights, the bill also establishes other \nfundamental rights for victims, including the right to reasonable \nnotice of public criminal proceedings, the right not to be excluded \nfrom those proceedings, and the right to be heard reasonably when a \ncourt is considering a criminal's release, plea or sentence. The bill \nalso guarantees victims the right to confer with a Government attorney, \nthe right to full and timely restitution, the right to proceedings free \nfrom unreasonable delay, and importantly, the right to be treated with \nfairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.\n  The bill also directs the Department of Justice to promulgate \nregulations to enforce these rights and to create an administrative \nauthority to receive and investigate complaints relating to the \nviolation of the rights of crime victims. This administrative remedy \ncreates a framework to quickly enforce victims' rights.\n  Moreover, the bill provides that victims will have standing to sue in \nFederal court if they are wrongly denied these rights. For those who \nmay be concerned that this bill might lead to new tort causes of \naction, let me assure you, that victims are not seeking to sue the \ngovernment and get rich. All the victims want is a chance to \nparticipate in the criminal justice process. Accordingly, the bill \nstates that there will be no cause of action for damages.\n  Public support for victims' rights protection is very strong. All 50 \nstates have some form of victims' rights measures at a statutory or \ncourt-based level and 33 states have passed state constitutional \namendments to protect victims' rights.\n  In sum, this bill has strong bipartisan support and I strongly urge \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for this important \nlegislation.\n  It is time to quit playing around and get this done. It is time to do \nwhat is right. The constitutional amendment itself, had we been able to \nbring that up, has been criticized because people around here say we \nshould never amend the Constitution, it is perfect as it is.\n  One reason some members want to amend the Constitution is to get it \nback to where it really was. In other words, we have courts that have \ngone way beyond the pale and have amended the Constitution by judicial \nfiat. Most of these constitutional amendments, I have found through the \nyears, have been to get the Constitution back where it really belongs, \naway from rogue judges just deciding on their own to amend the \nConstitution because they are in a position that some believe, as \nFederal judges, is the closest thing to God in this life. Frankly, some \nof them take advantage of that.\n  In the process, we wish we could get back to where the people rule \nand where the Constitution was before they changed it by judicial fiat. \nThere are a number of reasons why judicial fiat has changed the laws \nwith regard to victims' rights. Frankly, this bill will get us back to \na point where we will be making headway on victims' rights and \nprotecting the rights of those who have been suffering far too long.\n  I compliment my two dear friends and colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee and others in this Congress who have worked so hard to see \nthis come to fruition.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to comment on the \npassage today of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. I am gratified by the \noverwhelming, bipartisan support for this crucial legislation.\n  I especially thank the Senator from Arizona, Jon Kyl, and the Senator \nfrom California, Dianne Feinstein, for their labor over the past \nseveral years on behalf of a constitutional amendment, and for their \nefforts over the past days to write into Federal law appropriate \nprotections for victims of crime across the country. Without their \ndedication we would not have this victory.\n  While a constitutional amendment is preferable, this victims' rights \nFederal statute represents a significant improvement over the status \nquo. It ensures that crime victims have the right to fair treatment in \nthe criminal justice system. It will give crime victims new legal \nstanding to enforce their rights in court.\n  Too often, victims are shut out of the criminal justice process. They \naren't informed of hearings, plea deals, trial dates and sentencing, or \nof parole hearings once their attacker is convicted.\n  The system rightly strives to protect the rights of defendants. But \ntoo often it overlooks the rights of the victims.\n  Take, for example, the case of Jeanne Brykalski of Knoxville, TN. \nNine years ago, Jeanne lost both of her parents in a double homicide.\n  It was a Friday night, Jeanne's parents, Lester and Carol Dotts, went \nout for dinner. When they returned, they surprised three burglars in \nthe act of looting their home.\n  Jeanne's mother was shot seven times, once at point-blank range in \nthe head. Her father was shot six times, first in the neck and then \nrepeatedly while he lay crumpled on the floor. The assailants seized \nJeanne's mother's purse. And in a final grisly act, stole her father's \nwallet from his back pocket as he lay dying.\n  Jeanne's parents would have celebrated their 45th anniversary that \nsummer.\n  She tells my office:\n\n       Something like this you never get over. At first you don't \n     sleep. You can't sleep, because when you close your eyes, \n     horrible images flood your mind. When you finally can sleep, \n     that's when the nightmares come.\n\n  Jeanne found out about the first of the three perpetrators' public \nhearings on the front page of the local paper. As Jeanne recounts it, \none morning before work, her husband went outside to fetch the paper \nfrom the delivery box. He came back in and tossed it on the kitchen \ntable, telling her, ``You'll want to read this.''\n  Says Jeanne:\n\n       I saw the headline, and of course had to keep reading. And \n     then I found out for the first time the gruesome details of \n     how my parents were murdered. I completely fell apart. And I \n     still had to go to work that day.\n\n  Jeanne says it took a long time for the justice system to acknowledge \nher need to be a part of the process. In fact, on three occasions, she \nshowed up for hearings that she was never told were canceled. The \nyoungest of the perpetrators was plea bargained without Jeanne and her \nhusband being informed.\n  Her experience with the system led her to become a volunteer for the \nEast Tennessee Victims' Rights Task Force.\n  Says Jeanne:\n\n       All we want is equality and fair play in the courtroom. We \n     want to be treated with courtesy and respect. I don't think \n     that's too much to ask for.\n\n  Mr. President, nor do I. And that is why I strongly support the Crime \nVictims' Rights Act and look forward to getting this bill to the \nPresident's desk.\n  My home State of Tennessee has a Victims Bill of Rights. It was \npassed in November of 1998.\n  Anna Whalley, clinical coordinator of the Shelby County Crime Victims \nCenter, tells my office that the law has improved the status of victims \nin the Tennessee justice system. Judges are now getting used to seeing \nvictims in their courtrooms and are making their courtrooms more \ncomfortable and accommodating.\n  Because the Tennessee law does not provide funding, however, victims \ncontinue to fall through the cracks. There simply is not enough money \nto stay on top of all of the cases and keep victims informed throughout \nthe judicial process.\n  The Crime Victims' Rights Act wisely addresses this problem. It \nprovides legal assistance grants to help local law enforcement agencies \npromote victims' rights.\n  It also authorizes over $97 million over the next 5 years to broadly \ncarry out the legislation's goals.\n  Mr. President, we are not all the way there. Our ultimate goal is to \npass a victims' rights constitutional amendment. But this legislation \nrepresents a significant leap forward.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support today.\n  As we all agree, victims have rights, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4280-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I have up to 10 minutes, but I do not \nbelieve I will use that, if anybody is wondering.\n  I rise to speak about a disaster that has occurred within the last 24 \nhours in the country of North Korea. We now have on the wire service \nrecognition of the fact that there was a train wreck in North Korea \nwhere two trains ran into each other. It appears that between 1,000 and \n3,000 people were killed. One report says 1,000 and another report says \n3,000. In the meantime, the North Koreans have cut off the telephone \nlines to the area and have closed the border, so considering the nature \nof the country, I do not know when we will find out how many.\n  The reason I rose to talk about it is because the substances that we \nhave been told were in those trains do not come close to the explosive \npower of liquefied natural gas. They are some kind of a liquefied \npetroleum and another product like propane, and it must have been \nsufficient power for this to ignite and blow up.\n  Why would I bring this subject up on the Senate floor? Well, I say to \nmy colleagues, the Nation we live in has been on such an absurd path \nwith reference to diversifying our energy resources that we are \ncurrently thinking about using liquefied natural gas in large \nquantities to take the place of natural gas, which is getting higher \nand higher in demand and less and less in terms of supply. I believe we \nought to get on with producing as much natural gas from our own sources \nas possible. I believe the natural gas from the State of Alaska ought \nto be brought on board and we ought to help pay for the pipeline which \nwill be the largest and most expensive construction job in our history, \nbut it will transport voluminous quantities of natural gas and it will \nbe ours. It will not be liquefied natural gas from Algeria, Tunisia, or \nwherever it comes from.\n\n  We are inviting the opposite. We are inviting States, principally in \nthe eastern part of the United States--at least it is not the West or \nthe South again. But I would like to make sure other parts of the \ncountry understand that if they have been holding out and not wanting \nus to get this energy bill passed because they think this is some \neasier way--like we can solve this with wind instead of natural gas--\nyou know it just is not true. We cannot produce enough wind energy to \ntake the place of the natural gas shortage we are going to have if we \ndon't get on with producing it as fast as we can, in as large \nquantities as we can, and from safe sources, safe in terms of \nreliability and safe in terms of the environment.\n  We are going to hear more about this. I am sorry that I come to the \nSenate floor with such drastic statements about energy and the \ndestruction of people and property because of this collision involving \nenergy sources. But I can tell you, what the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources has been suggesting we do is so much less risky than \nthis, this fuel that exploded, that I almost wonder what is it going to \ntake to bring us to our senses.\n  There are Northern and Eastern States saying, once they hear about \nLNG, they don't want it either. But I can tell you, there is not going \nto be any gas for parts of our country and it is not going to be \nimported from the West to the East; it is going to be brought to where \nit is needed. We are going to see people who are now talking with \npermittees who want to build plants, refineries, bases where you can \nharbor and hold liquefied natural gas.\n  Unless one of those trains had LNG, and I don't think it did, we \nhaven't seen anything yet. If you killed 1,000 and wounded 1,000 and \nblew up a town with two trains running into each other and one of them \nwas not LNG, then whatever we know about will be less volatile than \nLNG. So we could be looking at a more disastrous situation.\n  I also suggest while we are talking about terrorism, just think of \nthat. If we have to bring in shipload after shipload of natural gas, \njust think of what we are going to have to do to make sure it is not \npart of a terrorist plan to blow up part of our country.\n  I for one hope we don't have to bring very much in, but I am sure, \nwith what has been going on--and I am sure the occupant of the chair \nshares my concern--we ought to be very careful. We ought to take on the \nissue of, can we get some nuclear powerplants built in a safer way than \nin the past? Can we produce some truly clean coal-burning plants? We \ncan bring solar, wind, and geothermal on. We can give them subsidies, \nall that are in this bill which we will not bring up today.\n  I think for those who are looking at that terrible country, terrible \nin terms of the nature of the existence of the people in North Korea, \nwe can do nothing but shake our heads in fear and trepidation. I just \nfinished reading a book about North Korea. As a Senator from a free \ncountry, to just read what is going on in that country just scares me \nto death. How the people can be so ravaged, so disgraced as human \nbeings by that regime, and then to have something like this happen to \nthem makes me terribly unhappy to be part of leadership in this world, \nthat we can still let that eyesore of terrible proportions exist. Here \nis another one--3,000 people. Just absolutely pathetic.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, like all of my colleagues, I went back home \nduring the Easter recess and listened to the feelings of Oregonians. It \nis clearly on the minds of the people of my State and much of the \ncountry the circumstance we find ourselves in Iraq. I thought I would \ncome and share some of my perspective on where America is, as this one \nSenator sees it, in the war on terrorism.\n  I shared these feelings with many of my constituents. I wanted to \nshare them with the Senate today as my reflections on the week I have \njust had.\n  When I first came to the Senate 7 years ago, I was privileged to \nspend my first term as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I came to the Senate with many preconceived views about the \nvalues of many of our alliances and our involvement in all kinds of \ninternational architecture--the United Nations, NATO, and many \ntreaties. I have been an advocate of these institutions and treaties on \nmany occasions. But I find myself now in a position where I am \nquestioning some of my earlier positions, based upon my experience as a \nSenator.\n  My questioning first began when I watched with dismay the U.N. \nessentially stand by as nearly 1 million Rwandans were hacked to death.\n  I watched with further dismay when approximately a quarter of a \nmillion Bosnian Muslims were murdered in cold blood by Mr. Milosevic \nand his minions, and I wondered why they couldn't do anything?\n  I remember the occasion when a number of us were invited to meet with \nPresident Clinton as our European allies were pleading with the \nPresident to intervene with them as Europeans to help stop genocide on \nEurope's backdoor. I remember saying to the President: Mr. President, I \nthink stopping genocide is a value that I share with the international \ncommunity, it certainly is and ought to be an American value. So, Mr. \nPresident, you have my support, but I urge you to seek a resolution \nfrom the Security Council so we go in with the ``legitimacy'' of the \nUnited Nations.\n  He said to me: Senator, I can't because I have been promised a U.N. \nresolution to intervene to stop genocide in Kosovo would be vetoed by \nthe Russians and the Chinese.\n  President Clinton believed that was a value high enough that nobody \nought to veto it, and America's hand should not be held back by such a \nveto. I could not have agreed with him more.\n  As a Republican, I voted with President Clinton consistently in our \nefforts to bail out our European friends in Kosovo to stop genocide. I \nam proud of those votes. I am proud of President Clinton for that. But \nI left the experience scratching my head about the United Nations and \nits role in the security architecture of our planet and particularly my \ncountry.\n  Then after 9/11, I heard lots of great speeches and then began to \nbecome aware of lots of wonderful resolutions and was so disappointed \nthat there was no resolve in the resolutions; that it ended at words.\n  Now we find ourselves confronted with an investigation in the United \nNations in which an oil for food program is going to be revealed to all \nthe world as a monstrous corruption. It would be better titled a \n``Fraud for Food Program.'' I wonder how well served we are by a \nSecurity Council that would tolerate such a thing.\n  I am not suggesting we withdraw from the United Nations, but I am \ntelling you I believe we should question that is the place we go for \nlegitimacy. I have concluded that the U.N. can do a few things well. \nMr. Brahimi's efforts are to be applauded and gratitude expressed, but, \nfrankly, to go there for legitimacy, as some suggest, I think is very \nmisplaced because we cannot get legitimacy from the kind of corruption \nthat has been engaged in the United Nations in its ``Fraud for Food \nProgram.''\n  What happened here, as Mr. Volcker will soon reveal to the world, is \na system of price fixing, price kiting, skimming, bribes, paybacks in \nwhich the United Nations bureaucracy, or at least some members of it, \nwere deeply complicit. What Saddam Hussein got out of that, according \nto the Washington Post, was $4 billion. According to the New York \nTimes, it is $10 billion. According to other estimates, it could run as \nhigh as $100 billion. Somewhere in that range the truth will be found.\n  What did he do with the billions, whether it is 4 or 100? He went \nabout systematically rebuilding his murderous machine to buy weapons \nand palaces and to exterminate about 400,000 Shiite Muslims. Then I \nwonder why it is we are going to the U.N. for resolutions for \nlegitimacy.\n  I tell you these things because, frankly, I was astounded when our \nfriend and colleague, the Democratic presumptive nominee for President, \nwas on ``Meet the Press.'' When asked what was the first thing he would \ndo, he said: I will go back to the U.N.\n  I remember Dwight Eisenhower, when he became the Republican nominee, \nwe were in trouble in Korea. He said: I will go to Korea. And John \nKerry is essentially saying: I will go to Paris. For what? Legitimacy? \nInternational involvement? We have gone to the U.N. and gotten 17 \nresolutions. Apparently, another is needed? For what? Legitimacy?\n  We are going to get people to sanction what we are doing when we will \nsoon learn who was on the take and providing the money that Saddam \nHussein used for palaces, weapons, and mass murder.\n\n  I hope John Kerry runs his new ad in Oregon a lot because he repeats \nhis ``Meet the Press'' statement in a slightly different version. He \nsays: The first thing I will do is internationalize this. I will go to \nthe international community.\n  I want the people of Oregon to know how vacuous a statement that is. \nI want my friend from Massachusetts to know I don't want the \ninternational community defending my family and my country. I know the \nAmerican people want a sense of how do we get out of this because we \ndon't want an open-ended commitment.\n  I hear it said by some of our European friends: You did it for oil. I \ntell the American people, if we had done it for oil, we would have \ninvaded Venezuela. There is a lot of oil there, and they have no \nmilitary. We did it for values. We did it because we believed in a \npost-9/11 world that Saddam Hussein was part and parcel of the war on \nterrorism. We believed, like all the other intelligence communities in \nthe world, that he had weapons of mass destruction because he had \ndeclared them but not disclosed them. That is why Bill Clinton bombed \nSaddam Hussein for 4 days and nights in 1998. That is why this place, \nthe United States Senate, under the direction and urging of Bill \nClinton, passed a resolution calling for regime change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, we passed the resolution on regime change. \nIn a post-9/11 world, with that intelligence that we had from President \nClinton's administration and with that belief that he was a clear and \ngrowing danger to this country, and for all the reasons which President \nBush has articulated, we did what President Clinton said we would \nultimately have to do: Change that regime.\n  I tell you, my belief is that those who would say the war on \nterrorism is here, but Saddam Hussein is somehow exempted from that, \nare engaging in a theory because the truth is, he was, by every \nmeasure, a central financier and tormenter of terrorism. Ask the \nIsraelis.\n  Where did Hamas get its money? There is a way out. There is a \ndeadline that is drawing out of the shadows all those who want to \ncompete for power. A lot of poison is being drained out of\n\n[[Page S4283]]\n\nthe Iraqi system and America is bearing the burden, but we will see a \ngradual transition of power and sovereignty from us to the Iraqi people \nbecause our country does not aspire to the territory or treasury or \noilfields of Iraq. We desire a more peaceful world.\n  President Bush has concluded, yes, we can swat flies and we can send \ncruise missiles here and there, but the truth is, if the fundamentals \non the ground cannot be changed to give the people some democratic \ninstitutions, frankly, nothing is going to be changed in the Middle \nEast.\n  Now, there is a very tribal culture there and ultimately Iraq may be \nevolving into a three-part state, with Kurds in the north and Shia in \nthe south and Sunnis in the center, and there may be a very loose \nconfederacy of Iraq, but to avoid civil war they will have to have some \nreligious and ethnic elbowroom as Iraqis. We are going to allow that to \nhappen, I hope.\n  I say to the people of my State, regard with humor if you can but \ngreat skepticism if you will those who call for internationalizing \nAmerica's war on terrorism. They can come in any time. The problem is, \nthey are complicit in the financing of Saddam Hussein and they run at \nthe first shot.\n  Tony Blair recently addressed this body and the House of \nRepresentatives. In conclusion, I share with my colleagues his words. \nSaid the Prime Minister: I know how hard it is on America. And in some \nsmall corner of this vast country out in Nevada or Idaho, I know out \nthere is a guy getting on with his life perfectly happy, minding his \nown business, saying to you, the political leaders of the country, why \nme and why us and why America? And the only answer is because destiny \nhas put you in this place in history, in this moment of time, and the \ntask is yours to do.\n  This world is a better place because of American leadership and \nbecause America's foreign policy is still based on the best values of \nour Bill of Rights, democracy, human rights, the spread of freedom and \nenterprise through trade, religious freedom, thought, press, assembly. \nThings that we are privileged to take for granted are, frankly, unknown \nin the Middle East. This is our idealism and it is a centerpiece now of \nour foreign policy, but those who would go to the U.N. to establish \nthose principles, they will do it in vain and they will do it with my \nopposition, if to internationalize this means my family and theirs are \nprotected by institutions which the Russians, the French, the Chinese, \nor anyone can veto when it involves the security of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in his remarks yesterday, Senator Byrd \nraised serious questions about whether the Bush administration violated \nthe law when it first began to prepare for war with Iraq without \ninforming Congress it was using funds appropriated for other purposes \nto do so. Three days after 9/11, both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives approved $40 billion in emergency funds in response to \nthat tragedy. The legislation was signed into law on September 18, \n2001.\n  Its clearly stated purpose was ``to respond to the terrorist attacks \non the United States that occurred on September 11, 2001, to provide \nassistance to the victims of the attacks, and to deal with other \nconsequences of the attacks.''\n  When the Congress approved these funds images of the World Trade \nCenter towers falling and the plume of smoke over the Pentagon were \nfresh in the minds of every American, and the Nation was mourning the \nloss of 3000 men and women who were brutally murdered in the worst \nterrorist attack in our history.\n  We were at war with al-Qaida, a terrorist organization based in \nAfghanistan, and with the Taliban government that was giving it \nsanctuary. Congress was united in its determination to help the \nadministration win the war in Afghanistan and do all we could to \nprevent any further terrorist attacks.\n  Congress clearly did not intend those funds to be used for a war with \nIraq. There had been no debate about Iraq. We were not thinking about \nIraq in those painful and dark days after the 9/11 attacks.\n  But the administration was.\n  As we now know, the Bush administration was focused on Iraq from day \none after the inauguration, and it was quick to use the 9/11 tragedy to \nadvance its agenda on Iraq.\n  According to former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's account in Ron \nSuskind's book, ``The Price of Loyalty,'' Iraq was on the agenda at the \nvery first meeting of the National Security Council, just 10 days after \nPresident Bush's inauguration in 2001. As Secretary O'Neill said: \n``Getting Hussein was now the Administration's focus. From the start, \nwe were building the case against Hussein and looking at how we could \ntake him out and change Iraq into a new country. And, if we did that, \nit would solve everything. It was all about finding a way to do it. \nThat was the tone of it. The President saying, `Fine. Go find me a way \nto do this.' ''\n  September 11 gave the administration the excuse they were looking for \nto go to war with Iraq. According to notes taken by an aide to \nSecretary Rumsfeld on September 11, the very day of the attacks, the \nSecretary ordered the military to prepare a response to the attacks. \nThe notes quote Rumsfeld as saying that he wanted the best information \nfast, to judge whether the information was good enough to hit Saddam \nand not just Osama bin Laden. ``Go massive,'' the notes quote him as \nsaying. ``Sweep it all up. Things related and not.''\n  As Bob Woodward's new book, ``Plan of Attack'' reveals, President \nBush himself asked Secretary Rumsfeld to get a war plan for Iraq on \nNovember 21--barely 2 months after the devastating attacks. In the many \nmonths that followed, Congress had no idea that secret preparations for \nwar in Iraq were underway. It was not until September 2002, nearly 10 \nmonths later, that the administration even asked Congress to authorize \nwar in Iraq.\n  Senator Byrd is right to raise this issue and to ask the tough \nquestions. In a hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nTuesday, Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz gave us a non justification. \nHe said that the administration notified Congress about $63 million in \nmilitary construction spending for Iraq on October 11 2002--just 1 day \nafter Congress passed the joint resolution authorizing the use of force \nin Iraq. After that, Secretary Wolfowitz said, ``some $800 million were \nmade available over the following months to support Iraq preparatory \ntasks consistent with that joint resolution.''\n  But Mr. Wolfowitz's claim is inconsistent with the assertion in Bob \nWoodward's book that $700 million worth of ``preparatory tasks'' were \napproved in the summer of 2002 to accommodate the major U.S. troop \ndeployment that would be required for the invasion of Iraq.\n  Diverting funds from the war in Afghanistan or from the Pentagon's \nregular operating budget to prepare for war against Iraq without the \nknowledge of Congress is clearly a fundamental breach of the trust that \nmust exist between Congress and the President in our system of \ngovernment. It is clearly at odds with the requirement of the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act itself, which states that ``the \nPresident shall consult with the Chairmen and ranking minority members \nof the Committees on Appropriations prior to the transfer of these \nfunds.''\n  In the summer of 2002 when these plans were under way, the war \nagainst al-Qaida was far from over. Osama bin Laden was still at large. \nIf Mr. Woodward is correct, the failure even to consult with Congress \nshows the contempt of the Bush administration for the constitutional \nrole of Congress on the fundamental issue of war and peace.\n  We need satisfactory answers to many questions:\n  Did the administration divert funds provided to respond to the 9/11 \nattacks and spend them in the summer of 2002 to prepare for war in \nIraq?\n  If the administration did begin spending those funds in the summer of\n\n[[Page S4284]]\n\n2002, why did it not consult the Chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee as the law required.?\n  If the administration did begin spending such funds in the summer of \n2002, why did the quarterly reports provided to Congress not clearly \nindicate that projects were being funded to prepare for war with Iraq?\n  The failure to engage the Congress confirms what many of us have said \nall along. The administration had a hidden agenda from day one, and it \nshamelessly capitalized on fears created by 9/11 to advance that \nagenda.\n  The Congress and the American people deserve answers, and we deserve \nthem now. The administration must tell the full truth and provide to \nthe Congress and the American people a full accounting of all Iraq war \nrelated expenditures in 2002.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORNYN). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss with my colleagues two \nbills that I believe we are being negligent as a body in not taking up \nand passing. I am sure many of my colleagues are heading to the airport \nfeeling like this week we accomplished a lot, or maybe they feel they \ngave a lot of speeches. The world is obviously a very dangerous and \nthreatening place right now, and maybe my colleagues think if we get up \nand we communicate about that, we have done our job in Washington, DC. \nWell, the discussion is good, but action is even better when it comes \nto the American people. And there are two critical issues--two critical \nissues we have bipartisan support on, two critical issues both the \nHouse and Senate have passed legislation in the past to deal with and \non which we could pass legislation today--that we cannot put on the \npriority list to take up and take action to help the American people.\n  The first one is on the electricity grid and reliability. Now, some \nof my colleagues may remember that the blackout of last August 14 led \nto a report from a commission that was released more than two weeks \nago. When the blackout occurred last summer, we said that we were going \nto get to the bottom of how it happened and what we should do about it. \nThe No. 1 recommendation from that commission was to make reliability \nstandards mandatory and enforceable, with penalties for noncompliance. \nPeople across America probably woke up after that blackout and thought, \nwhat happened? How did this whole situation happen to us?\n  I can tell them how it happened. We do not have any mandatory rules \nin place for the electricity grid to make sure we protect consumers, \nthat there is a reliability backstop governing actions by these energy \ncompanies.\n  Why is there not? The independent system operators and utilities have \nrules, but they are not mandatory. In fact, the commission's report \nsaid First Energy, one of the key companies involved in last August's \nblackout, was not complying with the voluntary rules.\n  Well, I am sure they did not feel there was much penalty in not \ncomplying with these rules because they were voluntary. So the \ncommission's report is being very specific about what we should do. \nCongress needs to get about our business in passing legislation to make \nthese rules mandatory.\n  Now I know some people think, I have sat a night at home with candles \nor gotten the flashlight out or my fuse box goes out and it is not so \nbad. Well, I tell my colleagues, last August's blackout was a bad \nsituation. We had people in New York who could not get down elevators \nand lived many flights up in apartments. We had an increase of people \ngoing to emergency rooms in New York because they were having heart \nattacks or other kinds of things were happening to them physically. \nUnder the stress of trying to vacate many of the facilities in New \nYork, we had major gridlock for hours. We lost $4 billion to $10 \nbillion economically as the result of the blackout, and we put our \nsenior citizens at great risk of harm because they did not have access \nto electricity on a hot summer day.\n  So the question is, what are we going to do about this and are we \ngoing to move ahead? Well, I came to speak about this a couple of weeks \nago, before we adjourned for the recess. And since then, I find we have \nnow 20 different newspapers across America that basically have asked, \nwhy hasn't Congress operated and gotten this done?\n\n  For example, the Miami Herald--it is starting to get warm in Miami. \nPeople are realizing summer is not that far off and the Miami Herald \nstated that, ``Another long, hot summer is looming.'' These reliability \nbills should be enacted and they should be enacted now. That is not \nsurprising since they know what a blackout can do in the heat of a \nsummer.\n  Another newspaper, the Boston Globe, stated that ``at the top of the \ncommission's proposals is legislation that would make mandatory the \ngrid reliability standards that are now voluntary. Congress should \nquickly pass a bill . . . that would do just that.''\n  There is another newspaper that knows about this because its readers \nwere impacted by that electricity grid blackout last August. They know \nthe commission came back and recommended this is what we should do.\n  The reason I am bringing this issue up now is because I think some \npeople on the other side of the aisle think we are just going to take \nanother stab at the good old Energy bill. We are going to make another \nattempt to pass legislation that just about every newspaper in America \nhas editorialized against--a bill that myself and my colleagues have \ncalled legislation for hooters, polluters, and corporate looters, \nbecause those are the kinds of provisions that were included in the \nEnergy bill that drowned out the more notable items such as the \nreliability standards also buried in there.\n  Why are we going to continue to hold hostage legislation on \nreliability standards that would protect consumers across America from \nfuture blackouts, just to getting a big, fat energy bill for which \nthere is never enough support? My colleagues know how bad that \nlegislation is.\n  My colleagues want to continue to use the reliability standards, \nwhich all the blackout commissions and various organizations across \nAmerica have said consumers deserve as protection, as the train driving \nthe energy bill. My colleagues are going to say, no, we are going to \nkeep holding reliability hostage. We want to see if Congress blinks and \nmaybe will go ahead and pass that big energy bill.\n  Well, do not come to blame this side of the aisle when we do not get \nthe Energy bill and we do not have reliability standards, because we \nare trying to pass these standards, just as various newspapers across \nthe country are saying. In fact, I think the Detroit Free Press said it \nbest. They said `` . . . the solution lies with Congress. Nearly 8 \nmonths post-blackout, it still has not passed mandatory standards. \nVoters should turn on their power and demand it.''\n  I think what they mean is that voters should be demanding that we do \nour job. Reliability legislation could have been brought up any day \nthis week--Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. I understand my colleagues \nhave probably now gone to catch planes and meet other schedules, but \nthis could be brought up next week. We could make a commitment to have \nit brought up. I do not think there is controversy over this particular \nlegislation or the original provision as it was included in the Energy \nbill. It is just being used as bait and being held hostage.\n  So there are other newspapers across the country that say, ``a \nresponsible energy policy would be to strip out the mandatory federal \n[reliability] standards and pass them as a stand-alone bill.'' This is \nfrom the Memphis newspaper. The people in Memphis, TN, are asking, why \nare you doing this? Why are you continuing not to pass good legislation \njust so you can get bad legislation attached to it? When people across \nAmerica are asking, what is\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\ngoing on here, we ought to come together as a body and figure this out.\n  I do not like to be partisan about it because I would rather get it \ndone. I would rather pass it. But newspapers are starting to realize \nthat it is getting partisan. The Philadelphia Inquirer said that \nRepublicans were happy to consider the bill--meaning the Energy bill--\nhappy to consider taking up some of the Energy bill's tax incentives as \npart of a corporate tax bill. That meant we took those tax credits out \nof the Energy bill or were willing to consider some energy tax credit \non the FSC/ETI bill. So if we can do that, why can we not break out the \nreliability measure, why can we not take the reliability measure as \nstand-alone legislation?\n\n  Now, the head of the North American Electric Reliability Council came \nand spoke before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee just before \nthis report was being released. I asked him this very question. Their \njob is to try to provide reliability of energy to Americans throughout \nthis country. I asked: Should we pass a stand-alone bill? His response \nwas yes. Now, he was interrupted by the chairman, who then said: We do \nnot need to do that now.\n  Well, I disagree with the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and I think we should consider moving ahead. I \nthink that is what The Washington Post is saying. It said it would be a \nshame if there is insistence on the whole bill or nothing. That means \nholding reliability hostage. It means Congress would never get around \nto shoring up the electricity grid, and perhaps that is a shame, or \nperhaps shame is too mild a word.\n  Well, I know I think it is too mild a word because we have been \nwaiting since 1999 to get this legislation passed. By that, I mean we \nhave had blackouts in various parts of America since 1996, and every \ntime we have had one of those blackouts in those regions, people have \ncome to us in Congress and said that we ought to pass some rules so we \ncan get a mandatory reliability scheme in place and so utilities have \nto comply.\n  We have had multiple blackouts since 1996. This picture shows across \nAmerica where we have had blackouts since then. You can see the huge \namounts of territory in various States: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, \nCalifornia, Washington, up now to the northeastern part of Ohio, \nPennsylvania, New York. I ask my colleagues, are we going to wait until \nevery State in the country has a blackout and then finally say, ``Oh, I \nguess we get the message, I guess we ought to do something about it?''\n  I think the newspaper that said it best was the Indianapolis Star. \nThese newspapers across America have shone a bright light on what has \nbeen an issue that most Members would like to get away from and not pay \nattention to. The Indianapolis Star said it best:\n\n     . . . if the lights go out again this summer, spare the \n     investigation. Congress is to blame.\n\n  I think that paper said it best. This is about us doing our job. This \nis about the attempt to bring up other legislation that may or may not \nhave the agreement necessary for it to be passed, or to pass a cloture \nmotion. There is support for this legislation. There is a report that \ndemands our attention. There are consumers who are waiting for \nprotection. We should do our job.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate now turn to Calendar No. 465, S. \n2236, a bill to enhance the reliability of the electric system, that \nthe bill be read three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid on the table, without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nTexas, I object.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, that sums it up. I am going to be here \nevery day next week that we are in session, asking to pass this bill \nand asking my colleagues why, in the name of the American consumer and \nthe assurance of our economy that cannot afford to have an unstable \nelectricity grid with no rules and regulations, and energy companies \nthat do not have to meet mandatory requirements--why we are not \nprotecting these consumers.\n  Many of my colleagues know there is another issue this Senator \nbelieves has not gotten the attention of this body. Each month another \nset of unemployment and job creation numbers come out. And each month \nthe American public becomes more and more convinced that we are not \nliving up to the prediction and promise of 2.6 million jobs that were \nsupposed to be created this year. And because of that empty promise, \nthe American people want to know when this body will take up and pass \nlegislation to reinstate the unemployment compensation program.\n  This program was designed for times just like these. The Federal \ngovernment has an obligation to make sure this program is in place. \nWhat do you do during tough economic situations? You pass a Federal \nprogram to help ease the pain of those who are unemployed and cannot \nfind work.\n  In the Economic Report of the President, Mr. Bush's Administration \nprojected that this year we were going to create 2.6 million jobs. We \nare nowhere near that projection. In fact, last month was the first \nmonth we saw any real job growth at all. But, after just one month of \ndecent growth some people are saying that the economy is all better. \nBut, there are many economists who disagree. The Miami Herald ran this \nheadline:\n\n       Jobs Report: Mixed Messages. The White House gets a boost \n     from strong job growth, but economists say unemployment will \n     remain a problem.\n\n  Economists are saying it will remain a problem because the number of \njobs being created is a long way away from what we need to get America \nback to work. There are 8.4 million Americans out of work. After the \njob creation in March, 8.1 million of those Americans will still be out \nof work.\n  Here's what the Dayton Daily News said:\n\n       Maybe there are brighter days ahead. But that's no comfort \n     now to the unprecedented number of laid-off workers, who have \n     scrambled without success to find a job and . . . [they have] \n     lost the little bit of help given under the State \n     unemployment benefits programs.\n\n  So now those laid-off workers are looking to us for help. They want \nto know why they and their employers paid into the unemployment \ninsurance system if there's no program to help them when they need it. \nThere is $15.4 billion in the unemployment insurance trust fund--a fund \nthat was created for economic times like these--and the federal \ngovernment is not going to help us through this unemployment crisis.\n  What is really happening in this recovery is that there are 1.1 \nmillion jobless workers who have exhausted their benefits and are not \nreceiving additional support. That is the number. Those 1.1 million \npeople and the people who are following behind them want to point out \nto this Congress that the economy is not getting better at a fast \nenough pace to help them put food on the table today.\n  I think that drawing a comparison to the first Bush administration is \nhelpful because the first Bush administration faced a similar problem \nwith the economy in the early 1990s. That recession was not as deep as \nthe one we are dealing with today. In fact, during that recession we \nlost a total of 1.6 million jobs, while in this recession we lost a \ntotal of 2.6 million. But in the last recession, even after the economy \nhad started to create jobs, George H.W. Bush still extended \nunemployment benefits. The reason that administration passed an \nextension, even though job creation had started, was because they knew \nthat it was going to be a long road to get to a place where there were \nenough jobs for Americans who wanted and needed to work. They also knew \nthat unemployment benefits are a stimulus for the economy--the people \npay their mortgage, keep their health insurance, keep food on the \ntable, until the job creation engine of the private sector started \ngoing again. That is what the temporary federal benefits are. They are \ninsurance until the economy gets going again.\n  We have had this debate back and forth, too, about who is to blame \nabout this issue, or what is the big holdup. We have the Treasury \nSecretary who actually came to my State and said: We don't really \nbelieve that 2.6 million job creation number. Yes, the administration \nsaid it, but we don't think it is really going to happen. We don't know \nwhat the number is going to be.\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\n  So, we have the administration saying they really don't know how many \njobs will be created this year. Then we have had Mr. Greenspan, who \nmost people respect, come before a variety of committees. He just came \nbefore the Joint Economic Committee this week. When he was asked if we \nshould extend unemployment benefits, he said:\n\n       I do think it's a good idea, largely because of the size of \n     exhaustions.\n\n  What he is saying is that those 1.1 million people who have exhausted \ntheir jobs are out there to demonstrate that the economy isn't getting \nbetter at a fast enough pace. Therefore, we should continue the Federal \nprogram until we see more job creation.\n  That is what I think should happen. I see lots of people across the \ncountry who are very frustrated by this.\n  In fact, the Dayton News just in the last few weeks said:\n\n       GOP leaders still dodging jobless.\n\n  That is not this Democratic Senator saying this. This is a newspaper \nin a State that has been as hard hit by the loss of manufacturing jobs \nas my State has. Ohio and Washington are among the highest unemployment \nStates. They are saying GOP leaders are dodging the jobless. Why are \nthey saying that? Here's the answer of the Dayton paper:\n\n       What's troubling . . . is how some Republican leaders are \n     hoisting another ``Mission Accomplished'' banner, this one to \n     hide the struggle of more than a million unemployed workers \n     who have exhausted State benefits without finding another \n     job.\n       That is the Dayton paper saying that. That is not this \n     Senator.\n\n  I happen to agree with the paper's point, that we should take care of \nthese 1.1 million people Greenspan says are not getting help. The \neconomists are saying we are not recovering fast enough; give these \npeople the benefit. I believe the Senate must act.\n  That is what Business Week said:\n\n       Government actions will act as a bridge that will help the \n     economy cross over this extended valley of almost nonexistent \n     hiring.\n\n  That is Business Week.\n  Why do they say that? Because they know the best thing for us to do \nis pass the unemployment benefits and create a bridge until we see \nsubstantial job creation.\n  I can't think of a better source to listen to than Business Week, \nwhich analyzes business trends, or Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, when they say we ought to pass these benefits.\n  This is about the 16th or 17th time we have been to the floor. I know \npeople say we are working on something. People say, Let's compromise. \nLet us cut the program in half. But, Alan Greenspan didn't say cut the \nprogram in half. The Dayton newspaper didn't say cut it in half.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to Calendar No. 470, \nwhich is S. 2250, a bill to extend unemployment insurance benefits for \ndisplaced workers, that the bill be read three times and passed and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Texas, I \nobject.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Presiding Officer has been so kind to listen with \ninterest to these two issues. I hope he and my other colleagues will \ntake these two issues to heart. I am being pointed in my remarks today \nbecause I believe these are two issues this body has the responsibility \nto deal with. These are two issues we can't get done and we are holding \nthe American people hostage by not addressing our basic domestic \neconomic security needs by giving people jobs and the reliable security \nof electricity grids.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, today we had a vote on the motion to \nproceed to the asbestos bill. As a followup to that vote, the \nDemocratic leader and I have been in discussions over the course of the \nday. Unfortunately, we have yet to work through the legislative impasse \non asbestos. However, there are Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nare committed to getting something done.\n  This morning Senator Daschle and I confirmed our understanding that \nwe must provide an opportunity for negotiations which will determine \nwhether a bipartisan solution can be reached. We will oversee a \nmediation process to determine whether we can resolve the remaining \ndifferences. My hope is we can work through this quickly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, while I am disappointed that we find \nourselves in this situation, I am pleased we are now going to begin the \nnegotiations and move forward. As we have discussed, starting on \nMonday, we will convene meetings of interested stakeholders utilizing \nJudge Edward Becker as a mediator. I am strongly committed to getting \nthe bill done and working through the serious issues that still divide \nus. The issue of asbestos is too vitally important to let this \nopportunity slip away. I know Senator Frist is committed as well.\n  Mr. FRIST. I believe the process needs to initially focus on the \nmajor issues--overall funding, claims values, and projections. If we \ncan make progress on this front, I strongly believe we can resolve the \nothers.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I agree. I think the funding and the so-called economic \nissues are critical to finding a solution. If we can't get a fair \nfunding level that provides just compensation to victims and certainty \nto businesses, then we won't be able to resolve the other interlocking \nissues.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this evening I want to take a few minutes \nof the time of the Senate to pay tribute to and to say a public goodbye \nto Mary McGrory, a friend of long standing to me and my wife Ruth and \nto our daughters Amy and Jenny. Mary passed away last evening here in \nWashington after having had a long illness.\n  Mary McGrory was a wonderful, warm, witty, and wise woman. Her death \nis, indeed, a passing of an era when the written word could carry \nmeaning, when the written word could actually move people, when people \nlooked to a Mary McGrory to give them the kind of inspiration they \nneeded or to give them the in-depth analysis they needed to understand \nwhat was going on in Washington.\n  Her writing had such a clarity about it that once I read what Mary \nMcGrory had written, I found myself many times saying: Yes, that's how \nI feel. Why didn't I think of that? Why couldn't I have said it that \nway?\n  I think of her passing as the passing of an era, like there is a time \nand a place and a circumstance that happens in the passing of time when \ncertain individuals do something, make something, or leave an imprint \nin some way that you know will never happen again, such as the passing \nof a Michelangelo, a Leonardo da Vinci, a Shakespeare, a time and a \nplace for Shakespeare and his magnificent writings never to be seen \nagain. I think of that when I think of Mary McGrory because we may \nnever see her kind of writing ever again.\n  Oh, with the advent of computers, sound bites, trying to get \neverything into 30 seconds or trying to make everything so simple that \nit is reduced to meaningless jabber, it may be that we will never see \nher kind of writing again.\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\n  Mary McGrory could make words dance. She could make sentences sing \nand turn paragraphs into symphonies. But it was not just her writing \nalone that endeared so many of us to Mary. It was just Mary, such a \nunique individual. It is hard to describe sometimes. I guess moments \nlike this when you know you will never have her company again, you \nthink about the pleasant times you spent together.\n  Of course, I always think about Mary's annual St. Patrick's Day \nbash--party, if you will--at her home on Macomb Street. I didn't make \nevery one. Sometimes I was in Iowa on the weekend. It was always on the \nweekend before or after St. Patrick's Day. Usually before. But I made \nseveral of them.\n  They were wonderful affairs. There was, of course, music, a lot of \nsinging, and, of course, Mary McGrory's lasagna which was always kind \nof odd. One would think that maybe on St. Paddy's Day one would have \ncorned beef and cabbage, an Irish dish or Irish stew, something like \nthat, but we always had lasagna. Mary McGrory was very proud of her \nIrish heritage, but I always thought she felt a bit confused. While she \nwas Irish to the core, she loved Italy and loved going to Italy, and \nshe loved having lasagna on St. Patrick's Day.\n  She one time said, and I am paraphrasing because I don't remember the \nexact words: It is too bad the Irish could not have been born in Italy. \nAs I said, she was sometimes, I think, a little confused whether she \nwanted to be more Irish or maybe more Italian, but she was Irish to the \ncore.\n  Her St. Patrick's Day events were wonderful occasions. There is that \nwonderful song about when Irish eyes are smiling, and something about \nthe lilt of Irish laughter, you can hear the angels sing. When Mary \nMcGrory's eyes lit up and when she laughed, she was all Irish and you \nreally could hear angels sing.\n  We always had music and songs. Everyone had to perform at Mary's St. \nPatrick's Day parties. Everyone had to perform. She always had people \nof talent there to play the piano or some musical instrument. Since I \nam musically challenged, and she knew this, I was always commissioned \nto sing. My song always thereafter was Mother McCree. I always \nsubstituted the words ``Mary McGrory'' for ``Mother McCree'' which \ndelighted her to no end.\n  Mary McGrory was a clever woman. She knew how to cajole, how to \nsometimes even plead, ask, prod, and act terribly helpless knowing that \nsomeone would pick up her suitcase, carry her belongings, get something \nfor her, and when that happened, and you would retrieve something or \ncarry something for her, do something for Mary, when you finished doing \nit, there was this twinkle in her eye and you knew you had been had one \nmore time. She was very clever.\n  Mary and my wife Ruth became fast and strong friends over gardening.\n  I enjoyed gardening, although I am not much of a gardener myself. I \nwould sit and listen to them talk about gardening, or Mary would come \nout to the house and my wife would take her around or ask her about \nthis flower or that flower. Of course, we would go to her place and \nthey would go out and look at Mary's flowers and what was wrong here \nand what should be planted there. I always felt my job was to go down \nto Connecticut Avenue and pick up something to eat and come back at the \nappropriate time when they had finished talking about gardening.\n  Much has been written and much will be written about Mary's \nbackground and where she went to school and what got her into \njournalism, but I think more should be said about the imprint she left \non so many people. She was not only a warm, wise, witty, and clever \nwoman, she was an inspirational woman to so many people.\n  After you had been with Mary, or after maybe reading one of her \ncolumns, you always felt better. You felt better about the world around \nyou. You felt better about things maybe you thought were going wrong. \nMaybe you were mad about something the Government was doing in one \nadministration or another. You read her column and you felt no matter \nhow bad things were, it was going to be okay; we were going to get \nthrough it; right would prevail; justice would triumph and people of \ngood will would take over.\n  There is an old folk song with this refrain: Passing through, passing \nthrough, sometimes happy, sometimes blue, glad that I ran into you. \nTell the people that you saw me passing through.\n  Well, Mary, you passed through and in your passing through you \ninspired us; you made us think; you prodded us to question, and always, \nto the end, gave us hope and courage that life will be better for those \nwho come after us.\n  So we say goodbye to Mary McGrory, thanks for passing through, thanks \nfor touching each of us so profoundly as you did when you passed \nthrough.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4287-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAIRNESS IN ASBESTOS INJURY RESOLUTION (FAIR) ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

My vote was not an endorsement of S. 2290 as it \nwas introduced in the Senate. I recognize that concerns have been \nraised about specific provisions of the bill, and I would consider \nsupporting amendments to S. 2290 if the Senate has an opportunity to \nfully debate this legislation.\n  However, I am very concerned about shortcomings in the current \nsystem, and support legislating a bipartisan solution that offers a \nfairer, more efficient process for compensating asbestos victims. For \nthis reason, I voted for cloture on S. 2290 in an effort to move the \ndebate forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4287-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4287-S4288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant Felix Delgreco\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Sgt. Felix Delgreco \nof the Connecticut Army National Guard, who was killed in action in \nIraq on Friday, April 9, at the age of 22.\n  Sgt. Delgreco was the first Connecticut National Guardsman to be \nkilled in Iraq. His unit, the C Company, 102nd Infantry, was based in \nBristol and had been deployed in Kuwait since March. It had been in \nBaghdad for less than 3 days when Sgt. Delgreco was killed.\n  Felix Delgreco enlisted in the Guard in 1999, while he was still in \nhigh school. Before he went overseas this year, he had been deployed \ntwice once on a peacekeeping effort in Bosnia in 2001, and once in 2003 \nto West Point for a homeland security mission.\n  Felix Delgreco was not ordered to go to Iraq. No one forced him to \nget on a plane. He volunteered. Felix Delgreco was an American patriot \nwho wanted to serve his country and to help build a brighter future for \nthe people of Iraq. He took it upon himself to make a difference in his \ncommunity and in his world.\n  Felix Delgreco's friends say he was a friendly, outgoing young man \nwho could fit in anywhere. He enjoyed writing poetry and playing music, \nand worked backstage during school plays at Simsbury High School. He \nwas an Eagle Scout who took the values of leadership, service, and \nhonor seriously. His cooking skills were well-renowned, both among his \nfellow scouts and among those who served with him in the Guard. He had \ndreams of one day running for President. From time to time, he would \neven plan out the details of his 2024 campaign with his friends.\n  Sgt. Delgreco was an individual whose warmth, enthusiasm, and spirit \ntouched everyone around him. Perhaps his former scoutmaster, Richard \nGugliemetti, put it best when he said, ``Felix Delgreco made us all \nbetter people.''\n  Felix Delgreco could have chosen many other paths in life. But he \nchose one of commitment, of duty, and of service. That was the kind of \nperson Felix Delgreco was. And we are all forever in his debt for the \ntremendous sacrifice he made so that we can live in freedom and \nsecurity.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to Sgt. Delgreco's parents, Felix and \nClaire, to his entire family, and to everyone who was fortunate to know \nhim.\n\n\n                          Tyanna Avery-Felder\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in memory of U.S. Army SP4 Tyanna \nAvery-Felder, of Bridgeport, Connecticut, who was killed in the line of \nduty in Iraq. She was 22 years old.\n  Specialist Avery-Felder, who served as a cook with the Army's Stryker \nBrigade, based in Fort Lewis, WA, died on April 6, 2004, 2 days after \nher convoy\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\nwas hit by an improvised explosive device in Mosul, Iraq. She is the \nfirst woman from Connecticut to be killed in Iraq since the United \nStates began military operations there in March 2003.\n  Tyanna Avery-Felder's death is a sobering reminder to all of us, and \nparticularly to people in my home State of Connecticut, that the brave \nmembers of our Armed Forces who are risking their lives for us overseas \nare no longer simply sons, brothers, and fathers. They are daughters, \nmothers, and sisters, as well.\n  Specialist Avery-Felder was not the only soldier in her family. She \nwas married to U.S. Army SP4 Adrian Felder. The couple met while they \nwere both completing their basic training in Fort Lewis, and they were \nmarried on December 20, 2002, just a few months before the war in Iraq \nbegan. Both of them knew of the commitment, risk, and sacrifice \ninherent in military service. But it was Tyanna who was called to serve \noverseas in Iraq. And it was she who would make the most powerful \nsacrifice of all.\n  Tyanna Avery-Felder was a graduate of Kolbe Cathedral High School in \nBridgeport, where she enjoyed playing basketball and singing in the \ngospel choir. She spent 1 year at Southern Connecticut State University \nbefore enlisting in the Army. She was determined to be a teacher for \nyoung children when she finished her military service.\n  Tyanna was a driven, goal-oriented young woman whose mind was hard to \nchange once she made it up. And she was the kind of soldier who \ninspired her drill instructor at boot camp to compliment her on her \ntoughness. But Specialist Avery-Felder also had a kind heart, and a \nloving relationship with her parents and her husband.\n  All of us in Connecticut and across America owe a deep and solemn \ndebt of gratitude to Tyanna Avery-Felder and to her family for her \nservice to our country. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I offer my \ndeepest condolences to Tyanna's husband Adrian, to her parents, Ray and \nIlene, and to everyone who knew and loved her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4288-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S ENVIRONMENTAL ROLLBACKS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is supposed to be a day to mark the \nimportance of protecting the environment. And thankfully, many people \nare. But though we are all marking the day, the only people celebrating \nare industry CEOs and lobbyists.\n  The Bush administration's laser-like focus on rolling back our \nenvironmental and public health protections is breathtaking, literally. \nThe rollbacks are dirtying our air and destroying the health of the \nplanet.\n  Instead of packing the agencies responsible for the environment with \nenvironmental stewards as you would expect, the administration has \nfocused on creating a public relations firm under the guise of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  It's been a busy PR firm: announcing environmental rollbacks on \nFridays or around holidays when they think the American public is not \npaying attention, assigning green names to destructive policies, \nscrubbing regulatory actions to downplay public health risks to meet \ntheir political needs and flat out ignoring scientific facts are just a \nfew of their favorite marketing tools.\n  But for all their public relations maneuvering, the public recognizes \nthe enormous and long-term effect of these policies on our environment \nand our health. This PR campaign is being led by the very people the \nadministration is supposed to be policing: industry representatives \noften at the heart of the most egregious environmental neglect. The \nadministration's lates rollback has the fingerprints of lobbyists all \nover it, the Bush retreat from strong mercury controls at coal-fired \npower plants.\n  Unfortunately, the ``swoosh'' from the revolving door between \nindustry lobby shops and the Bush administration has now spilled over \nto the Federal bench. The Bush administration recognizes that the \ncourts have become the final backstop against their environmental \nrollbacks, blocking Bush attempts to gut the Clean Air Act, Clean Water \nAct and protection of our national monuments.\n  The courts have ruled against Bush arguments to weaken the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act 80 percent of \nthe time. The Bush solution, give anti-environmental, unqualified \nindustry lobbyists lifetime judicial appointments.\n  The debate over William Myers, a former cattle and mining industry \nlobbyist, may be one of the most important environmental debates we \nhave this year. Unlike the Bush industry appointees to Federal \nagencies, Mr. Myers' effect on environment and public lands would \nsurvive long past this Presidency. As I have said many times, the \nenvironment is not a partisan issue but this administration has made it \nclear that industry interests trump the public interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4288-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4288-S4289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GOVERNOR FRANK B. MORRISON\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, Gov. Frank Morrison was quoted in the \nDecember 5, 1975 Lincoln Evening Journal:\n\n       As long as Frank Morrison's alive, I'll never retire, even \n     though I'm flat on my back. There are too many problems in \n     this world which need attention.\n\n  Much has already been said about the late Gov. Frank B. Morrison and \nhis remarkable life. However, I would like to add a couple of thoughts \nfrom the perspective of a Nebraskan, a U.S. Senator, and a Republican.\n  The first time I had the opportunity to meet Frank Morrison, I was a \nyoung radio station reporter in Omaha during the 1970 Nebraska Senate \ncampaign. In my first interview with him, I was drawn to his passion \nand sense of purpose. Frank Morrison believed he could make the world \nbetter--and he succeeded. His political career and life were about \nenhancing the world around him and solving problems.\n  Frank's dedication to Nebraska was, and still is, seen and felt \nstatewide. As Governor, he and his wife Maxine encouraged Nebraskans to \ntake pride in their State. It was his vision and pride in Nebraska that \neventually led to the completion of the Great Platte River Road Archway \nspanning Interstate 80 outside of Kearney. He was dedicated to \nrecognizing Nebraska's role as an important crossroads in the Nation's \ndevelopment and westward migration.\n  I stayed in touch with Frank over the years, but it wasn't until I \ncame to the Senate in 1997 that I communicated with him on a regular \nbasis. He would write or call me, offering suggestions, observations, \nand thoughts on issues of the day. I last spoke with him a week after \nMaxine's death when Frank knew he had very little time left. In our \nlast conversation, he never once mentioned his battle with cancer, his \npain, or his impending death. Our conversations were always about the \nfuture.\n  I told my Senate colleague and Frank's former colleague, Senator \nFritz Hollings (D-SC), that Frank did not have much time left. Frank \nand Fritz were Governors together during the 1960s. I gave Fritz \nFrank's phone number and he called him. They had a wonderful 45 minute \nconversation as they said their last goodbyes.\n  Frank Morrison was a remarkable man for many reasons. The ultimate \ncompliment that can be paid to any of us at the end of our lives fits \nhim well--he left the world better than he found it.\n  Frank's unyielding commitment to his family, State, and country is a \nmodel for all Nebraskans. He was a dedicated public servant who \ninspired others through his personal conduct and respect for others. \nAll of Nebraska thanks Governor Frank and Maxine Morrison for their \ncontributions to our State and humanity.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this week the citizens of Nebraska lost \na legend with the passing of Governor Frank Morrison, and I rise to \nrecognize my plain-spoken friend of 45 years.\n  When I was Governor of South Carolina, Frank became Governor of \nNebraska, and I have admired him ever since. We spoke earlier this \nspring, and his mind was as sharp at age 98, as it was at age 58.\n  When I think of Frank I think of a man who knew how to get results. \nHe was a progressive Governor, but also a fiscally conservative one. He \nimplemented many changes, insofar as creating an educational television \nnetwork and a statewide employee retirement system that modernized \nstate government.\n  We will miss him, as we miss his wife Maxine, who just passed away \nlast\n\n[[Page S4289]]\n\nmonth. My wife, Peatsy, joins me in extending our deepest sympathy to \ntheir family.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great \nNebraskan, a statesman, and a friend--former Governor Frank Morrison.\n  On Monday, Frank Morrison passed away in McCook, NE.\n  For a boy growing up in McCook, Frank Morrison was more than a \ngovernor to me, he was a role model. The Morrisons were friends of my \nfamily and I still remember delivering my first May Basket to Jeanne \nMorrison at the age of five. Maxine Morrison was my kindergarten \nteacher and Frank was my mentor in my early years in Nebraska politics.\n  I would often talk to him about the issues of the day and he was \nalways candid and fair in his advice. We didn't always agree, but Frank \nnever let politics become personal. He had big dreams and big goals, \nbut they were always practical and they became possible through his \ndedication. He worked with folks on both sides and he got a lot done \nbecause he understood that rhetoric and partisan passions were less \nimportant than making progress. He was a democrat and he loved the \nDemocratic Party. But he loved Nebraska more. Nebraska was always, \nALWAYS, first in his mind.\n  Althought not a native Nebraskan, he loved this state as much as \nanyone and, in every sense of the word, was a statesman. He was as \nsynonymous with Nebraska as the Sandhills, the Panhandle, the Platte, \nand the Huskers. All Nebraskans owe Frank Morrison a debt of gratitude \nfor the leadership and partnerships he offered us over the years.\n  Just last year, we had an illustration for the kind of regard in \nwhich Frank was held. Last September, the Chancellor of the University \nof Kearney, Dough Christenson, presented Frank with an honorary degree. \nThe degree recognized Frank's more than seven decades of public service \nand his tireless advocacy for Nebraska. Frank said that it was the \ngreatest day of his life, except the day his wife Maxine said ``yes''. \nTruly a well-deserved honor for a beloved Nebraska statesman.\n  I would be leaving something out if I didn't also talk about Frank's \nsense of humor. His wit was legendary in Nebraska and it was \nundiminished even in his final days. I remember, just after one of my \nfirst elections--a very close primary race, I spoke with Frank and he \ntold me about one of his first races.\n  He had been nominated to the local school board by both parties. And \nhe said he lost to a write-in candidate.\n  But losing an election didn't bother Frank. He was dedicated to \npublic service and to promoting Nebraska.\n  He brought pride to our State and he was a tireless advocate of the \nnatural wonders of a State that he had not been born in, but that he \ncalled home.\n  Frank was 98 years old when he passed and that is a long life by \nanyone's standards. But the measure of his accomplishments is longer \nstill.\n  Just a little over a month ago, Frank's beloved wife Maxine passed \naway. The loss of these two Nebraska legends had signaled, perhaps, the \nend of an era. They have left a void that will be very difficult to \nfill, but they have also left a legacy and a love of Nebraska and his \ncountry that will likely outlive us all.\n  I conclude with some words from the McCook Daily Gazette, the daily \npaper from the hometown Frank and I share:\n  ``Frank had a grand vision, but he was also a down home person who \nloved his family, his adopted hometown, the people of Nebraska and this \nnation and this world.\n  ``We will miss you, Frank. But we are very, very glad you lived such \nan abundant life. Thank you for living with purpose and passion. We \nwill try, as best we can, to follow your example.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4289-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4289-S4291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CELEBRATING EARTH DAY 2004\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, since the first Earth Day on April 22, \n1970, we have celebrated this day as an annual occasion on which to \nexamine our Nation's environmental policies.\n  Sadly, there is little to celebrate in terms of environmental \nprotection this year and much to worry about.\n  Just last week, we learned that 474 counties throughout our Nation \nfailed to meet air quality standards set by the Environmental \nProtection Agency. A total of 159 million people--more than half the \nNation's population--live in these communities.\n  In my home State of California nearly 90 percent of State residents \nlive in areas with unhealthy levels of smog. That means that 90 percent \nof Californians are at increased risk of asthma, reduced lung function \nand chronic lung diseases.\n  What is also alarming is that eight national parks, four of which are \nin California, contain excessively high levels of ozone.\n  Can you believe that the air in Yosemite, Sequoia, Kings Canyon, and \nJoshua Tree National Parks is harmful to your health?\n  And then there is the gravest threat to our environment and \nultimately, our health--global warming. Climate change is the most \nimportant environmental issue facing us today.\n  I would like to take a minute now to talk about a likely impact of \nclimate change that has not received very much attention--its effect on \nour water supplies.\n  The evidence is growing that climate change threatens water supplies \nthroughout the western United States--and especially on the West Coast.\n  Just recently, researchers at the University of California at Santa \nCruz analyzed the impact of global warming on Arctic Sea ice.\n  What they found was that higher temperatures will cause Arctic Sea \nice to melt which will, in turn, reduce the west coast's water supply.\n  According to the Santa Cruz scientists' models, melting sea ice will \ncreate columns of warmer air that change air flow in the atmosphere and \ndeflect storms and needed precipitation away from Western U.S. lands.\n  Forecasts indicate that Arctic Sea ice may shrink by up to 50 percent \nin summer months by the year 2050. This could have truly devastating \nconsequences for our Nation's water supplies.\n  Under the UC-Santa Cruz researchers' models, in 2050, the West Coast, \nfrom southern British Columbia to southern California, could receive 30 \npercent less rain than it does now.\n  And this is not just a problem for California. The research models \nshow that the melting ice could decrease precipitation as far inland as \nthe Rocky Mountains.\n  The water infrastructure in the West, particularly in California, is \nalready stretched to the limit this year. Even now we are struggling to \nprovide enough water for our communities, farms, forests, fish, and \nwildlife. What would we do with 30 percent less precipitation?\n  The Santa Cruz study is not the only one forecasting reduced water \nsupplies in the West. In fact, many global and regional statistical \nmodels agree that the West will see reduced snowpack as a result of \nrising temperatures.\n\n  Under those models, California and the West will receive more winter \nrain and less snow meaning two things for Western States--increased \nflooding in the winter and water shortages in the summer.\n  We are not talking about minor effects.\n  In February of this year, scientists at the Pacific Northwest \nNational Laboratory forecasted reductions in snowpack of up to 70 \npercent in the coastal mountains over the next 50 years as a direct \nresult of warming temperatures.\n  In the West, our water infrastructure is based on the gradual melting \nof snowpack throughout the spring and summer. A 70-percent decline in \nsnowpack would be catastrophic.\n  The evidence is also mounting that climate change threatens not only \nour water supplies, but also global biodiversity.\n  A report published in the January edition of the British journal \nNature estimates that 25 percent of Earth's plant and animal species \nwill be wiped out in the next 50 years if global temperatures continue \nto rise as expected.\n  This means that more than 1 million of the estimated 5 million land \nspecies could face extinction within our children's and grandchildren's \nlifetimes.\n  It is time to take global warming seriously and reduce our greenhouse \ngas emissions. The consequences of delaying and deferring decisions are \nsevere.\n  As a country with only 4 percent of the world's population, but which \nproduces 25 percent of carbon dioxide\n\n[[Page S4290]]\n\nemissions, the United States has a responsibility to act.\n  And yet, there are many steps we can take--steps which are broadly \nsupported--that will help protect the environment.\n  For example, we should continue to promote the production and use of \nhybrid cars. A few simple steps such as opening up carpool lanes and \nmunicipal parking spaces to hybrid cars will encourage motorists to buy \nthese environmentally friendly automobiles.\n  Congress should also act to bring corporate average fuel economy \nstandards of light-duty trucks and SUVs in line with the requirements \nfor cars.\n  This one action alone could save a million barrels of oil a day and \nprevent about 200 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the \natmosphere each year.\n  We also know that investments to improve the environment like these \npay off.\n  A study released by the President's Office of Management and Budget \nlast fall found that the social and health benefits of enforcing strong \nclean-air regulations were five to seven times greater than the costs \nof adhering to the rules.\n  The study estimated that, during the 10-year period from October 1992 \nto September 2002, between $120 billion and $193 billion were saved in \nreduced hospital stays, emergency room visits, premature deaths and \nlost workdays as a result of improved air quality.\n  Just as we have asked so many nations around the world to assist us \nin the war on terror and in securing and rebuilding Iraq, so, too, \nshould we help those nations who want our assistance in addressing \nglobal environmental problems.\n  On this 35th Earth Day we are reminded here in the Congress of the \nimportance of protecting the planet for future generations.\n  It is my hope that we will step up and meet this responsibility.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today marks the 34th anniversary of the \ndesignation of April 22 as Earth Day. It is fitting to contemplate the \nwords of former Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, who, in 1970, was \ninstrumental in launching this now annual event. Thanks to his \ndetermination, what began as a nationwide ``teach-in'' on college \ncampuses and in American communities to catalyze growing public \nawareness of ensuring a livable world, has become a traditional day \ndevoted to raising public consciousness about our environmental \nstewardship responsibilities.\n  Senator Nelson observed that ``(t)he real loser in man's greedy drive \nis the youth of this country and the world. Because of the stupidity of \ntheir elders, the children of today face an ugly world in the near \nfuture, with dangerous and deadly polluted air and water; overcrowded \ndevelopment; festering mounds of debris; and an insufficient amount of \nopen space to get away from it all. Since youth is again the great \nloser, perhaps the only hope of saving the environment and putting \nquality back into life may well depend on our being able to tap the \nenergy, idealism, and drive of the oncoming generation.''\n  Senator Nelson's reflections and the fact that today is Earth Day \nprovide an opportunity to offer a special salute to the initiatives of \na remarkable young native son of Illinois. Less than 3 miles away in \nthe District of Columbia, within the shadow of this Capitol, hundreds \nof local volunteers led by a dynamic crew of young Illinoisans have \nspent the last 3 weeks tackling the tons of trash along the shores of \nthe Anacostia and Potomac Rivers--soda cans and bottles, snack bags, \nstyrofoam, and just about anything else you can imagine.\n  This Capital River Relief Project is spearheaded by Chad Pregracke, \nan industrious and impressive young man from East Moline, IL, who \nfounded Living Lands and Waters, a non-profit organization to support \nhis Mississippi River Beautification and Restoration Project to collect \nand recycle debris. Over the past seven years, Chad's work has expanded \nfrom the Mississippi River to include clean-up projects on the \nIllinois, Ohio, Missouri, and currently the Anacostia and Potomac \nRivers. What began as a ``one man and his dog with one boat'' clean-up \neffort has grown to an eight-state, 56-community project with thousands \nof volunteers and an estimated 900 tons of trash removed from the \nwaters and banks of several major American rivers.\n  Doug Siglin, Director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Anacostia \nRiver Initiative, has partnered with Chad in the local effort. Numerous \ncorporate backers, led by Koch Industries, have provided financial \nsupport for the project.\n  Many organizations host annual river clean-up projects along both the \nPotomac and Anacostia Rivers. However, this year's clean-up effort is \ndifferent. For the first time, a 140-foot barge is being moved up and \ndown both the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, cleaning 30 miles of \nriverbanks. The barge serves as a temporary repository for all the \ngarbage and materials collected from the rivers.\n  As of April 19, Chad, his crew, and volunteers have loaded the barge \nwith 2,800 bags filled with trash, along with 746 tires, 25 55-gallon \nbarrels, 12 shopping carts, 7 refrigerators, 6 messages in bottles, 3 \nwater heaters, and 1 mannequin hand gathered from the banks and water. \nWhen the project concludes this weekend, all recyclable items will be \ntaken to recycling facilities. Anything remaining will be taken to \nconventional landfills.\n  Chad has received numerous awards for his efforts, including an \nhonorary doctorate degree from St. Ambrose University in Davenport, \nIowa, the Jefferson Award for Public Service, and the Manhattan \nInstitute of Public Policy's Social Entrepreneurship Award. He also has \nbeen featured in an array of publications including People, Time, \nReader's Digest, Outside, Smithsonian, and Biography magazine, which \nincluded Chad in its ``Top Ten Future Classics in America'' issue. \nSeveral networks have highlighted Chad's work including CNN, the \nNational Geographic Channel, MTV, and PBS.\n  In tandem with the clean-up drives, Chad's organization last year \nhosted 15 free, Big River Education Workshops from St. Louis, Missouri, \nto Davenport, Iowa, aboard a floating barge classroom. The workshops \ndrew 295 teachers and river advocates, who then shared the knowledge \nand experience with the thousands of students whose lives they touch.\n  Although Chad and his crew will be returning to the Midwest soon, \nthey will leave behind not only cleaner local river shorelines, but a \nbevy of fans inspired by the realization that one person's vision, \ncombined with muscle and resolve, can make a real difference. I applaud \nChad Pregracke and his team of Lisa Hoffman, Erick Louck, Tammy Becker, \nChris Fenderson, and Kim Erndt.\n  Not only on Earth Day, but every day, I hope what they have set in \nmotion for restoration of the historic waterways in our Nation's \ncapital will be contagious.\n  We owe it to our children and our children's children to restore and \npreserve all of the priceless waterways throughout our country, which \nsustain the lives of many fish, birds, and other species, provide \nabundant recreational opportunities, and help support not only our \neconomy but our precious earth, 70 percent of which is covered in \nwater, the building block of life.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Wisconsin has inspired some of the \ngreatest conservationists this Nation has ever known. Wisconsinites \nhave had a powerful influence on the environmental movement. I now hold \nthe Senate seat held by Gaylord Nelson, the founder of Earth Day, and a \nman for whom I have the greatest admiration and respect. I am pleased \nthat Wisconsin can lay claim to the genesis of Earth Day, a day of \nnational and international remembrance of the importance of our natural \nresources and a clean environment. I know that the people of Wisconsin, \nliving in such a beautiful and ecologically diverse State, feel a \nspecial connection to our natural resources and share a long tradition \nof our State government achieving excellence in its conservation \npolicies.\n  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Gaylord Nelson, a \nformer member of this body and a distinguished former Governor of the \nState of Wisconsin, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, for changing the consciousness of a nation. He is the living \nembodiment of the principle that one person can literally change the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S4291]]\n\n  During his 18 years of service in the Senate, Gaylord Nelson brought \nabout significant change for the ``greener'' in both our Nation's law \nand the institution of the Senate itself. He is the coauthor of the \nEnvironmental Education Act, which he sponsored with the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, \nand he sponsored the amendment to give the St. Croix and the Namekagon \nRivers scenic protection. In the wake of Rachel Carson's book ``Silent \nSpring,'' Gaylord Nelson, along with Senator Philip Hart of Michigan, \ndirected national attention to the documented persistent \nbioaccumulative effects of organochlorine pesticides used in the Great \nLakes by authoring the ban on DDT in 1972. He was the primary sponsor \nof the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore Act, protecting one of \nnorthern Wisconsin's most beautiful areas.\n  And Senator Nelson, of course, was the founder of Earth Day. Thanks \nto him, here we are, 34 years later, taking time out of our lives to \nthink about conservation. Earth Day is an event which in addition to \nchanging the environmental consciousness of the country literally \nstopped the Senate. Members of both bodies voted to adjourn their \nrespective Houses in the middle of the legislative week to attend Earth \nDay events, an adjournment that would be extremely rare today. Here in \nthis body, the Congressional Record indicates, at 3:31 pm. on Tuesday, \nApril 20, 1970, our colleague the senior Senator from West Virginia, \nMr. Byrd, adjourned the Senate until Friday, April 23, 1970. In the \nother body, Chamber action was adjourned from the middle of the day on \nApril 21, 1970, the actual date of the first Earth Day, through April \n23 of that year.\n  In addition to Gaylord Nelson, the list of Wisconsin \nenvironmentalists includes Sierra Club founder John Muir, whose \nbirthday is the day before Earth Day. Also notable is the writer and \nconservationist Aldo Leopold, whose Sand County Almanac helped to \ngalvanize the environmental movement. Finally, Wisconsin also produced \nSigurd Olson, one of the founders of the Wilderness Society.\n  Conservation is part of our culture in Wisconsin, and the people \nWisconsin are very environmentally savvy. Every year I hold a town hall \nmeeting in each one of Wisconsin's 72 counties, and protecting the \nenvironment is a top issue.\n  Earth Day has become an important part of who we are. From Milwaukee, \nWI, to Mumbai, India, millions of people across the world are taking \nSenator Nelson's legacy to heart. They are volunteering this weekend to \nconserve the environment--whether it is in their backyard, local river, \nor park.\n  I hope that on this Earth Day 2004, the Congress will re-dedicate \nitself to achieving the bipartisan consensus on protecting the \nenvironment that existed for nearly two decades. The Clean Water Act, \nfor example, passed the U.S. Senate in 1971 by a vote of 86 to 0. When \nPresident Nixon vetoed it, the Senate overrode his veto, 52 to 12. The \nEndangered Species Act, which is under such attack right now, was \npassed by the Senate on a 92 to 0 vote in 1973.\n  Unfortunately, during the course of this congressional session we \nhave faced numerous proposals to roll back the environmental and health \nand safety protections upon which Americans depend. From clean water to \nclean air, the list of environmental rollbacks is stunning and \ndisturbing. We need to work together to protect the environment, not \nrevert to the times when we saw the Cuyahoga River catch fire, when at \nleast one of the Great Lakes was considered ``ecologically dead,'' and \nwhen dumping of toxic wastes into rivers was standard operating \nprocedure.\n  In the upcoming months, I hope that Wisconsinites and citizens across \nAmerica use this Earth Day to collect their thoughts and voice their \nopinions about pending Federal legislation and its impact on the \nenvironment. Wisconsinites value a clean environment, not just for \npurely aesthetic or philosophical purposes, but because a clean \nenvironment ensures that Wisconsin and the United States as a whole \nremains a good place to raise a family, start a business, and buy a \nhome. It is important on this Earth Day 2004 that we keep the need for \nstrong environmental laws in mind. Let's continue to move forward, not \nroll back.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to share my views about the \nenvironment on Earth Day. I know many Members in this body support \nefforts to clean up our environment.\n  Earth Day 2004 is the ideal time to recognize just how much our \nenvironment has improved. Over the last 3 years, the focus has been on \nresults--making our air, water, and land cleaner. To get to that point \nand to keep improving in the future, we need to employ the best science \nand data available for decision-making. Our policies should encourage \ninnovation and the development of new, cleaner technologies.\n  We should continue to build on America's ethic of stewardship and \npersonal responsibility through education, volunteer opportunities, and \nin our daily lives. Opportunities for environmental improvements are \nnot limited to Federal Government actions. States, tribes, local \ncommunities, and individuals must be included.\n  Over the last 30 years, our Nation has made great progress in \nproviding for a better environment and improving public health. In that \ntime, our economy grew 164 percent, population grew 39 percent, and our \nenergy consumption increased 42 percent. Yet air pollution from the six \nmajor pollutants decreased by 48 percent. In 2002, State data reported \nto EPA showed that approximately 251 million people, or 94 percent of \nthe total population, were served by community water systems that met \nall health-based standards. This number is up from 79 percent in 1993.\n  Others areas of the environment can also be improved. I have \nintroduced legislation to clean up old abandoned mine sites. While we \nhave done a good job in addressing this problem, we can do better. I \nhave a very simple solution to deal with this problem that will make \nour communities safer.\n  The United States is holding $1 billion of money due States and \ntribes to clean up abandoned sites, and deal with problems associated \nwith coal mining activities. The money has already been collected and \nallocated, but not yet appropriated. There is no justification for \nCongress to continue to hold this money. States are pleading for help \nto fix abandoned mine problems that will make communities safer and \nhealthier for their citizens. It is unfortunate their pleas are being \ndisregarded.\n  This is a specific issue where we can make a huge dent in the problem \ntoday, right now. I ask Members to listen to the pleas of communities \nand immediately appropriate the $1 billion due States and tribes. If my \ncolleagues care about the environment and want to clean up these \ncities, join me and we will get that money released.\n  Let's show the American public that statements made in support of the \nenvironment are not political rhetoric and truly reflect the positions \nand feelings of Members. We can get this done today, and I ask each of \nyou my colleagues to join me in making this happen on Earth Day 2004.\n  There is no doubt that environmental progress is continuing. The \nfacts are unequivocal: Today the Nation's environment is cleaner and \nhealthier than it was 3 years ago. We are getting results more quickly \nand more substantially by reforming outmoded, command-and-control \nmandates that hinder environmental progress. We have been able to \naccomplish this with innovative, market-based approaches that harness \nthe power of technology to achieve maximum environmental benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4291-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4291-S4292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE LATE SENATOR THOMAS WARD OSBORN\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I would like to speak of a man who \nwas instrumental in the completion of the Washington Monument, a former \nSenator from Florida, Thomas Ward Osborn. The cornerstone of the \nWashington Monument was laid July 4, 1848, but the monument itself was \nnot completed and opened to the public until October 9, 1888. The \nconstruction of the memorial was stopped in 1856 due to the Civil War, \na lack of funding, and political difficulties within the Washington \nMonument Society.\n  Senator Thomas Ward Osborn was instrumental in passing the \nlegislation required to complete the monument\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\nafter the Civil War. Many were reluctant to finish funding the project \nbecause of technical issues related to the construction and the \nperception among some that it was a waste of money. S. 245, a bill to \nsecure the completion of the Washington and Lincoln Monuments, was \nintroduced on the Senate floor by the Honorable Thomas Ward Osborn on \nApril 1, 1869. Through Senator Osborn's efforts, this legislation was \nenacted and construction of the Washington Monument quickly resumed. \nThe design of the monument was altered to remove much of the \nembellishment in the original design and the result was the 555 foot \nobelisk that is so recognizable today as the symbol of an exceptional \nman and an exceptional Nation.\n  Senator Thomas Ward Osborn was motivated out of a sense of patriotism \nand a desire to create a permanent reminder for posterity of the \ncharacter of George Washington. It is important for citizens to retain \na link to their country's origins in order to fully engage in civic \nlife in the present. To understand the exceptional nature of \nWashington's character is to understand the exceptional nature of the \nUnited States as a Nation.\n  I believe that Senator Thomas Ward Osborn deserves recognition for \nhis vital efforts in seeing to the completion of the Washington \nMonument. In fact, I have written to the Department of the Interior \nurging that some form of recognition, such as a plaque, be provided to \nremind visitors of Senator Osborn's efforts. It is my understanding \nthat the regional director for the Park Service National Capitol Region \nhas since directed the chief of Visitor Services to research Senator \nOsborn's efforts and share that information with the park rangers whose \njob it is to help interpret the monument for visitors. The late Senator \nThomas Ward Osborn played a key role in seeing that George Washington \nreceived the recognition he deserves, and now it is my hope that \nSenator Osborn will receive the recognition he deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4292-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4292-S4293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               89TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this year I once again come before the \nSenate to pay tribute to those who lost their lives or were forced from \ntheir homeland as a result of the horrific genocide perpetrated against \nthe Armenian people from 1915 through 1923. During those years, the \nTurkish Ottoman government used the outbreak of World War I as a \npretext for subjecting its citizens of Armenian descent to deportation, \nabduction, torture, massacre, and starvation. The land on which some of \nthe Armenians had lived for generations was expropriated from them. It \nis imperative for the American people and for people around the world \nto commemorate this tragedy, with the hope that by remembrance we will \nadvance the day when the world will no longer witness such horrors.\n  Over one million Armenians perished as part of a deliberate campaign \nof murder in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. Armenians, given \nthat they were neither Turks nor Muslims, were treated as threats, even \nthough the Armenians had been exemplary citizens and had lived together \npeaceably with their Turkish neighbors for centuries. April 24th is the \ndate chosen to commemorate this genocide, since it was on that day in \n1915 that government leaders rounded up 300 Armenian leaders, writers, \nthinkers and professionals for their deportation and for many, their \ndeaths. While the preeminent members of the Constantinople's Armenian \ncommunity were being rounded up on that day, 5,000 others were \nslaughtered in their homes and on the streets.\n  Many Western, democratic nations became aware of the ruthless \ntargeting of the Armenian population yet did not act to stop it. In May \n1915, Great Britain, France, and Russia advised the Turkish leaders \nthat they would be held personally responsible for this crime against \nhumanity. Later that year, Henry Morgenthau, the American Ambassador to \nthe Ottoman Empire, cabled the State Department saying, ``Deportation \nof and excesses against peaceful Armenians is increasing and from \nharrowing reports of eye witnesses it appears that a campaign of race \nextermination is in progress under a pretext of reprisal against \nrebellion.'' His successor, Abram Elkus, wrote in 1816 that, ``. . . \nunchecked policy of extermination through starvation, exhaustion, and \nbrutality of treatment hardly surpassed even in Turkish history.''\n  In addition to the government records decrying the events in the \nOttoman Empire, historians have been able to record the memories of the \nvictims. It is important to share these stories, to ensure that the \nsubsequent generations can truly understand the appalling conditions \nunder which their ancestors both perished and survived. The Genocide \nProject, an effort by the San Francisco Bay Area Armenian National \nCommittee, has done a remarkable job of compiling oral and visual \ndocumentation from some of the survivors.\n  Edward Racoubian told the project how when, ``We reached the \nEuphrates River and despite the hundreds of bodies floating in it, we \ndrank from it like there was no tomorrow. We quenched our thirst for \nthe first time since our departure. . . . Of a caravan of nearly 10,000 \npeople, there were now only some 300 of us left. My aunt, my sisters, \nmy brothers had all died or disappeared. Only my mother and I were \nleft. We decided to hide and take refuge with some Arab nomads. My \nmother died there under their tents. They did not treat me well--they \nkept me hungry and beat me often and they branded me as their own.''\n  ``Sometime later, Turkish gendarmes came over and grabbed all the \nboys from 5 to 10 years old. I was about 7 or 8. They grabbed me too,'' \nSam Kadorian said. ``They threw us all into a pile on the sandy beach \nand started jabbing us with their swords and bayonets. I must've been \nin the center because only one sword got me . . . nipped my cheek . . . \nhere, my cheek. But, I couldn't cry. I was covered with blood from the \nother bodies on top of me, but I couldn't cry. If had, I would not be \nhere today.''\n  I believe the highest tribute we can pay to the victims of a genocide \nis by acknowledging the horrors they faced and reaffirming our \ncommitment to fight against such heinous acts in the future.\n  In commemorating the tragedy of the genocide today, I would also like \nto recognize the fact that yesterday Canada's House of Commons, took \nthe courageous step of officially recognizing that the events initiated \non April 24, 1915, were in fact a genocide and crime against humanity. \nIt is my hope that all people of goodwill will join in calling this \ntragedy by its correct name--a genocide. I hope that our colleagues \nwill join me in commemorating this tragedy and vowing to honor and \nremember the innocent victims of the Armenian genocide.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, my fellow \nRhode Islanders, and our Armenian American community to observe the \n89th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.\n  At this time, it is fitting that we reflect on this tragic event in \norder to ensure that future generations remember and learn from the \npain and suffering of those who came before us.\n  The Armenian Genocide was a demonstration of evil. From its genesis \non April 24, 1915, through the end of 1923, nearly one and a half \nmillion Armenians were killed and over a half a million survivors \nexiled.\n  All the while, the United States Government, too busy trying to \ndefeat the Austro-German alliance and attempting to stay out of a war \nin Europe, ignored these atrocities. The United States Ambassador to \nTurkey, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., attempted to bring the tragic string of \nevents to a climax, pleading with both President Wilson and Secretary \nof State Robert Lansing to get involved. Former President Theodore \nRoosevelt, frustrated by a lack of response from his own government, \npetitioned President Wilson on 24 November 1915, saying ``Until we put \nhonor and duty first, and are willing to risk something in order to \nachieve righteousness both for ourselves and for others, we shall \naccomplish nothing; and we shall earn and deserve the contempt of the \nstrong nations of mankind.''\n  Unfortunately, the Armenian genocide was only the first of several \n20th century tragedies--the Nazi extermination of the Jews and others \nduring\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\nthe Second World War; Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge's slaughter of nearly \ntwo million Cambodians in the mid-1970s; the Hutu massacre of the \nTutsis in Rwanda in the summer of 1993; and, at the same time, the \nSerbian annihilation of Bosnian Muslims in Bosnia from 1993 to 1995.\n  Thus, as we reflect on this atrocity, let us call for our own country \nto recognize the Armenian Genocide, just as my own State of Rhode \nIsland has done, and as the parliaments of Belgium, Canada, Cypress, \nFrance, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Russia, and Sweden have done over the \npast 6 years. Let us also pledge never to ignore atrocities by those \nwho claim the legitimacy of government. We must never ignore and we \nwill never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4293-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN SUPPORT OF S. RES. 330\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for S. Res. \n330, which expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should \ncommunicate to the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries, OPEC, cartel and non-OPEC countries the position of the \nUnited States in favor of increasing world crude oil supplies so as to \nachieve stable crude oil prices.\n  I am proud to again be a cosponsor of this resolution. In the 106th \nCongress, I was a cosponsor of a virtually identical resolution along \nwith, among others, the current Secretary of the Department of Energy. \nUnfortunately, the need to stand up to OPEC is even more pressing today \nthan it was two Congresses ago.\n  Ensuring access to and stable prices for imported crude oil for the \nUnited States and major allies and trading partners of the United \nStates is vital to United States foreign and economic policy. \nRegrettably, the 2004 OPEC production cuts have resulted in outrageous \nincreases in oil prices. The eleven countries that make up OPEC produce \n40 percent of the world's crude oil and control three-quarters of \nproven reserves, including much of the spare production capacity. When \nOPEC instituted its production cut in February 2004, it reduced \nproduction by 2,000,000 barrels per day. From February to March 2004, \ncrude oil prices have gone from $28 per barrel and now exceed $38 per \nbarrel.\n  High gasoline prices are inextricably linked to high crude oil \nprices. And these high oil and gas prices hurt Americans across the \nNation and from all walks of life. Farmers, teachers and small business \nowners are among those getting hit hard by these skyrocketing costs. \nFor gasoline, the increases in crude oil prices have resulted in a \npass-through of cost increases at the pump to an average national price \nof $1.80 per gallon. These are the highest gas prices we have seen in \n13 years.\n  We cannot allow this foreign oil cartel to wreak havoc on our \neconomy. The President should use diplomatic pressure to urge OPEC to \nincrease production. The actions of this cartel have real consequences \nfor Americans. And in an already shaky economy, high oil and gas prices \ncan put working families over the financial edge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4293-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  A lesbian couple was assaulted by a group of men and women outside a \nScottsdale, AZ, bar on April 4, 2004. The assailants called the couple \nderogatory names and beat one of the women and ripped the other woman's \ndress and then took photographs of her exposed breasts.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4293-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY DISEASES AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing the week of April 19 as National Primary Immune \nDeficiency Diseases Awareness Week. Primary immune deficiency diseases, \nPIDD, are genetic disorders in which part of the body's immune system \nis missing or does not function properly. The World Health Organization \nrecognizes more than 150 primary immune diseases which affect as many \nas 50,000 people in the United States. Fortunately, 70 percent of PIDD \npatients are able to maintain their health through regular infusions of \na plasma product known as intravenuous immunoglobulin, IGIV. IGIV helps \nbolster the immune system and provides critical protection against \ninfection and disease.\n  I am familiar with primary immune deficiencies because of a family in \nmy State, the Jones family, whose daughter, Emma, was born with common \nvariable immune deficiency, CVID, and hypogammaglobulinenimea. Emma has \nno immune system and relies on IGIV infusions every month to keep her \nalive. Emma, 9 years old, is a patient at Duke University Medical \nCenter, and is hoping to be a candidate for a stem cell transplant. \nEmma's mother, Jill, also has CVID and receives IGIV infusions. The \nJones family has become active volunteers for the Immune Deficiency \nFoundation, to help other families facing PIDD in my home State of \nIllinois.\n  I would also like to tell you about another courageous family in my \nState, the Berryhills, who became foster parents to an infant that was \nfinally diagnosed with severe combined immune deficiency, SCID, or \nbubble boy syndrome. Their son, who they want to adopt, would have died \nif Zina and Ray Berryhill did not persist in finding out why he was \ndying before their eyes. Their son was finally diagnosed with SCID, and \nthe cure for him is a bone marrow transplant. Unfortunately, they have \nnot been able to find a match, due to the shortage of African Americans \non the Marrow Donor List. Zina Berryhill continues to hold bone marrow \ndrives, and keeps her son isolated, except for his frequent trips to \nthe hospital for his IGIV infusions. The Berryhill family has also \nbecome active volunteers for the Immune Deficiency Foundation.\n  Despite the recent progress in PIDD research, the average length of \ntime between the onset of symptoms in a patient and a definitive \ndiagnosis of PIDD is 9.2 years. In the interim, those afflicted may \nsuffer repeated and serious infections and possibly irreversible damage \nto internal organs. That is why it is critical that we raise awareness \nabout these illnesses within the general public and the health care \ncommunity.\n  I commend the Immune Deficiency Foundation for its leadership in this \narea and I am proud to join them in recognizing the week of April 19 as \nNational Primary Immune Deficiency Diseases Awareness Week. I encourage \nmy colleagues to work with us to help improve the quality of life for \nPIDD patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4293-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4293-S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FIVE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF COLUMBINE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week marks the 5-year anniversary of \nthe tragic shooting of 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High \nSchool in Littleton, CO. The very mention of Columbine High School \nstrikes a nerve with the American public. It reminds us of that \nhorrendous scene of terrified children running from their assailants as \nSWAT teams descended on their school.\n  Earlier this week, students, parents and residents of Littleton \ngathered at Columbine High School to remember those who died and renew \ntheir commitment to address school violence. The anniversary brought \nback painful memories. Michael Shoels, the father of student Isaiah \nShoels, who was killed in the shooting, told the Associated Press, \n``It's most definitely something I think about every day but, you know, \nwe can't wallow in victimhood. Under the circumstances, we need to get \nout there and do something about it.''\n  In response to this massacre, many schools have implemented security\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\nmeasures such as posting in-school police officers, installing security \ncameras and metal detectors, and developing emergency response \nprograms. But a recent report from the National School Safety and \nSecurity Services, a firm specializing in school security and school \nsafety for K-12 schools, found an increase in school-related violent \ndeaths in the 2003-2004 school year. According to the report, there \nhave been 43 violent deaths nationwide this school year, more than the \nprevious 2 years combined and more than any school year prior to \nColumbine. In addition, there have been more than 60 non-fatal \nshootings this year and more than 160 other incidents of high-profile \nviolence, such as stabbings and riots. This is simply not acceptable.\n  Despite continued school violence, the President has not led on this \nissue and Congress has also failed to enact sensible gun safety laws \nthat could help to turn the tide. In fact, President Bush's budget \nproposes eliminating funding for the COPS school resource officer \nprogram. We have yet to close the gun show loophole, despite bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate. And, while the President has said he supports \nreauthorizing the assault weapons ban and a bipartisan majority in the \nSenate is on the record supporting reauthorization there are no plans \nto consider this important legislation before it expires on September \n13 of this year.\n  America's schools need our help and these are simple, commonsense \nsteps we can take to improve school safety. I urge my colleagues to \nclose the gun show loophole, keep the ban on assault weapons, and \nrestore funding for COPS school resource officers. As the end of \nanother school year approaches, the push to enact sensible gun safety \nlegislation must continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4294-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today recognizing the \n100th anniversary of the American Lung Association.\n  For a century, the American Lung Association has been addressing some \nof the Nation's most pressing health issues. In 1904, a dedicated and \nhard-working group of physicians, nurses, and volunteers came together \nwith the goal of eradicating tuberculosis. The result was one of the \nNation's oldest community-based, voluntary health organizations, and \nits fight against tuberculosis has produced amazing results throughout \nthe 20th century.\n  When the American Lung Association realized there was a new and \ndangerous problem facing the Nation--that of chronic lung disease--it \nbegan to shift focus away from TB and toward healthy lungs. Soon, the \nLung Association had one of the most extensive programs for fighting \nlung disease in the Nation.\n  Using a multi-faceted approach, the American Lung Association works \nin the areas of research, education, and advocacy. It has courageously \nbattled tobacco companies for the past 40 years, though its position \nwas not always a popular one. Furthermore, the Lung Association, \nconcerned about environmental factors such as air pollution, was a \nleader in passing the 1970s Clean Air Act.\n  Our Nation is a better place and our families are healthier because \nof the work of the American Lung Association. I am proud to \ncongratulate the association, and I ask my colleagues to join me in \nformally acknowledging their fine work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4294-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO THE CITY OF ASHLAND, KY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I would like to take the \nopportunity to congratulate the leaders in Ashland, KY who contributed \nto the downtown revitalization of the city. Ashland was one of 31 \ncities in Kentucky that received national recognition for its efforts \nin historic preservation on Tuesday, April 20, 2004.\n  First Lady Laura Bush presented the Preserve America recognition \naward to Ashland Mayor, Steve Gilmore, and Main Street Board President, \nLarry Jones. The initiative recognizes communities that protect and \ncelebrate their heritage, use their historic assets for economic \ndevelopment and community revitalization and encourage people to \nexperience and appreciate historic resources through education and \ntourism programs.\n  Of the 65 ``Preserve America'' U.S. communities that the First Lady \nLaura Bush has designated, 31 are in Kentucky. In President Bush's \nproposed budget for fiscal year 2005, he included $10 million for \nPreserve America communities. Ashland will be eligible to compete for \nsome of the money Congress appropriates.\n  The large number of Kentucky communities honored by the First Lady \nshows how important preservation is in Kentucky, and I commend these \ncommunities for their hard work and dedication to the various projects. \nI join all Kentuckians in congratulating Mayor Gilmore and the city of \nAshland on their beautiful downtown revitalization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4294-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNITION OF DANIEL T. BRANTON\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Daniel T. \nBranton of Leland, MS, for his distinguished service as president of \nDelta Council this year.\n  Delta Council is an economic development organization representing \nthe 18 Delta and part-Delta counties of Northwest Mississippi. \nOrganized in 1935, Delta Council has worked to bring together the \nagriculture and business leadership of the region to focus on the \nchallenges which face the economy and the people of the Mississippi \ndelta.\n  Ad president of Delta Council and a farm leader, Dan has been a \nstrong proponent of maintaining the agricultural policies which were \nadopted in the 2002 Farm Law. As a representative voice of farmers from \nthe Delta region which produces more than $3 billion of agricultural \ngoods annually, Dan's advice on matters affecting agriculture has been \ninvaluable to me and my staff as we attempt to address those issues \nwhich will ensure the future viability of American agriculture.\n  Dan has been a strong proponent of Delta Council's programs in \neducation and health care. During Dan's year as president, the teacher \nshortage programs which evolved from earlier Delta Council policies \nhave expanded in a way that is having a meaningful impact on the \nproblem of attracting school teachers to rural areas.\n  I am pleased that I have had the opportunity to work with Dan and \nDelta Council to make certain that special health care needs in areas \nsuch as the Mississippi Delta, where there is a large underserved \npopulation, have been enhanced. Through Delta Council's efforts to \nestablish the Delta Health Alliance, a new Federal and local \npartnership is now producing extraordinary outcomes. In the area of \ntransportation and water resource improvement, Dan has coordinated the \nactivities of Delta Council in a manner which has brought local \nconsensus to very touch issues facing the Delta's economic future. Dan \nhas been a leader in all aspects of Delta Council's work while \nmaintaining a successful family farming operation.\n  Dan has also been a leader in his community. He currently serves as \npresident of Burdette Gin Company and is a director of Leland Compress. \nHe is also a delegate and has served as a director of the National \nCotton Council. Dan serves on the Black Bayou Drainage Commission and \nis a former member of the Advisory Board for the Mississippi Department \nof Agriculture and Commerce.\n  I congratulate Dan Branton for his contributions to the Delta region, \nthe State of Mississippi, and the Nation. I look forward to his future \ncontributions in improving the quality of life for our \ncitizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4294-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4294-S4296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN TRIBUTE TO JOHN PALMS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, John Palms, the former president \nof the University of South Carolina, will be honored this week with \nMepkin Abbey's newly established Wisdom Award.\n  All of us in the Senate would be a little wiser ourselves to read the \nfollowing article from the April 10 Charleston Post and Courier, on Dr. \nPalms. He is an inspiration to all that the American dream is alive and \nwell. I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4295]]\n\n  The article follows.\n\n         [From the Charleston Post and Courier, Apr. 10, 2004]\n\n  John Palms--Nuclear Physicist Leads the Way in Science, Education, \n                      Religion and the World Stage\n\n                            (By Judy Watts)\n\n       ``Learning humanizes character and does not permit it to be \n     cruel'' is the University of South Carolina motto.\n       The words also epitomize John Palms' philosophy, not only \n     as the former USC president, but as a physicist and a human \n     being.\n       Although his formal training is in nuclear physics, his \n     life events have given him an educated perspective on \n     physics' ambiguous nature, both in the weapons he designed \n     and in the research, which had medical applications. As \n     president of two universities, he fulfilled his destiny as an \n     educator who believed in building not only well-educated \n     people, but also people of character.\n       On April 24, Palms will be presented with Mepkin Abbey's \n     newly established Wisdom Award, given for a lifetime of \n     achievement based on the highest human aspirations. Since his \n     years as a cadet at The Citadel, Mepkin Abbey has been a \n     personal touch-stone, a place where he has been able to focus \n     and center his life.\n       John Palms has come a long way from the little dutch boy \n     who fled a Hitler-terrorized Europe with his family.\n\n\n                           MAKING OF THE MAN\n\n       It was 1939 and Hitler had invaded Poland. John Palms was 4 \n     years old and sandbags were being piled on the front lawn in \n     anticipation of war. Palms; father, deciding it was dangerous \n     for the family to remain, concocted a story that they needed \n     to travel to South America to buy wool for his underwear \n     factory that supplied the Dutch military.\n       ``The North Sea had been mined and there were severe \n     restrictions about visas,'' says Palms.\n       The family took a train to Italy and from there a boat \n     headed for South America. En route, a submarine stopped the \n     boat and someone was taken off, says Palms.\n       ``I remember commotion and crying. My father has 8-mm film \n     of the submarine.''\n       For seven months the family lived in Rio de Janeiro until \n     they could obtain visas to continue on to New York, where \n     they arrived in February 1940. They waited out the war there.\n       When Palms was 11, the family returned to Holland to get \n     restitution for the family's damaged textile factory and \n     haberdashery.\n       ``We didn't want to go back because we were already \n     Americanized.''\n       Once in Holland, he and his siblings were faced with an \n     academic hardship.\n       ``We spoke Dutch in our house in New York, so when we went \n     back I could speak Dutch but could not read a word of it.\n       ``I was home-schooled for awhile and then tutored by the \n     Jesuits.''\n       At 14, he passed the comprehensive exam to get into St. \n     Aloysius College at The Hague.\n       ``I wasn't an outstanding student. I was excited about \n     being in a different country. There was lots of talk about \n     the war when we returned to Holland.''\n       Palms heard firsthand stories of Buchenwald from his uncle \n     who had been arrested for helping Jews escape from the Nazis.\n       ``His own neighbor told on him and he was taken to \n     Buchenwald. There was such fear that even if you knew about \n     something and didn't report it, you were at risk. But he \n     survived. Every time I see a German movie, I have to watch \n     it, and I read anything I can find on the concentration camps \n     and Buchenwald.''\n       The taste of American culture so prevalent in postwar \n     Hollard fueled the family's desire to return to the United \n     States. In 1951, they came back and settled in Clearwater, \n     Fla.\n       Palms graduated from Clearwater High School with no plans \n     for the future.\n       ``I decided to do nothing. I was over-Americanized by all \n     the American movies where people raised themselves up by \n     their bootstraps. I never got the message that you needed an \n     education. I thought I would find some opportunity by being \n     ingenious and creative.''\n       His parents had not gone to college, yet his father had \n     been a successful entrepreneur, a salesman who had bought one \n     sewing machine, then another and another, and ended up with \n     his own factory. Palms tried his luck first as a painter's \n     helper, then as a plumber and first mate on a boat.\n       His nonplan didn't work out. When he and some friends heard \n     about the great-paying automobile factory jobs in Detroit, \n     they made the trip. A day after they arrived, there was a \n     strike.\n       ``That was a real semester of realizations for me.''\n       Back in Clearwater, he ran into a friend who made a \n     suggestion. It was a suggestion that set his life on a \n     remarkable course.\n       ``My buddy said I could go to St. Petersburg Junior College \n     for $50. So, I borrowed $50 from my father.''\n       Palms enrolled. He wanted to find out if he was capable of \n     college work. Although he could read English, he read slowly. \n     He pulled a C in English and did well in math and chemistry. \n     Another suggestion from this brother was that he attend a \n     military academy. Palms wrote to West Point and got a letter \n     back saying he couldn't apply because he was not an American \n     citizen. His citizenship was still two years away.\n       His older brother had heard about The Citadel.\n       ``If I graduated as a distinguished cadet, I would get a \n     regular commission and could become a pilot. The Citadel had \n     just appointed a new president, Gen. Mark Clark, whom my dad \n     thought was the most wonderful American. I applied to \n     The Citadel and, sight unseen, I got in. Absolutely \n     amazing; they must have been short of students that year.\n       ``It was 1954. Dad drove me up to No. 2 barracks and saw \n     those bars on the windows and in his Dutch accent said, \n     ``Zyahn'--he couldn't say the J--`you don't have to go here \n     if you don't want to.' I told him it was exactly what I \n     wanted; that I needed the discipline and the structure. I \n     signed up for Air Force ROTC.''\n       The plan was to get his business degree, gain his \n     commission and become an Air Force pilot. He managed C's in \n     English and history, but again excelled in math, science and \n     German. He followed his strength and switched his major to \n     physics. There were five students in the program. As planned, \n     he graduated as a distinguished ROTC cadet.\n       ``But I failed the eye exam, so I couldn't be a pilot. The \n     head of the physics department and the ROTC called me in and \n     said they would give me a commission anyway and send me to \n     graduate school for one year. I chose Emory because they were \n     on the quarter system and I could finish my master's in a \n     year there.''\n\n\n                                academia\n\n       Two days after graduating from Emory, he was married to \n     Norma Cannon (``the most wonderful person I ever imagined \n     finding''), and the next few years were filled with \n     completing his master's, teaching physics at the Air Force \n     Academy, getting out of the Air Force and completing his \n     Ph.D.\n       He went to Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico, \n     where he did his dissertation and designed nuclear weapons.\n       ``Emory kept track of me and offered me to come back as a \n     professor. We struggled with that. I had the opportunity to \n     go to Stanford, but Southern ladies have to come back to the \n     South, so we did. We had a 23-year career at Emory.''\n       Palms worked his way through the ranks from associate \n     professor to vice president for academic affairs more than \n     two decades later, when he took a sabbatical. During the \n     break, he received numerous calls from other universities \n     that wanted him to come on board as president. Georgia State \n     was his choice.\n       But he had barely settled in there when he got a call from \n     a head hunter that the problem-ridden University of South \n     Carolina wanted Palms as President. The decision to move was \n     not easy and came only after a family weekend of soul-\n     searching and discussion.\n       They arrived in Columbia on the Ides of March 1991. The \n     first couple of years in Columbia were rough.\n       ``All the qualities that are important at a university had \n     been violated. And that affects hiring and tenure. The \n     president is expected to be the role model. The faculty is, \n     also. People don't understand the life of a university \n     president. There is a moral authority,'' says Palms.\n       He wanted to return the university to its core: learning \n     and the search for truth.\n       Within three years, USC's reputation was restored and the \n     school was in a position to launch a major campaign. He and \n     Norma traveled all over the country, cultivating and \n     nurturing people who might contribute. They also developed a \n     professional staff for financial development. Their goal was \n     to raise $200 million. When he stepped down after 11 years, \n     the couple had raised more than $500 million for the school.\n       During his tenure at USC, the SAT scores of incoming \n     freshmen rose 150 points, hundreds of thousands in research \n     grants were gained, and standards for hiring and tenure were \n     raised in all 52 departments.\n\n\n                                PHYSICS\n\n       Physics was the platform on which Palms built his career.\n       ``All my life I have struggled with the place of modern \n     physics in society and the morality of nuclear deterrence. \n     Should we be using nuclear weapons to deter war?''\n       Palms has been chairman of IDA--the Institute for Defense \n     Analysis--for five years and a member for 14 years.\n       ``IDA was set up right after WWII to bring university \n     talents into issues of national security,'' says Palms. ``It \n     started with the presidents of Harvard and MIT and a board of \n     military people and former congressmen.''\n       The group conducts independent analysis for the Secretary \n     of Defense and for Congress.\n       ``It (defense) can be so political, but this is really \n     independent analysis. We do everything from evaluating and \n     testing weapons systems to designing and forecasting.''\n       The issue of fighter planes and mobile-force \n     transformations from a Cold War world to present-day needs is \n     now being studied.\n       ``More coordination and use of equipment among the services \n     is becoming an integral part of what we are doing now and in \n     the future,'' says Palms. ``We are heavily involved in \n     homeland security right now, and we are also heavily involved \n     in Iraq--the whole operation. We are mainly sitting there \n     looking at what needs to be done and standing ready to do \n     these studies.''\n       IDA also works on advanced computer systems and mathematics \n     for cryptology.\n       ``You have the very best minds in the world to do this. \n     Every two years, we take 20 of the very best Ph.D.s in \n     universities and orient them to this work.''\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\n       After two years of site visits and orientation, new members \n     are assigned to a committee.\n       Palms became involved in IDA, in part, because he had \n     developed systems at Los Alamos, and IDA needed somebody who \n     knew about weapons. He also brought a firsthand perspective \n     to what happened in Europe during World War II. He says he is \n     always watchful for the signs of a similar situation \n     emerging.\n       ``When I was at Los Alamos (1963-66), I worked on weapons \n     design and fundamental physics research, which could have \n     been used for weapons development, or input to medicine, the \n     environment, ecology or therapeutic medicine. So, even though \n     funded by the Department of Defense, the results are there \n     for the world to use the way it wants to. Just because the \n     research is used in nuclear weapons, you shouldn't stop doing \n     it because it is also used in all these other areas.\n       ``There is the issue of a two-edged sword. As a scientist, \n     you have the obligation to make the public aware and \n     anticipate how the information should be used, whether it is \n     proper to use it one way or another.''\n       Such discussions of religion and science were a familiar \n     topic that he and the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin often \n     considered.\n       ``He wrote a commission report on the morality of nuclear \n     deterrence (Time, Nov. 29, 1982, issue; titled ``God and the \n     Bomb''). You can justify only so much deterrence. If there \n     had been no Russia and we had been the only nuclear power, we \n     would have to be very careful. We are living in that kind of \n     age now. You can't overuse your power. It must always be used \n     in response to the threat. Where's the other threat?''\n       Palms first met Cardinal Bernardin while a cadet at The \n     Citadel. His wife knew Bernardin as her teacher at Bishop \n     England High School.\n       ``He baptized our children. It's a funny world.''\n       Palms is currently involved with neutrino research through \n     USC and a consortium of 13 universities.\n       ``Neutrino is one of the subatomic particles. People have \n     been trying to find if it has mass or not. It might explain \n     the missing dark matter in the universe. My role is that I \n     built one of the first detectors. Those detectors have \n     evolved. I'm trying to make a contribution and also helping \n     to find funding for this. It will cost about $40 million to \n     $50 million.''\n       He also continues to teach physics classes at USC, \n     including a lab course in which the class will conduct four \n     Nobel prize-winning experiments.\n       Although he didn't continue in the Air Force, he is content \n     that he is doing his part through IDA.\n       ``This is almost better. This is my contribution to the \n     country and to national security, and I'm happy to be able to \n     serve my country.''\n\n\n                             the home front\n\n       Norma Palms describes her husband of 45 years as a great \n     husband and father with a wonderful sense of humor.\n       ``Everyone wants him full time, yet he never wants to take \n     the credit for anything,'' she says.\n       Today, the couple divide their time between Columbia and \n     their home in Wild Dunes. His retirement from USC has allowed \n     more time for their grown children, Lee, John and Danielle, \n     and nine grandchildren. Norma says they have looked forward \n     to this time as a couple.\n       ``The time to be with our children and grandchildren has \n     been very special,'' she says. ``We can take off and go see \n     the grandchildren on their birthdays and for holidays. We \n     couldn't do that before. We especially look forward to \n     getting everyone together for family reunions here at the \n     house.''\n       The couple are very involved at their church, St. Thomas \n     More, and served as honorary chairs for the church's recent \n     50th-anniversary celebration.\n       Mepkin Abbey also is part of their spiritual life. In fact, \n     Palms sees a link between the abbey and finding Norma.\n       ``When I was 21, I was ready to make a serious commitment \n     to someone and went to Mepkin Abbey and prayed about that. I \n     was trying to find out if I was doing the right thing with my \n     life. Two weeks later I met Norma.''\n       Today, the couple go to the abbey together, then they take \n     different paths and read alone in the gardens.\n       ``We contemplate our lives and come back together and get \n     rededicated again. We think a lot of the brothers. Their \n     spirituality has been important in our lives,'' says Norma.\n       Palms says he is honored to receive the Wisdom Award from \n     Mepkin Abbey.\n       ``I have a lot more years to live, and there are many \n     people who have done a lot more for the state for a lot \n     longer than I have. This is a wonderful honor from them.''\n       Chairman of the award committee, Dr. Theodore Stern, says \n     Palms was chosen because of his abilities as a team leader.\n       ``He's very dedicated and has made a tremendous \n     contribution to the academics of South Carolina. He is an \n     outstanding individual and leader and has worked on so many \n     education and government commissions,'' says Stern, ``and his \n     wife, Norma, also has been a leader.''\n       Norma headed up the abbey's capital campaign.\n       ``My whole heart was in that. I still hold them as No. 1 on \n     my priority list,'' she says.\n       Palms credits Norma's outgoing personality with softening \n     his technocratic tendencies.\n       ``I'm made up of everyone I've ever met and known, but \n     Norma is the biggest influence and the most important person \n     in my life,'' says Palms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4296-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING EAST BRUNSWICK HIGH SCHOOL'S SUCCESS IN ``WE THE PEOPLE'' \n                                PROGRAM\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

BROOKS\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \nlife of a distinguished public servant and a true friend, Judge Gene E. \nBrooks, who passed away Monday, April 19, 2004. His long life was \nfilled with conscientious service and unwavering dedication to our \nState and Nation. The contributions he made to American jurisprudence, \ncombined with the many lives he touched along the way, leave behind a \npositive legacy that will not soon be forgotten.\n  Judge Brooks began his career in public service by honorably serving \nour country with the United States Marines during the Korean War. He \nearned his undergraduate degree from the Indiana State Teachers College \nand went on to study law at the Indiana University School of Law. Judge \nBrooks practiced law as a prosecuting attorney and in private practice \nin Posey County, IN, from 1960 to 1968. He was then appointed to serve \nas the first full-time bankruptcy judge for the Southern District of \nIndiana, where he worked until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter \nappointed Judge Brooks as a United States District Court Judge. His \nnomination was forwarded to President Carter by my father, Senator \nBirch Bayh. Judge Brooks went on to become the Chief Judge of the \nSouthern District in 1987.\n  The positive imprints Gene made upon the United States legal \nlandscape came not only through his many judicial rulings, but also \nthrough his active role as advisor to the United States Congress, as \nwell as his membership and leadership as former president of the \nNational Conference of Bankruptcy Judges. In addition to his \nprofessional service, Judge Brooks was an active member of many \ncommunity organizations, including the Indiana Legal Aid Society, the \nKiwanis Club, Toastmasters, the Indiana State Museum Foundation, and \nthe Evansville Petroleum Club. He was a Kentucky Colonel and a 32nd \nDegree Mason.\n  Judge Brooks is survived by his wife, Jan Darlene (Gibson) Brooks; \nhis three sons, Gene E. ``Geno'' Brooks Jr., Marc E. Brooks, Gregory A. \nBrooks; his daughter, Stephanie Jobe; his sister, Joyce Brochman; and \nhis three grandchildren.\n  Judge Brooks was a man who walked with kings, but never lost the \ncommon touch. The citizens of the State of Indiana and the United \nStates of America were well served by the life led by the Honorable \nJudge Brooks. Gene was a dedicated family man and public servant. He \ntouched many lives over the\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\ncourse of his career and will be remembered as a loving husband, \nfather, and an incredible leader.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Gene E. Brooks in the official \nRecord of the U.S. Senate. May God be with all who mourn his passing, \nas I know He is with Gene.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4297-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 440th \nanniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare in Stratford-upon-Avon. \nShakespeare's name is undoubtedly the most recognized in English \nliterature. Every one of us has spent time exploring the Elizabethan \nsociety and language through Shakespeare's dramas, poems, and sonnets. \nI remember with great enthusiasm the times I read Shakespeare or \nwatched one of his plays. Who among us does not have their favorite \nline from one of Shakespeare's many works? Mine, which all of us in \nthis chamber should pause to consider from time to time, comes from \n``Hamlet Prince of Denmark'': ``This above all: to thine own self be \ntrue, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be \nfalse to any man.''\n  His plays abound with all of the human emotions: love, jealousy, \nhatred, joy, envy, and are filled with the eternal themes of loyalty, \nbetrayal, friendship, and revenge. He wrote of family strife, of the \nbest laid plans gone awry, of tender love and bitter feuds. His themes \ntranscend culture, nationality, and ethnicity. They are universal; and \nto this day are repeated time and time again throughout the world. From \nthe American retelling of ``Romeo and Juliet'' in ``West Side Story'' \nto the Japanese adaptation of ``King Lear'' in ``Ran,'' Shakespeare's \ncultural influence is virtually limitless. Was William Shakespeare a \nvisionary? Or was he simply a keen observer, chronicling human \nrelationships that have essentially remained unchanged in the four \ncenturies since he lived?\n  We, in Oregon, are very fortunate to have the renowned Oregon \nShakespeare Festival which has been presenting its namesake's works, as \nwell as other classic and contemporary plays, for nearly 40 years. Some \n380,000 people--Oregonians and audiences from various parts of the \ncountry and the world--visit Ashland each year to attend these \nrepertory performances. From the very first productions of ``The \nMerchant of Venice'' and ``Twelfth Night'' to this year's ``The Comedy \nof Errors,'' ``King Lear,'' ``Henry VI,'' and ``Much Ado About \nNothing,'' the Oregon Shakespeare Festival has brought Shakespeare's \nmagic and great wit to life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4297-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO COLONEL AARON ``BURLEY'' BURLESON\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Inhofe and \nmyself, I wish to honor and pay respect to a great Oklahoman, COL (Ret) \nAaron ``Burley'' Burleson. Currently, he is the director of Military \nDevelopment of the Altus Chamber of Commerce, Altus, OK. He has served \nthe State of Oklahoma and the United States for many years.\n  Mr. Burleson was born in Lawton, OK, and graduated from Lawton High \nSchool. While attending Cameron College in Lawton, he was mobilized for \nactive duty with the 45th Infantry Division in 1940. After completing \npilot training in 1944 at Pampa Army Airfield, TX, Burley Burleson \nreceived his commission as a second lieutenant. Over the next 30 years \nhe would serve his country around the globe.\n  He served as special air missions officer in the Office of the Vice \nChief of Staff, U.S. Air Force, the Pentagon. During this assignment, \nBurley worked directly with the White House, the Office of the \nSecretary of State, the Senate and the House of Representatives. His \nmain assignment was to provide airlift for both United States and \nforeign dignitaries.\n  In 1970, he transferred to Altus Air Force Base, OK, where he served \nas Vice Commander of the 443rd Military Airlift Wing and later as base \ncommander in 1973.\n  Retiring as a colonel from the Air Force in 1974, he immediately \nbecame the executive director of the ``Committee of 100,'' a special \npart of the Altus Chamber of Commerce. The main purpose of the \ncommittee was to strengthen and promote economic development of Altus \nand Jackson County, OK. After serving as the head of the organization \nfrom 1975 to 1984, Burley became the community's liaison between the \nmen and women of Altus and the personnel assigned to Altus Air Force \nBase.\n  Burley's leadership brought about tremendous support for Altus AFB. \nWorking with Air Force personnel and congressional Members, he was able \nto help secure needed funding and resources for the base. Some examples \ninclude new housing, runway easements, a parallel assault runway, a \ncorrosion control facility and a drop zone. In 1982, a tornado struck \nAltus AFB and caused severe damage. Under Burley's leadership, critical \nfunding was obtained to repair the damages. These projects helped Altus \nAir Force Base become rated as the best base in the Air Force a few \nyears ago.\n  Burley has received numerous awards and citations through the years \nfor his many achievements. Recently, Air Education Training Command \nsingled Burley out for one of four, first time, ``Pioneer Awards'' to \ncommemorate the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force. He was also \nheavily involved with the Air Force Association, at the national and \nthe State levels, as well as numerous civic and charitable \norganizations in Altus.\n  Burley Burleson, unfortunately, suffered a stroke in November of 2002 \nand is currently recovering. Jim Inhofe and I are proud to call him a \nfriend and appreciate his dedicated service to our great country. His \npositive contributions to countless friends, all Oklahomans, and the \nU.S. Air Force are greatly appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4297-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4297-S4298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL SCHOPP\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today in the Senate to honor \n15 year-old Michael Schopp, from Creve Coeur, MO. In a ceremony \nhonoring his achievement on May 2, 2004, Mr. Schopp will receive the \nEagle Scout Award, which is the highest advancement rank a young man \nmay earn in scouting.\n  To earn his Eagle Award, Mr. Schopp designed, planned and supervised \nthe construction and landscaping of a planter and two dugout benches \nfor the Ballwin Athletic Association baseball fields where he played \nball for several years.\n  Mr. Schopp began his scouting experience as a Cub Scout in elementary \nschool and has been a member of Troop 631, sponsored by St. Mark \nPresbyterian Church in Ballwin, MO, since March 2000. Mr. Schopp's \ndedication to the values of scouting and his leadership ability are \ndemonstrated in his many scouting activities over the years: he has \nserved his boy scout troop as Patrol Leader and Assistant Patrol \nLeader, and is currently one of the leaders of his troop as a member of \nthe Executive Patrol and as Assistant Senior Patrol Leader. Mr. Schopp \nparticipated in the Junior Leader Training Camp and also attended three \nBoy Scout High Adventure Camps: Northern Tier in Ely, MN; Sea Base in \nFlorida; and OKPIK Winter Camp in Northern Minnesota.\n  The rank of Eagle Scout has always carried with it a special \nsignificance since it was first awarded in 1912 and its rigorous \nstandards have been maintained over the years. That rigor is \ndemonstrated in the fact that only 4 percent of young men across \nAmerica who join the boy scouts earn this prestigious award. Mr. Schopp \nwill be in good company as there are leaders in every walk of life who \nhave endeavored to earn this coveted award. Indeed, many Eagle Scouts \nhave gone on in life to excel in professional athletics, business, \nspace exploration, entertainment, scientific discovery and public \nservice in government. President Gerald Ford is an Eagle Scout as well \nas two of my distinguished colleagues in this chamber, Senator Jeff \nSessions of Alabama and Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana.\n  The people of Creve Coeur, MO are fortunate to have Mr. Schopp living \nand growing in their community. I congratulate Mr. Schopp for his \nsuccess in earning his Eagle Scout Award. But also, I congratulate all \nof his peers, members of his troop, coaches, teachers, and parents for \nall the support and encouragement they have given that has helped Mr. \nSchopp reach his goals.\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\n  I know that all of my colleagues in the Senate will join me in \noffering congratulations to Mr. Schopp on a job well done and to extend \nbest wishes for all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4298-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING LT. COL. MARC SUKOLSKY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to honor Lt. Col. Marc \nSukolsky, a long time Idaho resident, upon his retirement from 24 years \nof service in the U.S. Air Force. Mark has served his country well, in \npeacetime and in war. Idaho is proud to be represented by such a \ndedicated soldier.\n  Marc Sukolsky received his master's degree in music pedagogy and then \ntaught at Idaho State University. After 4 years of teaching, Marc began \nhis extensive military leadership career in logistics in the Ninth Air \nForce and 363rd Fighter Wing. Exhibiting strong leadership early in his \ncareer, Marc was chosen as a senior logistics and resource inspector to \ndevelop future military base locations in Southwest Asia. In this \nposition his inherent abilities as a negotiator and diplomat became \nwell known. As his expertise grew, so did his influence. Mark's advice \nwas solicited by the most senior officials including the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff.\n   In 1993, while stationed at the U.S. Embassy in the Netherlands, \nMarc played an important role in organizing logistical agreements \nbetween the U.S. and the Netherlands. This involved organizing troop \nand equipment movement both within the Netherlands and throughout \nEurope. As a military representative for the U.S. Secretary of State, \nMarc was also able to negotiate with foreign officials for permanent \ntroop positions in Europe.\n  In the mid 1990's, he was called to assist NATO Allied Forces during \nthe crisis in the Balkans. He drafted and implemented strategies for \nall logistical arrangements between the U.S. and Allied forces. In \naddition, he provided guidance and training for those nations seeking \nNATO membership.\n  His abilities to plan and execute defense, economic, and trade policy \nwere tested and proven, when as a Commander he led the deployment of \nover 1.5 million pounds of equipment and 3,400 personnel to sensitive \nareas including the Persian Gulf. He managed to save the government \nover $19 million with new budgetary and finance programs. Leading the \nquality assurance of flying wing he recorded over 28,000 sorties and \nover 49,000 hours of flawless flying. In this position he was the \nprincipal advisor to the U.S. Ambassador of U.S. European Command on \nall armament matters. While serving in this capacity, he negotiated \nover $135 million in arms sales in 2002. He also contracted an $800 \nmillion aircraft development deal with the Netherlands.\n  In all of this, the role of his wife Ellen should not be understated. \nDuring 25 years of marriage, she has made tremendous sacrifices during \nMarc's time in the military. Together, they have spent 11 years \noverseas, relocated eleven times, and even spent 2 years apart during \ntwo 2-year separations.\n  I would like to honor Lt. Col. Marc Sukolsky and Ellen Sukolsky for \ntheir selfless service and sacrifice for their country. It is \nespecially appropriate during this time of conflict to recognize a \ncouple who have done so much for the freedom and stability of their \ncountry and the world. I wish both of them the best as they approach \nthis new chapter of life together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4298-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               LAURA JOSS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to Laura \nJoss, superintendent of Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic \nShrine and Hampton National Historic Site, NHS. Laura has recently been \nappointed superintendent of Arches National Park in southern Utah and I \nwish her and her family the best of luck with this new assignment and \nthank her for the outstanding job she did in managing and enhancing \nFort McHenry and Hampton NHS since coming to Maryland in 2000.\n  Over the past 4 years, I have had the opportunity and privilege to \nwork closely with Laura Joss in efforts to protect and restore the \nhistorical resources of Fort McHenry and Hampton NHS and to develop a \nStar Spangled Banner National Historic Trail to help educate our \ncitizens about a pivotal, but sadly neglected period in our Nation's \nhistory. In every instance, Laura proved herself to be a skillful and \nhighly effective leader. Under her direction, Fort McHenry's seawalls \nand many historic structures have been restored, plans have been \nadvanced to develop a new visitors center to accommodate the increasing \nnumber of visitors to the fort, many preservation projects have been \nundertaken at Hampton and a new general management plan for this \nhistoric site has been completed. Laura and her dedicated staff have \nfrequently gone beyond the call of duty, offering to assist with the \nrecovery efforts from the recent water taxi accident in Baltimore's \nHarbor and the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center and \nvolunteering with the National Flag Day Foundation, Historic Towson \nInc, and the Baltimore City Heritage Area, to name only a few examples.\n  Laura's dedication to the stewardship of the National Park System has \nearned her the respect of everyone with whom she has worked. During her \n14-year career in the National Park Service, she has protected and \nimproved some of our Nation's most precious natural and cultural \ntreasures. Beginning as a volunteer at Mesa Verde National Park, she \nquickly advanced to serve in a number of national park units throughout \nthe country, including Yellowstone National Park, Bryce Canyon National \nPark, and Glen Canyon National Recreation. Through her accomplishments \nshe has set a high bar for all those to follow in her path, and the \nvisitors to these national parks will benefit from her efforts for \nyears to come. I greatly value the assistance Laura provided to me and \nmy staff. I extend my personal congratulations and thanks for her many \nyears of hard work and dedication to the principal conservation mission \nof the National Park Service and join with her friends and coworkers in \nwishing her, her husband Stuart Meehan, and her daughters Lindsay and \nElizabeth, well with this new assignment and relocation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4298-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4298-S4299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IN HONOR OF BRIGADIER GENERAL RICHARD L. URSONE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \noutstanding American soldier, BG Richard L. Ursone. General Ursone, a \nnative of Stamford, CT, is retiring June 30, 2004 after 33 years of \ndistinguished service in the United States Army Medical Service Corps.\n  General Ursone played a critical role in shaping and successfully \nexecuting the mission of the United States Army Medical Department. \nWhen brave men and women across our country commit to serving our \ncountry in the Armed Forces, our country also makes a commitment to \nthem. And part of that commitment is to provide them with world-class \nmedical care, both on and off the field of battle. Throughout his \ncareer, General Ursone has made invaluable contributions to the health \nand well-being of soldiers in the United States Army. Over the past \nthree decades, General Ursone has served in a series of demanding \nassignments around the globe and in leadership positions of increasing \nresponsibility.\n  Of particular note was General Ursone's service in combat during \nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. From 1990 to 1991, General \nUrsone, then a Lieutenant Colonel, served as commander of the 47th \nMedical Logistics Battalion. He successfully deployed and led his \nsoldiers in supporting the war effort and the entire U.S. Army Central \nCommand Theater of Operations with the delivery and replenishment of \nneeded medications and medical supplies.\n  From 1994 to 1996, then-Colonel Ursone served as the commander of the \nU.S. Army Medical Materiel Center, Europe in Pirmasens, Germany. \nThrough his leadership, he reengineered the center's business practices \nto ensure that our soldiers stationed in Europe and their families \nreceived medical supplies and medications quickly and efficiently. His \nhard work and many accomplishments were recognized with the prestigious \nVice President Gore's Hammer Award.\n  In 2000, he was promoted to brigadier general. As a general officer \nhe served in multiple senior positions and was also appointed as the \nfourteenth chief of the Army Medical Service Corps.\n\n[[Page S4299]]\n\n  As the commander of the Europe Regional Medical Command, General \nUrsone led a health care system comprised of a medical center, two \nhospitals, and 27 clinics. This medical command supported operations \nspanning over three continents--Europe, Africa and Asia--while \nsimultaneously providing healthcare to over 250,000 soldiers, family \nmembers, retirees and civilians from the Department of Defense. In \nsubsequent assignments as the Assistant Surgeon General for Force \nSustainment and the Assistant Surgeon General for Force Projection from \nJune 2002 to June 2004, General Ursone's leadership was integral in \npreparing the Army Medical Department to serve our troops in their \nefforts against the new and unfamiliar threat of global terrorism.\n  As chief of the Medical Service Corps, General Ursone has unified the \nmost diverse group of specialties in the Army. His commitment to leader \ndevelopment and mentoring of junior officers helped the Corps achieve \nannual increases in recruiting and retaining officers. General Ursone's \nvision and leadership have created opportunities for officers to serve \nour Nation while also achieving their own professional and personal \naspirations.\n  Health care in the Army encompasses a staggering array of services, \nfrom basic medical and dental checkups to prescription medications to \nemergency care on the battlefield to vaccinations against biological \nand chemical threats. Officers serve as medical operations officers, \nhealthcare administrators, medical logisticians, preventive medicine \nofficers, allied scientists, behavioral science officers as well as \noptometrists and pharmacists.\n  To lead and manage such a wide and complex network, you need to be a \nspecial person--one who is able to think strategically and act \nappropriately for the time and circumstances. You need a leader who \nwill take swift and decisive action in a crisis, like when General \nUrsone worked around the clock managing the evacuation and care of the \nvictims of the USS Cole bombing. You need a compassionate leader \ncapable of implementing Women, Infant and Child programs. Above all, \nyou need a leader who recognizes that his decisions will have a \ntremendous impact on thousands and thousands of individual soldiers and \ntheir families. In each and every one of these critical areas, Richard \nUrsone has gone above and beyond the call of duty.\n  Brigadier General Ursone's service and contributions to fellow \nsoldiers and our Nation are eloquent testimony to his loyalty, \ndedication, talents, and abilities. General Ursone is not a physician. \nHowever, it is difficult to imagine any individual who has done more to \nensure that every single soldier, family member and retiree in the U.S. \nArmy receives the most advanced, efficient, and compassionate health \ncare. His commitment to the men and women of our Armed Forces is truly \nan inspiration to us all. I send him my best wishes on his well-\ndeserved retirement. And on behalf of our Nation, I extend to him \nthanks and gratitude for a remarkable career of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4299-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT PREPARED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE BOARD ENTITLED ``SCIENCE AND \n                 ENGINEERING INDICATORS--2004''--PM 75\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 1863(j)(1), I transmit herewith a report \nprepared for the Congress and the Administration by the National \nScience Board entitled, ``Science and Engineering Indicators--2004.'' \nThis report represents the sixteenth in the series examining key \naspects of the status of science and engineering in the United States.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to designate certain National Forest System land in \nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as components of the National \nWilderness Preservation System; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Caribbean \nNational Forest Act of 2004, along with Senator Schumer.\n  The Caribbean National Forest Act designates approximately 10,000 \nacres of the Caribbean National Forest (CNF) as the El Toro Wilderness. \nThe El Toro Wilderness would be the only tropical forest wilderness in \nthe U.S. National Forest system.\n  The CNF has long been recognized as a special area, worthy of \nprotection. The Spanish Crown proclaimed much of the current CNF as a \nforest reserve in 1824. One hundred years ago, President Theodore \nRoosevelt reasserted the protection of the CNF by designating the area \nas a forest reserve.\n  Located 25 miles east of San Juan, the CNF is a biologically diverse \narea. Although it is the smallest forest in the national forest system, \nthe CNF ranks number one in the number of species of native trees with \n240. In addition, the CNF has 50 varieties of orchids and over 150 \nspecies of ferns. The area is also rich in wildlife with over 100 \nspecies of vertebrates, including the endangered Puerto Rican parrot. \nThe only native parrot in Puerto Rico, they numbered nearly one million \nat the time that Columbus set sail for the New World. Today there are \nfewer than 35 of these parrots. The Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service and Puerto Rico's Department of Natural Resources and \nthe Environment have initiated a recovery program for the Puerto Rican \nParrot. Wilderness designation will ensure that the forest home to the \nparrot will remain protected and the ongoing recovery efforts, \nconsistent with the Wilderness Act, will continue.\n  The CNF also provides valuable water to the people of Puerto Rico. \nThe CNF receives over 10 feet of rain each year. As a result, the major \nwatersheds in the CNF are able to provide water to over 800,000 \nresidents. In addition, the CNF provides a variety of recreational \nopportunities to over 700,000 Puerto Ricans and tourists each year. \nFamilies, friends and school groups come to the forest to hike, bird \nwatch, picnic, swim and enjoy the scenic vistas.\n  Wilderness designation of the El Toro will protect approximately one \nthird of the forest. A companion House bill, H.R. 1723, has been \nintroduced by Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner, Abibel Acevedo Vila. \nDuring a House hearing on this measure last summer, the U.S. Forest \nService stated its support for the designation of the El Toro \nWilderness Area.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2334\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part A of title II of the Higher Education \nAct of 1965 to enhance teacher training and teacher preparation \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Preparing, \nRecruiting, and Retaining Education Professionals Act of 2004 to ensure \nhigh quality preparation, induction, and professional development \nprograms for teachers, early childhood education providers, principals \nand administrators in order to improve learning and achievement for all \nstudents.\n  As Congress turns to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, \nwe need to increase support for prospective, new, and experienced \neducators in early childhood education programs, elementary schools, \nand secondary schools.\n  My legislation challenges teacher preparation programs to make \nimproving student achievement the engine that drives all activities, \ntraining, and support for teachers. The goal here is not to be punitive \nbut to put students and their achievement first.\n  We know that strong teaching skills make a difference. Studies have \nshown that students who attend classes taught by high-quality teachers \nperform significantly better on assessments. The No Child Left Behind \nAct requires that all teachers be highly qualified. To be so deemed, in \ngeneral, a teacher must hold a bachelor's degree, be fully certified by \na State, and demonstrate content knowledge of the subjects taught by \nthe 2005-2006 school year. New teachers must meet this standard now. \nYet, according to the U.S. Department of Education, only 54 percent of \nour Nation's secondary school teachers were highly qualified during the \n1999-2000 school year. The percentage of highly qualified teachers \nvaries widely by State and by subject matter. For example, a 2003 \nsurvey by the Council of Chief State School Officers found that only my \nhome State of Rhode Island, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, and \nMinnesota have more than 80 percent of their math teachers with college \nmajors in math and full certification. Seven States report having more \nthan 10 percent of their teachers on waivers; that is, teaching with \nemergency, temporary, or provisional licenses.\n  The Preparing, Recruiting, and Retaining Education Professionals Act \nmodifies and strengthens the current State, partnership, and \nrecruitment grants contained within title II of the Higher Education \nAct to focus on improving teaching skills of prospective, new, and \nexperienced teachers and early childhood education providers as well as \nimproving the capacity of principals to provide instructional \nleadership and classroom support for teachers.\n\n[[Page S4303]]\n\n  My legislation ensures States hold institutions of higher education \nand entities that provide alternative routes to State certification \nequally accountable for preparing highly qualified teachers and highly \ncompetent early childhood education providers via reforms to ensure \npreparation program effectiveness. The goal is to provide teachers and \nearly childhood education providers the scientific knowledge of \nteaching skills needed to understand and respond effectively to diverse \nstudent populations, including students with disabilities, limited-\nEnglish proficient students, and students with different learning \nstyles or other special learning needs; the ability to integrate \ntechnology into the classroom; strategies to effectively use \nassessments to improve instructional practices and curriculum; and an \nunderstanding of how to communicate with and involve parents in their \nchildren's education.\n  The Higher Education Act's existing partnership grants are \nstrengthened by improving the effectiveness of the teaching skills and \nlearning practices taught through inclusion of academic departments \nsuch as psychology, human development, or one with comparable expertise \nin the disciplines of teaching, learning, and child and adolescent \ndevelopment. Partnerships are expanded to include pre-service clinical, \nfield, or practicum components whereby the prospective teachers receive \nclose supervision and mentoring. A residency program would be created \nto provide ongoing training support during new teachers' first 3 years. \nProfessional development opportunities would have to be provided for \nexperienced teachers to encourage continual retraining to further their \nskills. Managerial skill development is also included to improve the \ncapacity of principals to provide instructional leadership and \nclassroom support for teachers.\n\n  The time for action is now because too few of the teachers that we \nhave prepared choose to enter the schools and stay. According to the \nNational Commission on Teaching and America's Future, after 3 years, 33 \npercent of beginning teachers have left teaching and after 5 years, 46 \npercent have left. Not surprisingly, the turnover rate in high poverty \nschools is approximately one-third higher than the rate for all \nteachers. During the 1999-2000 school year, 232,000 new teachers were \nhired, but schools lost more than 287,000--a net loss of 24 percent. \nTeacher attrition undermines teacher quality and drives teacher \nshortages. Investing in the preparation of our educators and their \ncontinued professional development is critical for addressing these \nneeds which, in turn, will improve outcomes and results for all \nchildren.\n  One of the primary reasons for such high attrition, according to the \nCommission, is the lack of support once a teacher is hired. \nApproximately one-third of those teachers who expressed dissatisfaction \ncited poor administrative support, a lack of faculty influence and \ninadequate planning and collaboration time. By providing mentoring and \nsupport during the pre-service experiences, the early years of \nteaching, and through ongoing professional development opportunities \nfor experienced teachers, we can substantially reduce the terrible \nturnover rates that our Nation experiences.\n  There are also extensive teaching vacancies in schools nationwide. \nThe General Accounting Office has found that 23 of 37 State officials \nreported teacher shortages in high-need subject areas such as \nmathematics, science, bilingual education and special education.\n  My legislation focuses recruitment activities where high teacher \nturnover and shortages exist, where there is great difficulty meeting \nacademic standards, or where there is great difficulty demonstrating \nthat teachers are highly qualified. The grants also allow funds for \noutreach to encourage recruitment in inner city and rural areas.\n  The State, partnership, and recruitment grants are currently funded \nat only $90 million a year--far too little of an investment for this \ncritical enterprise. The stakes are too high, not just in terms of \nmeeting the highly qualified requirements of No Child Left Behind, but \nfor real kids in real classrooms. My bill significantly boosts this \nfunding, authorizing $500 million for these vital programs.\n  The PRREP Act is supported by a diverse array of education \norganizations, including the American Association of Colleges for \nTeacher Education, American Psychological Association, Center for Civic \nEducation, Council for Exceptional Children, Higher Education \nConsortium for Special Education, National Association of Elementary \nSchool Principals, National Association of Secondary School Principals, \nNational Association of State Directors of Special Education, National \nAssociation for the Education of Young Children, National Council of \nTeachers of English, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, \nNational Science Teachers Association, and National PTA.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this essential endeavor by \ncosponsoring this legislation and working for its inclusion in the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  Additionally, I am pleased to be joining Senator Bingaman, who is \nintroducing the CLASS Act. This legislation shares the PRREP Act's \nspirit of improving teacher preparation and therefore, student \nachievement. In addition to encouraging the development of data systems \nto measure teacher quality, the CLASS Act authorizes pilot studies to \nevaluate the impact of teacher preparation programs on student \nachievement and to identify the specific practices that result in \nachievement gains.

A bill to expand access to preventive health care services \nand education programs that help reduce unintended pregnancy, reduce \ninfection with sexually transmitted disease, and reduce the number of \nabortions; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I introduce a bill on behalf of myself, Mr. \nChafee, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. \nLautenberg.\n  We are very fortunate to live in a democratic nation where we can \nexpress our opinions freely. That is what America is all about. We can \nattempt to influence the policies of our Government and even criticize \nthem without fear of retaliation. We can debate important issues \nwithout fear of retaliation by anyone.\n  One of the most heated debates in the last two decades has been the \nissue of abortion. People on both sides of the issue feel extremely \nstrong. They have argued, demonstrated, and protested with much emotion \nand passion. The issue is not going to go away soon. I doubt that one \nside will be able to suddenly convince the other to drop its deeply \nheld beliefs.\n  However, there is a need and even an opportunity to find common \nground. We can move toward a goal we all share, reducing the number of \nunintended pregnancies in America. It is possible. And it is necessary \nto come together and enact effective legislation to prevent unintended \npregnancies, reduce the number of abortions performed in this country, \nand address the unmet health care needs of American women.\n  We can only find common ground by being honest with each other. We \ncan find not only common ground but also common sense solutions in this \nlegislation which I am introducing entitled ``Putting Prevention \nFirst.'' I am pleased that Senators Chafee, Boxer, Murray, Corzine and \nLautenberg are joining me as cosponsors of this legislation.\n  The Putting Prevention First Act will help reduce the staggering \nrates of unintended pregnancies in America. It will reduce the rate of \ninfection with sexually transmitted diseases, reduce the number of \nabortions, and improve access to health care for women.\n  Specifically, the Putting Prevention First Act will: No. 1, end \ninsurance discrimination against women; No. 2, improve awareness and \nunderstanding of emergency contraception; No. 3, ensure that rape \nvictims have information about emergency contraception and access to \nemergency contraception; No. 4, increase funding for the National \nFamily Planning Program; No. 5, provide funding to allow States to \nimplement a comprehensive approach to sexuality education that includes \ninformation about both abstinence and contraception; No. 6, expands \nteen pregnancy prevention programs; and, No. 7 allows States to expand \nMedicaid family planning services to low-income women without having to \napply for a waiver from the Federal Government.\n  Nationwide, about one-half of all pregnancies are unintended and half \nof those end in abortion. This is not just a health problem; it is a \npublic health tragedy. But it does not have to be this way. Most of the \nunintended pregnancies and resulting abortions can be prevented. We \nmust work together to make that happen, we can find a common ground.\n  One of the most important steps we can take to prevent unintended \npregnancies is ensuring that American women have access to affordable, \neffective contraception.\n  I have been on national radio call-in shows and talked about \nlegislation I have worked on with Senator Snowe for so many years to \nprovide for contraceptive equity. One time, a woman called and said: I \ndon't believe in contraception. Well, my simple answer to her was: Then \ndon't use them. But don't prevent others who have different beliefs \nfrom having the ability to use these contraceptives.\n  Today, numerous forms of safe and highly effective contraception are\n\n[[Page S4310]]\n\navailable by prescription. If used correctly, they could greatly reduce \nthe rate of unintended pregnancies.\n  One of the greatest obstacles to the use of prescription \ncontraceptives by American women is their cost. Women are educated. \nThey know that they work. They simply do not have the money.\n  Again, on a radio program, a woman called in and said: I have \ndiabetes. I am pregnant. I didn't want to become pregnant. It is not \ngood for me. She said: But my husband's insurance doesn't cover the \npill.\n  It is amazing, but many insurance policies do not cover prescription \ncontraceptives for women. But they do automatically cover tubal \nligations, vasectomies, abortions, and other such things that are much \nmore expensive than prescription contraception.\n  Now, we have made progress. Federal Employees have access to \nprescription contraception through the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program. But we shouldn't limit this benefit to just federal \nemployees.\n  We know that women on average earn less than men, and yet they must \npay far more than men for health-related expenses. According to the \nWomen's Research and Education Institute, women of reproductive age pay \n68 percent more in out-of-pocket costs for medical expenses than men, \nand, of course, that is largely due to their reproductive health care \nneeds.\n\n  Because many women cannot afford the prescription contraceptives they \nwould like to use, many go without. Far too often, this results in \nunintended pregnancies.\n  The high cost of prescription contraceptives is not just a problem \nfor the millions of women without health insurance, but also for \nmillions of American women who do have health insurance because many \ninsurance plans that cover prescription drugs do not cover \ncontraceptives. So women are forced to either do without contraceptives \nor pay for them out of pocket and, as I have given an example or two, \nmany families simply cannot afford it. This is unfair to women and \ntheir families and it is a bad policy because it causes additional \nunintended pregnancies and adversely affects the health of women.\n  Since 1997, Senator Olympia Snowe and I have worked to remedy this \nproblem. Today, as part of the Putting Prevention First Act, I am again \nproposing common-sense legislation that has received bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act--\nEPICC, as we call it--requires insurance plans that cover prescription \ndrugs to provide the same coverage for prescription contraceptives. We \nare not asking for special treatment, only equitable treatment within \nthe context of an existing prescription drug benefit. This legislation \nis simply the fair thing to do for women.\n  And making contraception more affordable and more available will \nenable more women to use safe and effective means to prevent unintended \npregnancies. As I said, it is a goal we all share.\n  Contraceptive coverage is much cheaper than other services, \nincluding, as I have said, abortions, sterilizations, and tubal \nligations that insurance companies routinely cover. The Federal \nEmployee Health Benefits Program, which has provided contraceptive \ncoverage for several years because of an amendment offered on this \nfloor, has proved that adding such coverage does not increase the cost \nof a plan.\n  This commonsense, cost-effective legislation is long overdue. \nPromoting equity in health insurance coverage for American women, while \nworking to prevent unintended pregnancies and improve the health of \nwomen, is by any means the right thing to do.\n  We should also take additional steps that would improve access to \nwomen's health care for poor and low-income women. Public health \nprograms such as Medicaid and title X provide high-quality family \nplanning services and other preventive health care to underinsured or \nuninsured individuals. Yet these programs are struggling to meet the \ngrowing demand for subsidized family planning services without \ncorresponding increases in funding.\n  The Putting Prevention First legislation would increase the \nauthorization for title X, and it would allow States to expand Medicaid \nfamily planning services to women with incomes of up to 200 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level without having to apply to the Federal \nGovernment for a waiver.\n  This commonsense approach has long been championed by Senator Lincoln \nChafee. My friend and cosponsor of this legislation knows that \ncontraceptive use saves scarce public health dollars. Every $1 spent on \nproviding family planning services saves an estimated $3 in \nexpenditures for pregnancy-related and newborn care for Medicaid alone.\n  The Putting Prevention First Act would increase the awareness and \navailability of emergency contraception, an important yet poorly \nunderstood form of contraception. Approved for use by the Food and Drug \nAdministration, emergency contraception pills work to prevent \npregnancy, and they cannot disrupt or interrupt an established \npregnancy. The emergency contraception pills work to prevent pregnancy, \nnot to interrupt and disrupt a pregnancy. The availability of emergency \ncontraception is very important for women who survive a sexual assault.\n  I can remember a young woman who worked for me, a teenager. She came \nto me and said: Could I see you in your office?\n  I said: Sure. What is the matter?\n  She said: I was jumped.\n  She was driving through a part of town alone. Some people pulled her \ncar over and they raped her. I sent her to another friend of mine who \nis an OB/GYN.\n  It is difficult to imagine the physical, psychological, and emotional \npain endured by a woman who is raped. In addition to the violent \nattack, she must also worry about the possibility she could become \npregnant.\n  The availability of emergency contraception is important for women \nwho survive a sexual assault. A woman could use emergency contraception \nin an emergency, such as if she has been raped and doesn't want to \nbecome pregnant.\n  Compassion is a word we have heard a lot from political leaders in \nrecent years. Actions speak louder than words. Surely it would be \ncompassionate to make emergency contraception available to a woman who \nis raped so she doesn't become impregnated by the thug who brutalized \nand traumatized her.\n  The Putting Prevention First Act includes a provision that has been \nadvocated by Senators Corzine and Murray. This provision would require \nhospitals receiving Federal health dollars to provide information about \nemergency contraception and make it available to sexual assault \nsurvivors who are treated in the emergency room. Simply put, emergency \ncontraception should be made available in an emergency room.\n  Emergency contraception and emergency rooms go hand in hand. Women \nwho are the victims of rape should be informed of all their options, \nincluding emergency contraception.\n  If they choose that option, it should be available to them right \nthen.\n  Emergency contraception has been studied extensively and is regarded \nas a safe and effective method to prevent unintended pregnancies. Its \nuse has been recommended by leading medical authorities, including the \nAmerican Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists. It has been approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. An FDA advisory panel has recommended emergency \ncontraception be made available without a prescription. This could \nprevent 1.7 million unintended pregnancies and 800,000 abortions in \nAmerica each year.\n  Unfortunately, however, emergency contraception remains for the most \npart a well-kept secret. Most of the women who would use this to \nprevent an unintended pregnancy are unaware of its existence, and they \ndon't know it is available, if it is available. Even many health care \nproviders do not understand what emergency contraception is, how it \nworks, and who can use it.\n  To reduce unintended pregnancies by raising awareness about emergency \ncontraception, the Putting Prevention First Act includes a provision \nchampioned by Senator Murray that will provide funding to develop and \ndistribute information about emergency contraception to public health \norganizations, health care providers, and the public. I commend Senator \nMurray and appreciate her allowing me to include this in my \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S4311]]\n\n  These are some of the simple but necessary steps we can and should \ntake to prevent unintended pregnancies. We should embrace these \nmeasures to protect the health of American women, prevent unintended \npregnancies, and reduce abortion. It is time to put prevention first.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord,  as follows:\n\n                                S. 2336\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (``CDC'') included family planning in its published list of \n     the ``Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th \n     Century'', the United States still has one of the highest \n     rates of unintended pregnancies among industrialized nations.\n       (2) Each year, three million pregnancies, nearly half of \n     all pregnancies, in the United States are unintended; and \n     half of unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n       (3) In 2000, 34 million women--half of all women of \n     reproductive age (ages 15-44)--were in need of contraceptive \n     services and supplies to help prevent unintended pregnancy, \n     and half of those were in need of public support for such \n     care.\n       (4) The United States also has the highest rate of \n     infection with sexually transmitted diseases (``STDs'') of \n     any industrialized country: in 2000 there were approximately \n     18.9 million new cases of STDs.\n       (5) Increasing access to family planning services will \n     improve women's health and reduce the rates of unintended \n     pregnancy, abortion, and infection with STDs. Contraceptive \n     use saves public health dollars: every dollar spent on \n     providing family planning services, saves an estimated $3 in \n     expenditures for pregnancy-related and newborn care for \n     Medicaid alone.\n       (6) Contraception is basic health care that improves the \n     health of women and children by enabling women to plan and \n     space births.\n       (7) Women experiencing unintended pregnancy are at greater \n     risks for physical abuse and women having closely spaced \n     births are at greater risk of maternal death.\n       (8) The child born from an unintended pregnancy is at \n     greater risk of low birth weight, dying in the first year of \n     life, being abused, and not receiving sufficient resources \n     for healthy development.\n       (9) The ability to control fertility also allows couples to \n     achieve economic stability by facilitating greater \n     educational achievement and participation in the workforce.\n       (10) The average American woman desires two children and \n     spends five years of her life pregnant or trying to get \n     pregnant and roughly 30 years trying to prevent pregnancy; \n     without contraception, a sexually active woman has an 85 \n     percent chance of becoming pregnant within a year.\n       (11) Many poor and low-income women cannot afford to \n     purchase contraceptive services and supplies on their own. \n     12.1 million or 20 percent of all women aged 15-24 were \n     uninsured in 2002, and that proportion has increased by 10 \n     percent since 1999.\n       (12) Public health programs like Medicaid and Title X, the \n     national family planning program, provide high-quality family \n     planning services and other preventive health care to \n     underinsured or uninsured individuals who may otherwise lack \n     access to health care.\n       (13) Medicaid is the single largest source of public \n     funding for family planning services and HIV/AIDS care in the \n     United States. Half of all public dollars spent on \n     contraceptive services and supplies in the United States are \n     provided through Medicaid and approximately 5.5 million women \n     of reproductive age--nearly one in ten women between the ages \n     of 15 and 44--rely on Medicaid for their basic health care \n     needs.\n       (14) Each year, Title X services enable Americans to \n     prevent approximately one million unintended pregnancies, and \n     one in three women of reproductive age who obtains testing or \n     treatment for STDs does so at a Title X-funded clinic. In \n     2002, Title X-funded clinics provided three million Pap \n     tests, 5.2 million STD tests, and 494,000 HIV tests.\n       (15) The increasing number of uninsured, stagnant funding, \n     health care inflation, new and expensive contraceptive \n     technologies, and improved but expensive screening and \n     treatment for cervical cancer and STDs, have diminished the \n     ability of Title X funded clinics to adequately serve all \n     those in need. Taking inflation into account, funding for the \n     Title X program declined 57 percent between 1980 and 2003.\n       (16) While Medicaid is the largest source of subsidized \n     family planning services, many States have had to make \n     significant cuts in their Medicaid programs due to budget \n     pressures putting many women at risk of losing coverage for \n     family planning services.\n       (17) In addition, eligibility for Medicaid in many States \n     is severely restricted leaving family planning services \n     financially out of reach for many poor women. Many States \n     have demonstrated tremendous success with Medicaid family \n     planning waivers that allow them to expand access to Medicaid \n     family planning services. However, the administrative burden \n     of applying for a waiver poses a significant barrier to \n     States that would like to expand their Medicaid family \n     planning programs.\n       (18) Many private health plans still do not cover \n     contraceptive services and supplies. The lack of \n     contraceptive coverage in health insurance plans places many \n     effective forms of contraception beyond the financial reach \n     of many women.\n       (19) Including contraceptive coverage in private health \n     care plans saves employers money: not covering contraceptives \n     in employee health plans costs employers 15 to 17 percent \n     more than providing such coverage.\n       (20) Emergency contraception is a safe and effective way to \n     prevent unintended pregnancy after unprotected sex. It is \n     estimated that the use of emergency contraception could cut \n     the number of unintended pregnancies in half, thereby \n     reducing the need for abortion.\n       (21) In 2000, 51,000 abortions were prevented by use of \n     emergency contraception; increased use of emergency \n     contraception accounted for up to 43 percent of the total \n     decline in abortions between 1994 and 2000.\n       (22) Access to comprehensive sex education is critical to \n     reducing rates of unintended pregnancy, abortion, and STD \n     infection among teens. Over 60 percent of teens have had sex \n     before they graduate from high school and nine out of ten \n     people have sex before they get married. 822,000 teenagers \n     become pregnant each year; 35 percent of teen girls become \n     pregnant at least once before turning 20; and 78 percent of \n     teenage pregnancies are unintended. Nearly half (48 percent) \n     of new STD cases are among people ages 15-24, even though \n     these youth make up only a quarter of the sexually active \n     population.\n       (23) The American Medical Association, the American Nurses \n     Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \n     College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \n     Public Health Association, and the Society for Adolescent \n     Medicine, support responsible sexuality education that \n     includes information about both abstinence and contraception.\n       (24) Comprehensive sex education protects adolescent \n     health. A recent survey found that only 15 percent of \n     American parents believe that schools should just teach about \n     abstinence.\n       (25) A recent study showed that teens who took pledges to \n     remain virgins until marriage were just as likely to contract \n     STDs as teens who did not take virginity pledges and that \n     although teens taking the pledges delayed sexual debut, they \n     were less likely to use condoms once they were sexually \n     active.\n\n[[Page S4312]]\n\n       (26) Teens who receive sex education that includes \n     discussion of contraception are more likely than those who \n     receive abstinence-only messages to delay sex and to have \n     fewer partners and use contraceptives when they do become \n     sexually active.\n\n             TITLE I--TITLE X OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT\n\n     SEC. 101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Life Education Act''.\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) The American Medical Association (``AMA''), the \n     American Nurses Association (``ANA''), the American Academy \n     of Pediatrics (``AAP''), the American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists (``ACOG''), the American \n     Public Health Association (``APHA''), and the Society of \n     Adolescent Medicine (``SAM''), support responsible sexuality \n     education that includes information about both abstinence and \n     contraception.\n       (2) Recent scientific reports by the Institute of Medicine, \n     the American Medical Association and the Office on National \n     AIDS Policy stress the need for sexuality education that \n     includes messages about abstinence and provides young people \n     with information about contraception for the prevention of \n     teen pregnancy, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted \n     diseases (``STDs'').\n       (3) Research shows that teenagers who receive sexuality \n     education that includes discussion of contraception are more \n     likely than those who receive abstinence-only messages to \n     delay sexual activity and to use contraceptives when they do \n     become sexually active.\n       (4) Comprehensive sexuality education programs respect the \n     diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community \n     and will complement and augment the sexuality education \n     children receive from their families.\n       (5) The median age of puberty is 13 years and the average \n     age of marriage is over 26 years old. American teens need \n     access to full, complete, and medically and factually \n     accurate information regarding sexuality, including \n     contraception, STD/HIV prevention, and abstinence.\n       (6) Although teen pregnancy rates are decreasing, there are \n     still between 750,000 and 850,000 teen pregnancies each year. \n     Between 75 and 90 percent of teen pregnancies among 15- to \n     19-year olds are unintended.\n       (7) Research shows that 75 percent of the decrease in teen \n     pregnancy between 1988 and 1995 was due to improved \n     contraceptive use, while 25 percent was due to increased \n     abstinence.\n       (8) More than eight out of ten Americans believe that young \n     people should have information about abstinence and \n     protecting themselves from unplanned pregnancies and sexually \n     transmitted diseases.\n       (9) United States teens acquire an estimated 4,000,000 \n     sexually transmitted infections each year. By age 24, at \n     least one in three sexually active people will have \n     contracted a sexually transmitted disease.\n       (10) An average of two young people in the United States \n     are infected with HIV every hour of every day. African \n     Americans and Hispanic youth have been disproportionately \n     affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Although less than 16 \n     percent of the adolescent population in the United States is \n     African American, nearly 50 percent of AIDS cases through \n     June 2000 among 13- to 19-year olds were among Blacks. \n     Hispanics comprise 13 percent of the population and 20 \n     percent of the reported adolescent AIDS cases though June \n     2000.\n\n     SEC. 603.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that while States are not \n     required to provide matching funds, they are encouraged to do \n     so.\n\n[[Page S4315]]\n\n     SEC. 605.

A bill to establish a grant program to support coastal and \nwater quality restoration activities in States bordering the Great \nLakes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Great \nLakes Community Restoration Act.\n  Before I discuss the bill, I want to say that it is extremely fitting \nthat we are discussing the restoration of the Great Lakes, because \ntoday is Earth\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\nDay. Earth Day is a time to reflect on the environmental gains we have \nmade, and to challenge ourselves with a new environmental commitment \nfor the future. Our environmental and natural resources are not merely \nimportant, they are vital to our future health and survival. The Great \nLakes are one of our Nation's most precious and vital natural \nresources. I believe it is extremely important that we have a strong \nFederal, State and local commitment to protect them.\n  The Great Lakes contain one-fifth of the world's fresh water, and \nsupply safe drinking water to thirty-three million people, including 10 \nmillion people who rely on Lake Michigan alone. The Great Lakes' \ncoastlines are home to wetlands, dunes, and endangered plants and \nspecies. Lake Michigan alone contains over 417 coastal wetlands, the \nmost of any Great Lake. Millions of people use the Great Lakes each \nyear for recreation, enjoying beaches, good fishing and boating. The \nlatest estimate shows that recreational fishing totals a $1.5 billion \nboost to Michigan's tourist economy alone.\n  However, it takes a real Federal, State, and local partnership to \nmaintain this critical natural resource. Unfortunately, there are \nseveral environmental threats to the Great Lakes that we need to \naddress. These include cleaning up contaminated sediments and \npollutants that are affecting the Great Lakes ecosystem. During last \nyear's electricity blackout, 650 pounds of vinyl chloride were dumped \ninto the St. Clair River. This past February, another serious chemical \nspill occurred, dumping approximately 42,000 gallons of methyl ethyl \nketone and methyl isobutyl ketone into the river, and forcing the \nshutdown of 10 drinking water plants. Last summer alone, 81 beaches in \nMichigan were closed due to elevated E coli levels. This contamination \naffects our water supply, our recreation and tourism, and Michigan's \noverall economy.\n  The Great Lakes have also been inundated with invasive species. Over \nthe past century, more than 87 non-indigenous aquatic species have been \naccidentally introduced into the Great Lakes. They have damaged the \nlakes in a number of ways. They have destroyed thousands of fish and \nthreatened our clean drinking water. For example, Lake Michigan once \nhoused the largest self-producing lake trout fishery in the world. The \ninvasive sea lamprey, which was introduced from ballast water almost 80 \nyears ago has fed-on and greatly contributed to the decline of trout \nand whitefish in the Great Lakes. Today, lake trout must be stocked \nbecause it cannot naturally reproduce in the lakes. These invasive \nspecies also cause damage to our community water and sewer systems.\n  Michigan also is home to over 120 lighthouses, more than any other \nState in the Nation. The oldest Michigan lighthouses date back to the \n1820s. These lighthouses are an inseparable part of Michigan's identity \nand cultural history. Unfortunately, many of our lighthouses are poorly \nmaintained and in grave need of repair. In order to preserve our \nhistory and heritage of the Great Lakes, it is imperative that we \nmaintain our lighthouses.\n  As I mentioned before, protecting the Great Lakes requires a \ncoordinated effort at all levels of government. However, our local \ncommunities are the ones who are immediately affected by these \nproblems, both environmentally and economically.\n  That is why I have introduced the Great Lakes Community Restoration \nAct. The Act will provide $400 million directly to local communities to \nhelp protect and restore the Great Lakes coastal region. NOAA will \naward the grant for local projects, such as repair of sewer systems \ndamaged by invasive species, lighthouse restoration, and the local \ncleanup of water pollution and sediments.\n  Protecting the Great Lakes requires a Federal, State and local \npartnership, and this Act will provide local communities with the \nresources they need to continue their vital stewardship of the Great \nLakes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2338. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \narthritis research and public health, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues, \nSenator Christopher Bond and Senator Tim Johnson, in introducing the \nArthritis Prevention, Control, and Cure Act of 2004. Senator Bond has \nbeen outstanding in his leadership and support of this bipartisan \nlegislation, which is a product of the untiring efforts of many leaders \nin the arthritis community including patients, families, and health \ncare providers. The goal of this legislation is to lessen the burden of \narthritis and other rheumatic diseases on citizens across our Nation.\n  Seventy million adults in the United States now suffer from arthritis \nor related conditions. Of these, one in three is under 65. Over 300,000 \nare children who struggle each day to get out of bed, go to school, and \nplay with their friends. Arthritis accounts for 4 million days of \nhospital care ach year. It costs $51 million in annual medical care, \nand $86 million more is lost in productivity. Arthritis is an \noverwhelming and debilitating hardship for countless families across \nthe Nation.\n  In recent years, increasing effective research into the prevention \nand treatment of arthritis has led to measures that successfully reduce \npain and improve the quality of life for millions who suffer with this \ndisease. Cooperative efforts at every level have led to the development \nof a National Arthritis Action Plan, with emphasis on public health \nstrategies to make timely information and medical care much more widely \navailable across the country. However, the commitment to implement \nthese important public health approaches has been very limited so far. \nAdvances in research and treatment reach less than 1 percent of people \nwith arthritis. We need to do much more to bring the highest quality of \ncare to those with arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.\n  Our legislation will reduce the burden of unnecessary suffering for \nour citizens by supporting implementation of effective strategies to \ncarry out the National Arthritis Action Plan. That means support for \ncomprehensive arthritis control and prevention programs. It means the \ndevelopment of arthritis education and outreach activities, and more \nresearch on the best ways to prevent and treat the illness at various \nages.\n  It also means developing better care and treatment for children with \narthritis and rheumatic diseases. We include planning grants to support \ninnovative research on juvenile arthritis. We support training for \nhealth care providers specializing in pediatric rheumatology, so that \nall children will have greater access to physicians trained in state-\nof-the-art care for arthritis.\n  This legislation will improve the quality of life for large numbers \nof adults and children, and avoid thousands of dollars in medical costs \nfor each patient. Millions of our fellow citizens will have greater \naccess to the best available information and medical care to prevent \nand treat this debilitating disease. I urge our colleagues to support \nthis timely and needed legislation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I join a bipartisan group of \nSenators in introducing the Arthritis Prevention, Control and Cure Act \nof 2004. This legislation is so important to addressing arthritis and \nchronic joint problems which are the leading causes of disability in \nthe United States impacting nearly 70 million adults. I want to thank \nSenators Kennedy and Bond who have been working hard on this \nlegislation over the last year.\n  The prevalence of chronic diseases in the U.S. have become the most \nsignificant public health problem of our current day. The beginning of \nthe last century raised many infectious disease public health problems. \nBut safe drinking water, clean working conditions and modern medicines \nhave changed the public health dynamics. While we do need to continue \nto be concerned about newly emerging infectious diseases such as SARS \nand West Nile Virus, the biggest threat to our health as a nation is \nthe impact of chronic diseases. It is estimated that by the year 2020, \n157 million Americans will suffer from some chronic illness. Whether it \nbe asthma, diabetes, heart disease or arthritis, these conditions are \ncostly to our health care system and erode quality of life.\n\n[[Page S4317]]\n\n  Arthritis and other rheumatic diseases are among the most common \nconditions in the United States, diminishing mental health and imposing \nsignificant limitations on daily activities. One out of every 3, or \nnearly 70 million adults in the United States suffer from arthritis or \nchronic joint symptoms. In my home State, approximately 173,000 adults \nsuffer from the disease, or 31 percent of the adult population. \nArthritis is exceeded only by heart disease as a cause of work \ndisability. In addition, nearly 300,000 children in the United States, \nor 3 children out of every 1,000, have some form of arthritis or other \nrheumatic disease. The costs associated with arthritis are immense. The \ndisease results in 750,000 hospitalizations, 44 million outpatient \nvisits and 4 million days of hospital care every year. The estimated \ntotal costs of arthritis in the U.S., including lost productivity \nexceeds $86 billion.\n  While the current impact of the disease is quite astounding, there is \nmuch that can be done to prevent and control arthritis. Despite myths \nthat inaccurately portray this illness as an old persons disease, some \nforms of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, can be prevented with \nweight control and other precautions. More broadly, the pain and \ndisability accompanying all types of arthritis can be minimized through \nearly diagnosis and appropriate disease management. There are many \ninterventions that have been proven effective in reducing the burden of \nthis disease, but unfortunately up until this point, those strategies \nhave been underutilized.\n  The National Arthritis Action Plan, developed by the Centers for \nDisease Control or CDC, Arthritis Foundation and the Association of \nState and Territorial Health Officials, put forward a comprehensive \nstrategy to meet the challenged of addressing arthritis. This \nlegislation puts the action plan into law, directing the CDC and \nNational Institutes of Health to formalize the intentions of that \naction plan.\n  This legislation enhances support for the implementation of public \nhealth strategies consistent with the National Arthritis Action Plan. \nThrough the CDC, the legislation will implement comprehensive arthritis \ncontrol and prevention programs, developing arthritis education and \noutreach activities, and conducting research on prevention and \ntreatment across the lifespan. It also includes planning grants in \nsupport of innovative research related to juvenile arthritis and \nsupports health care provider training for those specializing in \npediatric rheumatology. This bill will also assure that the National \nArthritis Action Plan is implemented in a systematic way, and \nguarantees continued focus on quality research and care for adults and \nchildren who suffer from this debilitating disease.\n  The bill provides funds for local demonstration projects, including \ncommunity-based and patient self-management programs for arthritis \ncontrol, prevention and care. State and tribal grants will also be made \navailable for comprehensive prevention programs administered by state \nhealth departments. While CDC does provide for some grants currently, \nit is my hope that by moving this legislation forward, eventually, all \nstates will have comprehensive arthritis programs to meet the \nincreasing need.\n  I want to again thank Senators Kennedy and Bond for their leadership \non this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Stabenow, and \n        Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 2339. A bill to amend part D of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to improve the coordination of prescription drug coverage provided \nunder retiree plans and State pharmaceutical assistance programs with \nthe prescription drug benefit provided under the medicare program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues, \nSenators Lautenberg, Stabenow, and Mikulski, to introduce legislation, \nthe Preserving Access to Affordable Drugs (PAAD) Act. This legislation \nis essential to ensuring that no senior who has existing prescription \ndrug coverage receives less coverage once the Medicare prescription \ndrug program goes into effect.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that as many as 1.7 \nmillion retirees could lose their employer-based prescription drug \nbenefits as a result of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nAlso as a result of the new law, hundreds of thousands of seniors \ncurrently enrolled in state pharmacy assistance programs (SPAPs) will \nbe forced out of those programs and into a private Medicare drug plan. \nAdditionally, approximately six million seniors who are dually eligible \nfor Medicare and Medicaid will lose access to their Medicaid \nprescription drug benefits, which are more generous and provide greater \naccess to a variety of drugs than the Medicare benefit will. And, \ndespite the fact that the new Medicare law has huge gaps in coverage, \nseniors who choose to enroll in the new drug benefit will be prohibited \nfrom purchasing Medigap coverage to pay for prescription drugs not \ncovered by the new Medicare benefit.\n  No senior should be made worse off by the new Medicare law. The law \nshould expand benefits--not rescind them. The PAAD Act will make \ncritical changes to the Medicare law to ensure that the above-mentioned \nbenefits are safeguarded.\n  First, the PAAD Act will preserve retiree prescription drug benefits \nby allowing employer contributions to count towards the out of pocket \nthreshold. Under the Medicare law, retirees with employer-based \ncoverage would receive less of a subsidy from Medicare than seniors \nwithout such coverage. This lower subsidy creates a disincentive to \nemployers to continue to provide these benefits and will lead to a \nsignificant reduction in employer-based benefits. The PAAD Act will \nensure that employer-based plans receive the same subsidization as the \nMedicare prescription drug plans.\n  Second, the PAAD Act will restore language that I added to the \nSenate-passed Medicare bill to allow states with pharmaceutical \nassistance programs to administer the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in these programs. This will \nensure a seamless transition for these seniors and will ensure that \nthey maintain the generous prescription drug coverage that many states, \nincluding New Jersey, offer.\n  Third, the PAAD Act will enable states to supplement the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit for the neediest Medicare beneficiaries, \nthose dually-eligible for the Medicaid program. Under current law, \nMedicaid wraps around Medicare, paying for copayments and premiums, for \nthose beneficiaries who are extremely sick and poor. Under the new \nMedicare law, states will be prohibited from using Medicaid to wrap \naround the Medicare drug benefit for these seniors, stripping them of \naccess to needed prescription drugs. The PAAD Act will ensure that \nstates can provide supplemental Medicaid prescription drug coverage to \ncomplement the Medicare drug benefit for seniors who are dually \neligible for Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Fourth, the PAAD Act will restore seniors' access to supplemental \ndrug benefits through the Medigap program. Seniors should be allowed to \nimprove the Medicare drug benefit if they so choose.\n  Finally, the PAAD Act will also eliminate the risky demonstration \nprogram to privatize Medicare, a program which if not eliminated is \nlikely to impact my state of New Jersey. Under the new Medicare law, \nseniors who live in areas where a large number of seniors are enrolled \nin Medicare managed care plans could end up in this privatization \nscheme. This new program is slated to go into effect in 2010. But, if \nit were to go into effect today, Gloucester, Burlington, Camden and \nSalem Counties in New Jersey would likely be chosen to participate in \nit.\n  One of the goals of medicine is to do no harm. The new Medicare law \nviolates that tenet. My legislation is critical to preserving and \nprotecting existing prescription drug coverage while expanding it to \nthose who currently lack such coverage. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to pass this legislation and improve prescription drug \nbenefits for all seniors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 2340. A bill to reauthorize title II of the Higher Education Act \nof 1965; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Capacity \nto Learn for All Students and Schools (CLASS) Act of 2004, along with \nSenators Kennedy and Reed, to ensure that all of our students receive \nthe high quality of instruction they need and deserve. We know that \nteacher quality is the single most important factor in determining the \nsuccess of our school children. Children who consistently have access \nto good teachers are more likely to do well academically; those who do \nnot are more likely to fall behind.\n  As the son of two former teachers, I am well aware of the \nsatisfactions and challenges that accompany a career in teaching. I \nhave been a long-time and strong supporter of our devoted teachers and \nour public schools. Over the years, I have visited many schools \nthroughout my home State of New Mexico and spoken with countless \nstudents and teachers. I frequently have witnessed the dedication of \nour teachers in preparing young people to lead meaningful and \nproductive adult lives.\n  So many of us can look back on our own student years and recall a \nspecial teacher whose passion for learning ignited a similar passion in \nus, whose high standards caused us to set higher standards for \nourselves, and whose commitment to education provided a model for our \nown lives. We need to ensure that all children have access to such \nspecial teachers. Many other Senators share my interest in this issue, \nincluding my colleagues on the HELP Committee. In fact, I am pleased to \nbe introducing this bill along with the Senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland. Senator Reed's PRREP Act is a great complement to the CLASS \nAct, and I look forward to working with him and other members of the \nCommittee as we proceed toward reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct.\n  The current act authorizes three types of competitively awarded \ngrants: State Grants, Partnership Grants, and Recruitment Grants. The \nCLASS Act significantly increases funding for these programs, \nstrengthens the provisions of the current law, and expands the learning \nand teaching capacity of students, teachers, and schools. I want to \nmention some of our critical educational needs and explain how the \nCLASS Act addresses those needs.\n  First, we need to ensure that all teachers are highly qualified, have \nstrong teaching skills, understand scientifically based research and \nits applicability, and can use technology effectively in the classroom. \nThe preparation afforded prospective teachers must enable them to meet \nthe varied needs of our nation's students, of our schools and \ninstitutions of higher education, and of our competitive workforce.\n  The CLASS Act will address this need in a number of ways. For \nexample, the CLASS Act establishes Academic Teaching Centers (ATCs). \nThe ATCs provide a setting--a model teaching laboratory--for the \nintegration of education and training, research, and evidence-based \npractice for teacher candidates, university professors, and master \nteachers. Modeled on academic health centers, ATCs offer prospective \nteachers with a system of practice-based support at initial levels of \npreparation, training during the first years of practice, and continued \nsupport in maintaining high levels of skill mastery. The ATC provides a \nclinical setting with an education and research mission, mentorship by \nexpert practitioners, cross-pollination between practice and research, \nand high-quality services for its K-12 students.\n  The CLASS Act also authorizes a Professional Development Program \n(PDP) that encourages states to pursue alignment with National Board \nfor Professional Teaching Standards, a tiered licensure system, \nmultiple career paths, and opportunities for professional growth. The \nPDP will improve teacher recruitment and retention by increasing the \nattractiveness of a teaching career, encouraging teachers to enhance \ntheir competencies and skills, and reinforcing their efforts to advance \nin their profession. The CLASS Act also encourages clinical, field, \ninduction, mentoring, and other professional development experiences.\n  Further, the CLASS Act requires rigorous standards for teacher \ncertification or licensure designed to enhance teacher quality and to \nensure that all prospective teachers meet the same high State \nstandards. The act also expands programs that prepare prospective \nteachers to use advanced technology.\n  Second, we need to empower teachers and schools to provide access for \nall students to a high-quality general education curriculum, including \nminorities, students in high-need schools, and students with \ndisabilities and limited-English proficiency. Our teachers need to be \nable to provide effective instruction to diverse student populations \nand to address special learning needs. We also need to recruit new \nteachers from underrepresented groups and to increase access to \ncertification or licensure for other qualified individuals.\n  The CLASS Act will address this need by creating Centers of \nExcellence. The Centers of Excellence will increase minority teacher \nand principal recruitment, development, and retention. The act will \nalso prepare teachers to provide access to the general education \ncurriculum for all students, including students with disabilities and \nlimited-English proficiency.\n  Third, we need to enhance the ability of schools, districts, and \nstates to collect, analyze, and utilize data to improve schools and \nprograms and to fulfill the requirements of No Child Left Behind and \nthe Higher Education Act. Good data and data systems are the bedrock on \nwhich accountability is built. Yet present data and data systems are \ntoo often inadequate to meet the needs of our schools, districts, \nstates, and nation. For example, in 2003 the General Accounting Office \nreported that states did not have complete or consistent criteria to \ndetermine the number of highly qualified teachers and that state data \nsystems did not track the federal criteria.\n  The CLASS Act will address this need by strengthening accountability \nthrough improved assessment procedures that are valid and reliable, are \naligned with reporting requirements, and allow for accurate and \nconsistent reporting. The CLASS Act will also require a State-level \nneeds assessment for Teacher Enhancement Grants to identify areas of \ngreatest need and to specify a timetable for meeting identified needs. \nThe needs assessment will assist States to identify teacher production \nneeds in high-need academic subjects, such as mathematics and science; \nin high-need services, such as special education, bilingual education, \nand early childhood education; in high-need rural and urban areas; and \nin high-poverty, high-minority, and low-performing schools.\n  Further, the CLASS Act will create data systems designed to improve \npublic education, including enhancing teacher preparation programs. \nState educational agencies can apply for new Data Systems Grants that \nenable them to develop or expand data systems that have the capacity to \nintegrate and coordinate individual student data from educational and \nemployment settings; to conduct analyses necessary for evaluating \nprograms and policies and identifying best practices; and to facilitate \nalignment among schools, institutions of higher education, and \nemployment settings. These data systems also allow teacher preparation \nprograms to follow graduates as they proceed toward certification or \nlicensure and into the classroom.\n  Fourth, we need to improve teacher recruitment and retention. Each \nyear, more of the nation's teachers leave the field than enter the \nprofession. In fact, approximately one-third of teachers leave the \nfield during their first 3 years, and almost half leave during their \nfirst 5 years. Moreover, the overall turnover rate for teachers in \nhigh-poverty areas is almost a third higher than the rate for all \nteachers. Some of our schools, such as the rural schools in New Mexico, \nface unique challenges in recruiting and retaining highly qualified \nteachers. These challenges include low salaries, geographic and social \nisolation, housing shortages, poor physical working conditions, a \npaucity of teacher preparation programs targeted to rural schools, \nlimited opportunities for professional development, and the necessity \nfor teachers to teach more than one grade or subject.\n  The CLASS Act will address this need in the following ways. Among \nother initiatives, the act will fund a wide range of teacher \nrecruitment and retention strategies designed to put--and keep--highly \nqualified teachers in every classroom, including induction\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\nand mentoring for beginning teachers and ongoing opportunities for \nprofessional growth and advancement.\n  Importantly, the CLASS Act will also create the Rural Education \nRecruitment and Retention Program to address the needs of rural \ndistricts by funding a range of recruitment strategies, such as tuition \nassistance, loan forgiveness, housing assistance, and financial \nincentives for working in areas of greatest need; as well as retention \nstrategies, such as mentoring programs and ongoing opportunities for \nprofessional growth and advancement. In addition, the act encourages \npartnerships designed to meet the needs of rural schools.\n\n  Fifth, we need to better prepare students for postsecondary education \nand a competitive workforce. According to recent data, a majority of \ncollege professors and employers rate high school graduates' skills in \nspelling, grammar, writing, and math as only fair or poor. Too many \nstudents leave high school ill-prepared to meet the requirements of \npostsecondary education or the demands of high-skilled, high-wage \nemployment. Half of all students entering higher education take at \nleast one remedial course, and, according to the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, employers frequently report difficulty in finding qualified \nworkers who have satisfactory skills. High school graduation \nrequirements are often not aligned with the requirements governing \ncollege admission, obtaining a job, or enrolling in credit-bearing \ncourses once in college. High school curricula and assessments often \nstress different knowledge and skills than are required by college \nentrance and placement requirements.\n  The CLASS Act will address this need by creating the data systems \ndescribed above that are designed to improve public education and to \nfacilitate alignment among schools, institutions of higher education, \nand employment settings. These systems will have the capacity to \nintegrate and coordinate individual student data from educational and \nemployment settings. The CLASS Act will also support programs that \nprovide special certification in advanced placement (AP)-level or \ninternational baccalaureate (IB)-level content and pedagogy.\n  In conclusion, I would like to say that I am very pleased to \nintroduce a bill designed to ensure that all of our students are taught \nby highly qualified and effective teachers. No task is more important.\n  Each child who falls behind diminishes the power of our society's \nfuture. I hope you will all join me in reinforcing our national \ncommitment to teacher preparation and teacher quality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and summary were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2340\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of \n1986 to expand the National Practitioner Data Bank; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Safe Healthcare Reporting (SHARE) Act, which Senator Lautenberg and \nI have developed to add nurses and other licensed health care \nprofessionals to the National Practitioner Databank.\n  In 1986, Congress passed legislation that established a national \ndatabank, the National Practitioner Databank (NPDB), to track \nlicensing, disciplinary, and medical malpractice actions taken against \nU.S. physicians. While the NPDB has served as an important source of \ninformation on physicians, it fails to incorporate critical information \non millions of non-physician licensed health care professionals, \nincluding nurses.\n  The recent case of Charles Cullen, a New Jersey nurse who has claimed \nresponsibility for as many as 40 murders carried out at multiple \nhospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania over the last decade, has \nhighlighted the need for a national reporting system on nurses and \nother licensed health professionals. As the health care workforce \nbecomes increasingly mobile, such a system would be an invaluable \nresource to health care employers seeking information on potential \nemployees.\n  The SHARE Act will help break the chain of silence currently plaguing \nour health care system. This chain of silence prevented critical \nemployment history on Cullen--including five firings and at least one \nsuspension--from ever reaching his future employers. While Charles \nCullen kept killing people, hospitals kept hiring him. They didn't know \nhis history. They didn't understand the risk he posed to patients. This \nis because hospitals and other employers are reluctant to share \nemployee information because they are afraid of being sued.\n  The goal of our legislation is to make sure that hospitals know--to \nmake sure that employers have access to critical information on health \ncare practitioners. It will ensure that adverse employment actions, \nlicensing and disciplinary actions, and criminal background information \nare available to all health care employers. The SHARE Act mandates that \nhospitals and other health care entities report adverse employment \nactions taken against employees who violate professional standards of \nconduct. This would include things like drug diversion and \nfalsification of documents.\n  Importantly, the legislation protects health care employers from suit \nwhen they, in good faith, report information that they believe is \ntruthful. Any employer who reports false information in an effort to \nsmear a nurse's record would receive no protection under our bill. In \nfact, anyone who abused the information reported to the databank would \nbe fined by the Federal Government.\n  Health care employers, such as hospitals and nursing homes, would be \nrequired to report to the National Practitioner Databank, which \ncurrently provides such information on physicians. They would also be \nrequired to report to the appropriate state licensing board. In turn \nthe State licensing board would report the results of its \ninvestigations and licensing or disciplinary actions to the databank. \nThe legislation also encourages nurses and other health care \nprofessionals to report suspected activities to state boards by \nproviding whistleblower protections to those individuals.\n  The SHARE Act also ensures that a practitioner who is subject to \nreporting is informed of the report, offered a hearing on the issue, \nand allowed to comment on the report.\n  I believe that this legislation is a critical first step toward \nimproving access to important information on our health care workforce. \nSince 1986, the Federal Government has required hospitals to report \nemployment information on physicians. It's time we include nurses and \nother health care professionals that provide direct patient care. In \nfact, the average nurse spends more time at a patient's bedside than \nthe patient's physician. We simply must ensure that the person at the \nbedside is competent and professional.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to move this bill through Congress and get it to the President's \ndesk. We must and we can improve patient safety and the integrity of \nour health care system. This bill takes an important step toward that \ngoal.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator \nCorzine, in introducing the Safe Healthcare Reporting (SHARE) Act.\n  The first rule of the medical profession is ``do no harm.'' \nUnfortunately, Charles Cullen spent his career doing harm to people in \nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n  The overwhelming majority of nurses are excellent practitioners of \nmedicine who save countless lives every day. Nurse Cullen is the \nexception--not the rule--he was a bad apple of the worst kind.\n  As many as 40 people died as a result of Charles Cullen's actions. He \ndid it at different hospitals in different States. But no one put the \npieces of the puzzle together for decades.\n  That is why the legislation Senator Corzine and I are introducing is \nso important. This legislation adds nurses to the centralized, national \ndata bank of medical errors and misconduct. Our bill will require \nhospitals to notify state nursing boards--and the national data bank--\nif they launch an investigation into an employee--something Senator \nCorzine and I believe is badly needed. The bill also requires hospitals \nto reference the national database when hiring nurses and other \nlicensed health care professinals.\n  We must prevent more people like Charles Cullen from becoming nurses \nin the future. The vast majority of nurses out there are dedicated \nprofessionals, but we need a way to track and monitor the few who are \nusing the profession as a means to commit terrible crimes. It makes no \nsense to allow a medical professional to go from job to job, leaving \nunder suspicious circumstances, with virtually no means of detection.\n  Cullen's ability to perpetrate such despicable acts against patients \nhighlights serious flaws in our current system. The system let this man \nslip through the cracks and continue to work as a professional \nhealthcare provider even as investigations of his killings at previous \nemployers were being launched. This is appalling.\n  Patient safety must always be at the forefront. Our bill will close \nthe holes in this system and make it harder for people like Charles \nCullen to commit such horrific crimes in the future.\n  I look forward to working in a bi-partisan fashion to further this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 2342. A bill to designate additional National Forest System lands \nin the State of Virginia as wilderness, to establish the Seng Mountain \nand Crawfish Valley Scenic Areas, to provide for the development of \ntrail plans for the wilderness areas and scenic areas, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation for my State, the Virginia Ridge and Valley \nWilderness and National Scenic Areas Act of 2004. This bill will add \nfour new wilderness areas, five additions to existing wilderness areas, \nand two National Scenic Areas to the Jefferson National Forest. \nCongressman Rick Boucher is introducing companion legislation in the \nUnited States House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page S4329]]\n\n  It is no coincidence that I introduce this legislation on Earth Day, \na time when we can reflect on our natural world and the obligations we \nhave to protect the earth which provides so richly for us. Throughout \nmy career in the United States Senate, I have strived to preserve \nVirginia's natural resources and heritage through the designation of \nwilderness areas. In fact, I have worked to pass three wilderness bills \nthrough Congress. I stood here not four years ago and introduced a bill \nthat added two exceptional areas in the George Washington National \nForest to the wilderness system. With the help of many, that \nlegislation is now law, and Virginia has approximately 100,434 acres of \ndesignated wilderness lands.\n  However, there is still work to be done. Within the Jefferson \nNational Forest, designated wilderness areas total only 7 percent of \nthe total forest acreage. The enactment of this legislation will \nsubstantially increase our opportunities for uninterrupted enjoyment in \nthe forest with the addition of nearly 29,000 acres of new wilderness \nareas and almost 12,000 acres of national scenic areas.\n  Virginia is blessed with great beauty and natural diversity. From the \ncomplex ecosystem of the Chesapeake Bay, to the exquisite vistas, \nstreams, vegetation, and wildlife of the Shenandoah Mountains, \nresidents and visitors alike can enjoy a bountiful array of natural \ntreasures. As demand for development in Virginia increases, it becomes \nincumbent upon Congress to act expeditiously to protect these wild \nlands. Through wilderness and national scenic area designations, we can \nensure that these areas retain their primeval character and influences.\n  I consider myself an avid outdoorsman, and I enjoy opportunities for \nrecreation. I want to stress the many activities that will continue to \noccur in these wilderness areas, including: hunting, fishing, hiking, \ncamping, canoeing, and horseback riding, to name a few. In addition, \nthe Wilderness Act is flexible and provides for reasonable local forest \nmanagement and emergency services in wilderness areas, such as the use \nof motorized equipment and aircraft for search and rescue operations; \nor to combat fire, insects and disease.\n  I am particularly pleased to include in the legislation an \nauthorization for the establishment of a non-motorized trail between \nCounty Route 650 and Forest Development Road 4018 outside of the new \nRaccoon Branch Wilderness area. This trail will follow the historic Rye \nValley Railroad Grade and will be a popular route for mountain bikers, \nequestrians and hikers. In addition, this bill directs the Forest \nService to develop trail plans for the wilderness and national scenic \nareas.\n  As a father and a grandfather, I feel a weighty obligation to ensure \nthat our children have lasting opportunities to enjoy Virginia's \nimmense natural beauty and diversity. This legislation is a crucial \nstep in our quest to preserve these lovely areas for the enjoyment and \nuse of future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2343. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the medicare program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am being joined by Senator \nBlanche Lincoln in introducing the Medicare Prescription Drug \nImprovement Act (MEND) of 2004, which aims to make various improvements \nto the recently enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Modernization, and \nImprovement Act of 2003 (H.R. 1).\n  I said when we passed H.R. 1 that we could do better for seniors and \nthat I would keep pushing to improve the Medicare drug bill. This bill \nis an important first step in that effort. It provides a better, more \nstable prescription drug benefit and lowers the costs of drugs for \nseniors. It also removes the giveaways to health plans and it will \nreduce the deficit. In short, this bill is a win for seniors, a win for \ngood government, and a win for taxpayers.\n  I supported the new Medicare law, but this was not an easy decision. \nWhile this legislation takes important steps to add a drug benefit to \nthe Medicare program and makes needed provider payment reforms, this \nlegislation has many flaws that must be addressed. The legislation I am \nunveiling today takes steps in this direction.\n  Before I describe this new effort, I'd first like to highlight why I \nbelieve supporting the Medicare bill was the right decision, \nparticularly for Medicare beneficiaries in my home State of North \nDakota.\n  The first--and most basic--reason I supported this legislation is \nbecause it takes critical steps to add a drug benefit to the Medicare \nprogram. This benefit will provide America's seniors--for the first \ntime--the opportunity to receive help with their medication costs. If \nseniors are satisfied with their current health care coverage, they do \nnot have to sign up for this new benefit. But if they need extra help \ncovering their prescription costs, the new Medicare drug benefit offers \nan important coverage option.\n  The second major reason I supported this legislation is because it \nprovides a very generous benefit for lower-income seniors with incomes \nbelow 150 percent of the Federal poverty. Under the legislation, about \n40 percent of seniors in North Dakota will get the vast majority of \ntheir drugs covered, with minimal out-of-pocket costs. This extra \nassistance will make a critical difference to lower-income seniors in \nmy State, many of whom have told me that they are often faced with the \nchoice of paying for their medicines or paying for food, rent and other \nliving costs. In my view, this is a choice that no senior citizen \nshould be forced to make. The legislation we passed took important \nsteps to address this problem.\n  In addition, the Medicare drug benefit will provide substantial \nassistance to those with catastrophic drug costs. Specifically, after a \nbeneficiary spends $3,600 out-of-pocket, Medicare will pick up 95 \npercent of the cost. This catastrophic coverage is an important \ncomponent of the bill, which we estimate will help nearly 11 percent of \nNorth Dakota seniors better afford high-cost medications.\n  As we move forward on implementing this new benefit, it is my strong \nhope that it will improve health care coverage for the millions of \nseniors across the Nation who are struggling to afford life-saving and \nlife-enhancing medications.\n  Finally, another major reason that I supported the Medicare bill is \nthat it includes a whole host of rural provider payment reforms that I \nauthored along with Senator Craig Thomas from Wyoming and \nRepresentative Earl Pomeroy from my State of North Dakota. These \nmeasures take important steps to address payment disparities that were \ncausing rural health care providers to receive significantly less \nreimbursement than their urban counterparts. Over the next 10 years, \nthese payment changes will improve funding to the rural health care \nsystem by more than $20 billion. It is my hope that these important \nprovisions will help ensure health care providers can continue offering \nquality and affordable health care services to rural communities in my \nState and across the Nation.\n  Those are positive aspects of the recently enacted Medicare \nlegislation. But, as I said when we passed it, the bill also had a \nnumber of significant flaws. The bill I am introducing today addresses \nthese flaws and makes some important improvements to the new Medicare \nlaw.\n  To be clear, my new legislation does not include every change I would \nlike to make to the Medicare law. To do that, we would need to spend \nhundreds of billions of dollars. Given the Federal budget deficit we \nare facing, this is simply not possible.\n  But it is possible to make some common-sense improvements to the \nbill. And that is what my legislation does. Let me describe it in \nfurther detail.\n  The first area of my bill will include new measures to reduce the \ncosts of prescription drugs. We know that drug costs have skyrocketed \nover the last few years. This is a real problem for seniors and others \nacross the Nation who are having increasing trouble affording their \nmedications.\n  It is also a problem for the Medicare program, which will face \nincreasing cost pressures when we add the new drug benefit. Given this \nsituation, we must take steps to reduce and control drug costs. My \nlegislation would do that in two ways.\n  First, it would allow pharmacists and licensed wholesalers to \nreimport less expensive drugs from Canada. The Medicare bill gives the \nDepartment of\n\n[[Page S4330]]\n\nHealth and Human Services authority to allow this reimportation, but it \nput roadblocks in place that will effectively ensure reimportation \nnever happens.\n  My bill would remove these roadblocks and allow reimportation to \nbegin immediately. If at any time a reimported drug is found to be \nunsafe, the Secretary would have authority to immediately suspend \nreimportation of this product.\n  The second thing my bill would do to reduce costs is to allow the \nSecretary of HHS to negotiate with drug companies to lower the costs of \nmedications in the new drug benefit.\n\n  As my colleagues know, the Medicare law specifically prohibits the \nSecretary from directly negotiating with pharmaceutical companies to \nlower drug prices. We know that allowing the government to negotiate in \nother programs, like the VA, has significantly lowered costs. There's \nno reason we shouldn't also allow it in the new Medicare drug benefit.\n  In addition to taking steps to reduce drug costs, my legislation also \nincludes measures to improve the stability of the Medicare drug \nbenefit.\n  Under the new Medicare benefit, I am concerned that seniors may face \ndifferent drug costs, different drug formularies, and different \napproved pharmacies as they switch from plan-to-plan every year. If we \nknow anything, we know that seniors want certainty.\n  One way to fix this is to allow seniors to stay in the drug plan of \ntheir choice for more than 1 year--even if it is a ``government \nfallback plan.'' My legislation includes this change.\n  Another shortfall of the new Medicare law is that it prohibits \nseniors from purchasing supplemental insurance to assist with costs not \ncovered by the new benefit. My legislation would lift this restriction \nand give seniors another choice for covering their medication costs.\n  Beyond that, my legislation also includes new measures to ensure \nseniors retain access to the local pharmacy of their choice. In many \ncommunities, the local pharmacist is the most accessible source of \nhealth care services. Given this, my bill contains measures to protect \nlocal pharmacy services.\n  Specifically, it would require that the Medicare program allow \nseniors to go to their local pharmacy to get their prescriptions \nfilled, rather than forcing them to receive their drugs by mail-order \nor forcing them to go to a pharmacy in a nursing home or hospital that \nmay not be as accessible. My hope is that this provision would ensure \nthat seniors can continue to visit their local pharmacist.\n  My legislation would also authorize $500 million that could be used \nto help pharmacists cover the costs of educating seniors about the new \ndrug plan choices. This funding would provide pharmacists a one-time \npayment for providing information to seniors as they enroll in the new \nbenefit.\n  My bill also includes other measures to provide seniors with better \ninformation about the new drug benefit. Specifically, it would require \ndrug plans to provide seniors with detailed information about what \ndrugs will be covered--before the seniors signs up. It also would \nrequire that plans inform seniors of any changes to these covered \ndrugs--either through the telephone, by mail or on the Internet.\n  My legislation would also take other steps to protect seniors by \nrepealing the premium support demonstration project that is set to \nbegin in 2010. Although seniors will be able to choose whether they \nwant to enter private plans under this demonstration, I believe it is a \nstep in the wrong direction toward privatizing the program and could \ndrive up premiums for those in fee-for-service. Given this, my bill \nwill repeal this privatization demonstration.\n  Finally, my bill includes additional measures that will help reduce \nspending and protect the financial integrity of the Medicare program.\n  In particular, the legislation will include measures to expand the \nchronic care management demonstration project in the Medicare law.\n  Today, roughly 5 percent of seniors account for about 50 percent of \nthe entire Medicare budget. The Medicare law will test providing \ncoordinated care to these beneficiaries, which many believe will help \nimprove quality of care and reduce costs. My legislation will build on \nthis effort by providing additional resources to expand chronic care \nmanagement to more areas of the country. I believe this will save money \nfor Medicare and improve health outcomes for these seniors.\n  Finally, my new legislation will eliminate provisions in the Medicare \nlaw that provide unfair, extra payments to private plans. Specifically, \nit will repeal a new $8.9 billion taxpayer subsidy to bring more \nprivate plans into the market. It will also address inequities that \ncurrently allow HMOs to receive significantly higher payments than \ntraditional Medicare--for serving the exact same patient. These \npolicies are simply a waste of money.\n  According to unofficial estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, \neliminating these private plan overpayments could result in significant \ncost savings. Under my plan, these cost savings would be used to reduce \nthe Federal budget deficit, which has reached record levels this year.\n  This is a basic overview of the provisions that will be included in \nmy new legislation--the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement Act (the \nMEND Act).\n  I believe this legislation will take significant steps toward \nimproving the new Medicare law. I would like to thank Senator Lincoln \nfor joining me in this effort and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2344. A bill to permit States to require insurance companies to \ndisclosure insurance information; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Armenian \nVictims Insurance Fairness Act. This bill is the Senate companion to \nlegislation introduced by Congressman Adam Schiff, my good friend and \ncolleague from the 29th District of California.\n  This legislation authorizes states to enact laws that require \ninsurance companies to disclose and make public information about any \npolicy issued in areas controlled by the Ottoman Empire between 1875 \nand 1923.\n  This week marks the 89th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. \nBetween 1915 and 1923, the Ottoman Empire conducted the first Genocide \nof the 20th Century, killing an estimated 1.5 million Armenians and \ndisplacing thousands more. The campaign was so devastating that at the \nbeginning of World War I, there were 2.1 million Armenians living in \nthe Ottoman Empire. Following the Genocide, fewer than 100,000 \nArmenians remained.\n  This legislation is important because survivors and descendants of \nthe Armenian Genocide are still trying to recoup the benefits owed to \nthem under the tens of thousands of insurance policies that were issued \nprior to the Genocide. According to a news report, one Californian has \nbeen attempting to collect on an insurance policy for 40 years, but has \nbeen stonewalled by the company that issued the policy.\n  Insurance policy documents were often destroyed during the Genocide, \nand death certificates were not issued to those Armenians who lost \ntheir lives. Therefore, survivors and descendants can only rely on the \ndocuments held by insurance companies as proof that they are owed \nbenefits. Unfortunately, we have seen little cooperation from insurance \ncompanies on disclosing these documents and opening up their records.\n  This bill closely follows legislation that would help Jewish \nHolocaust survivors. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that a \nCalifornia state law requiring the disclosure of insurance information \nrelated to Holocaust-era policies was unconstitutional--in part because \nof the Federal Government's responsibility to make foreign policy. I \nsupport pending legislation to allow States to pass laws requiring the \ndisclosure of Holocaust-era policies.\n  My bill is designed to ensure that state laws to force insurance \ncompanies to disclose insurance information on policies related to the \nArmenian Genocide do not run into similar legal challenges.\n  It is an injustice to the memories of those slain during the Armenian \nGenocide that insurance companies have not paid the benefits owed to \nthe survivors and victims of this tragic chapter of history. This \nlegislation will help survivors and their families pursue these claims.\n\n[[Page S4331]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Armenian Victims Insurance \nFairness Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2345. A bill to improve the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to \nintroduce legislation, ``The No Child Left Behind Reform Act.'' This \nlegislation makes three basic changes to the No Child Left Behind Act \nwhich was signed into law in January of 2002.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act received the support of this Senator and \n86 of our colleagues. Like most, if not all, of our colleagues who \nsupported this bill, I supported it because I care about improving the \nquality of education in America for all of our children. I believed \nthat this law would help to achieve that goal by establishing more \nrigorous standards for measuring student achievement, by helping \nteachers do a better job of instructing students, and last but not \nleast, by providing the resources desperately needed by our schools for \neven the most basic necessities to help put the reforms we passed into \nplace.\n  Regrettably, the high hopes that I and many others had for this law \nhave not been realized. The law is being implemented by the \nAdministration in a manner that is inflexible, unreasonable and \nunhelpful to students. Furthermore, the law is not only failing to help \nteachers do their best in the classroom, it reflects, along with other \nAdministration policies and pronouncements, a neglect and even \nhostility towards members of the teaching profession.\n  Worse still, the Administration's promise of sufficient resources to \nimplement No Child Left Behind's much needed reforms is a promise that \nhas yet to be kept. Indeed, the current budget proposed by the Bush \nAdministration underfunds No Child Left Behind by $9.4 billion. Since \npassage slightly over 2 years ago, the law has been funded at a level \nthat is more than $26 billion below what was promised when the \nPresident signed the Act into law.\n  As a result of the failures of the current Administration to fulfill \nits commitment to our nation's school children under this law, those \nchildren and their teachers are today shouldering new and noteworthy \nhardships. Throughout the State of Connecticut, for example, students, \nteachers, administrators and parents are struggling to implement \nrequirements that are often confusing, inflexible and unrealistic. And \nthey are struggling to do so without the additional resources they were \npromised to put them into place.\n  As I have said on numerous occasions in the past, resources without \nreforms are a waste of money. By the same token, reforms without \nresources are a false promise--a false promise that has left students \nand their teachers grappling with new burdens and little help to bear \nthem.\n  The legislation I am introducing today proposed to make three changes \nto the No Child Left Behind Act. These changes will ease current \nburdens on our students, our teachers and our administrators without \ndismantling the fundamental underpinnings of the law.\n  First, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act will allow schools to be \ngiven credit for performing well on measures other than test scores \nwhen calculating student achievement. Test scores are an important \nmeasure of student knowledge. However, they are not the only measure. \nThere are others as well. These include dropout rates, the number of \nstudents who participate in advanced placement courses, and measures of \nindividual student improvement over time. Unfortunately, current law \ndoes not allow schools to use these additional measures in a \nconstructive manner. Additional measures can only be used as a measure \nof how a school is failing, not how a school is succeeding. This \nlegislation will allow schools to earn credit for succeeding.\n  Second, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act will allow schools to \ntarget school choice and supplemental services to the students that \nactually demonstrate a need for them. As the current law is being \nimplemented by the Administration, if a school is in need of \nimprovement it is expected to offer school choice and supplemental \nservices to all students--even if not all students have demonstrated a \nneed for them. That strikes me as a wasteful and imprecise way to help \na school improve student performance. For that reason, this legislation \nwill allow schools to target resources to the students that actually \ndemonstrate that they need them. Clearly, this is the most efficient \nway to maximize their effect.\n  Finally, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act introduces a greater \ndegree of reasonableness to the teacher certification process. As it is \nbeing implemented, the law requires teachers to be ``highly qualified'' \nto teach every subject that they teach. Certainly none of us disagree \nwith this policy as a matter of principle. But as a matter of practice, \nit is causing confusion and hardship for teachers, particularly \nsecondary teachers and teachers in small school districts. For example, \nas the law is being implemented by the Administration, a high school \nscience teacher could be required to hold degrees in biology, physics \nand chemistry to be considered highly qualified. In small schools where \nthere may be only one 7th or 8th grade teacher teaching all subjects, \nthese teachers could similarly be required to hold degrees in every \nsubject area.\n  Such requirements are unreasonable at a time when teachers are \nincreasingly hard to find. The legislation I introduce today will allow \nStates to create a single assessment to cover multiple subjects for \nmiddle grade level teachers and allow states to issue a broad \ncertification for science and social studies.\n  In my view, these changes will provide significant assistance to \nschools in Connecticut and other states currently struggling to comply \nwith the No Child Left Behind law. I would hope that our colleagues \nwould look with some favor on it.\n  Of equal if not greater importance is the urgent need to provide our \nschools with the additional resources they need to help our children \nlearn. Obviously, funding this law is beyond the scope of this bill. I \nwould note, however, that efforts to increase education funding to \nauthorized levels have thus far been unsuccessful.\n  Earlier this year, I supported Senator Murray's amendment to fully \nfund No Child Left Behind by increasing the budget allocation by $8.6 \nbillion. Unfortunately, Senator Murray's amendment was defeated purely \non party lines. Clearly, funding for No Child Left Behind is not at the \ntop of the Majority's priority list. I will continue to work to change \nthis outcome. Clearly, our children deserve the resources needed to \nmake their dreams for a better education a reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2345\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as I have announced on several occasions, \nwe intend to begin consideration of the Internet tax access legislation \nnext week. To review for a moment, the bill was reported by the \nCommerce Committee on September 29 of last year and the Finance \nCommittee on October 29. The Senate began consideration of the bill on \nNovember 6 of last year.\n  Since that time, there have been many discussions as to how to best \nproceed through this issue. I understand Members have been continuing \ntheir efforts to find a solution, but it is time to come forward and \ndebate the underlying issue. It would be my hope to begin consideration \nof the bill on Monday, and Senators could offer their amendments and \nthe Senate could then work its will on the moratorium.\n  I understand some of my colleagues desire to delay this bill, but I \nwould respectfully say it is now time to start the process and begin \nthe debate.\n  Having said that, at this point I would have asked consent that at 1 \np.m. on Monday, April 26, the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 353, S. 150, a bill relating to taxes on Internet access. \nGiven the objections from Members on both sides of the aisle, I will \nwithhold that request.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  I now move to proceed to the consideration of S. 150. I send a \ncloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the cloture motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 353, S. 150, a bill to make permanent \n     a moratorium on taxes on Internet access and multiple and \n     discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce imposed by the \n     Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n         Bill Frist, George Allen, Jon Kyl, Orrin Hatch, James \n           Inhofe, Elizabeth Dole, Larry Craig, John Ensign, \n           Gordon Smith, Mitch McConnell, Norm Coleman, Sam \n           Brownback, Trent Lott, Conrad Burns, James Talent, John \n           Sununu, Mike Crapo.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, thank you for your indulgence this \nevening. I, for the last couple of nights, have been reading through \nmuch of Bob Woodward's new book, ``Plan Of Attack.'' It provides, \nbelieve me, quite an exceptional insight into the timetable and the \nprocess by which President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and their top \nadvisers secretly planned and then engineered our country and the world \ninto the Iraq war.\n  It is remarkable that virtually every top administration official \nfrom the President on down provided so much information to Mr. \nWoodward, information that they withheld from Congress and from the \nAmerican people.\n  For example, in the fall of 2002, I sat through several hours of top \nsecret briefings with the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency \nand he never told us it was a ``slam-dunk'' that Saddam Hussein had \nweapons of mass destruction, as he reportedly said to the President. I \nguess I am glad he didn't, because he was wrong.\n  I voted against the Iraq resolution that fall because I was not \npersuaded that Saddam Hussein had or was close to acquiring weapons \nthat threatened the national security of the United States. So I guess \nI am fortunate that I wasn't slam-dunked.\n  I wasn't, either, at the September 26, 2002, meeting which President \nBush reportedly, according to Mr. Woodward, had with 18 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives. In the book, the President is quoted as \nsaying--Mr. Woodward says initially:\n\n       Putting the most dire spin on the intelligence he, the \n     President, said ``It is clear he, Saddam Hussein, has weapons \n     of mass destruction, anthrax, VX. He still needs plutonium. \n     The timeframe would be 6 months for Iraq having a nuclear \n     weapon if they could obtain sufficient plutonium or enriched \n     uranium.\n\n  That was a significantly shorter timetable than anything that was \nrepresented to me in any of the briefings that I attended, even under \nthose circumstances of procuring from the outside, weapons materials.\n  Then the President went to the Rose Garden and said to the assembled \npress corps, and therefore to the Nation and the world:\n\n       The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, \n     and, according to the British government, the Iraqi regime \n     could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as \n     45 minutes after the order was given.\n\n  That is an alarming statement, coming from a President of the United \nStates, a statement likely to frighten a great many Americans and also \npressure a great many Members of Congress that Iraq was, right then and \nthere, an urgent and immediate threat to our national security.\n  Mr. Woodward goes on to say that the CIA Director and others had \nwarned the British not to make that allegation, which was based on a \nquestionable source and almost certainly referred to battlefield \nweapons, not ones that Iraq could launch even at neighboring countries, \nlet alone American cities. He quotes the Director of the CIA as \nreferring privately to this as:\n\n     . . . they-can-attack-in-45-minutes shit.\n\n  I know one of my Senate colleagues who has said that he based his \nvote in support of the war resolution on that stated threat, and the \nperil, if true, in which it would have placed coastal cities in his \nState--if true. Of course it was true if the President, the President \nof the United States, said so to the American people from the White \nHouse, with Members of the House of Representatives, Democrats and \nRepublicans, standing right behind him.\n  They presumably also believed in the President, that he was speaking \nthe truth--a truth that perhaps only he could know. And surely, \ncertainly, if he happened to misspeak, someone in the administration \nwho knew otherwise, especially the person in charge of our national \nintelligence agency, would make sure the necessary correction would be \nissued quickly so as not to mislead anyone or everyone. But that wasn't \ndone.\n  That is just one example of the misuse of prewar intelligence by the \nBush administration. But in that instance the President himself and the \ncommission the President appointed to look into the intelligence \nfailures, if there were, or successes leading up to and through the \nIraqi war, that commission will not be looking into that use or misuse \nof intelligence information by the administration officials because the \nPresident's directive does not permit them to do so.\n  If anybody in this body needs sufficient cause to insist upon, as \nmembers of my caucus have for many months now, a truly independent \ncommission, one with full authority to investigate whatever its members \ndetermine warrants their investigation so that we all can know the \ntruth and the full truth about who had what information and who used \nwhat information truthfully or untruthfully and, therefore, led us into \nthat war, if they need sufficient cause, this book certainly provides \nit.\n  It is clear to me, however--I say this very reluctantly--that the \nadministration won't provide us with the truth themselves--perhaps only \npart of it through Mr. Woodward. I regret to say I am convinced that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle won't require the \nadministration to do so. Instead, it is hunkered down, admitting no \nmistakes, acknowledging no difficulty, keeps spinning the party line \nabout how well everything is going in Iraq, how much better and safer \nthe Iraqi people are, we are, and the world is as a result of this war.\n  That is what we have been told repeatedly and emphatically in every \nSenate Armed Services Committee meeting I have attended and in every \nsecret and top secret briefing I received. And in the now dwindling \nnumber of real opportunities to question the administration's decisions \nabout what is going on in Iraq, we get instead the party line about \nwhat they want us to know--what they won't tell us because they don't \nwant us to know. What they tell us is usually contradicted as a result \nof some good investigative journalism. And I thank the Lord for a free \nand vigilant press in this country. It is just an absolute requirement \nfor successful democracy.\n  Increasingly now what we are finding out is the hard realities--the \nugly truths about what really is happening or not happening in Iraq--\ngrab the headlines and seize our attention and sear our consciences as \nmore and more Americans are dying there, as more and more are wounded, \ninjured, and maimed for life.\n  I have been to the hospitals here. I think most of my colleagues have \nas well. I have seen lives that have changed forever. And, of course, I \nhave gone to services for those whose lives were ended forever, and \nthose families have to struggle and go on.\n  It is incredible to watch what is going on in Iraq now and see that \nmore and more of our incredibly courageous men and women serving over \nthere are being murdered by the people they saved--the people that the \nadministration with certainty said would support our troops as \nliberators and not attack them as enemies.\n  What do our incredibly brave American troops over in Iraq need to be \nable to do the enormous task that was assigned to them? We keep asking \nthat question in Congress. We certainly asked it in the Armed Services \nCommittee. We wanted to provide it.\n  This Congress and the Congress previous to this one--in which I also \nserved--provided the administration with every single dollar it \nrequested for the operation in Iraq, whether it was a regular \nappropriation, a supplemental appropriation, or emergency\n\n[[Page S4335]]\n\nsupplemental appropriation. I personally voted for every dollar the \nPresident said is needed for military supplies and equipment for the \nIraqi security force training, for economic development in that \ncountry, and for social rehabilitation.\n  My colleague, Senator Coleman, and I added funding that had been \noverlooked to help pay for those American heroes who are serving over \nthere to travel home to see their families during their 2-week leave in \nthe middle of what has become a 12-month or 18-month or indefinitely \nextended tours of duty.\n  Senator Bob Graham saw to it that the wounded soldiers wouldn't have \nto pay for their own hospital meals during their recuperations. Senator \nLindsey Graham and Senator Tom Daschle tried to extend the health care \ncoverage that is provided to reservists and National Guard men and \nwomen and their families to make it year round, since their service in \ncertainly incredibly increasing numbers of cases have become year \nround, and subject to that at a moment's notice. I was a proud \ncosponsor of that legislation. It was opposed by the administration. \nDespite that opposition, last year we were partially successful, and we \nare going to be trying to accomplish the rest this year.\n  Most of my caucus and quite a number of my Republican colleagues have \nalso voted several times to restore the funding cuts that the \nadministration proposed for the VA health system which is even now \nseriously overloaded.\n  When with no forewarning and apparently with very little \nforeknowledge, heavy fighting escalated from where it was before in \nIraq and erupted where it was not before; when American forces are \nsuffering their highest casualties in the years since President Bush \nflew onto the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and proclaimed ``mission \naccomplished;'' when 20,000 of our troops, our constituents, the \nfamilies in our States were told they were literally packing up and \nheading for home, and then told they must stay for an indefinitely \nextended period; then we in the Senate Armed Services Committee meeting \nthis week are told by the Deputy Secretary of Defense that ``the \nincrease in violence was not entirely unexpected;'' it is hard to \nreconcile what has occurred.\n  Just 3 weeks earlier--just hours, in fact, before the four American \ncontractors were ambushed and massacred and then part of hell broke \nloose over there--those expectations were not mentioned in a briefing \nwe attended. They weren't even suggested. When I made that point--I \ndidn't ask in that briefing about Fallujah--well, what about it now? \n``Unsettled,'' I was told this week but U.S. forces will soon secure \nthe city.\n  The next morning they published a report that a:\n\n       Senior American officer in Fallujah was quoted as saying \n     ``We have the potential to turn it into the Alamo, if we get \n     it wrong.''\n\n  The Alamo? That was pretty unsettling, as I recall from my history \nbooks, and it kept getting worse thereafter.\n  Again at a hearing, I queried that there have been reports that Iraqi \nforces which we have been paying $1 billion through supplemental \nappropriations to supposedly train and equip so they can fight and \nprotect their own country and our men and women can come home, there \nwere reports some of them in the last couple of weeks--many of them--\nwould not fight, that they ran away and even left our guns and \nequipment to be used by the insurgents to try to kill our own forces. \nHow many did so? In other words, how effective has our training been? \nDidn't know. Estimated maybe 5 to 10 percent.\n\n  That very night I read in an article I overlooked in a morning paper, \nthat same day an American general who was in Iraq put the percentage of \nIraqi forces who failed to fight at 40 percent; 40 percent of our \nsupposed allies were not allies when needed and 40 percent of our \nequipment is being used against our own troops.\n  The question I most want to be answered is, What is your current \ntimetable for bringing our troops home? They are showing a big chart at \nthe hearing for the timetable of the transfer of political \nresponsibilities and government authority. It is quite detailed. It \nwent through 2004, 2005, and into 2006. What, then, I asked, is the \ntimetable for the transition of military responsibility to the Iraqis? \nNo answer, not even in the closed session following. What is the United \nStates force level now projected in 6 months, in 12 months in Iraq? No \nanswer.\n  Surely these projections are being made. Nobody likes to predict in \npublic what the uncertain future might hold, but we have a right to \nknow. More importantly, the American people have a right to know. These \nare their sons and daughters over there on the orders of their \nCommander in Chief and they deserve to be told the truth. We are not \neven being told how much money the war in Iraq and the war in \nAfghanistan is expected to cost in the next fiscal year, which starts \nin 5 months.\n  We cannot even find out when the $87 billion we appropriated last \nOctober will run out. That is ridiculous. After all, whose money is it? \nWhose Government is it? It is our Government, all of us here and all of \nthe American people, we are all in this together for better or for \nworse. We will pay for it or avoid paying for it together. We will \nbenefit from an improved world or suffer from the reported \nunprecedented Arab hatred toward America. We will do that together. Our \nlives and our children's lives, our beloved Nation's future, will all \nbe affected for many years profoundly by what is being done in our \nnames and by the results and consequences that have occurred.\n  Please, tell the truth, Mr. President, the real truth, the whole \ntruth, and we will face it together.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/22/senate-section/article/S4335-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 26, 2004, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
