Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nfor morning business until 11 a.m. Following morning business, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 2555, the Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. One amendment is pending. It was \noffered by Senator Byrd during yesterday's proceedings. I anticipate \nfurther debate on that amendment today, and then it is hoped that a \nconsent will be reached for a time certain to vote in relation to that \namendment. There will be no votes prior to the policy luncheons.\n  In addition, this afternoon, there will be an all-Senators briefing, \nand therefore I will be discussing with the Democratic leadership the \nbest timeframe for the scheduling of votes today.\n  It is hoped that once debate is complete on the Byrd amendment, we \ncan set that aside and consider other amendments. We will make further \nprogress on the bill throughout the day and stack rollcall votes for \nlater this afternoon. We will stay in session this afternoon and early \nevening to dispose of as many amendments as possible.\n  As I indicated last week, we hope to complete this important Homeland \nSecurity bill during Wednesday's session of the Senate. That would \nenable us to proceed to other appropriations bills that are available \nthis week.\n  The end of the fiscal year is fast approaching, and the Senate should \ncontinue to work through the constitutionally required appropriations \nprocess as expeditiously as possible.\n  Next week is the final week of legislative work prior to the August \nrecess, and that will be devoted to finishing the Energy bill. I would \ntherefore ask for all Senators' consideration as we continue through \nthis last week and a half. I should add that it would be helpful to \nboth Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd if Members would come forward \ntoday with their amendments so that we could schedule the debate and \nvotes in an orderly way.\n  I thank all Members for their attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9665-7", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9665-S9666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic whip is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. The leader should be aware that we are going to run a \nhotline to find out what amendments we have on Homeland Security. \nSenator Byrd's amendment is a large amendment, and he has a speech that \nwill take close to an hour to talk about. As soon as that is completed, \nI am sure we will be able to arrive at an end of the debate on that \nissue and a vote can be scheduled at the pleasure of the leader.\n  I would ask, through the Chair: We are this morning going to be in \nmorning business until 11. Senator Byrd is preoccupied on other matters \nuntil 11:30. The leader has indicated there will be no votes this \nmorning. The party caucuses usually run until 2:15, and we are always \njammed for time in ours. I wonder if it would be in the best interest \nof the Senate that the party caucuses be extended an additional 15\n\n[[Page S9666]]\n\nminutes from 2:15 to 2:30. I think we should be in recess when Mr. \nBremer is here.\n  The point is, if the leader intends to put us in recess until 3:30, \ncould we extend the caucuses another 15 minutes?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would rather talk to Senator Cochran \nbefore making decisions about this afternoon. As the Democratic \nleadership wants to do, I want to progress in an expeditious way but at \nthe same time give people the opportunity to do policy lunches and \ndebate. We also have an all-the-Senate briefing this afternoon. But \nbefore locking down any understanding, I will first check with the \nfloor managers on the particular bill. That would be appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9666-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICA'S ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak to an issue we will be \naddressing next week, as I mentioned earlier, and that is the Energy \nbill. As I mention daily, or almost daily, on the floor, I am very \npleased with the productive debate we have had to date on this very \nimportant bill and want to take this opportunity to commend the \nchairman of the Energy Committee, our distinguished colleague from New \nMexico, Chairman Domenici, for his work on moving this Energy bill \nforward because it is important to every American.\n  We have made solid progress. We have locked in an agreement which \nlimits the number of amendments to the Energy legislation. We have \nreminded people, again almost on a daily basis, to continue working, \neven though we have other activity on the floor, to narrow those \namendments, to continue the discussion, to work out agreements so that \nwe can use the time most efficiently on the floor next week. I am \nconfident that because of that, we will be able to pass this crucial \nlegislation next week.\n  It is imperative that we do so. America's economic future is at \nstake. It is our responsibility to pass this bill. The House of \nRepresentatives has already passed an energy bill. The President has \nclearly stated he wants the Congress--specifically the Senate--to \naddress this issue, and now is the time for us to act.\n  I mentioned the economic interests because when a lot of people think \nenergy, they think directly about whether it means gasoline or whether \nit means paying their utility bills, but it also--and this is why I \nmentioned it--has a real impact on our economy.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan came to the Hill last month \nspecifically to talk about the energy policy. The price of natural gas \nfor July delivery is 150 percent what it was just a little over 2, \nalmost 3, years ago. Meanwhile, natural gas storage levels are at their \nlowest in almost three decades. In these meetings, Chairman Greenspan \nwarned that the volatility in the price of natural gas could eventually \naffect and contribute to erosion in the economy. We simply cannot \nafford that. We have a responsibility to respond, and indeed we have \nthat opportunity next week.\n  American industry is caught between regulations limiting the supply \nof natural gas and regulations encouraging its use. The result: Rising \ngas prices, with some industries cutting jobs or being priced out \naltogether, and consumers getting hit with rising electric bills. We \nsimply must diversify our sources of energy, and we must do so in a way \nthat lessens our dependence on foreign sources for this energy.\n  The fact that almost 60 percent of our energy sources come from \noverseas is simply too much. It is unacceptable today. America's energy \npolicy should be consistent with our foreign policy in that it has the \nprinciples of independence and security at its foundation. By \nincreasing America's domestic production of clean coal, oil, gas, \nnuclear, solar, and other renewable energy sources, we increase not \njust our energy supply but also our national security.\n  By passing a comprehensive energy package, we will be creating the \nneeded jobs. The Energy bill will create at least 500,000 jobs and will \nsave even more. The Alaskan pipeline, for example, will create at least \n400,000 jobs. The hundreds of millions of dollars in research and \ndevelopment of all sorts in new technologies will not only benefit the \nenvironment but will create new jobs in fields such as engineering, \nmath, science, and physics.\n  I am committed to getting a comprehensive national energy bill \npassed. While some people are talking of a weak economy, warning of a \nweak economy and increasing unemployment, we are taking action on the \nSenate floor to make our economy strong. We will do so in this Energy \nbill, as we did with the Jobs in Growth Act, which indeed provides \nimmediate tax relief to millions of American families, to businesses, \nand to our States.\n  As we all know, checks of up to $400 will soon be sent to 25 million \ntaxpayers starting even later this week. A family of four making \n$40,000 will see their taxes reduced by over $1,100 this year, and of \nthe overall $350 billion stimulus and growth package, nearly $200 \nbillion, fully 60 percent of it, will be injected into the economy in \nthe next 18 months. This injection of money and resources is the input \nwe need to grow our economy, to create jobs, to create investment, to \nprovide States with the resources they need to maintain essential \ngovernment services and to reduce unemployment.\n  We will be able to amplify that legislative success by securing our \nenergy supply. A strong, productive energy policy is crucial to our \nefforts to strengthen our economic and national security.\n  As I mentioned, we will return to that Energy bill on Monday. I look \nforward to addressing the remaining amendments over the course of that \nweek. We will be able to deliver to the American people energy that is \ncleaner, more abundant, and more secure. Energy is fuel for our \neconomy, as well.\n\n  Together with other issues we will be addressing--tax reform, medical \nliability reform, and many other issues we are addressing in the \nSenate--we will secure and strengthen our economy and protect its \nfuture growth.\n  I make these comments only as a prelude to what will be a very \nimportant week next week as we address energy policy for fulfilling our \nresponsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9666-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to acknowledge the \nschedule the distinguished majority leader has enunciated and to \nrespond to a couple of remarks he has made.\n  I share his view that we ought to do all we can to address the \nquestion of energy policy in this country. I certainly recognize its \npriority as we consider all of the competing issues we have to address. \nI have indicated to him on several occasions that I was very concerned \nabout the decision he has made to limit the amount of debate on the \nEnergy bill to a matter of a couple of days. We will start on Monday \nand obviously the scheduled recess is to begin on Friday. We have a lot \nof amendments. If I recall, it is over 320 amendments pending. Frankly, \nI don't know how one can accommodate the amendments contemplated in \nthat brief period of time.\n  In the last Congress, we voted 88 to 11 to pass a comprehensive \nEnergy bill, but it took 144 amendments and 8 weeks of floor debate to \nreach that accomplishment. We spent significantly less time debating \nthe Energy bill this year. In total, we have spent about 9 days, with \n24 amendments, and only 12 rollcall votes.\n  We have not addressed the many issues remaining. I am told not 320 \namendments but 382 amendments are currently pending, including a \nrenewable portfolio standard to require utilities to generate 10 \npercent of their electricity from renewable sources by the year 2020. \nIt was in the Senate bill last year but dropped in the conference. That \nis very critical to a number of Senators.\n\n[[Page S9667]]\n\n  I am told the electricity title is now the subject of a redraft. We \nhave not had the opportunity even to see this title yet. I understand \nit is being drafted; it is going to be one of the most critical parts \nof the debate. The longer we go without having had the opportunity to \nsee it, the more difficult it will be to address it ultimately when it \nis brought to the floor. It is an understatement to say electricity \npolicy is complicated. All one has to do is look at the experience over \nthe last few years in California to know how challenging and how \ncomplicated those issues involving electricity are.\n  Last year's bill included a comprehensive framework to address global \nwarming. The current bill eliminates those provisions. We think that \nalso is a very important issue.\n  There are many other issues, including hydroelectric dam relicensing, \nnuclear power subsidies, the Indian energy programs and policies that \nremain unresolved, and of course the energy tax package that passed out \nof the Finance Committee has yet to be included in the Energy bill.\n  That is a lot of work to do in a matter of a couple of days. I hope \nwe could take it up this week so we could be sure we can address all of \nthese issues in a timely way, in a way that would accommodate a good \nand full debate. Even if we took up the Energy bill this week and spent \nthe next 2 weeks debating it, we would still be approximately a month \nshorter in the overall consideration of the bill than we were last \nyear. Last year, we spent 2 full months. We have spent a little more \nthan a week debating the bill so far this year. We are far short from \nthe time dedicated, devoted to the issue of energy policy last year. If \nwe cut what remains of this month in half and limit the debate to a \nmatter of a few days, I am very concerned about our ability to complete \nthe work. I am very concerned about the ability to address in a \nmeaningful way many of the outstanding issues that still remain.\n\n  The distinguished majority leader also noted that he would hope that \nthis Energy bill would add to the economic portfolio we have attempted \nto address this year. He mentioned the checks that will be going out \nlater this week. I am still troubled--in fact, I would hope the whole \nSenate is troubled--by the fact that 6 million families with 12 million \nchildren were left out when this bill was signed into law. These \nfamilies will not receive child care tax credit checks. We have \nattempted to come to the Senate on several occasions to address this \ninequity. On an overwhelming basis the Senate has committed to \naddressing the inequity. Yet our House colleagues and this \nadministration have not engaged and have not weighed in on their behalf \nto allow this work to be completed.\n  We will look for ways to address that particular issue this week, \nnext week, whatever length of time it takes because it is inexcusable \nthat we would literally carve out those who would benefit most. It \ncould generate the most economic activity were they included as we had \noriginally intended. That, too, is an issue of great concern.\n  We have to be concerned about the economy. We have lost, now, 3 \nmillion jobs since this administration has taken office. We have to go \nall the way back to Herbert Hoover to find a time when any \nadministration has lost jobs. In every administration since Herbert \nHoover we have actually allowed the economy to grow to a net gain of \njobs being realized. This is now the first time in some 70 years where \nthat is not the case. Many believe that, in part, is a result of the \nhorrendous fiscal policy we faced. We are facing indebtedness now in \nthis fiscal year of some $400 billion. Take away Social Security and it \nis over $550 billion, and that fiscal policy alone has resulted in this \ndevastating economic circumstance we are facing.\n  We will have a lot of discussion, and there is a great deal of work \nto be done. First, on the economy; secondly, on fairness within the \neconomy especially for those working families whose incomes were \ndramatically affected by the carveout, intentionally, of many of our \nRepublican friends as they wrote the tax bill but on energy, as well.\n  I hope we could begin sooner than next Monday so we could address \nthese issues in a meaningful and constructive and bipartisan and \ncomprehensive way.\n  I will certainly talk to the majority leader about this more directly \nand personally as the occasions arise.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. To put this in proper perspective, the distinguished \nDemocratic leader is aware, to complete this bill in 5 days, would \nrequire us to handle 77\\1/2\\ amendments a day. That has never happened \nin the Senate and never will happen in the Senate. If we go to a 4-day \nweek, which we usually do here, coming late Monday nights, that would \nmean 95 amendments a day.\n  I say to the distinguished Democratic leader, if we were fortunate \nenough to be able to get Senators not to offer half of those \namendments, and worked a 5-day week, we would still have to do 38 \namendments a day, which never has happened and never will happen.\n  I know this bill, to me, is very important in the sense it has in it \nan alternative section that I think is quite good. I would like to \nfinish the bill. But it is not going to be finished when we have 382 \namendments pending, and we only have 4 or 5 days to complete this bill. \nIt just is humanly impossible under any sense of one's ability to \nunderstand the Senate or even one's imagination.\n  So I very much appreciate the Senator being here for those of us who \nwant an Energy bill. We want one with some debate or we will not have \nan Energy bill. We have too many important issues that simply have to \nbe debated. So I extend my appreciation to the Senator for recognizing \nwe cannot do approximately 77 amendments a day.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the assistant Democratic leader makes a \nvery compelling argument. No one knows the management of the Senate \nfloor better than he does. He is here every day, and he is right. You \ncan't deal with 15 or 20 amendments a day, much less 70 or 80.\n  I think it minimizes, in some ways it demeans the debate about energy \npolicy in this country. To say about important issues such as the ones \nwe have outlined again this morning on renewable fuels, on \nconservation, on nuclear energy, on electricity, on taxes, that we are \ngoing to have debates about those extraordinary policy questions and \ncondense them somehow in a matter of a few hours as we debate energy \npolicy that could affect us for the next generation--that is not the \nway to legislate, certainly not the way to manage an important bill \nsuch as this.\n  These issues deserve attention. They deserve our careful \nconsideration, and they will simply not have that if we wait until next \nweek to address these issues. So, again, I thank the Senator for his \ncalculations about the management of these amendments. I hope we could \nentertain this bill a lot sooner than next Monday to accommodate that \nvery problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the distinguished \nmajority leader's time is not part of morning business. Is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I am sure, if the Republican leader were here, he would \nacknowledge that morning business should be divided fairly. The \nDemocratic leader's time has been calculated as in the Democrats' half \nof the morning business; is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that for fairness, the Republican \nleader's time be calculated as in morning business, along with that of \nthe Democratic leader. That way the time will be divided fairly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9667-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9667-S9671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MISLEADING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week there was a historic meeting of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, of which I am a member. Director \nTenet of the Central Intelligence Agency came before us. There has been \na lot written and said about that meeting of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  I think what is important is we reflect on what has occurred since \nthat meeting because I think it speaks volumes about where we are in \nAmerica when it comes to the issue of being\n\n[[Page S9668]]\n\ncritical of this administration, its policies, and its use of \nintelligence.\n  At issue, of course, were 16 words in the President's State of the \nUnion Address last January. This address on January 28 included the \nfollowing statement by the President of the United States:\n\n       The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein \n     recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \n     Africa.\n\n  This sentence was part of a speech delivered by the President, the \nmost important speech any President delivers in the course of a given \nyear, at a time in our Nation's history when we were asked to rally \nbehind our troops and our President to invade the nation of Iraq. This \nwas a moment, of course, of great consequence because not only was \nAmerica's foreign policy about to be decided in relation to the Middle \nEast, but families across America were going to be asked to send their \nsons and daughters, husbands and wives, and loved ones into harm's way. \nThe words have to be measured carefully because the consequences of \nthose words are so serious.\n  Many people have said, What was wrong with the President's statement? \nThe British intelligence was insisting that they had evidence that, in \nfact, Iraq had tried to obtain uranium, fissile material to build \nnuclear weapons from Niger, an African nation. It turns out there was \nmuch more to the story. In addition to the efforts of British \nintelligence, our own intelligence agencies had been looking closely at \nthe same issue and had come to the opposite conclusion. They decided \nthat the evidence presented did not make the case. In fact, in October \nof 2002, when President Bush was going to give a very important speech \nin Cincinnati, OH, outlining the reasons he believed we should be \nmindful of the threat of Iraq, White House staffers--Mr. Hadley, who \nwas with the security portion of the White House--wanted to include in \nthat speech the same reference to this sale of uranium from Niger to \nIraq. He was cautioned by the Central Intelligence Agency in October \nnot to include it because the sources of the information, according to \nthe American intelligence agency, were not credible; the claim was \ndubious. So the charge was taken out of the President's Cincinnati \nspeech in October.\n\n  Then comes the President's State of the Union Address in January. \nOnce again, the same White House staff--I am not alluding to Mr. Hadley \nagain, but someone on the White House staff came forward and said these \nwords should be included, even after being warned 3 months earlier that \nthey were not accurate.\n  So Director Tenet came before us last week to explain what happened, \nwhy words that were disqualified from the President's earlier speech \nwere then included in this State of the Union Address. As the Director \ncame before us, we knew several things. A week before, the President of \nthe United States said the words should not have been included in the \nspeech, and Director of the CIA, Mr. Tenet, said he took personal \nresponsibility for not removing them; that the Central Intelligence \nAgency, responsible for reviewing that kind of wording in the speech, \nshould have stopped the President from using those remarks a second \ntime in the State of the Union Address.\n  I said publicly and on the floor of the Senate that what Director \nTenet told us was important, but equally important was the question as \nto what individual or group of individuals within the White House was \nso adamant in their pursuit of including this important language in the \nspeech, in the President's State of the Union Address--particularly \nafter the White House had been told not to say that in an earlier \nPresidential speech.\n  I made that point after the hearing. I certainly did not disclose the \nname of the White House employee given to us during the course of the \nIntelligence Committee hearing. I said, as I believe now, that as a \nresult of that hearing it was clear that when we make this inquiry, all \nroads lead to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We have to really look to the \nWhite House staff and the role they played in pushing for and putting \nthis language in the speech which led the President to mislead the \nAmerican people.\n  I have said and repeated, there is no evidence or indication that \nPresident Bush knew this statement was wrong--none. If that comes out \nat some later time, so be it. I am not making any allegation about the \nPresident's motive of including it. But I will say this, unequivocally. \nThe President was let down by his staff in the White House. They had a \nresponsibility to make certain what he said to the American people was \ntrue, and they knew better. In October, they had been warned by the CIA \nthat this information was not accurate, was dubious, could not be \nbacked up. Yet they persisted in January in including these same \nremarks.\n\n  After I made the statement, it was interesting the reaction from the \nWhite House. The next day, the White House Press Secretary, Mr. Scott \nMcClellan, called my claims nonsense and went on to say that because I \nvoted against the use of force resolution when it came to the invasion \nof Iraq when it was before the Senate last October, that I was, in \nfact, trying to justify my vote by the statements I was making.\n  That was the White House interpretation of my remarks. They did not \ngo to the heart of the issue, obviously, as to whether there was anyone \nin the White House staff insistent or persistent when it came to \nincluding these remarks and what action might be taken by the White \nHouse to take that staffer off the case, perhaps to remove them \ncompletely from the White House because they had misled the President. \nNo, that was not the issue. The issue was this Senator and my \ncredibility. Well, I understand that. Politics isn't a bean bag. I was \nnot born yesterday. You have to have a tough mental hide if you are \ngoing to aspire to this office and be in a national debate. But it was \ninteresting, on the first day, when the time came to address the issue, \ninstead of attacking the problem, they attacked me. So be it.\n  But then there was more to follow. On the following day, on Friday, \nthe White House press operation started floating the story that there \nwere Senators in this Chamber who were asking for my removal from the \nSenate Intelligence Committee because of the statements I had made. And \nwhen pressed as to what those statements were, the White House said \nDurbin has disclosed classified information and, therefore, should be \nremoved from the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  Now, that is a very serious charge. I can think of perhaps only once \nor twice in my entire congressional career that I have ever heard a \nsimilar charge. So, of course, the reporters who called said to the \nWhite House: What did he disclose? And they said two things: First, he \ndisclosed the name of the White House staffer who was responsible for \nwriting this speech. And, secondly, on the floor of the Senate, at this \nvery desk, he said there were 550 suspected sites of weapons of mass \ndestruction in Iraq identified by the U.S. Government before our \ninvasion.\n  The White House said: Both of those items are classified, Durbin \ndisclosed them, and he should leave the Intelligence Committee.\n  Well, the facts are these: No. 1, I never disclosed the name of the \nWhite House staffer--to this day--who was involved in the preparation \nof the speech. And, secondly, the information I gave on the floor of \n500 suspected sites of weapons of mass destruction had been \ndeclassified a month earlier, declassified and made public. So the \nWhite House allegations to back up my removal from the Intelligence \nCommittee, attacking my credibility, saying that I disclosed classified \ninformation, were, in fact, false and inaccurate.\n  Sadly, what we have here is a continuing pattern by this White House. \nIf any Member of this Senate--Democrat or Republican--takes to the \nfloor, questions this White House policy, raises any questions about \nthe gathering of intelligence information, or the use of it, be \nprepared for the worst. This White House is going to turn on you and \nattack you. They are going to question your patriotism. They are going \nto question the fact of whether or not you are living up to your oath \nof office here in the Senate. And they are going to question as to \nwhether or not you belong in this debate on intelligence; whether, for \ninstance, you should be a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \nI think that is a very serious outcome. It is one that all of us should \nreflect on for a moment.\n\n[[Page S9669]]\n\n  This morning, Paul Krugman has an article in the New York Times. I \nask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 22, 2003]\n\n                         Who's Unpatriotic Now?\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n       Some nonrevisionist history: On Oct. 8, 2002, Knight Ridder \n     newspapers reported on intelligence officials who ``charge \n     that the administration squelches dissenting views, and that \n     intelligence analysts are under intense pressure to produce \n     reports supporting the White House's argument that Saddam \n     poses such an immediate threat to the United States that pre-\n     emptive military action is necessary.'' One official accused \n     the administration of pressuring analysts to ``cook the \n     intelligence books''; none of the dozen other officials the \n     reporters spoke to disagreed.\n       The skepticism of these officials has been vindicated. So \n     have the concerns expressed before the war by military \n     professionals like Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of \n     staff, about the resources required for post-war occupation. \n     But as the bad news comes in, those who promoted this war \n     have responded with a concerted effort to smear the \n     messengers.\n       Issues of principle aside, the invasion of a country that \n     hadn't attacked us and didn't pose an imminent threat has \n     seriously weakened our military position. Of the Army's 33 \n     combat brigades, 16 are in Iraq; this leaves us ill prepared \n     to cope with genuine threats. Moreover, military experts say \n     that with almost two-thirds of its brigades deployed \n     overseas, mainly in Iraq, the Army's readiness is eroding: \n     normal doctrine calls for only one brigade in three to be \n     deployed abroad, while the other two retrain and refit.\n       And the war will have devastating effects on future \n     recruiting by the reserves. A widely circulated photo from \n     Iraq shows a sign in the windshield of a military truck that \n     reads, ``One weekend a month, my ass.''\n       To top it all off, our insistence on launching a war \n     without U.N. approval has deprived us of useful allies. \n     George Bush claims to have a ``huge coalition,'' but only 7 \n     percent of the coalition soldiers in Iraq are non-American--\n     and administration pleas for more help are sounding \n     increasingly plaintive.\n       How serious is the strain on our military? The Brookings \n     Institution military analyst Michael O'Hanlon, who describes \n     our volunteer military as ``one of the best military \n     institutions in human history,'' warns that ``the Bush \n     administration will risk destroying that accomplishment if \n     they keep on the current path.''\n       But instead of explaining what happened to the Al Qaeda \n     link and the nuclear program, in the last few days a series \n     of hawkish pundits have accused those who ask such questions \n     of aiding the enemy. Here's Frank Gaffney Jr. in The National \n     Post: ``Somewhere, probably in Iraq, Saddam Hussein is \n     gloating. He can only be gratified by the feeding frenzy of \n     recriminations, second-guessing and political power plays. . \n     . . Signs of declining popular appreciation of the legitimacy \n     and necessity of the efforts of America's armed forces will \n     erode their morale. Similarly, the enemy will be \n     encouraged.''\n       Well, if we're going to talk about aiding the enemy: By \n     cooking intelligence to promote a war that wasn't urgent, the \n     administration has squandered our military strength. This \n     provides a lot of aid and comfort to Osama bin Laden--who \n     really did attack America--and Kim Jong II--who really is \n     building nukes.\n       And while we're on the subject of patriotism, let's talk \n     about the affair of Joseph Wilson's wife. Mr. Wilson is the \n     former ambassador who was sent to Niger by the C.I.A. to \n     investigate reports of attempted Iraqi uranium purchases and \n     who recently went public with his findings. Since then \n     administration allies have sought to discredit him--it's \n     unpleasant stuff. But here's the kicker: both the columnist \n     Robert Novak and Time magazine say that administration \n     officials told them that they believed that Mr. Wilson had \n     been chosen through the influence of his wife, whom they \n     identified as a C.I.A. operative.\n       Think about that: if their characterization of Mr. Wilson's \n     wife is true (he refuses to confirm or deny it), Bush \n     administration officials have exposed the identity of a \n     covert operative. That happens to be a criminal act; it's \n     also definitely unpatriotic.\n       So why would they do such a thing? Partly, perhaps, to \n     punish Mr. Wilson, but also to send a message.\n       And that should alarm us. We've just seen how politicized, \n     cooked intelligence can damage our national interest. Yet the \n     Wilson affair suggests that the administration intends to \n     continue pressuring analysts to tell it what it wants to \n     hear.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. This morning, in the New York Times, Paul Krugman wrote \nabout another episode. I would like to read from it because I think it \nindicates what I have been through over the past several days is not \nunique.\n  We are aware of the fact that Ambassador Joe Wilson, who has served \nthe United States, was called on by this administration to go to Africa \nand to establish whether or not the sale of uranium took place. He came \nback, and it is my understanding he made an oral report to the \nadministration questioning whether or not there was any background \nevidence to support the claim that Iraq had tried to obtain or had \nobtained uranium fissile material from Niger. He made the report to the \nadministration, which is part of the cumulative evidence of the \nweakness of this assertion by British intelligence.\n  And, of course, a week or two ago, in the New York Times, Ambassador \nWilson published a column indicating the timeline and substance of his \ninvolvement with this issue, and making it clear that based on the \nrequest of the administration, he had gone to Africa, came back with \nthe information, and told the administration he could not make this \nclaim.\n  Let me read from Paul Krugman's article today about Ambassador Joe \nWilson and what has happened to him since he went public with the fact \nthat he had warned this administration that saying anything about the \nuranium coming from Africa was really not credible, of dubious \nbackground. Here is what Krugman writes:\n\n       And while we're on the subject of patriotism, let's talk \n     about the affair of Joseph Wilson's wife. Mr. Wilson is the \n     former ambassador who was sent to Niger by the C.I.A. to \n     investigate reports of attempted Iraqi uranium purchases and \n     who recently went public with his findings. Since then \n     administration allies have sought to discredit him--it's \n     unpleasant stuff. But here's the kicker: both the columnist \n     Robert Novak and Time magazine say that administration \n     officials told them that they believed that Mr. Wilson had \n     been chosen through the influence of his wife, whom they \n     identified as a C.I.A. operative.\n       Think about that: if their characterization of Mr. Wilson's \n     wife is true . . .\n\n  And Krugman writes that Wilson refuses to confirm or deny it--\n\n       Bush administration officials have exposed the identity of \n     a covert operative. That happens to be a criminal act; it's \n     also definitely unpatriotic.\n       So why would they do such a thing?

Yet the \n     Wilson affair suggests that the administration intends to \n     continue pressuring analysts to tell it what it wants to \n     hear.\n\n  End of quote from this Krugman article.\n  Mr. President, I am going to ask the chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee and the ranking member to investigate this \nmatter. This is an extremely serious situation. If, in fact, \nadministrative officials have publicly disclosed the identity of Mr. \nWilson's wife, who is allegedly, according to these news articles, \nworking for the CIA, this is an extremely serious matter. In their \neffort to seek political revenge against Ambassador Wilson for his \ncolumn, they are now attacking him and his wife, and doing it in a \nfashion that is not only unacceptable, it may be criminal. And that, \nfrankly, is as serious as it gets in this town.\n\n  I would say to my colleagues in the Senate, understand what this is \nall about. If you come to the floor of this Senate, or stand before a \nmicrophone, and are critical of this administration for their policy or \nuse of intelligence, be prepared for the worst. You are in for a rough \nride.\n  Certainly what happened to me was minor league compared to what \nhappened to Ambassador Wilson. In my situation, they merely questioned \nmy integrity and asked I be removed from the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. In Mr. Wilson's situation, they have set out to destroy the \ncareer of his wife. That speaks volumes of where this administration \nhas gone when it comes to this essential issue.\n  People have asked me: Why are 16 words so important? Why does it make \nany difference if the President happened to make a mistake? And maybe \ntechnically he didn't. He attributed this information to British \nintelligence. Tony Blair was here last week and says he still stands by \nit.\n  I think it is important in this respect: We spend billions of dollars \neach year accumulating important intelligence information to protect \nAmerica. We can count on the dedicated men and women in intelligence \nagencies around the United States and around the world to keep us safe. \nThey risk their lives to do it. They are as fine and patriotic as any \nman or woman\n\n[[Page S9670]]\n\nwho has ever served this country in uniform. And they try to bring this \ngathered information together, to sift through it, establish what is \ncredible and what is not, and to alert the policy leaders--the \nPresident and others--as to the steps we need to take as a nation to \ndefend ourselves.\n  That is always an important job, but in a war on terrorism it is \nessential. That intelligence becomes increasingly important. Without \nthat intelligence data, how can we possibly protect this Nation from \nanother 9/11?\n  Second, there is a question as well; that is, not only whether we are \ngathering accurate intelligence but whether that intelligence that we \nhave gathered and that information is being accurately and honestly \nreported to the American people. What is at issue is not just the \nintelligence data but the honesty and credibility of the policymakers \nwho use it and portray it.\n  The question we have before us is whether the intelligence \ninformation in this important statement about nuclear weapons in Iraq \nwas somehow spun, hyped, or exaggerated. If that is true, what was the \nmotive? How far up the chain does it go? Is it only one zealous White \nHouse staffer who was trying his best to put this information in a \nspeech or is it more? It is an important question. It is one which I am \ncertain the administration doesn't want to face. But in this age where \nintelligence is more important than ever, it has to be faced.\n  Let me go into the chronology of how the White House has responded as \nwe have questioned whether those 16 words should have been included in \nthe State of the Union Address. This is over a span of about 5 or 6 \nweeks.\n  On June 8, 2003, on Meet the Press, National Security Adviser \nCondoleezza Rice said that the uranium claim in the State of the Union \naddress was ``mistaken,'' but that the White House had not known about \nintelligence doubts until afterward. Rice claimed, ``We did not know at \nthe time--no one knew at the time, in our circles--maybe someone knew \ndown in the bowels of the agency, but no one in our circles knew that \nthere were doubts and suspicions that this might be a forgery.'' Since \nthen, it has been shown that the National Security Adviser Condoleezza \nRice was indeed aware of deep doubts regarding this claim. In fact, the \nCIA prevented one of Dr. Rice's chief deputies from including the \nuranium reference in an October 2002 speech the President gave in \nCincinnati.\n  When Dr. Rice said on June 8, 2003, on ``Meet the Press'' that, ``We \ndid not know at the time--no one knew at the time in our circles'' that \nthere were opportunities and suspicions that this might be a forgery, \nthat ran in direct contradiction of the simple facts that have been \ndisclosed. The CIA had advised the White House and the national \nsecurity portion of the White House not to include the same words in \nthe speech 3 months earlier.\n  Let us go to July 7, 2003.\n  Prompted by a New York Times op-ed article in which Joseph Wilson, \nformer U.S. ambassador to Gabon, contended that the Bush administration \nignored--and possibly manipulated--his findings regarding an Iraq-Niger \nuranium connection, the White House acknowledged that Bush should not \nhave made the claim because of concerns about the intelligence behind \nit. Then White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer tried to shut down \nthe story in its tracks, insisting it was old news.\n  On July 10, 2003--Four days into the controversy, as Bush was dogged \nwith questions while visiting Africa, Secretary of State Colin Powell \nsaid there was no intention to deceive and called the outcry \n``overwrought and overblown and overdrawn.'' In defending the process \nby which the President allowed such a statement in the State of the \nUnion speech, he said ``There was sufficient evidence floating around \nat the time that such a statement was not totally outrageous.''\n  Is that the standard? It was not totally outrageous?\n  Frankly, it is interesting that a few days after the President's \nState of the Union Address when Secretary of State Colin Powell was in \ncareful preparation of his presentation before the United Nations \nSecurity Council, he consciously decided not to include that same \nreference in the speech to the United Nations Security Council. He knew \nbetter, and he knew that the standard of credibility of America is not \nwhether something is or is not totally outrageous.\n  On July 11, 2003: first Condoleezza Rice, then President Bush \nhimself, pointed fingers at the CIA for not removing the claim while \nvetting the speech.\n  Rice:\n\n       There was even some discussion on that specific sentence, \n     so that it reflected better what the CIA thought. And the \n     speech was cleared. Now, I can tell you, if the CIA, the \n     director of Central Intelligence, had said, ``Take this out \n     of the speech,'' it would have been gone, without question.\n\n  President Bush said:\n\n       I gave a speech to the nation that was cleared by the \n     intelligence services. And it was a speech that detailed to \n     the American people the dangers posed by the Saddam Hussein \n     regime.\n\n  At that point, July 11, CIA Director George Tenet made his statement \nconcerning this particular episode. He said in a statement that CIA \nofficials reviewing the draft remarks of the State of the Union \n``raised several concerns about the fragmentary nature of the \nintelligence with National Security Council colleagues. Some of the \nlanguage was changed.'' The change included using British intelligence \nas the source of the information. The CIA, however, continued to doubt \nthe reliability of the British claim, and in fact doubted the \ncredibility of the statement made by the President of the United \nStates, which is certainly asserting the same claim.\n  Between July 11 and July 14, a new line of defense was established by \nthe White House. Dr. Rice and Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld \nappeared on three Sunday talk shows to offer a new explanation: Bush's \nremark was technically accurate because he correctly described what \nBritish intelligence had reported:\n\n       It turns out that it's technically correct what the \n     president said, that the UK did say that and still says that. \n     Even though the words should not have been included in the \n     speech, they're not necessarily inaccurate. The British say \n     they believe that it is accurate, and that may very well be \n     the case. We will just have to wait and see.\n\n  Dancing on the head of a pin, the Secretary of Defense, moving back \nand forth between whether this statement is accurate or not, says that \nthe British intelligence discredited by our intelligence agency said \nmaybe we have to take a wait-and-see attitude and see maybe if they are \nright and maybe if they are wrong.\n  Again, is that the standard for statements by the President of the \nUnited States in preparation for a war where we are about to risk \nAmerican lives? I certainly hope the standard is much higher.\n  On Monday, July 14, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer \nemphasized that the British could be right. He said:\n\n       We don't know if [British intelligence claims were] true \n     but nobody--but nobody--can say it was wrong. The fact of the \n     matter is whether they sought it from Africa or didn't seek \n     it from Africa doesn't change the fact that they were seeking \n     to reconstitute a nuclear program.\n\n  That was a statement made in his Monday press briefing. Now they are \nbasically saying it really doesn't make any difference whether what we \nsaid was truthful or not. According to Ari Fleischer, we all knew they \nwere setting out to reconstitute a nuclear program. But it turned out \nthat this was one of the two major pillars the Bush administration was \nusing to argue that nuclear weapons were a threat from Iraq.\n  First, the aluminum tube controversy, which went in circles many \ntimes as to whether or not these tubes would be used for nuclear \nweapons or conventional munitions and the fissile material and uranium \ncoming from Africa. What we have here is a situation where they are \ntrying to build the case, and build it with the shakiest evidence \nalready discredited by the CIA and other intelligence agencies.\n  Between July 10 and July 18, there came a new strategy from the White \nHouse on the issue. Scott McClellan, who succeeded Fleischer as White \nHouse spokesman, also tried to dismiss questions. Over four days, he \ntold reporters 20 times that the particular question they were asking \nhad already been ``addressed.''\n\n  On July 16, 2003, Scott McClellan said claims by Senator Durbin that \nWhite House officials applied pressure on the CIA to keep the uranium \nreference in\n\n[[Page S9671]]\n\nthe speech were ``nonsense'' and accused skeptics of trying to \n``politicize this issue by rewriting history.'' At the same time, the \nWhite House tried to redirect the debate onto the overall danger posed \nby Saddam's chemical and biological weapons--uranium or not--and onto \nBush's resolve in acting to confront that threat.\n  On July 17, 2003, McClellan cautioned that Senator Durbin--and \npossibly other Democrats--were ``lying about the little things'' \nrelated to CIA Director George Tenet's testimony before the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. The ``little thing'' was whether Tenet has \nnamed names of these responsible at the White House.\n  Although I refused to disclose any names mentioned by the CIA \nDirector, I will say this: I stand by my statement.\n  Let me explain for a moment the issue at hand. We have made it clear \nthat Director Tenet would appear before the Intelligence Committee. \nThat was public knowledge. The fact is that Director Tenet sat at the \ncommittee table in the Senate Intelligence Committee with several \npeople from his agency. What he said, of course, was given to the \nmembers of committee. Questions from members of the committee were \ndirected to appropriate members of the staff, and he would indicate \nwhich member might give an answer to a question.\n  I took great care in commenting about his testimony to limit any \nreference to anyone in the room, specifically to Director Tenet, so \nthat I would not even disclose the names of the CIA employees who were \nin the room. Perhaps I was over cautious. But that caution on my part \nwas then used against me by the White House. Because when we asked \nDirector Tenet pointblank who was the White House staffer responsible \nfor the State of the Union Address--in fact, it has now been publicly \ndisclosed by the CIA and others--he turned to Alan Foley, an assistant \nwho worked on the speech, and Allen Foley gave the name to the \ncommittee with a nod by Director Tenet. So my caution and care not to \neven disclose the name of Alan Foley who sat at the table with the CIA \nDirector was turned and used against me by the White House, saying that \nI was lying to the American public as to whether Director Tenet \ndisclosed the name.\n  The fact is, Director Tenet was testifying. He turned to Mr. Foley, \nhis assistant, who said the name. Whether Director Tenet repeated the \nname, only the record of the hearing can reflect. But what I was \nestablishing was the fact that the identity of the person involved was \ndisclosed during Director Tenet's testimony. I stand by that.\n  On July 18, on Friday, the White House press staff began leaking word \nthat one of the leading White House opponents, Senator Durbin of \nIllinois, had released classified material regarding names of those \ninvolved in the controversy and the number of suspected WMD sites in \nIraq. As a result, the White House said some Senators were \ncontemplating having me, Senator Durbin, removed from the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Our office pointed out to reporters that no classified material had \nbeen released by this Senator. I had refused to name the White House \nstaffer or characterize specific witness testimony. And the number of \nsuspected Iraqi WMD sites, 550, which I disclosed on the Senate floor, \nhad been declassified this year in June. It is public information.\n\n  The White House, when they were confronted with the fact that their \naccusations against me were not true said, they would ``Look into \nthat.''\n  After attacking my honesty and integrity and suggesting I be removed \nfrom the Senate Intelligence Committee, they were unable to produce any \nevidence of the disclosure of classified information. I have gone to \ngreat lengths to avoid that, and I will continue.\n  Then on July 18, that same day, the White House took the rare step of \ndeclassifying and releasing eight pages of a 90-page top secret \nnational intelligence estimate that was used to write the questioned \nportions of the State of the Union Address. Instead of putting a lid on \nthe controversy, the document showed prewar divisions within the U.S. \nintelligence community that were glossed over by administration \nspokesmen. The State Department, for instance, termed the reports that \nSaddam Hussein was shopping for uranium in Africa as ``highly \ndubious.''\n  That is the chronology. It is an important chapter in our political \nhistory. It is an important chapter in the history of the collection \nand use of intelligence here in the United States.\n  I am glad the Senate Intelligence Committee will continue its \ninvestigation. It is my understanding the chairman and ranking Democrat \nhave said they will call White House staffers before the committee to \nask what led up to this situation and why we are in the position we are \ntoday.\n  I can recall times in the past when the Intelligence Committee and \nits members had been challenged as to whether they disclosed classified \ninformation and called on to take polygraphs for fear they may have \nsaid something that was top secret and should not be public knowledge. \nI understand the concern of the administration. That should be the \nconcern of every American. We have to take care not to disclose \nclassified information.\n  But I have to ask the obvious question: How can this administration \ndeclassify things, drop certain items into the press that are \ncomplimentary and positive from their point of view and get away with \nit and not be held to the same standard as members of the committee? \nWhen we are in a situation where we are given a body of information and \ndraw a conclusion from that but cannot speak to that publicly, while \nthe administration discretely drops into the public domain information \nthey think is helpful to their side of the case, that is a one-sided \nargument. It does not serve this Nation well, and the administration is \npushing the envelope when they do it.\n  I am glad the Senate Intelligence Committee is going forward. There \nis a lot more we need to do. I will say to my colleagues in the Senate, \nplease do not back off from our responsibility. We have a \nresponsibility to the people who elect us and to the American people at \nlarge to hold this administration--indeed, every administration--\naccountable for honesty and accuracy when they speak to the American \npeople, particularly in areas of the discussion of intelligence \ninformation which could lead to military action which could, in fact, \nendanger the lives of Americans and their families. That is our most \nserious and sacred duty. We should not back off of it because of \nthreats from the White House or efforts by the White House to silence \nus.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before Senator Durbin leaves the floor, I \nwant to say that the concerns he has raised are serious and grave. They \ndeserve serious attention, not just of this body but of the people in \nthis country. I thank him for bringing them to us today and join him in \nvoicing the gravity of the situation. The kind of actions he has \ndescribed, if they are true, should not be permitted. They should not \nbe countenanced.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Carper pertaining to the introduction of S. 1443 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, yesterday when we presented this bill for \nconsideration, we had opening statements describing the content of the \nlegislation. It is the first appropriations bill that will provide \nfunding for the new Department of Homeland Security. It provides \nfunding in the amount of $29.326 billion for this new Department. It is \na billion dollars over the President's budget request but consistent \nwith the allocation under the budget resolution to this subcommittee.\n  The additional funds are used primarily for training enforcement \npersonnel and developing new equipment\n\n[[Page S9681]]\n\nand technologies that can be utilized to better protect our homeland. \nState and local governments will get grants from the Department to help \nupgrade their capabilities in this area, not just against the war \nagainst terror and defeating terrorism but in dealing with natural \ndisasters as well.\n  The 22 agencies that previously existed that have responsibilities in \nthis area have been folded into one organization under this new \nDepartment headed up by Secretary Tom Ridge. We are hopeful we can \ncomplete action on this bill by Wednesday evening, and we will be able, \nthen, to start working to iron out differences between the House and \nSenate bills so when we come back from the break in August we can pass \nthis bill and do our part to contribute to the timely consideration of \nall appropriations bills in time for the beginning of the fiscal year \non October 1. We have asked Senators to let us know what amendments \nthey intend to offer. We hope we can handle these amendments \nexpeditiously.\n  There was one amendment laid down yesterday by Senator Byrd that \nwould add over a billion dollars to different accounts in the bill. We \ncan take that amendment up. I am advised that Senator Byrd will be \ncoming to discuss that amendment and other issues that are involved in \nthis legislation later in the day. Until that amendment can be disposed \nof, we have an opportunity for other amendments to be called up. We can \nset aside the Byrd amendment and consider other amendments if it is \nagreed to.\n  I looked at the list. There are 29 amendments that we know about. \nMost of them are being offered by Senators on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle. We hope we can have the cooperation of all Senators to \nexpeditiously consider the legislation and not drag out the \nconsideration of amendments.\n  I thank my friend, the Senator from Nevada, for working with us to \nlook at ways to expedite the consideration of this bill. I appreciate \nhis assistance, advice, and counsel in this process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Byrd has said, as the distinguished \nmanager of the bill has noted, that he has no objection to moving to \nanother amendment. The only caveat would be that at 3:30, or whenever \nwe reconvene after the caucuses, that he be recognized and his \namendment recur. That would give someone at least an hour and a half or \nthereabouts to work on their amendment.\n  As I indicated to the distinguished majority leader, we are in the \nprocess of hotlining. We do have a list of amendments. I am going to \nstep off the Senate floor now and make some calls and see if we can get \nsomeone to come over.\n  There was some understanding that Senator Byrd would have the floor \nthis morning, but that is not the case now. So maybe someone could come \nover when there is a relative quiet time, before the rush at the end of \nthis bill takes place sometime later this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we appreciate the advice and information \nthat the distinguished Democratic whip has offered us. We do hope \nSenators will come now and call up amendments. In the expectation that \nwill be the case, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Byrd \namendment be set aside, and that Senator Byrd's amendment recur when we \ncome back after our caucus recess today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1318\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1318.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To appropriate $20,000,000 to the Office for Domestic \n Preparedness to be used for grants to urban areas with large tourist \n                              populations)\n\n       On page 58, strike line 6 and all that follows through page \n     59, line 17, and insert the following:\n     any other provision of law, $2,908,000,000, which shall be \n     allocated as follows:\n       (1) $1,750,000,000 for grants pursuant to section 1014 of \n     the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (42 U.S.C. 3711), of which \n     $500,000,000 shall be available for State and local law \n     enforcement terrorism prevention grants: Provided, That no \n     funds shall be made available to any State prior to the \n     submission of an updated state plan to the Office for \n     Domestic Preparedness: Provided further, That the application \n     for grants shall be made available to States within 15 days \n     after enactment of this Act; and that States shall submit \n     applications within 30 days after the grant announcement; and \n     that the Office for Domestic Preparedness shall act on each \n     application within 15 days after receipt: Provided further, \n     That each State shall obligate not less than 80 percent of \n     the total amount of the grant to local governments within 45 \n     days after the grant award;\n       (2) $30,000,000 for technical assistance;\n       (3) $750,000,000 for discretionary grants for use in high-\n     threat urban areas, as determined by the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security: Provided, That no less than 80 percent of \n     any grant to a State shall be made available by the State to \n     local governments within 45 days after the receipt of the \n     funds: Provided further, That section 1014(c)(3) of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act of 2001 (42 U.S.C. 3711) shall not apply to these \n     grants;\n       (4) $20,000,000 for discretionary grants for use in urban \n     areas with large tourist populations, to be used as \n     determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security; and\n       (5) $358,000,000 for national programs:\n     Provided, That none of the funds appropriated under this \n     heading shall be used for the construction or renovation of \n     facilities: Provided further, That funds appropriated for \n     State and local law enforcement terrorism prevention grants \n     under paragraph (1) and discretionary grants under paragraphs \n     (3) and (4) of this heading shall be available for \n     operational costs, to include personnel overtime and \n     overtime.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment deals with our efforts to \nsecure hometowns. First, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nHomeland Security Subcommittee for their efforts to bring a responsible \nbill to the Senate floor. As I have said to both the chairman and \nranking member of this subcommittee, I think the bill's biggest problem \nis simply a lack of money. They did not have an easy task. The \nsubcommittee did not have an easy task. The full Appropriations \nCommittee did not have an easy task with this new subcommittee, created \nas a result of the 9/11 terror act.\n  The subcommittee allocations this year have made it a challenge for \neach subcommittee. Unfortunately, the budget that Congress passed this \nyear has made it nearly impossible to address all the needs of our \nNation's emergency responders.\n  A recent report, sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, and \ndirected by Warren Rudman, who, of course, we know is a longtime \nSenator from the State of New Hampshire, found that our Nation will \nneed an additional--let's round it off to $100 billion--basically what \nhe said is more than $98 billion over the next 5 years to meet all of \nour hometown safety needs, an additional $20 billion each year.\n  Because of this fact, I am on the floor today to offer an amendment \nthat will attempt to address one of the areas that I believe we have \nnot sufficiently addressed; namely, the tourists that come to many of \nour Nation's cities.\n  The United States is home to some of the most visited and cherished \ncities in the world. I applaud my friend, the distinguished President \npro tempore of the Senate, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, for coming up, in the supplemental bill we just passed, with \n$50 million to promote tourism for the United States. The State and \nlocal governments in our country will make far more than what we spend \nby advertising, by promoting places in America for people to visit.\n  I am always stunned when Senator Ensign and I have our ``Welcome to \nWashington'' meetings every Thursday morning. People come to Washington \nfrom all over Nevada, and a large number of them say: I have never been \nto our Nation's Capital before. They have been other places. I am \nalways amazed when someone says: Yes, I have been to\n\n[[Page S9682]]\n\nLondon. I have been to Paris or Mexico City but never Washington, DC. \nWashington, DC, is a beautiful city. It is our Nation's Capital. \nCertainly we should be proud.\n  Not only do we have landmarks, such as the Washington Monument, the \nLincoln Memorial, the Capitol, the White House, the beautiful Mall, but \nthings are being built all the time to entice people to come here. It \nis too bad we do not do a better job of promoting tourism for our \ncountry because people who come to Washington, DC, see amazing things. \nIf they have been here before, they see new things when they come back.\n  Now under construction is the American Indian Museum. It is going to \nbe a beautiful place on our Mall. In recent years, of course, we have \nadded places to visit, i.e., the Franklin Roosevelt Memorial, which is \na tremendous piece of work. They did a wonderful job in laying out the \nfour terms this man served as President of the United States--the four \ntimes he was elected as President of the United States.\n  One of the most moving items on that Mall is a memorial that was \nrelatively recently constructed, the Korean Memorial, especially at \nnighttime. Those soldiers are lined up in their ponchos, with their \nrifles on their shoulders. You can just see them in the ``coldest \nwar,'' as the Korean war is referred to.\n\n  There are lots of places to visit in America. We should do everything \nwe can to get more people to come here.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Alaska for working it out so we \ncould have this money to promote the United States.\n  Whether you visit the Nation's Capital, go to Disney World or \nDisneyland, or go to Chicago, the so-called windy city that is really \nnot as windy as some might think--it is an extremely pleasant place, if \nyou are not there in the wintertime. Chicago is a wonderful place. I \nwas so impressed when we went to the National Democratic Convention \nthere. I really didn't look forward to going to Chicago. I had been \nthere basically in the wintertime at the airport, and those are not \npleasant experiences. One of the nicest times my wife and I ever had \nwas at that convention. Chicago is a beautiful city, with many places \nto see. And it is a place for visitors, for tourists.\n  America's tourist destinations are a source of pride for our country, \nas well they should be. Our national parks are places that are the envy \nof the rest of the world.\n  But in our cities, emergency responders take just as much pride in \nprotecting those temporary residents, those tourists who make their \nhomes in hotel rooms rather than apartments and houses. So we should \nmake sure these emergency responders have the resources to protect us \nwhen we travel, just as they would protect us in a permanent residence.\n  This may not seem like a major issue, but let's look at some of the \nfacts. Tourists account for a sizable number of people in many of our \nlarger cities. There are 15 cities with more than 45,000--45,000--hotel \nrooms, based on a study by Smith Travel Research. Each hotel room \naccounts for several visitors every day. That means just the hotel \nrooms in each of these cities is responsible for at least 100,000 new \npeople, additional people each day. That is the size of a small city.\n  In Nevada, we have cities that have a lot of people in them: Reno, \nLas Vegas, Henderson, and North Las Vegas; and then there are places \nthat are pretty small by most standards.\n  Las Vegas has about 130,000 hotel rooms. We have been very fortunate. \nThe occupancy has been good even after September 11. In fact, in Las \nVegas an average of about a quarter of a million people stay in our \nhotels each day. During most weekends, it approaches 350,000 or \n400,000. That tourist population of only 250,000 on a weekday in Las \nVegas represents a city the size of Savannah, GA, or Tallahassee, FL.\n  This amendment would correct that deficiency. It would correct it in \nOrlando, Las Vegas, New York, Dallas, and other places where we have a \nlot of tourists on a daily basis. This amendment would set aside a \nrelatively small amount. This bill is more than $25 billion but not $30 \nbillion, so this is $20 million for these areas where there are a lot \nof tourists. This amendment would not take away from any other \nworthwhile program. My amendment would simply add $20 million to the \nmoney we are already spending for homeland security. The Rudman report \ntold us we need to give our emergency responders almost $100 billion in \nthe next 5 years. So this means unless we do something we are giving \nour emergency responders $100 billion less than what they need. This \namendment is a start to addressing the shortfall.\n  We have a long way to go, but we have to start somewhere. It is quite \nclear this amendment is direct. It provides an additional $20 million \nto be distributed to cities with large tourist populations. The \namendment has no offset. I have indicated that. There are very few \nopportunities for offsets in this bill since almost all programs are \nunderfunded. So trying to take money from one place and putting it \nsomeplace else in this bill certainly would not be fair.\n  I repeat, according to a task force chaired by Senator Rudman, \ncurrent homeland security funding levels will fall $98 billion short of \nthe needs of our Nation over the next 5 years. From the standpoint of \nsimply directing a message to the American people, it makes sense that \nwe take care of people no matter where they are or why they are there. \nWe have to make sure people who are emergency responders--police, fire, \nemergency medical personnel--have the money to take care of people, \nwhether they are tourists or permanent residents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we appreciate the Senator from Nevada \nbringing this issue to the attention of the Senate by offering this \namendment. His amendment goes directly to the provision of the bill \nthat provides funds for discretionary grants to high threat urban \nareas. In the bill, we provide an appropriation for this program of \n$750 million. These are discretionary grants to be made by the Office \nfor Domestic Preparedness to those who are considered by the Department \nto be in need of these funds to better protect the security of these \nspecific urban areas.\n  This is a discretionary program, and we are hoping that by defining \nthe criteria to be considered by the Department, we help encourage the \nselection of sites. But we don't pretend to make those decisions here \nin the Senate or in the Congress. These are administrative decisions. \nIf we got into the business of deciding which areas of the country, \nspecifically which urban areas of the country should be entitled to \nthese funds, it would be a very unwieldy process.\n  What we have done is to try to define the kinds of characteristics \nthat should be taken into account by the administration as they make \ndecisions in the awarding of these grants.\n  Vulnerability is one of those criteria. I will read now from the \ncommittee report, page 48, where this grant program is described. It \nsays:\n\n       The Committee expects the [Office for Domestic \n     Preparedness] to allocate these funds no later than 30 days \n     after enactment of the act. No less than 80 percent of \n     discretionary grants provided to any State shall be obligated \n     to local governments within 45 days of the State's receipt of \n     funds. In making grants to State and local governments, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall take into consideration \n     credible threat, vulnerability, population, cooperation of \n     multiple jurisdictions in preparing domestic preparedness \n     plans, and identified needs of public agencies. The grants \n     may be made to single or multiple jurisdictions in the same \n     urban area.\n\n  It is our judgment that the inclusion of the word ``vulnerability'' \nand also the statement with regard to population gives the Secretary \nthe discretion to consider popularity as a tourist destination to be a \nvulnerability or characteristic that is consistent with vulnerability. \nLarge hotels, as the Senator from Nevada describes, are, of course, \nvulnerable. A transient population that is not acquainted with the area \nas a resident might be could make them more vulnerable to a terrorist \nact. And while obviously the Senator has a legitimate concern for these \ncommunities and wants to be sure they are considered when the \nDepartment divides this money among other municipalities and local \ngovernment agencies around the country, we think it is provided for \nalready in the bill.\n  More importantly, to go back to the statement I made at the outset of \nmy\n\n[[Page S9683]]\n\nresponse to the Senator, we don't need to get into the business of \ntrying to convert this discretionary program into one where the \nCongress, by massaging the language and putting in additional criteria, \nends up taking the discretion away or limiting the discretion that \nought to be exercised by the Department. Many characteristics are going \nto be considered, but we hope we won't try to tie the hands of the \nadministrator so tightly that this program loses its significance.\n  High threat urban areas, we recognize, are entitled to Federal \nsupport in managing the threats to those communities, and it may cost \nmore than States or local jurisdictions can manage to more fully and \nsuccessfully protect the security interests of people in those areas.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will reject the amendment. Specifically, the \namendment is an add-on of $20 million without any offset. So it is \nsubject to a point of order and would have to overcome that point of \norder. The Senate could waive the point of order, could approve a \nmotion to waive, but that would be one way to join issue with this.\n  I think our discussion here--the Senator's comments and the response \nI have made--can be interpreted as a colloquy that clarifies the \nauthority the Secretary has to give consideration to the special \nvulnerability of cities and other localities that have a high degree of \ntourist population. He specifically mentioned Las Vegas. I am thinking \nspecifically, too, about the gulf coast of Mississippi where we have a \nlarge number of tourists who come visit the resort areas and the \ntourists hotels, other attractions along the Mississippi gulf coast.\n  That area might very well also qualify for consideration as a \nvulnerable area for funding under this provision. I think the Senator \npoints out something the Secretary and the Office for Domestic \nPreparedness specifically ought to consider as they make these grants \nto so-called high-threat urban areas. These are discretionary, but we \nthink the criteria we have listed and described in the committee report \nand in the colloquy we have had on this amendment the Senator offered \nwill help guide the Department in making these grants and enable them \nto fully consider the vulnerability of areas with high density or high \nlevels of tourist population. We think that would be appropriate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. How much is set aside in this bill for these discretionary \ngrants?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Seven hundred and fifty million dollars.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the statement of the Senator from \nMississippi. I am one of Secretary Ridge's fans. I came to Washington \nwith him in 1982. Under very trying circumstances, I think he has done \na very good job.\n  I also want to elaborate on some of the problems we have in Nevada. \nWe have about 2.4 million people who come from overseas to Las Vegas. \nSo on any given day there are 60,000, 70,000, 80,000 people from other \ncountries in Las Vegas. I misspoke before when I said there were \n130,000 hotel rooms; it is really closer to 150,000 hotel rooms in Las \nVegas. It goes without saying that in those hotel rooms, which average \nabout 90 percent occupancy, there are a lot of extra people.\n  I do appreciate not only what the Senator from Mississippi said but \nhow he said it. Probably $750 million for discretionary grants isn't \nenough, but it is certainly a lot of money. I hope those who work with \nSecretary Ridge will do what they can to protect people in destinations \nno matter how they got there or why they are there. Whether you are a \nresident of Georgia and you are in Nevada or a resident of Nevada and \nyou are in Georgia doing a little tourist work, you still have to be \nprotected; and whether you are from England or Memphis and you are in \nLas Vegas, there is still a requirement to take good care of the people \nwho are there, make sure they have police and fire protection and \nemergency medical personnel.\n  So I appreciate the work of the subcommittee, as I stated when I \nstarted my remarks. We have a problem in America today with security \nneeds, and we in Congress have an obligation to do what we can to help \nState and local governments with problems that are national in scope. \nThis is one area where we need help.\n  At an appropriate time, after further discussion with the chairman \nand ranking member of the committee, I will make a determination as to \nwhether this amendment should require a vote or whether I want to work \non the basis of the colloquy with the Senator from Mississippi and \nwithdraw the amendment. That decision will be made at a subsequent \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada. We will continue to work with him to \nbe sure that we take into account the observations he has made, and the \nurban areas in his State will be dealt with fairly by the Office for \nDomestic Preparedness in the consideration of the allocation of grants \nfrom this fund.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am going to propound two unanimous \nconsent requests which we understand have been cleared on both sides of \nthe aisle, and I make this request at the suggestion of the majority \nleader.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the committee substitute amendment be \nagreed to and considered as original text for the purpose of further \namendment, provided that no points of order be waived by virtue of this \nagreement; provided further that the amendments that are now pending be \nmodified so they are considered as pending to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:30, \nthe Senate stand in recess until 3:30 this afternoon. This would allow \nall Senators to attend an important briefing this afternoon, in \naddition to the party lunches at 12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if it would not be \nto the benefit of especially the Senator and myself, but the Senate \ngenerally, if as soon as the Senator completes these unanimous consent \nrequests we go into recess at that time rather than wait until 12:30?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection to that and so modify my request in \nthat way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9683-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That is our intention. We hope to have the \ncooperation of all Senators.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S9684]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1317\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Nation's eyes have been turned to war \noverseas. The country's focus has been on the daily battles in Iraq. On \nthe news almost daily there have been reports of American soldiers \nstill dying. While the President arguably says that the mission in Iraq \nhas been accomplished, the mission to protect our citizens here at home \nis far from complete.\n  Immediately after September 11, 2001, there was a great outcry for \nstrengthening homeland security. Congress responded, infusing $40 \nbillion into the war on terrorism--including efforts to better protect \nour citizens here at home. But since those early weeks after that clear \nSeptember morning, the momentum has slowed. The pace has slackened. \nHomeland security initiatives are falling behind.\n  Just last month, former Senator Warren Rudman chaired a task force at \nthe Council on Foreign Relations that examined investments in police, \nfire, and emergency medical teams. This blue ribbon panel included \nNobel laureates, U.S. military leaders, former high-level government \nofficials, and other senior experts, and was advised by former White \nHouse terrorism and cyber-security chief Richard Clarke. The results of \ntheir examination should shake this Congress from its homeland security \nslumber and especially it should shake the White House from its slumber \nand from its focus elsewhere.\n  The task force found that, nearly two years after 9/11, the United \nStates is drastically underfunding local emergency responders and \nremains dangerously unprepared to handle a catastrophic attack on \nAmerican soil, particularly one involving chemical, biological, \nradiological, nuclear, or high-impact conventional weapons. The panel \nconcluded that, if the Nation does not take immediate steps to better \nidentify and address the urgent needs of emergency responders, the next \nterrorist incident could be even more devastating than 9/11.\n  Imagine that, more devastating than September 11, 2001.\n  The underlying legislation before the Senate is the Fiscal Year 2004 \nHomeland Security Appropriations bill. It provides more than $28 \nbillion for a variety of programs, from better border security to \nnatural disaster response efforts. But while this is a step forward, \nthe legislation does not accomplish enough. It does not provide the \ninvestments in protections that the Nation so desperately needs.\n\n  This fact is not the fault of Subcommittee Chairman Thad Cochran or \nAppropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens. The hand that they were \ndealt was poor from the start. But that does not mean that this Senate \nneeds to settle for less than is needed.\n  The amendment that I have offered would add critical dollars to some \nof our Nation's most vulnerable entities. It is a responsible $1.75 \nbillion approach to begin to close the enormous gaps in America's \nhomeland security. The amendment to which I address my remarks at this \ntime is about fulfilling our promises to the American people. After 9/\n11, Congress passed the Patriot Act. It passed the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act. It passed the Aviation and Transportation \nSecurity Act. It passed the Enhanced Border Security Act. And the \nPresident signed these with great fanfare. But when it comes to \nsecuring our homeland, the administration follows the same pattern. The \nPresident seems to be satisfied with rhetoric, which doesn't cost \nanything, rather than working with Congress to provide real dollars.\n  The amendment I offer today is intended to fulfill the promises made \nfor securing our homeland. It would add a total of $1.75 billion for \ncritical homeland security programs. The amendment adds: $602 million \nfor Maritime and Land Security, including port security and transit \nsecurity; $729.5 million for first responder funding for our police, \nfire and emergency medical personnel, including funding for high threat \nurban areas; $238.5 million for security improvements at U.S. borders \nwith Canada and Mexico; it includes 100 million for air cargo security; \nand it includes $80 million for protections at chemical facilities.\n  With public warnings ringing in our ears from Secretary Ridge that \nanother terrorist attack is inevitable, some may argue that our \nhomeland security needs seem endless, and therefore the Congress must \nset limits. I agree that they are endless and that Congress must set \nlimits. That is why this amendment focuses on the specific expanded \nhomeland security missions that Congress has authorized since 9/11, but \nthat the administration has yet to adequately fund. Unfortunately, the \nbudget resolution endorsed by this White House has forced us to exclude \nfrom the bill some funding that both the Congress and the President \nhave recognized as being real needs. This amendment focuses on those \ncritical shortfalls. It puts the beam on those critical shortfalls. It \nputs the microscope right down to their level.\n  One of the mysteries about the President's budget is the budget for \nthe Transportation Security Administration, or TSA. TSA was created by \nthe Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001 and was supposed \nto focus on securing all modes of transportation. Yet the President's \nbudget includes only $86 million or 2 percent of the TSA budget for \nmaritime and land security. Yes, I said 2 percent--just 2 percent of \nthe TSA budget for maritime and land security. The rest of the \nPresident's budget request is for aviation security and for--you \nguessed it--administration. What about securing our ports? What about \nsecuring our trains? What about securing our railroad tunnels, and our \nsubways? What about buses or securing the trucks that carry hazardous \nmaterials?\n  In fact, the President's budget requests 2.5 times more for \nadministering the TSA bureaucracy than he does for securing the \nNation's ports, trains, trucks, and buses.\n  This amendment would add $602 million for maritime and land \ntransportation funding. To his credit, Chairman Cochran provided $295 \nmillion for these programs. My amendment further enhances the good work \nSenator Cochran has begun.\n  On November 25, 2002, the same day that the President signed the \nHomeland Security Act, he also signed the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act--MTSA, putting in place significant new standards for \nimproving the security of our 361 ports around the Nation. On July 1, \nthe Coast Guard published regulations putting the MTSA into action.\n  During the Senate Appropriations Committee's homeland security \nhearings last year, one witness, Stephen Flynn, noted that the Nation's \nseaports:\n\n     . . . are the only part of an international boundary that the \n     federal government invests no money in terms of security. . . \n     . Most ports, the best you get is a chain link fence with \n     maybe some barbed wire.\n\n  Let me repeat that. The Appropriations Committee of the Senate \nconducted hearings last week, anent homeland security. And we heard \ntestimony from mayors, Governors, and from seven Department heads--I am \ntalking about Departments in the President's Cabinet--and from FEMA as \nwell. And one of these witnesses was Stephen Flynn. Here is what he \nsaid about the Nation's seaports. He said:\n\n       [They] are the only part of an international boundary that \n     the federal government invests no money in terms of security. \n     . . . Most ports, [he said] the best you get is a chain link \n     fence with maybe some barbed wire.\n\n  Comforting? Is that comforting?\n  Consider that U.S. ports receive 16,000 cargo containers per day and \nmore than 6 million containers per year. Consider the fact that U.S. \nports are home to oil refineries and chemical plants that process \nnoxious, volatile chemicals. Consider the additional fact that there \nare 68 nuclear powerplants located along U.S. waterways and that the \naverage shipping container measures 8 feet by 40 feet and can hold \n60,000 pounds. Consider, further, that a ship or tanker transporting \ncargo can hold more explosives and dangerous materials than could ever \nbe smuggled in an airplane or a truck crossing a land border.\n  Yet despite the clear danger, the best port protection the American \npeople\n\n[[Page S9685]]\n\nhave is a chain link fence? It is unfathomable--unfathomable--why we \nhave not insisted this amendment be signed into law months ago.\n  This amendment would make sure that more than a chain link fence is \nprotecting the Nation's ports. Not too much to ask, is it?\n  The Coast Guard has estimated that it will cost the ports $5.4 \nbillion during the next decade to implement the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act standards, including $1.1 billion this year; and yet the \nPresident did not request one thin dime--can you believe it, not one \ndime--for port security. The amendment that I will offer, which is at \nthe desk, would increase port security grant funding from the $150 \nmillion contained in the bill by $460 million, thus providing a total \nof $610 million for this program.\n  The Commandant of the Coast Guard testified before the House \nauthorizing committee on June 3, 2003, about the implementation of the \nMTSA legislation. Here is what he said:\n\n       The regulatory impact on the maritime industry will be \n     significant, and the time line for implementing the new \n     robust maritime security requirements is exceptionally short.\n\n  However, the administration, while aggressively supporting Federal \nsecurity funding for the aviation industry, has failed in four straight \nspending requests to include a single penny--not one red cent--for port \nsecurity grants even though 95 percent of all non- North American U.S. \ntrade enters our 361 ports around the Nation. This is serious.\n  During our Homeland Security Subcommittee hearings this spring, I \nasked Under Secretary Asa Hutchinson why there was no money requested \nin the President's budget for port security grants and Mr. Hutchinson \ntestified that he believed it was the responsibility of the port \nindustry--the responsibility of the port industry. Yet the port \nindustry's first priority is moving goods through ports as quickly as \npossible because that increases profits. There must be incentives if we \nare to realistically expect the ports to improve security.\n  This year, the Transportation Security Administration received over \n$1 billion of applications from the ports for the limited funding that \nwas approved by Congress last year. There clearly is a demand from the \nports, for help to harden physical security to reduce the Nation's well \ndocumented seaport vulnerabilities. These are vulnerabilities that are \nwell documented.\n  The amendment also addresses other important homeland security needs \nauthorized by the Maritime Transportation Security Act--and yet again \nnot funded.\n  The Maritime Transportation Security Act requires that vessel and \nport facility owners prepare and submit security plans to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for the purpose of deterring a \ntransportation security incident. The Coast Guard serves as the lead \nagency to develop a National Maritime Transportation Security Plan and \nreview all security plans prepared by vessel or facility owners or \noperators.\n  To meet requirements set in the MTSA, vessel and facility owners must \nsubmit security plans to the Coast Guard for review and approval by the \nend of calendar year 2003. But, once again, the administration provided \nno funding to the Coast Guard for this effort or for tracking \ncompliance with the plans in its fiscal year 2004 budget request.\n  In recent testimony, Coast Guard Commandant ADM Thomas H. Collins \nacknowledged that the Coast Guard still needs an additional $70 million \nand 150 full-time employees by this fall to review and approve more \nthan 10,000 security plans by vessel and facility owners. My amendment \nprovides the money.\n  My amendment also provides $57 million for public transit grants. \nAccording to a Mineta Transportation Institute study, one-third of \nterrorist attacks worldwide have been on transportation systems, and \ntransit systems are the mode most commonly attacked. According to the \nstudy, nine surface transportation systems were the target of more than \n195 terrorist attacks from 1997 through the year 2000.\n  The approximately 6,000 transit agencies in the United States provide \nmore than 9 billion trips each year representing 43 billion passenger \nmiles, and yet the administration has provided minimal funding for \ntransit security.\n  The General Accounting Office, the GAO, recently reported that:\n\n       Insufficient funding is the most significant challenge in \n     making transit systems as safe and secure as possible.\n\n  Mr. President, at just 8 of the 10 transit agencies surveyed, the \nGeneral Accounting Office identified the need for security improvements \nestimated at $700 million. The General Accounting Office also found \nthat:\n\n       TSA has yet to exert full responsibility for the security \n     of any transportation mode other than aviation.\n\n  The chemical attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995 is a sobering \nreminder of how a terrorist attack on one transit system can affect \nhuman lives, the economy, and confidence in our transit systems. How \nmany times do we have to witness attacks on transit systems in other \ncountries before we secure our transit systems?\n  This amendment would provide $57 million in direct grants to the \nTransportation Security Administration to help with that shortfall.\n  The amendment also would add $15 million to the $10 million already \nprovided in the bill for intercity bus grants. A study conducted by the \nMineta Transportation Institute, ``Protecting Public Surface \nTransportation against Terrorism and Serious Crime,'' found that during \nthe period 1997 through 2000, 54 percent of the worldwide attacks on \nsurface transportation systems were against buses or bus terminals.\n  Almost 800 million people ride over-the-road buses annually, more \nthan the airlines and Amtrak combined. Intercity buses serve \napproximately 5,000 communities daily, compared to roughly 500 each for \nthe airlines and Amtrak. Intercity buses serve those who truly need \npublic transportation--rural residents who have no other public \ntransportation alternatives and urban residents who must rely on \naffordable public transportation.\n  Given the important role that intercity buses play in the Nation's \ntransportation system and their susceptibility to terrorist attacks, \nthey must be protected.\n  One of the most glaring funding deficiencies identified in the recent \nRudman report is the poor support for first responders. The Rudman \nreport estimated that America will fall approximately $98.4 billion \nshort of meeting critical emergency responder needs in the next 5 \nyears, if current funding levels are maintained. But the legislation \nbefore the Senate does not even maintain that current funding level.\n  While the underlying bill provides first responder funding at a level \nthat is $303 million above the President's request, it is $434 million \nbelow the level that the Congress approved for the current fiscal year.\n  In the nearly 2 years since the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001, States and cities have worked to better protect the Nation. They \nhave undertaken critical assessments of vulnerabilities. They have \nprovided specialized training to police officers, firemen, and \nemergency medical teams. They have attempted to close as many gaps as \npossible to prevent another terrorist attack. But unfortunately, for \nmany communities, they have had to act without the support of the \nFederal Government.\n  A March 2003 analysis by the U.S. Conference of Mayors reports that \ncities are spending an additional $70 million per week on personnel \ncosts alone, to keep up with security requirements. Mayors and \ngovernors have contacted almost every Member of this Congress, if not \nall, practically begging for additional funds to help defray the huge \nexpenses for homeland security. Their requests come at a time when \ncities, counties, and states are in the worst financial shape in \ndecades. Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn stated earlier this year that \n``We've dug deep into our own pockets. Now we really need the help of \nthe Federal Government.'' This is taken from the Los Angeles Times of \nFebruary 23. They have come hat in hand for help, and we ought not turn \nour backs on them.\n  My amendment adds $500 million to the budget of the Office of \nDomestic Preparedness for first responders. Specifically, it provides \n$250 million for\n\n[[Page S9686]]\n\nState grants, and $250 million for high threat urban areas, bringing \nthe total for high-threat urban areas to $1 billion. This amendment \nprovides funds to meet the immediate and growing needs that State and \nlocal first responders have for funds for equipment, training, homeland \nsecurity exercises, and planning.\n  The needs are great.\n  According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National \nFire Protection Association, only 13 percent of fire departments have \nthe equipment and training to handle an incident involving chemical or \nbiological agents.\n  Forty percent of fire department personnel involved in hazardous \nmaterial response lack formal training in those duties.\n  Only 10 percent of fire departments in the United States have the \npersonnel and equipment to respond to a building collapse.\n  Funds would be used to purchase: Personal protective equipment for \nfirst responders--chemical resistant gloves, boots, and undergarments; \ninteroperable communications equipment, portable radios, satellite \nphones, batteries; detection equipment--equipment, to monitor, detect, \nsample, identify and quantify chemical, biological, radiological/\nnuclear and explosive agents; medical supplies and pharmaceuticals; \nand, training costs and paying overtime costs associated with \nattendance at training for emergency responders, emergency managers, \nand public officials.\n  My amendment also provides $79.5 million for grants for interoperable \ncommunications equipment. This bill currently includes no funds \nspecifically for interoperable communications equipment. This amendment \nproposes to add $79.5 million, the same amount that was provided in \nfiscal year 2003.\n  The initial $79.5 million was a small step in starting the process of \nintegrating and coordinating communications equipment between and among \nfirst responders firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical \npersonnel--a deficiency uncovered during the 9/11 attacks on the United \nStates.\n  Only one-fourth of all fire departments can communicate with all of \ntheir rescue partners. The Council on Foreign Relations' June, 2003 \nstudy on homeland security needs estimated that the need for \ninteroperable communications equipment funding was $6.8 billion over \nthe next 5 years.\n  The amendment also provides an additional $150 million for fire \ngrants. The Senate bill includes $750 million for assistance to \nfirefighter grants, roughly the same amount as last year. This \namendment would add $150 million for fire grants, which would bring the \ntotal to $900 million, the level authorized. Our fire departments need \nthis money.\n  On average, fire departments across the country have only enough \nradios to equip half the firefighters on a shift, and breathing \napparatuses for only one third.\n  In the 3 years this program has been in existence, it has become one \nof the best run programs in the Federal Government. This Senate should \nfund this program at the authorized level. Our frontline defenders \ndeserve no less.\n  In October of 2001, the President signed the Patriot Act which called \nfor tripling the number of border patrol agents and Customs and \nimmigration inspectors on the northern border. In May of 2002, the \nPresident signed the Enhanced Border Security Act, which authorized \nsignificant new investments in border patrol agents and facilities. The \ngoals with regard to Customs inspectors and border facilities cannot be \nmet with the limited funding that was made available for this bill.\n  The amendment I have offered adds $100 million for improvements to \nour border ports-of-entry. There are 197 ports-of-entry on our Nation's \nland borders. Of those, 128 out of 197 are stretched across our 5,525 \nmile long border with Canada.\n  The remaining sites are along our highly-trafficked border with \nMexico.\n  Most facilities along the U.S.-Canada border were constructed either \nas part of the Civilian Conservation Corps program during the Great \nDepression or in the period between 1950 and 1965. These older \nfacilities are having an increasingly difficult time meeting the energy \nand power requirements of today's technology.\n  Along the U.S.-Mexico border, traffic both in people and goods has \nmore than doubled since the last major border infrastructure effort was \nlaunched during the Reagan administration.\n  Trade with Canada has doubled in the last decade, while trade with \nMexico has tripled during the same time frame. However, the facilities \nthrough which trade must flow have not been expanded or enhanced to \nkeep pace with this traffic.\n  A Congressionally mandated study called the ``Ports of Entry \nInfrastructure Assessment Study,'' completed over a year prior to the \ntragic events of September 11, 2001, identified a growing backlog of \ninfrastructure needs at our Nation's border crossings. It specifically \nidentified 822 infrastructure requirements with an estimated gross cost \nof $784 million. That report was completed 3 years ago last month--but \nCongress has yet to seriously begin to address this growing problem.\n  Consistent with the Enhanced Border Security Act and legislation \nintroduced in this body by a bipartisan group of Senators, this \namendment provides $100 million for the new Bureau of Customs and \nBorder Protection to begin addressing this backlog. The funds provided \nin this amendment could be used to replace the trailer--yes, the \ntrailer--that serves as a border port-of-entry in Easton, ME, or to \ncomplete construction of the San Diego fence along the border with \nMexico which was authorized by Congress in 1997.\n  My amendment would also add $138.5 million to hire additional border \nprotection staff to meet the levels authorized in the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  While funding in the Committee bill will allow the Bureau for Customs \nand Border Protection, CBP, to succeed in meeting the Congressionally \nmandated staffing goal for the Border Patrol by the end of this fiscal \nyear, the remaining components of this newly created bureau fall far \nshort of meeting the authorized target.\n  The PATRIOT Act authorizes a total of 4,845 legacy Customs, \nImmigration and Agriculture inspection personnel along the northern \nborder by the end of fiscal year 2004. According to the CBP, it will \nfall far short of that goal. It estimates that it will only have 3,387 \ninspection personnel at the many port-of-entry and other facilities \nthat stretch across the 5,525 mile northern border with Canada. This is \n1,458 personnel short of the authorized and required level.\n  My amendment would provide the $138.5 million estimated to complete \nthe hiring initiative called for in the PATRIOT Act. The funds would be \nused to hire an additional 1,458 inspectors to: enhance our ability to \nconduct inspections of people and goods entering our country to ensure \nthat the people entering the country are authorized to do so; to ensure \nthat the products in the containers are indeed what they are claimed to \nbe and that no dangerous foods, meats, or other products are brought \ninto the country.\n  Another key area of focus is air cargo security. Most Americans would \nbe stunned to learn that, under the President's budget proposal, each \nairline passenger will be screened before boarding a plane. Each \npassenger's baggage will be screened before being loaded on a plane. \nBut commercial cargo on that same plane is left unchecked.\n  The amendment would add $100 million to the Transportation Security \nAdministration's budget. The additional funds proposed in this \namendment would accomplish some key immediate objectives while at the \nsame time laying the ground work for a more comprehensive, multi-year \nplan. Of this amount, $70 million would be provided to immediately \nstrengthen and expand a number of ongoing TSA activities while the \nremaining $30 million would be used to increase research, development \nand testing of screening technologies and other systems.\n  The $70 million would be used for the following purposes:\n  To immediately deploy personnel to the Customs and Border \nProtection's National Targeting Center to develop rules for targeting \nsuspicious packages on passenger aircraft and, as resources are \nprovided, all-cargo aircraft; to provide $20 million for approximately \n125 inspectors to be devoted to cargo screening. These personnel would \nbe trained to inspect cargo operations, but in keeping with TSA's \nAviation Operations strategy to cross-train its personnel, they would \nbe trained for additional duties in future fiscal years; to provide $15 \nmillion to advance\n\n[[Page S9687]]\n\n by one-year the TSA plan to expand canine screening teams for limited \ncargo screening. These activities would be co-located at airports \ncurrently using TSA canine for screening of U.S. mail, and would work \nas a complement to EDS screening at smaller locations; to provide $25 \nmillion to fully deploy the ``known shipper'' and profiling programs \nfor cargo being carried on passenger aircraft; to provide $5 million to \nupdate the risk and vulnerability assessments for cargo operations; to \nprovide $5 million to launch immediately a pilot program to use \nexplosive detection system, EDS, machines at select locations to screen \ncargo.\n  The additional $30 million would be added to the currently budgeted \n$30 million in TSA's research and development account for air cargo \nactivities, doubling the total amount available for research and \ndevelopment within the air cargo pilot program.\n  Finally, my amendment provides $80 million to begin addressing the \nissue of physical security at chemical facilities.\n  Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution has called the lack of \nsecurity at U.S. chemical plants a ``ticking time-bomb.'' The General \nAccounting Office has reported that chemical plants remain vulnerable \nto a terrorist attack. Using data from the Environmental Protection \nAgency, the GAO noted that 123 chemical facilities across the country, \nif attacked, could inflict serious damage and expose millions of people \nto toxic chemicals and gases.\n  There are 3,000 chemical facilities in 49 States that, if attacked, \ncould affect more than 10,000 people each.\n  The General Accounting Office found that the Federal Government has \nnot comprehensively assessed the chemical industry's vulnerabilities to \nterrorist attacks, nor has the Federal Government adequately addressed \nour nuclear vulnerabilities.\n  The Homeland Security Department is responsible for carrying out \ncomprehensive assessments of the vulnerabilities of the key resources \nand critical infrastructure of the United States. The President's \nNational Strategy for Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructure \nand Key Assets identifies chemical plants as part of the Nation's \ncritical infrastructure. We are talking about chemical plants.\n  Unfortunately, this administration has paid lipservice to the issue \nby saying that the Homeland Security Department will take the lead in \nmanaging vulnerability assessments of U.S. chemical facilities, but--b-\nu-t--no funding is identified in this budget to do just that.\n  When I asked Secretary Ridge who was responsible to secure these \nfacilities, he testified that he thought that securing chemical \nfacilities was the responsibility of the chemical industry. Frankly, I \ndo not believe our communities would be satisfied to wait for the \nadministration to wake up to this danger.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that it will cost $80 \nmillion to conduct vulnerability assessments for chemical plants. This \namendment I have offered would provide those resources.\n  Protecting this Nation's communities is not easy. Protecting this \nNations communities is not cheap. And protecting this Nation's \ncommunities cannot wait. After 9/11, Congress passed the Patriot Act, \nthe Maritime Transportation Security Act, the Aviation and \nTransportation Security Act and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa \nEntry Reform Act and the President signed all of these with great \nfanfare. But the President has done little to fulfill the promise of \nthose laws. Now the Senate has before it the funding legislation that \nwill either fulfill the promise of those acts or continue to leave the \nNation vulnerable.\n  We will hear the same old mantra in opposition to this amendment that \nmoney cannot possibly solve the problems facing homeland security. I \nagree that money cannot solve all of our problems but if we fail to \ninvest sufficient funds, if we fail in the effort to protect our people \nas best we can, we will never even begin to address them. The gaps in \nour protections and preparations will continue to grow. We all know \nthese caps exist. And, to be sure, if we know where those gaps are, so \ndo the terrorists know where those gaps are. The American people \nbelieve that we here in Washington are taking care of the problem. We \nmust make every effort to close those gaps.\n  In just a few weeks, America will pause to remember the second \nanniversary of the moments when the airplanes struck the World Trade \nCenters, the Pentagon, and the Pennsylvania field. We again will \nremember the mothers and fathers, the brothers and sisters, the \nfirefighters, the police officers, the ambulance drivers. We will \nremember all of those who lost their lives in those tragic moments. And \nwe should remember those who saved our lives when they sent that plane \ninto the Pennsylvania fields. But as we remember the lives of all \nthese, we owe them more than high-sounding rhetoric. We owe them our \nbest judgment. We owe them rational, responsible action. We owe them a \nlegacy that may truly save lives and prevent another terrorist attack \nfrom happening.\n  I urge all Members to be mindful of their solemn duty to ``provide \nfor the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the \nBlessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity'' as we debate this \nimportant legislation.\n  I have gone to considerable lengths to speak concerning my amendment. \nI urge Senators to support the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that certain Senators have their names added \nas cosponsors: Senators Lieberman, Cantwell, and Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I welcome the cosponsorship of other Senators--all \nSenators for that matter. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia for his cooperation in the development of \nthis bill that is now before the Senate. His assistance and \nparticipation in the hearings, the review of the President's budget \nrequest, our meetings with administration officials to fully understand \nthe priorities as they saw them, and, in many ways, his experience and \njudgment in helping guide the development of this bill were very \nessential to the success we had in getting it to this point. His \nsupport in getting it through the committee and subcommittee was \nessential and very important.\n  This amendment, as the distinguished Senator has pointed out, will \nadd money for many different areas of spending in the legislation that \nwe have presented. Of course, it is because there are many needs there. \nThere are many ways we can allocate and spend resources to try to \nupgrade our capability of protecting our Nation's homeland. So there is \nno end to the list of ways we could spend additional funds.\n  What we have tried to do, though, is be guided by the limitations \nthat have been imposed on the committee by the budget resolution. We \nhave a limited amount of money to spend in this bill. In fact, the \namount we have been allocated to spend is $1 billion more than the \nPresident's budget request that was submitted to Congress earlier. So \nthis bill provides $29.326 billion. We have tried to allocate it among \nall the competing needs that we have come to understand through our \nreview of the budget request and the information we have been able to \nobtain as to what our needs are and what the highest priorities are, \nand that is what this bill reflects: the judgment of the Appropriations \nCommittee of the priorities that exist and how we can best use the \namount of money that is allocated to this committee for this next \nfiscal year, keeping in mind that we have already appropriated funds in \nthe year we are in now, fiscal year 2003.\n  We have also added a substantial amount of money for homeland \nsecurity in the supplemental appropriations bill that was just recently \npassed by the Senate and signed by the President. Therefore, since this \namendment proposes to add another $1.75 billion to the bill that is \nbefore us with no offsetting suggestion of where the money would come \nfrom, I will be constrained to make a point of order against the \namendment because it provides spending in excess of the subcommittee's \nallocation in violation of the Budget Act. Before doing that, let me \nmake a few observations about the Senator's comments on some specific \nprovisions in the bill.\n\n[[Page S9688]]\n\n  Facilities along the land borders, which the Senator discussed, are \nmaintained under the General Services Administration, and funds for \nupgrading, maintaining, and replacing facilities are funded through the \nGeneral Services Administration and the appropriations bill that has \nthat as part of its jurisdiction.\n  This committee does not have GSA jurisdiction. What we do have is the \nresponsibility of trying to accommodate the deployment of facilities to \nimplement the U.S. visitor and immigrant status indicator technology. \nThis is a new program. It is to be deployed upon land ports of entry, \nand funds are included in the committee bill for that purpose.\n  In addition, the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has \nundertaken to hire additional inspectors to be deployed on these \nborders, to enforce the new rules and to better protect us from people \nwho come across the border who may be a threat to the security of our \nhomeland.\n  Our indications from the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection are \nthat over 4,000 inspectors have been added to the workforce since \nSeptember 11, 2001. That has increased coverage at these ports of entry \nby 25 percent. Over 2,600 inspectors are on the northern border, \ncompared to about 1,600 prior to September 11. There are 613 Border \nPatrol agents who are assigned to the northern border compared to 368 \nbefore September 11. Commissioner Bonner says he plans to have 1,000 \nagents on the northern border by October of this year. So when the new \nagents who are funded in this bill are counted, are included, there \nwill be over 11,600 Border Patrol agents in fiscal year 2004. That is \nfunding already in this bill.\n  We added additional staffing in the wartime supplement. We put in the \nsupplemental $75 million for additional northern border and maritime \nports of entry personnel. This was in addition to the money that was \npreviously appropriated for this fiscal year for new personnel. We also \nincluded $25 million to transfer Border Patrol agents to the northern \nborder. It is an important new undertaking, and we are cooperating with \nthe administration in trying to meet those needs.\n  The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection can only hire so many \npeople in any one year. This bill includes the maximum number of new \nborder agents who can be absorbed in one year.\n  We also think it is important to preserve the Department's \nflexibility to assess its staffing needs nationwide. We should not come \nin and say they have to hire 1,000 more than they planned to hire this \nyear. We have to leave to the good judgment of the administrators how \nthey can absorb and find the qualified people to hire, how they can \ntrain them in their new duties and deploy them to the places where they \ncan be used. I think it would be a mistake at this point for the Senate \nto try to superimpose our judgment about a detail of that kind.\n  We have the same goal. We are on the same team with this \nadministration. We have to listen to the statements and suggestions \nthey make to us about the funds they can use and what they need to do \ntheir job within the limits that we have. We have to allocate the funds \naccording to the priorities as we see them.\n  Up to this point in time, it is the judgment of the committee at \nleast that the funding we have made available for border security \nagencies, for personnel to carry out the missions of the USA PATRIOT \nAct, which the Senator mentioned, and other authorizing legislation is \nfunded in the bill to the extent that it is possible to be funded in \nthe bill.\n  In the case of the Transportation Security Administration, the \nadditional funding suggested in the amendment is $100 million for \nscreening of air cargo. First, the authorizing committee assessed the \nneeds for new authorities and how the responsibilities for screening \nair cargo would be changed to meet the new threats. Congress responded \nby passing the Air Cargo Security Improvement Act, S. 165. It \nauthorizes the development and deployment of something called a known \nshipper database, strengthening security enforcement and compliance \nmeasures for indirect air carriers and implementing mandatory security \nprograms for all cargo carriers.\n\n  The Transportation Security Administration has undertaken a \ncomprehensive, strategic plan for air cargo security. It is based on \nthreat assessment and risk management.\n  As I understand it, there are three elements to the approach of the \nTransportation Security Administration. They strengthen the current \nknown shipper program to verify shipper legitimacy. They have developed \na cargo prescreening and profiling system that targets shipments based \non a set of guidelines to indicate which shipments may be suspicious. \nThey have a targeted inspection system to identify suspicious cargo \nutilizing explosive detection systems, explosive trace detection, \ncanine detection, and other approved methods for inspecting air cargo.\n  This comprehensive approach is consistent with the Department's \napproach in securing containers that cross our borders by all modes of \ntransportation, and the funding that was requested in the President's \nbill has been respected. The bill we have before the Senate provides \n$60 million. Ironically, it is $30 million more than the President \nrequested for this function.\n  The Transportation Security Administration, according to my \nunderstanding, can use this money. But this amendment that has been \noffered by the Senator from West Virginia would add an additional $100 \nmillion in addition to what is already in the bill. I am not sure the \nadministration can use that and use it effectively.\n  The amendment has additional money for grants for public transit \nagencies, for enhancing security against chemical and biological \nthreats. We already have $71 million for the Science and Technology \nDirectorate to develop and deploy chemical, biological, and nuclear \nsensor networks throughout the country, including public transit \nfacilities. That would duplicate and be over and above what is already \nbeing spent to try to make sure that we deploy the right kind of \ndefenses to this kind of threat.\n  Again, I think it is important for us to work with the administration \nand say: Okay, we have so much money that has been allocated to us to \nspend for homeland security. How can we best spend that money right \nnow? How much do they need this year? What can they use? What are the \nhighest priorities? Where do we need to spend the money first?\n  The amendment the Senator has offered also increases port security \ngrants by $460 million, as he pointed out. We already have $150 million \nin the bill for port security grants, and this is in addition to $365 \nmillion provided in 2002 and 2003.\n  Of the $365 million already provided by the Congress, only $260 \nmillion has been obligated by the administration. So think about this: \nWe have a proposal to add $460 million to an account where the money is \nstill there and has not been obligated that has previously been \nappropriated. How much can be spent is something that has to be taken \ninto account as well, not how much we can appropriate. That is not \ngoing to be a measure of the success of this bill or whether or not it \nhas been thoughtfully expended to protect our security. We have to make \nsure it can be used and that it can be used thoughtfully, consistent \nwith a plan that has been developed by the administration.\n\n  The Transportation Security Administration can only obligate about \n$150 million a year because assessments of ports have to be conducted, \nthey have to be given some kind of priority, and then an application \nprocess by the ports for the funds has to be analyzed, assessed, and \ncareful decisions need to be made. It cannot be just a rush to apply \nfor a grant: Hey, they have a new fund in Washington. If you are a port \ndirector, if you get your application in now and put pressure on the \nadministration, you may get some funds.\n  Will it be consistent with the overall national plan? Will it be \ntargeted where the threats are the most imminent and most troublesome, \nwhere the money really needs to be spent? Are\n\n[[Page S9689]]\n\nother agencies going to be able to take up the slack in helping to deal \nwith threats that are known to exist in our ports?\n  There is a capacity only to spend so much money at one time. That is \nthe point. The rush to spend money can put the agency in disarray, can \ngive a false sense of security to the people in the country, saying, \nlook, we spent $460 million in addition to what had already been \nappropriated. But that may not actually help improve our security.\n  There is no doubt there will be a need for these funds later. There \nwill be a need to increase security at our ports over and above what we \nare doing in this fiscal year or next fiscal year--and not just in \nports but in all modes of transportation. But we need to take a \nmeasured, thoughtful approach, and weigh the funding provided for the \nsecurity of our Nation's homeland security needs. That is what we tried \nto do, take a balanced approach and make an assessment based on \nlimitations we have and the realities we face.\n  There is a proposal in this amendment to add $70 million to the Coast \nGuard operating expenses account to increase the total funding of the \nCoast Guard. The bill already provides $4.719 billion for Coast Guard \noperating expenses. This is $12 million more than the President has \nasked for operating expenses, excluding environmental compliance and \nrestoration, and reserve training, which are funded separately.\n  Included in the bill for acquisition, construction, and improvements \nis the amount of $1.035 billion which is $238 million above the \nPresident's budget request.\n  Funding to implement the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) \nwas not requested in the President's budget because that Act had not \nbeen passed until after the President's budget was prepared. No request \nwas made for funding to implement MTSA in the fiscal year 2003 \nsupplemental either. We know funding for the implementation of the MTSA \nis a priority for the Coast Guard. If we had additional funds \navailable, we would agree to increased funding in fiscal year 2004. But \nthe bill has been very generous to the Coast Guard. We believe funding \nfor the implementation of MTSA should be included in next year's budget \nrequest by the President.\n  The Office for Domestic Preparedness is targeted in this amendment \nwith a funding increase. Mr. President, $729.5 million is provided in \nthis amendment to increase funding for grants to State and local \ngovernments.\n  One of the first calls I made when I realized it was going to be my \nobligation to chair this subcommittee was to Warren Rudman, our former \ncolleague from New Hampshire, who has been, with Gary Hart, part of a \nstudy to assess our homeland security needs. They had published reports \nand made some presentations in New York, Council on Foreign Relations, \nand other places.\n\n  One of the things I remember former Senator Rudman suggesting to me \nis, it is impossible to know precisely what is needed and how much it \nwill cost. That is something I have kept in mind.\n  The fact is, this is not an exact science. We have to use our \njudgment, make choices, understand that we cannot do everything at \nonce. What we are trying to do is maintain a base level of preparedness \nthrough this program.\n  The Department is going to be better able to assess true needs once \nthe States have had a chance to submit their updated homeland security \nstrategies. We cannot just assume right now the States can identify all \nof the areas where they need to spend the money, which local \ngovernments continue to have needs, and which ones ought to be funded \nfirst.\n  In my judgment, we run the risk of being irresponsible if we increase \nfunding over and above an amount that can logically and systematically \nbe provided through the grant program to State and local governments.\n  We will have provided through the funds recommended in this bill \nalmost $9 billion through the Office for Domestic Preparedness and the \nfirefighters assistance grants since September 11. A lot of money has \nbeen spent already. In addition to those expenditures and the funding \nin this bill, the Senator suggests we ought to spend another $729.5 \nmillion.\n  We are suggesting the funds appropriated in this bill, in this \naccount, for this fiscal year, are a responsible level of funding for \nfirst responders, given the other needs and other demands that come \nunder the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The amendment also suggests we earmark $80 million for information \nanalysis and infrastructure assessment, a directorate, to conduct \nassessments for chemical facilities. I am impressed with the concerns \nreflected in this suggestion. We do not have funding made available to \nindividual industries involved in the chemical business to make these \nassessments. I am not enough of an expert in that business to know the \nassessments that have already been made and the security arrangements \nthat many of these businesses and industries already have. One thing we \nneed to keep in mind is that self-interest has motivated business and \nindustries, and anyone who owns a business or a home should do what \nthey can to protect themselves, to be sure their workers are protected, \nto be sure their families are protected. We all feel that obligation. \nIt is not like everyone has been assuming they had no responsibilities \nfor self-protection.\n  Businesses and industries have done a great deal, invested huge sums \nof money, to protect their own assets.\n  The suggestion is we need to give them more money to do some more \nanalysis, to do some more assessments.\n  There may be a need for additional critical infrastructure \nassessment; however, this bill already provides $293.9 million for key \nasset identification, field assessments of critical infrastructures, \nand key asset protection implementation to help guide and support the \ndevelopment of protective measures to improve the security of \nindustrial facilities and assets.\n  Of the amount provided for critical infrastructures, $199.1 million \nis made available for critical infrastructure and vulnerability \nassessments of the highest priority infrastructures and assets. But we \nneed the benefit of the advice of the administration, those who are in \ncharge of the programs, to tell us what those are. This amendment that \nis offered by my friend from West Virginia says it is the chemical \nindustry. That is the only earmark in this part of the bill--$80 \nmillion for chemical facilities. There may be other facilities that are \nmore vulnerable or that would cause more damage and displacement of \nAmerican businesses than the chemical facilities would if they were \nunder a threat of terrorist attack.\n  The priorities that have to be made and assigned have to be based on \na combination of factors: threat, vulnerability, and risk analysis. And \nwe have to leave that up to the administration. I don't feel competent \nto make that kind of decision. I don't know of any Senator, if this \namendment were to be voted on this afternoon, who could just walk in \nhere and decide should that be an earmark or should it not. But it is \nfolded into this big amendment and we are asked to decide whether to \ntarget $80 million for just these kinds of facilities. Who is to know \nwhether that is a good decision or not, if they have not been through \nthe hearings, they have not had the opportunity to assess the other \noptions?\n  So I think it is an unfair choice that we present to other Senators, \nto have them make that decision right now. Why can't the administration \nmake that decision? I think they are better suited to make that \ndecision than we are right now. We have to work with them and not make \nprejudgments.\n  The prioritization is going to be based on a lot of factors. There \nare 14 critical infrastructure areas--including the chemical sector--5 \nkey asset categories that further break down into about 99 distinct \nsegments, all of which must be considered based on changing threat \nassessments. So this is not necessarily an effective way to improve our \nNation's security, just to earmark money for one particular kind of \nindustry requiring a specific amount of funds to be spent. Why not $180 \nmillion? Why not just $40 million? Where does $80 million come from? I \ndon't know. Who knows?\n  So without the corresponding analysis that helps advise the Senate, \nit is a mistake for us to be asked to make this kind of choice.\n  We are telling the terrorist organizations, aren't we, that we are \ngoing to spend the money in this sector? We are going to target this \nsector and emphasize it and make it a high priority, but\n\n[[Page S9690]]\n\nnot the others? Is that a good way to make decisions in this area or \nshould we let the administration and the infrastructure protection \nexperts decide where the threats really are? What does the intelligence \nshow as to where the threats are? These need to be taken into account.\n  This amendment, adding $1.75 billion to the bill, violates the Budget \nAct because it does not offset the spending, it exceeds the \nsubcommittee's allocation that is given to us, and at the appropriate \ntime I will be constrained to make a point of order against the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know we have been notified that one \nSenator is on the way over here to speak on this amendment before the \nSenator makes his point of order. We have at least one, maybe two \nSenators who wish to speak on this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senator Cochran has said there is no end to \nthe list of homeland security needs. He is absolutely correct on that. \nWe could list these security needs from now until Kingdom come. \nAdditional needs can be found. So he is correct. But that does not mean \nthe amendment I have offered is excessive. It does not mean the \namendment is excessive. It is targeted to specific activities that \nCongress has approved.\n  As I said in the beginning, I named several pieces of legislation \nthat have been approved and signed into law by the President, some of \nthem with great fanfare. So Congress has approved these acts, and the \nPresident has signed them into law.\n  The chairman is correct in stating the progress we have made in \nhiring Border Patrol agents and inspectors. But that leaves us nearly \n1,500 inspectors short of the goal established in the PATRIOT Act. The \nPresident signed that law.\n  Are we serious or are we not serious about meeting the goals set \nforth in these acts? My amendment would provide the resources to meet \nthe goals that have been set forth in the acts by Congress, the acts \nthat have been signed by the President.\n  It has also been noted that the bill already includes $150 million \nfor port security grants. But the Coast Guard has estimated that it \nwill cost $1.1 billion in just the first year for the ports to \nimplement the security plan that the Coast Guard issued on July 1, \npursuant to the Maritime Transportation Security Act.\n  Who signed that act? The President signed it. Who issued the \nregulations? The Coast Guard. Are they serious or not about port \nsecurity? Is the President serious? The amendment would result in less \nthan $1 billion of total funding. This is less than the Coast Guard's \n$1.1 billion estimate.\n  Our distinguished chairman has said he tried to include a base level \nof funding for grants to equip and train our police, fire, and medical \npersonnel. And I compliment the chairman. He has done a masterful job \nin writing the provisions in the bill we have before us, a masterful \njob in distributing the limited amounts that have been provided to the \nchairman and to the committee for distribution. He has sought to \nexercise good judgment. He has done so--with the limitations.\n  The problem is, we do not have enough funds to appropriately allocate \nto meet the needs of the country. But I do not believe that \nestablishing a base level of funding is enough. When a nonpartisan \norganization such as the Council on Foreign Relations estimates a $98 \nbillion shortfall over the next 5 years, I simply cannot understand why \nthe committee funding level is enough. It is $434 million below the \nlevel available in fiscal year 2003.\n  With regard to funding chemical facilities security, the chairman \nnotes there is significant funding in the bill for securing critical \ninfrastructure. Yet, nearly 2 years after 9/11, we have no details--\nnone--from the administration describing how these funds would be used. \nSecretary Ridge testified to the subcommittee that he believes that \nsecuring chemical facilities is the responsibility of the chemical \nindustry.\n  I do not believe we should continue to wait for the administration to \nget its act together. We should not allow the budget resolution to \nartificially limit our ability to address known vulnerabilities in this \ncountry. Our citizens do not know about budget resolutions. Our \ncitizens do not know about 302(b) allocations. But they do know they \nfeel vulnerable to terrorist attacks that Secretary Ridge has said are \ninevitable.\n  Mr. President, the full committee conducted careful and extensive \nhearings last year. We had seven Department heads here before the \ncommittee. The committee membership was there. The committee hearings \nwere well attended. Senator Stevens and I carefully selected witnesses \nto appear before those hearings. There were Governors who appeared. \nThere were mayors who appeared. There were members of county \ncommissions who appeared. First responders appeared. Firemen, \npolicemen, health personnel appeared at those hearings. And we have \ngone over those hearings carefully. The staff has gone over those \nhearings and painstakingly gleaned from the rich testimony that was \nsubmitted by these public officials and public servants. Based on those \nand subsequent hearings, we decided that these are needs that ought to \nbe addressed. And so I have tried to address these needs in the \namendment.\n\n  As I say, the amendment adds $1.75 billion. That would fund 42 hours \nof the Defense Department expenditures. The Defense Department will be \nspending $1 billion a day on the military--$1 billion a day. They are \nspending a billion dollars a week in Iraq. Why can't we spend $1.75 \nbillion on the protection of our own people, and our industries here, \nthe protection of our own infrastructure; $1.75 billion to defend the \nAmerican people, to defend our infrastructure, to defend our ports, to \nmeet the needs of our ports, $1.75 billion? We spend a $1 billion every \n24 hours on our defense budget. Yet when it comes to defending this \ncountry, defending its infrastructure, then we say it is too much.\n  I hope Senators will support the motion to waive the point of order. \nAs I close my remarks at this point, I thank the distinguished chairman \nfor his characteristic courtesy and also for his proficiency, his \nprofessional handling of this bill and the hearings. He attended the \nhearings, started them on time, and asked incisive questions. He is \nalways fair to those on the minority side. I have nothing but praise \nfor him. And I thank the cosponsors of the amendment. I must state \nagain, however, that I feel the need for adding appropriations as I am \nattempting to do here.\n  A stitch in time saves nine. There is no question in my mind but that \nwe are underfunding the homeland security needs. The Senator has done \nthe best he could with the limited amount of moneys, but there is no \ngood reason why we can't add moneys to this bill. We have to overcome \nthe point of order, of course. There is a 60-vote point of order. That \nis difficult. But Senators may come to rejoice in having voted for this \namendment. Who knows?\n  I see the distinguished Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the ranking \nmember of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee and \nof the full committee, the Senator from West Virginia, for his \nconstancy in sounding the alarm. He is the Paul Revere of the homeland \nsecurity debate. Because every time we come to the floor to debate and \nconsider provisions that we believe will make our country safer, the \nSenator from West Virginia is there sounding the alarm.\n  This time I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nrespond to that alarm which he has once again sounded, because his \namendment reflects a full and complete understanding of what we know, \nwhat the experts tell us is absolutely essential to meeting the \nhomeland security needs of our Nation.\n  As has already been referred to in many different settings, the \namendment the Senator presents to us contains the best thinking of \npeople who\n\n[[Page S9691]]\n\nhave considered our vulnerabilities and have honestly assessed what it \nwill cost so we can look into the eyes of our constituents and say: We \nhave done the best we knew to do.\n  Recently the independent Homeland Security Task Force of the Council \non Foreign Relations, a task force chaired by former Senator Warren \nRudman, issued its third report regarding the state of our homeland \ndefense. While the report noted that we had made progress and that \npositive action in a number of areas had occurred since September 11, \nthere was still much to be done and we remained woefully unprepared.\n  The report, ``First Responders: Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously \nUnprepared,'' says it all in its title. It reminds us as to how much \nwork we truly have in front of us if we intend to address these needs \nhonestly and to equip our frontline homeland defenders with the \nresources they desperately need.\n\n            Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously Unprepared\n\n       The United States has not reached a sufficient national \n     level of emergency preparedness and remains dangerously \n     unprepared to handle a catastrophic attack on American soil, \n     particularly one involving chemical, biological, \n     radiological, or nuclear agents, or coordinated high-impact \n     conventional means.\n\n  How much more specific and dramatic a conclusion from independent \nexperts do we need to have before we act to pass overwhelmingly the \namendment that has been presented to us?\n  The report also emphasizes the pivotal and primary role our first \nresponders play in our national homeland defense:\n\n       America's local emergency responders--\n\n  We are talking about our police officers, our firefighters, our EMTs, \nand others who are on the front line, who need to be given the \nresources that will equip them to prevent horrific attacks, as well as \nto respond--\n\n     will always be the first to confront a terrorist incident and \n     will play the central role in imagining its immediate \n     consequences. . . . the United States--\n\n  Namely, the U.S. Government, not the New York State government, or \nthe New York City government, or the Buffalo government, or the West \nVirginia government, but the United States Government--\n\n     has both a responsibility and a critical need too provide \n     them [our first responders] with equipment, training, and \n     other necessary resources to do their jobs safely and \n     effectively.\n\n  Again, I don't know how much more specific we need to be. The efforts \nof these first responders in the minutes and hours following an attack \nwill be critical to saving lives, reestablishing order, and preventing \nmass panic.\n  The report speaks about the heroic police and fire professionals who \nentered the World Trade Center on September 11. They acknowledge what \nall of us saw: that our emergency responders will be there; they will \nanswer the call; they will perform their duties. What will we do for \nthem?\n  In providing just a few examples of the needs of these brave police \nofficers and firefighters and EMTs that are unmet, I have picked a few \nvery representative, dramatic examples from the report:\n\n       Two-thirds of our fire departments do not meet the \n     consensus fire service standard for minimum safe staffing \n     levels.\n       On average, fire departments across the country have only \n     enough radios to equip half the firefighters on a shift, and \n     breathing apparatuses for only one-third. Only 10 percent of \n     fire departments in the United States have the personnel and \n     equipment to respond to a building collapse.\n       Most States' public health labs still lack basic equipment \n     and expertise to respond adequately to a chemical or \n     biological attack. Seventy-five percent of State laboratories \n     report being overwhelmed by too many testing requests.\n       Most cities do not have the necessary equipment to \n     determine what kind of hazardous materials emergency \n     responders may be facing.\n       Police departments in cities across the country do not have \n     the protective gear to safely secure a site following an \n     attack using weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  I read these statistics, but I also know firsthand from speaking to \npolice officers and firefighters, police chiefs and fire commissioners, \nand others throughout New York who tell me exactly what we were reading \nhere from this report.\n  Now, I have to say it is troubling to me that, while we know we have \nnot done enough to equip and fund and provide the resources needed by \nour first responders, we are seeing, because of budget constraints, \ncities and counties cutting back on their personnel. According to the \nInternational City-County Management Association, the average number of \nfull-time, paid police employees for jurisdictions between 250,000 and \n500,000 residents, today, is 16 percent below the figure for 2001. Why \nis anyone surprised by that? We have seen countless stories about the \nbudget cutbacks that States and counties and cities are experiencing.\n\n  Police departments and fire departments are not immune. In the city \nof New York, after the heroic, incredible performance of these brave \nfirefighters, they watched helplessly as fire stations were closed. So \nthis is something that we know is happening. So not only are we failing \nto fully fund our first responders, we are seeing the numbers cut back.\n  When you think about what this report tells us and what the estimate \nis as to what is necessary for us to protect ourselves, clearly, we are \nasking that we honestly assess where we are and the funding that is \nneeded. The report says we need approximately $100 billion over the \nnext 5 years--approximately $20 billion a year for 5 years. We spend $5 \nbillion a month in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are asking for 4 months of \nthe expenditures of those two military actions and postconflict \nactivities to make sure we are safe here at home.\n  These preliminary figures are based on the assessments that are \ncoming directly from first responders and from communities. They were \ndeveloped in partnership with the Concord Coalition and the Center for \nStrategic and Budgetary Assessment. It may be conservative, but it is \nthe best assessment we could find.\n  First, it assumes, however, that State and local governments will \ncontinue to spend somewhere between $26 billion and $76 billion of \ntheir own funds for homeland security over the next 5 years.\n  Second, in looking at specific needs, particularly the need for a \ncommunications system that actually works and includes everybody, the \ntask force erred on the side of conservative figures they obtained from \ncommunications policy experts.\n  Third, many law enforcement associations could not even assess their \nown needs. They don't have time to stop and do a survey or try to hire \na consultant. So they did the best they could in assessing what they \nthought their needs were. Clearly, as the task force has pointed out, \nwe should have a thorough national needs assessment. Under Senator \nByrd's leadership, he did hold very thorough hearings out of which we \ngot some specific information, and we need to continue a comprehensive \nneeds assessment so that we do know what our needs are so that we can \nbetter plan how to meet them.\n  We certainly would not do for our men and women in uniform what we do \nfor our men and women in uniform at home. I have the honor of serving \non the Armed Services Committee. It is a painstaking process to \ndetermine what our troops need and how to best plan that they can be \nprotected. I am very proud of that process.\n  I think it is time we did the same for our front-line defenders, our \nsoldiers in the war against terrorism here at home--primarily our \npolice officers, our firefighters, and our EMTs.\n  Among the many things we need to be doing, the task force concludes--\nand I agree--is to create those interoperable communications systems so \nthat first responders can communicate seamlessly across borders, \nbetween police and firefighters, and certainly across borders of \njurisdictions. We need to extend nationally the Emergency 911 system. I \nam very proud to be working with my colleague from Montana, Senator \nBurns, on groundbreaking legislation to extend the E-911 system. I \nthink it will certainly move us forward as long as we fund it.\n  We need to enhance our urban search and rescue capabilities. We need \nto enhance our public health preparedness, particularly by \nstrengthening and expanding the quality and number of laboratories that \ncan track diseases, that can quickly diagnose some kind of biological, \nchemical, or radiological event.\n\n[[Page S9692]]\n\n  This report reflects what I hear from all over New York and, of \ncourse, from all over the country, whether you are in Los Angeles, \nwhere every time the terror alert goes to orange, it costs that city \n$1.5 million a week and another $1 million a week to protect the Los \nAngeles International Airport; or whether you are in Denver, a city \nthat has incurred many millions of dollars for emergency preparedness \nand has purchased mobile emergency equipment but still doesn't have an \nadequate communications system; or whether you are in Douglas County, \nNE, which needs resources to buy protective suits for first responders, \nthis is a national problem. Certainly in New York, I know firsthand how \ninadequately funded many of our brave men and women are.\n\n  I know that under the leadership of the chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee, whom I commend, the committee has \nworked very hard to come up with a good bill and, given the budgetary \nconstraints under which the committee has operated, they have done an \nincredible job.\n  The problem is that the budget resolution we adopted last spring did \nnot adequately reflect the real costs of homeland security. That is why \nthe Senator from West Virginia has an amendment which more honestly \nassesses those needs. It provides an additional $1.7 billion: $729.5 \nmillion for first responders; $602 million for maritime and land \nsecurity; $238 million for border security; $100 million for air cargo \nsecurity; and $80 million for chemical facility security.\n  It is hard to argue with the EPA's own figures that we have 123 \nchemical facilities located throughout the Nation that have toxic \nworst-case scenarios where more than 1 million people would be in the \nso-called vulnerable zone and could be at risk of exposure to a cloud \nof toxic gas.\n  Remember the terrible accident in Bhopal, India? Remember that? We \nhave 123 chemical facilities that could produce this kind of \nextraordinary horror.\n  We have 600 facilities that could threaten between 100,000 and 1 \nmillion people, and 2,300 more that would threaten between 10,000 and \n100,000 people in these so-called vulnerable zones.\n  When I read statistics such as that, it has to make one feel \nvulnerable, and it certainly makes me, as a Senator with responsibility \nfor my constituents, sick at heart. I do not think any of us want to \nsee these scenarios ever come true and, thank goodness, we have been \nspared that since September 11.\n  But that is not the way a great country plans to defend itself. If \nthat were the case, we could have shut down our entire military. After \nthe War of 1812, we could have just said forget it. After the Civil \nWar, we could have said forget it. We could say we do not think we will \never have anything bad in the world happen again, so let's just send \neverybody home. Let's just let the tanks rust. Let's just give up \npreparing for the worst-case scenario which will more than likely make \nit possible for us to avoid such an occurrence.\n  That is what we are doing when it comes to homeland security. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimated it will take $80 million to \nconduct vulnerability assessments associated with our chemical plants. \nThis amendment provides the money for that purpose.\n  Regarding the first responder funding in the Byrd amendment, there is \nadditional money for State and local grants, $250 million, and I \nespecially appreciate an additional $250 million for high-threat urban \narea grants; $150 million for FIRE Act grants so we can fund the \nprogram fully at the authorized level; and, finally, $79.5 million for \nthe interoperable communications equipment I have talked about in this \nChamber so many times since September 11.\n  We learned tragically that our police and fire departments could not \ntalk with each other. We learned that people coming to our rescue to \nassist us could not communicate with the New York City police and fire \ndepartments.\n\n  Later in the debate, I will talk about State and local grants and how \nimportant they are and how strongly I believe the Department of \nHomeland Security and Secretary Ridge should disburse those funds using \na threat base rather than a per capita formula. Right now I want to \nunderscore how important it is to get more money into this high-threat \nurban area category.\n  In January, I gave a speech at the John Jay College of Criminal \nJustice in New York City. In that speech, I made some recommendations \nand released a survey about what I had found as I surveyed cities and \ncounties throughout my State: Seventy percent of New York cities and \ncounties had not received any Federal homeland security funding since \nSeptember 11. Since January, some money has come forward; more has been \nappropriated.\n  But I was in Buffalo, NY, on Sunday speaking with the mayor. They \nhave not received a penny of the money we have appropriated. It is \neither tied up in Washington or it is tied up in the State capital.\n  Either explanation is, to me, unacceptable. We need to do more, and \nin that speech I called for a domestic defense fund.\n  In March, I proposed that we provide direct funding and we include $1 \nbillion for high-threat urban areas. Later that month, I offered an \namendment to the budget resolution that would have provided funding for \nthe domestic defense fund, including the $1 billion for high-threat \nurban areas for fiscal year 2003. Unfortunately, the amendment was \nnarrowly defeated but at least we began a dialog and a debate about \nhigh-threat areas with critical infrastructure, with dense populations.\n  We are making some progress and, in fact, the supplemental we \nconsidered for funding the action in Iraq in April did include $700 \nmillion for high-threat urban areas. I thank my colleagues for that \nfunding. I think we all recognize how critical that funding is.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has begun to allocate high-threat \nfunding based on factors such as credible threat, vulnerability, \npopulation, mutual aid agreements, and identified needs of public \nagencies. And many communities, not just New York and Washington but \nHouston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Kansas City, New Orleans, \nMemphis, Cleveland, Charleston, among others, across our country have \nreceived this high-threat funding. This will help us shore up our \ndefenses against our most vulnerable targets.\n  Regarding New York, I would give anything if terrorists did not have \nsuch an interest in New York but we have to accept that reality. New \nYork is such a symbol of our Nation. It is such an incredibly diverse, \ndynamic place, the most fascinating and exciting city in the world, and \nit is going to draw that kind of attention. Therefore, we need the \nsupport we have been getting and that the Byrd amendment will provide \nin additional funding that, believe me, we can put to good use.\n  In recent articles that have appeared in national newspapers, such as \nUSA Today, I read about communities that got homeland security funding \nand did not know what to do with it. I said: If you really do not know \nwhat to do with the money, send it to New York; we have more needs than \nwe can possibly meet.\n  If we are serious about defending our Nation, then we have to be \nserious about putting money behind that commitment. What the Byrd \namendment does is to say very straightforwardly: We have not done \nenough. We may have done all we could within the constraints of the \nbudget resolution, and for that I commend the chairman and the ranking \nmember, but the budget resolution was inadequate.\n  We do not have a budget resolution for our military and occupational \nexpenses in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are not even in the budget. \nThere is not one penny. We passed a $398 billion defense budget last \nweek and there is not one penny for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We did not worry about the budget resolution when it came to \nsupporting our troops. We did what we thought we had to do. Well, we \nshould do the same when it comes to protecting us at home. How on Earth \ncan we do less?\n  So, yes, we have made some progress since we were attacked. How could \nwe not? How negligent would we have been if we had not done what at \nleast we have started to try to achieve in providing more support? But \nwe have not done nearly enough.\n  History will judge us harshly if we are found wanting when it comes \nto defending ourselves on our own soil.\n  So I hope for the sake of our country, for the sake of our citizens, \nwe will listen to former Senator Warren Rudman\n\n[[Page S9693]]\n\nand the task force, we will listen to the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, and we will do our duty, we will vote for the Byrd \namendment, and we will send a clear signal to friend and foe alike that \nwe intend to prevent, in every way possible, any further terrorism on \nour shores. But if anyone dares to take us on, we intend to be ready.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the statement of the Senator from \nNew York. Senator Byrd and I were talking earlier. No State has \nsuffered as did New York as a result of the September 11 incident. We \nall know that. But I bring to the Senator's attention that I offered an \namendment earlier today saying that one of the facts that should be \ntaken into consideration is how many tourists are in the community \nwithin any given time. Of course, New York is a tourist-oriented \ncommunity. People are there all the time for various reasons--\nconventions, just wanting to see the Big Apple. Even today that is in \nfact the case.\n  One of the facts I brought to the attention of the Senate the other \nday is that in Las Vegas, on any given day, there are about 300,000 \ntourists, and the Senator would agree, I am sure, that the people of \nLas Vegas--law enforcement, fire, emergency medical responders, first-\nline responders generally--have as much of an obligation to take care \nof someone visiting Las Vegas from New York as they do someone who \nlives there on a full-time basis. The Senator would agree with that, \nwould she not?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I certainly would agree with the Senator from Nevada. I \nbelieve that is a factor that Secretary Ridge should consider in a \nthreat-based formula where we have large crowds of people who come for \nattractions such as those that the Senator has in Las Vegas or we have \nin New York City and certainly other places around our country. That \nshould be taken into account because our police officers, our \nfirefighters are constantly on duty because there is a constant stream \nof people coming from all over the world to enjoy the attractions.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask the Senator this: One of the other \nconsiderations I brought to the attention of the Senate is that on any \ngiven day in Las Vegas there are about 75,000 people from foreign \ncountries. But in looking at some of the statistics I have, even though \nwe have almost 2\\1/2\\ million people who visit Las Vegas yearly who \ncome from other countries, New York City--not the State of New York but \nNew York City--has 5\\1/2\\ million people who come from foreign \ncountries to visit. So on any given day in New York City, instead of \nthe 75,000 we have in Las Vegas, the Senator has 150,000, \napproximately.\n  Now, would the Senator agree that someone who is visiting New York \nCity from Turkey, Germany, or Japan, the first-line responders have an \nobligation to make sure they are taken care of in the event of an \nemergency just as someone who is a New York resident?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I certainly do agree with that.\n  Mr. REID. I hope there is some consideration given to people who are \nin New York City, Las Vegas, all of the States--Orlando, FL, where we \nhave Disney World--that have these large numbers of tourists come from \nvarious parts of our country and around the world, and I hope the \nAmerican people understand that. I compliment the Senator from New York \nfor her outstanding statement in bringing to the attention of the \npeople of this country and the Senate the information that only can \ncome from someone who represents the State of New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to thank the very distinguished \nSenator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, on the ringing defense of the \nprovisions that are set forth in the amendment that I and several other \nSenators are cosponsoring. I do not think any Senator could come to \nthis floor with better credentials than those of the Senator from New \nYork, Mrs. Clinton. She represents the State and the city that was the \nhardest hit by the terrorist attacks on 9/11. There is only one other \nState and one other jurisdiction that suffered, but she has made an \nextraordinary plea coming from the experiences that she has suffered as \na result of 9/11.\n  I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate, and she \ncame to my office not once, not twice, not three times but many times \nin support of the appropriations that the Senate was considering and \nthat the Senate finally enacted. She had a great impact on me as we sat \nand talked and as I listened to her recount the problems of her city, \nthe problems of New York City and of New York State that resulted from \nthose attacks.\n  So I thank her for her support of the amendment and say that no one \nin the Senate could have made a finer statement in support, and no one \nin the Senate would better understand the needs the American people \nhave as we try to prepare against any future terrorist attacks. I thank \nher and her staff for the excellent effort they have put into this \nmatter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator from West Virginia and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Byrd \namendment. The Senator from West Virginia has clearly identified that \nthere are inadequate resources being devoted to homeland security, and \nthe paramount concern and responsibility of this body is to protect the \nhomeland. We have to do that. It cannot simply be protected by \nrhetoric. There have to be real resources applied to the task.\n  In the wake of 9/11, this Congress laid out very clearly and very \ndeliberately, after much consideration and consultation, major \nlegislation such as the Transportation Security Act of 2002, the \nEnhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, the \nAviation and Transportation Security Act, and the USA PATRIOT Act. All \nof these legislative pronouncements laid out a framework to secure our \nhomeland and, as Senator Byrd points out, we are not living up to the \nrequirements that were clearly identified by that legislation in terms \nof appropriations.\n  Specifically addressed by Senator Byrd's amendment is a shortfall in \nseaports, Coast Guard, and land transit security of $602 million; \npolice, fire, and emergency medical teams of $729.5 million; security \nat United States borders with Canada and Mexico of $238.5 million; air \ncargo security, $100 million; and chemical facility security, $80 \nmillion.\n  Now, all of these protections are imperative because what we have \ndiscovered from those who wish us ill--terrorist cells--is first they \nare sophisticated; second, they are ruthless; and third, they tend to \nstrike at areas which are the least protected, not the most protected.\n  We have made significant improvements in our air transportation \nsystem in terms of passenger travel, screening passengers, and I do not \nthink most security consultants would say that would be the primary \nroute of a new attack against us. We still have miles to go with \nrespect to seaport security, maritime security, security at the \nborders, air cargo security. Again, given the nature of our opponents, \nour adversaries, it is likely they would look to these places, rather \nthan areas we have reinforced or fortified, to launch another attack.\n\n  The Transportation Security Agency, as we all know, is responsible \nfor all modes of transportation security. Yet the TSA, as I have \nsuggested, has focused almost exclusively on our air transportation \nsystem with passenger travel throughout the United States and \nthroughout the world. With a $4.8 billion budget, TSA has committed \nonly $86 million for maritime and land security activities in this \nbudget proposed by the administration. In contrast, $4.3 billion was \nrequested for aviation security. In fact, the budget requests for \nadministrative costs at TSA, their headquarters and the mission support \ncenters, consist of amounts to $218 million, 2.5 times greater than the \ntotal request for maritime and land security activities.\n  As a result, the budget proposed by the President, the budget Senator \nByrd seeks to amend, does not fully recognize the potential threats to \nour\n\n[[Page S9694]]\n\nports, to our interstate buses, trucks that carry hazardous material, \ntrains, our transit system, chemical factories--and the list, \nunfortunately, is longer.\n  Let me for a moment concentrate on one area of particular concern; \nthat is, public transit. In the last Congress, I had the opportunity, \nresponsibility, and privilege of being the chairman of the subcommittee \nin the Banking Committee that dealt with transit issues. We had several \nhearings with respect to numerous transit issues but particularly with \nrespect to transit security. We found, and the GAO verified, there is a \nhuge demand for resources to protect our transit systems, our subway \nsystems, our bus systems. This bill hardly measures up to that.\n  The Byrd amendment--and I commend the Senator--would increase our \nefforts in transit security by $57 million. Frankly, based upon the \ntestimony I heard last year before my committee, this is literally the \nproverbial drop in the bucket. There are some estimates--one by the \nAmerican Public Transportation Association--that the needs for transit \nsecurity through all the transit systems in this country would amount \nto $6 billion, primarily in the areas of communication, surveillance, \ndetection systems, personnel, and training.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I will state that in the wake of \nthe tragedy of 9/11, there was something remarkable taking place that \nminimized our casualities both in New York City and in Washington, DC. \nParticularly in Washington, DC, the subway system was the major source \nor route of evacuation for literally thousands and thousands of people. \nThis system in Washington has been the beneficiary of a great deal of \nattention. It might be because of the proximity to the appropriators \nbut, indeed, it had effective communications, it had a well-managed and \nwell-trained group of operators, and they were able to move people \nliterally underneath the Pentagon even though that building had been \nattacked. In New York City, the transit operators, these individual \ntransit police officers and station masters, were able successfully to \nevacuate the subways and move people out because of communication \nsystems, because of training, because of the infrastructure already \nthere.\n  Those two systems--New York City and Washington, DC--are some of the \nmost sophisticated in the country. Other parts of the country, other \nareas do not have the communication systems; they do not have the \ntraining; they do not have the expertise. That would go for probably \nevery system, to varying degrees, throughout my country.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, we have a statewide bus system, \nwhich is a good system, but they would be the first to say they need \nmore training; they need more communications equipment; they need \nredundant communication systems in the event of an emergency so they \ncan get through to the operators and the operators can get through to \ntheir dispatchers and controllers. That is just one example of the \ntremendous need for help for transit security.\n  There are approximately 6,000 transit agencies in the United States. \nThese transit agencies provide over 9 billion trips per year, \nrepresenting 43 billion passenger miles.\n  Yet there is very minimal funding in this bill for transit security.\n  Once again, if you believe, as I, that our adversaries are cunning, \nruthless, and will strike at the most vulnerable portions of our \ncountry, transit is a target that I am sure is being considered. We \nhave to do something to protect our riders, the literally millions of \nriders a year.\n  I hope we can support enthusiastically the Byrd amendment. It would \nrepresent a significant increase in our homeland security. It would \naddress the areas that have been neglected in this bill sent to us by \nthe administration.\n  Once again I emphasize, particularly in the area of transit security, \neven if we were to pass the Byrd amendment, if we wanted to ensure that \nall of our transit systems have the most up-to-date equipment and \ncommunications, that all of their personnel were well trained, we would \nbe talking not about an additional several million dollars but we would \nbe talking about literally billions of dollars.\n  I commend the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership. This is \nnot the first time he has come to this floor to argue eloquently and \npassionately that we should defend our homeland. I am sure it will not \nbe the last. I hope we can support this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me express my appreciation to the Senator for his \nsupport of the amendment; more than that, for his steadfast support of \nthe appropriations as we have dealt with this problem time and again on \nthe floor.\n  The Senator, as is Senator Clinton, is a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and his support for this amendment tells a lot. Here is the \nsupport of two Senators on the Armed Services Committee. They have been \non there quite a while. They have seniority.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is an outstanding member of the \ncommittee. I deeply appreciate his support of this amendment. I \nappreciate his patriotism and his eloquence and support of preparing \nthis country against such attacks as it was subjected to on September \n11, 2001.\n  Mr. REED. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Members. \nI thank the distinguished Senator from Mississippi for giving me an \nopportunity to spend a few minutes before making a motion on the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd, to give me a chance to express my views on this amendment and to \nbegin by thanking my seatmate and colleague of these many years for \noffering this amendment. Once again, his eloquence and his leadership \nand his vision are giving this body an opportunity to do something \nright for the American people.\n  We have all felt the sense of anxiety in this country since the \nstartling events of September 11, 2001. There have certainly been no \nlimits to the number of speeches given to the importance of making our \nNation more secure, taking steps to see to it that our airports, our \nharbors, our borders, receive the kind of support and backing needed to \nkeep this Nation as secure as we possibly can be, with the full \nunderstanding that as a nation, an open society, a nation where freedom \nand liberties are extended to all, this is not an easy path to walk--to \nbe an open, free nation and simultaneously to be more secure. How we \nbalance those interests requires a great deal of thought, a great deal \nof work.\n  The Senator is offering a reflection of what has been suggested by \nthe Council on Foreign Relations in the report analyzing where we are \ntoday, 2 years after the events of September 11.\n  To quote the authors of that report, we are ``still dangerously \nunprepared, underfunded for a catastrophic terrorist attack.''\n  I think we ought to take their words to heart and we ought to do what \nwe can to see to it that first responders--our fire departments, our \npolice departments--are going to receive the kind of backing and \nsupport they ought to be getting from the Federal Government.\n  What the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is offering is a \nmodest proposal. The money is not significant, I know that. But when \nyou consider the gap that exists--the Council on Foreign Relations \nsuggests that we are underfunding first responders by more than $98 \nbillion. That is a huge amount of money. But if you go even further, \nreading the report, the number actually is twice that amount when you \nconsider what needs to be done at other levels of government as well, \nto maximize our protection.\n  Unfortunately, we are coming way short of that number. So while we \ntalk about this issue and identify the various problems that exist, \nthis 62-page report, released on Monday, points out that we have a lot \nmore work to do.\n  Senator Byrd has offered us an opportunity to close some of that gap. \nThat is all, it is just some of this gap that will be closed by his \namendment. I am disturbed that we are not going to be doing more. I \nfully support what the Senator from West Virginia is offering, but I \nthink the American public would expect more. I suspect most did not \nhave an opportunity to read this report or even hear news reports about \nit. But\n\n[[Page S9695]]\n\nas certainly as I am standing here today, there are going to be events \nthat will come. I wish I didn't have to say that, but I think all of us \nknow that to be the case. From what we are witnessing in Iraq today, \nwhat we have seen in Liberia, what we have seen in various targets \naround the globe, none of us should operate under the illusion that we \nare going to be immune from any future attacks because of what we have \ndone since 9/11.\n  There are those gathered in places around the globe, as I share these \nwords this afternoon, who are planning to attack this country, whether \nabroad or at home. They are planning it. Be certain of it. They are \ngoing to look for the opportunities to do us great harm and great \ndamage. Any conclusion other than that would be foolhardy. They are \ndoing it, and the question is, What are we doing to see to it that we \nare maximizing the protection of the people we have been charged to \nrepresent?\n  The painful conclusion is that we are not doing enough yet. \nObviously, we cannot do this all at once, but we have a report telling \nus that after 2 years we are still woefully short of meeting those \nobligations. We have an opportunity. We have to make choices here. They \nare not comfortable choices, but we need to make these choices.\n  The time will come when a judgment will be made, and the question \nwill be asked of us: What did you do, when you knew better? You were \nbeing told over and over again that you hadn't done enough yet. What \ndid you do on that day in July, prior to your August break, when you \nwere given an opportunity by the Byrd amendment to invest more \nresources to make these first responders better prepared? Where were \nyou? How did you cast your vote?\n  Because the memories of 9/11, even after just 2 years, seem to be \nfading, it would be a catastrophic and tragic mistake, in my view, not \nto heed the counsel and advice of my colleague from West Virginia and \nstep up and do what is right here and provide backing. I hope for \nunanimous support for this amendment. I cannot think of a more \nimportant or meaningful message we can send that we are prepared to \ntake whatever steps are necessary to maximize the protections of our \npeople within constitutional limitations.\n\n  My fear is the less we do along the lines suggested by the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, the more likely we are to take steps to limit the \nfreedoms of average Americans. That seems to be the direction we are \nheading, to restrain or prevent individuals from doing certain things \nor examining or investigating individual people, rather than to \nstrengthen the first responders and provide more harbor protection, to \nsee to it our harbors and ports are going to be better protected.\n  Senator Byrd is offering us an opportunity, in a modest way, to \nanswer that question that history will ask of us at some point. When \nyou knew you were likely to be attacked again, when you knew you were \nlikely to be victimized by terrorists, on that day in July when you \nwere asked to make a choice to do more, to step to the plate, how did \nyou cast your ballot? How did you represent your constituents when \nconfronted with that choice? Senator Byrd is providing that opportunity \nto us this afternoon, and I hope our colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this amendment to take a modest step, and that is all this \nis, to answer the deep concerns that have been expressed by our former \ncolleague, Warren Rudman, and other individuals who prepared this \nreport for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n  This report is a serious document. These are serious conclusions \nreached by serious individuals who have done their homework. This is \nnot a political document. It is a document that lays out, chapter and \nverse, where the shortcomings are and what needs to be done by this \nNational Government to try to close these gaps. Senator Byrd is \noffering us that chance to do it.\n  I thank him profoundly for this suggestion that he has made to us. I \nam going to have several amendments myself later on in this debate to \ndeal with fire departments across the country to increase, if we can, \nthe resources to see to it they can have the tools necessary to respond \nto the challenges they will see. This amendment is more comprehensive, \nthe amendment being offered by Senator Byrd. We will have other \nsuggestions to make as well. But this is the first opportunity for us \nto say that our memories have not faded.\n  While others may focus on other events as they captivate the \nattention of the media, we remember what happened on 9/11. While there \nis no certainty we can stop it from happening again, we want to take \nthe steps necessary to see to it that we make it that much harder for \nthose who would do us harm to achieve their goals.\n  For those reasons, I strongly endorse this amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to do likewise by casting a vote in favor of the Byrd \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the Byrd amendment provides \nspending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I realize this is not debatable. I shall \nshortly move to waive the point of order, which will be debatable, not \nthat I intend to take long in debating it. But if the Chair will \nindulge me momentarily, I want to thank Senator Dodd for his very \nforceful and cogent and persuasive statement in support of the \namendment. He is extremely eloquent. He intends to follow up this \nstatement after a little while with an amendment of his own. But I \nthank him profusely, without being profuse, for an excellent, excellent \nstatement. I believe his perspicacity will be rewarded in time. I \nbelieve it will be. I know the American people are better off for \nhaving him in the Senate and for the support he has given to this \namendment. I hope the Senate will prevail in support of the statement \nof the Senator from Connecticut.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor purposes of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there debate on the motion to waive?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Mississippi has been \nvery patient today. We have one additional Senator who says he is on \nhis way. I am confident he is. So if the Senator from Mississippi would \nbe patient, he should be here shortly.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to withhold. Of course I will.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, while Senator Nelson is coming to the floor, \nlet me just remind my colleagues that I offered an amendment last \nJanuary to add $5 billion to the omnibus appropriations bill for 2003 \nfor homeland security programs such as port security, nuclear security, \nairport security, and first responders. The White House labeled the \namendment as extraneous spending and the amendment was defeated.\n  So what happened? Ten weeks later, the White House requested a $4.4 \nbillion supplemental. And a month later, Congress approved $5.1 billion \nof supplemental homeland security funding. So the White House was a day \nlate and several hundred million dollars short. All the White House \naccomplished was the delay of critical homeland security investments \nfor 3 months.\n  That was a repeat of the same old tune we heard from the White House \nat the time Senator Stevens and I wrote a letter to the White House and \nto Secretary Ridge urging that there be more money for homeland \nsecurity. Secretary Ridge responded with a letter to Senator Stevens \nand to me saying that the White House believed that our amendment was \nextraneous for the moment and that the White House would be submitting \nits own request in due time.\n  So it seems that whenever we have attempted to offer legislation to \nprotect our own country, to protect the people of the country, to \nprotect the infrastructure of the country, to protect the industries of \nthe country from attack, the administration always says it does not \nneed these moneys and that in due time it will submit its own request. \nAnd so that seems to be the record today.\n\n[[Page S9696]]\n\n  Today we are debating an amendment to add just $1.75 billion for \nhomeland security. And the majority, speaking for the administration, \nsays the amendment is too large. Mr. President, history has a way of \nrepeating itself. The Senate should approve this amendment today. The \nSenate should not wait for the White House to recognize real homeland \nsecurity vulnerabilities. Delay does not make the Nation more secure.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia.\n  There are a lot of important reasons to enact this amendment. There \nis no greater calling for the National Government now than to protect \nthe homeland. We see all the instability in the world and the fact that \nIraq has now become a magnet for a lot of bad guys in all the world who \nwant to do damage to the United States. In Iraq, almost one American \nsoldier a day is being assassinated.\n  By the way, the assassinations are taking place in three different \nways. On the eve of my arrival, 2 weeks ago, in Baghdad, very sadly and \nunfortunately, one of our Florida National Guard soldiers from \nGainesville was assassinated. In this particular case, the soldier was \non guard duty for a delegation that had gone to a meeting at the \nuniversity. And in the hubbub of all the crowds at the university, this \nsoldier was standing guard for the party that was meeting. The soldier \nwas vulnerable because of the crowds. And our soldiers are vulnerable \nbetween that position and that position--being the upper part of the \nbody armor, the Kevlar, and the helmet. And, in this particular case, \nin the hubbub of that crowd, someone tapped that soldier on the \nshoulder. He turned around, and he was shot in the face. That is one \nmethod of assassination.\n  Another method is to use a landmine with a remote control device, and \nusually a landmine placed on a part of a road where the road narrows, \nso when the convoy comes along that area, the landmine can be \ndetonated. And it is usually targeted at a lightly armored vehicle such \nas a humvee. We have had that happen a number of times.\n  And then a third method, which has been used more frequently \nrecently, is the use of the rocket-propelled grenades. In the case of \nthe soldiers last night who were assassinated, it was being fired from \na position behind bushes, near a roadside.\n  But another method is where a convoy is moving out, and they are \nmoving rapidly, and someone on a downtown street tries to insert into \nthat convoy and then shoots an RPG either at the vehicle in front of \nthem or to the rear of them.\n  So, clearly, there is a lot of trauma and mischief that is going on \nin that part of the world. But it is a foretelling of what people want \nto do to the United States. It is not just the Fedayeen and it is not \njust the Baathists and it is not just the Saddam loyalists. Iraq is now \nattracting outsiders who want to do damage to the United States.\n  So if they target there, clearly they are going to be targeting here \nas well. This, by the way, is another reason, when we try to protect \nourselves against terrorists, our protection is only so good as the \ntimeliness of our intelligence and the accuracy of our intelligence. \nDoes that ring a bell? And I hope we get through all of that and get it \nstraightened out as well.\n  But the issue before us is the protection of the homeland. You cannot \nprotect the homeland on the cheap. If the question is how we allocate \nthe moneys--if it should go to tax cuts or protecting the homeland--\nthen that gets to be a pretty simple answer. The people want the \nhomeland protected.\n  Although there is some measure of protection that is offered, now \nSenator Byrd has offered additional protection. The debate has already \nbeen held, and I will not repeat, except to emphasize one thought: \nFlorida, my State, has 15 deepwater ports. It is a place of great \nvulnerability because of all the containers that come into this \ncountry, only 2 to 3 percent of them are checked.\n  If we are looking for weapons as easily concealed, for example, as a \nshoulder-mounted heat-seeking missile that can bring down a commercial \nairliner, how easy that is to slip into the country in a container in \nport. Senator Byrd is offering a total of $610 million, $460 million \nover the existing $150 million in the bill, for expenses for port \nsecurity. I can tell you every one of those port managers in my State--\nand I think I can speak also for the other ports of the other States--\nare strapped with so many expenses. They desperately need additional \nhelp for security at their ports.\n  I rest my case. It is a matter of common sense in the protection of \nthe homeland. I have only spoken about one part of the appropriations \nin this amendment. I encourage our colleagues to support Senator Byrd's \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the hour has gotten late and the vote is \nnearly upon us, but I did not want this opportunity to pass by without \ncommending my colleague from West Virginia on his amendment. When we \ntalk about the need for homeland security and the efforts to safeguard \nthe American people, Senator Byrd has been leading the charge here in \nthe Senate, and here in Washington, every step of the way for the past \n22 months. Tonight he again reminds us about putting the Nation's \npriorities in order. As he rightly argues, an additional $1.8 billion \nfor increased port security, enhanced chemical and electrical security, \nand additional aid to our first responders struggling out there to \nprotect Americans is no burden, it is an imperative.\n  In the past several days, as I have prepared for this debate, I have \nhad the opportunity to follow up with mayors across Massachusetts to \nsee how they are coming along in their efforts to protect their \ncitizens. They are working hard, and they are doing their best, but \nthey are not getting the help they need. Mayor Ed Lambert in Fall \nRiver, MA, has, to date, only gotten $150,000 to protect his city of \n95,000. One-hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a city that has had \nto reduce its police force by more than 30 police officers. He has the \nresponsibility to protect an extremely important reservoir that serves \n200,000 citizens of Southeastern Massachusetts and $150,000 doesn't get \nhim very far.\n  The Mayor of Holyoke, MA, Mike Sullivan, didn't even fare that well. \nHis city is home to one of the nerve centers of the Northeast's \nelectricity grid. And yet he has gotten no homeland security assistance \nto date to help defray the costs of protecting this piece of critical \ninfrastructure which his police force constantly monitors. He has also \ngotten no instruction from the federal government regarding what he \nshould be doing to keep it safe and secure.\n  So if any of our colleagues wonder what is happening in the homeland \nor questioning whether first responders in their cities and towns need \nhelp, I recommend that they simply pick up the phone and call their \nmayors. The mayors and local officials will tell them what an \nextraordinary need there is. They will also tell them of the great \npressure and anxiety they feel to try to do more to protect the \npublic's safety at a time when most of them are wrestling with crushing \nand unprecedented budget shortfalls.\n  This amendment makes an important downpayment, and sends a strong \nsignal to mayors and first responders across the country. It says that \nthe U.S. Senate knows that more needs to be done, that not enough is \nbeing done, and that we are prepared to begin helping you meet the \nawesome challenges you face. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nstanding firm on this amendment, and for all he has done to force our \ngovernment to recognize and address the extraordinary homeland security \nneeds confronting this nation. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Nelson, and I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for their excellent statements. I thank \nthem for supporting the amendment. I hope the\n\n[[Page S9697]]\n\nSenate will vote to waive the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the motion to \nwaive?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) and \nthe Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), and \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) \nwould each vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd, for his work on this important Homeland Security appropriations \nbill. As the Senator knows, I am pleased that the bill we are \ndiscussing today includes within the Transportation Security \nAdministration ``$13 million for the hazardous materials permit program \nand truck tracking system to provide for nationwide coverage.'' As you \nare aware, the Federal Government has issued warnings that terrorists \nmay exploit the 800,000 daily hazardous waste and dangerous goods \nshipments in new attacks on the U.S.--either as weapons of mass \ndestruction or in the manufacture of such weapons. So the funding you \nand Chairman Cochran have included in this bill is very timely and \nimportant.\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree this is important and timely funding for one of the \nmany needs facing our Nation as we deal with terrorist threats.\n  Mr. REID. I want to ask the Senator if he is aware that the \nUniversity of Nevada Las Vegas is working to initiate development of a \nNational Hazardous Materials Transportation Monitoring and Response \nCenter that would build upon existing commercially available satellite \nbased nationwide truck monitoring and communications technology. The \ncenter would ensure a secure location for nationwide hazardous material \ntruck monitoring. It would also link, for the first time, the ability \nto remotely identify an incident anywhere in the country with the \nability to immediately alert the appropriate emergency responders and \nlaw enforcement officials.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I understand this project is in development in Nevada. \nI encourage the Department to consider using a portion of the $13 \nmillion appropriated for hazardous materials tracking to help initiate \nthe development of this project.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my colleague from West Virginia and the Chairman \nCochran for their support of those efforts and look forward to working \nwith the committee on this important issue.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2555, the \nHomeland Security Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004, as reported \nby the Senate Committee on Appropriations.\n  I want to commend the distinguished chairman and the ranking member \nfor bringing the Senate a spending bill within the Subcommittees' \n302(b) allocation. Moreover, they and their staffs need to be \ncongratulated on reporting the very first Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill.\n  The pending bill provides $29.4 billion in total budget authority and \n$30.6 billion in total outlays for fiscal year 2004. For discretionary \nspending the Senate bill is at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and outlays. The Senate bill is $1.4 billion in BA and \noutlays above the President's budget request.\n  The pending bill funds the programs of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, including the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, the \nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Coast Guard, \nthe Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Secret Service, \nthe Office for Domestic Preparedness, and several other offices and \nactivities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget Committee \nscoring of the bill be in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  H.R. 2555, DEPT.

Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the war in \nIraq.\n  My recent visit to the Middle East confirmed that the largest \nobstacle to a free and prosperous Iraq is the significant number of \npeople who still live in fear of Saddam Hussein and his sons. That is \nan understandable fear, considering the years of torture so many \nendured under the iron fist of the Hussein regime.\n  With today's news from Central Command of the deaths of Uday and \nQusay Hussein, we are two steps closer to removing that fear, two steps \ncloser to rebuilding a once-great nation, and two steps closer to \nensuring lasting security and freedom for the Iraqi people. I thank all \nthe dedicated men and women in our Armed Forces who helped make these \ntwo steps possible.\n  Throughout the past few weeks, we have heard some on this floor raise \nquestions about the justification for the war in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S9698]]\n\n  Last week on this floor, the senior Senator from North Dakota had \nthis to say, and I quote:\n\n       This administration told the world Iraq had weapons of mass \n     destruction, that they are trying to develop nuclear \n     capability, there is a connection to al-Qaida, and each and \n     every one of those claims is now in question, every one of \n     them. It is not just 16 words in the State of the Union. It \n     is far more serious than that.\n\n  I find this charge to be simply indefensible. It is an accusation \nthat flies in the face of everything that we have seen about Saddam \nHussein's regime. It offends the reasoning mind. It maligns all good \nMembers of this body who weighed the intelligence about Iraq in the \nbalance and decided that this war was just and right--and voted for it. \nI might add, months before the President's State of the Union speech.\n  We have heard similar statements echoed from others on this floor and \nin the press in recent weeks. I have the utmost respect for my fellow \nSenators. Yet I must confess I am dumbfounded at how soon they forget \nthe truth about the vile regime of Saddam Hussein.\n  I believe their line of reasoning goes something like this: They \ncharge that the President was looking for excuses to go to war with \nIraq, and that his claims concerning weapons-of-mass-destruction were \njust a pretense for this war.\n  I find this line of reasoning nonsensical at best--and downright \noffensive at worst.\n  First, if one buys the idea that Saddam Hussein did not possess the \nweapons or the capabilities the administration assigned to him, the \ndictator did not fool us alone as to his guilt. Every significant \nintelligence service in the world, including the vast majority of those \nin nations who opposed this war, were convinced that Iraq possessed \nthese weapons. That is why the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed \nResolution 1441, which declared Iraq in material breach of its \nobligations under numerous previous resolutions, including failing to \naccount for weapons of mass destruction that Iraq had previously \nadmitted to building and stockpiling.\n  As Richard Butler, the former head of the U.N. arms inspection team \nin Iraq, wrote in 2001:\n\n       It would be foolish in the extreme not to assume that \n     [Saddam] is developing long-range missile capabilities; at \n     work again on building nuclear weapons; and adding to the \n     chemical and biological warfare weapons he concealed during \n     the UNSCOM inspection period.\n\n  Yet it is that same logical position that some in this body are \narguing against today. Those who make accusations based on their \npolitical desires, not the facts, lump the international political \ncommunity, the media, the intelligence community, and the President of \nthe United States into some fantastic form of shadowy conspiracy. This \nis hardly responsible, and I believe it does a great disservice to the \nAmerican people.\n  Second, if one honestly argues that because of one offending sentence \nevery other claim made by the administration concerning Iraq is now \nunder question, you run into a very hard brick wall of solid fact. \nPerhaps my colleagues will explain what form of gas Saddam used to kill \nmore than 100,000 Kurds, including 5,000 in just one day. Perhaps they \nwill explain why, prior to kicking out the U.N. inspection team in \n1998, Iraqi officials admitted that they had produced biological \nweapons agents--including 4 tons of VX, 8,500 liters of anthrax and \n19,000 liters of botulinum toxin--and biological weapons delivery \nmunitions, including aerial bombs, aerial dispensers, and Scud missile \nwarheads. Perhaps they will explain why, for more than a decade, Saddam \nHussein stymied inspectors, buried research facilities, built mobile \nbiological weapons labs, intimidated scientists, and even removed the \ntongues of those who questioned his regime.\n  I would ask my colleagues who have made these arguments to answer a \nquestion for me, then. Under their line of reasoning, why did our \nPresident seek the authority to pursue this war? If, as they claim, \nthere was no overarching consensus that Saddam Hussein represented a \ndanger to American security and peace in the Middle East and around the \nworld, why did the President undertake this war? Why did so many vote \nto support the President, here in the Senate and in the United Nations?\n  War is a serious enterprise, one that is not undertaken without risk. \nThe fact that Baghdad fell in 3 weeks, with so few casualties among \ncoalition forces, fulfilled our greatest hopes for this conflict. I \nknow I am thankful for that fact, and I know the President is as well. \nI also know that the case for this war remains solid.\n  This was a case built not on one piece of evidence provided by \nBritish intelligence, but on a much deeper long-term purpose. It was \nbuilt on the noble goal of ending the decades of brutal and violent \nworks by Saddam Hussein, and on our clear duty to ensure America's \nsecurity in the post-9/11 world by removing state-sponsors of terrorism \nand opposing regimes that threaten other nations with weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Three-hundred thousand people, maybe more, are buried in mass graves \nspread throughout Iraq, in nearly a hundred reported sites. They \nstretch from Basrah to Baghdad, from Najaf to Kirkuk. They are silent \nmonuments to Saddam's legacy of ruthlessness and evil.\n  The suggestion in the face of these silent witnesses that Iraq, the \nMiddle East, and America are not better off today than we were before \nthis war is simply ludicrous.\n  We have finished the fighting. Now we must finish the job. We seek to \nmake Iraq secure, to make it a place where the rule of law can be \nestablished, so that civilian leaders and the Iraqi Governing Council \ncan establish a new government for a new nation.\n  This is not an easy task--and it is not without cost. But it must be \ndone, so that Iraq can flourish as a free nation, and so that the \nvictories won, the lives risked and lost, will not be in vain.\n  Those we spend their time playing political games with our mission in \nIraq, even while our brave men and women labor to secure and stabilize \nthis fledging nation, dishonor our soldiers in the field and the \nmemories of all of those who sacrificed their lives opposing the \nbloodthirsty regime of Saddam Hussein.\n  President Clinton argued in 1998 that if America did not act, Saddam \nHussein would:\n\n       . . . go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of \n     devastating destruction. And some day, some way, I guarantee \n     you, he's use the arsenal.\n\n  President Bush agreed with that argument, and he dediced to do \nsomething about it. Many of us agreed with that argument, and we voted \nto support the President. And I am confident history will record it as \nthe right decision--a decision based strongly on the principles of \nhuman freedom that inspired America's foundation.\n  Last week, Prime Minister Blair reminded us that we have a duty as a \npowerful nation to take great care regarding what kind of world we \nleave for our children. I believe that the task that falls to us at \nthis moment in history is spreading the blessings of liberty, bringin \nthe light of freedom to a nation imprisoned in the darkness.\n  Let those who are more comfortable playing political games--play on. \nThose of us who wish to accomplish something greater will labor on, \nundeterred, always confident in our ultimate goal: We seek a just, \nfree, and peaceful world--for ourselves, for the Iraqi people, and for \nfuture generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9698-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9698-S9699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN REMEMBRANCE OF STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record my remarks of December 9, 2002, before the U.S. Capitol \nHistorical Society.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       ``Who well lives, long lives; for this age of ours should \n     not be numbered by years, days and hours.''\n       We are gathered here today to salute a friend and colleague \n     who has lived long and spent his days well.\n       Strom Thurmond has been a teacher, an athletic coach, an \n     educational administrator, a lawyer, a State legislator, a \n     circuit court judge, a county superintendent, a soldier, a \n     Presidential nominee, and a Governor--and all of that was \n     packed into just his first 52 years.\n       In 1954, Strom won his first election to the Senate as a \n     write-in candidate--beginning\n\n[[Page S9699]]\n\n     his Senate sojourn with the singular achievement of being the \n     only person in history to be elected to the Senate in that \n     fashion.\n       As he began his Senate service with a ``first'' he also \n     leaves it by setting two more records--that of being the \n     longest serving Senator in U.S. history and also being the \n     oldest person to serve in the U.S. Senate. May I note here \n     that he is also the only person in the Senate who is old \n     enough to be my big brother. But, Strom, like Casey Stengel, \n     I'll never make the mistake of being 70 again.\n       Strom Thurmond's life is not just about length and \n     achievement, it is about personal service and commitment.\n       Now, I am not speaking here about Strom's well-known \n     appreciation for the gentler sex. I am speaking about his \n     love of his country and his commitment to serve it.\n       Consider the fact that Strom Thurmond volunteered for \n     service in World War II. He did that when he could have \n     stayed safely at home. Strom was beyond draft age in 1942. \n     Additionally, as a judge, he held draft-exempted status. Yet \n     he went. And in 1944, Strom Thurmond was part of D-Day--the \n     invasion of the beaches of Normandy that signaled the defeat \n     of worldwide fascism. He risked his life to serve the nation \n     he loved.\n       After the war, Strom Thurmond served the State that he \n     loved by becoming its Governor.\n       In 1948, Governor Strom Thurmond tried again to serve the \n     country that he loved by running for President as a States \n     rights Democrat. He carried four States and won 39 electoral \n     votes. Undaunted, in 1954 Strom found another way to serve \n     his beloved State and country by being elected to the U.S. \n     Senate. It is in this role, that of U.S. Senator, that we \n     have come to understand the extraordinary service of this \n     man from South Carolina.\n       Strom Thurmond is a man who, because of the quantity of his \n     years, has seen enormous change--the rise and fall of Nazi \n     Germany; the Russian Revolution; the rise and fall of the \n     Soviet empire; two world wars; space exploration; civil \n     rights upheaval; and incredible advances in technology and \n     medicine. Indeed, the world is very different from the one \n     that Strom Thurmond knew as a young man. He has been witness \n     to the ``vicissitudes of fortune, which spares neither man \n     nor the proudest of his works, which buries empires and \n     cities in a common grave.''\n       And yet Strom has never lost his desire to serve, to make \n     his contribution, to add his voice and his views to the rich \n     conglomeration of beliefs and viewpoints which, when mixed \n     together, yield an idea called America.\n       Strom is never one to become discouraged, disheartened or \n     disenchanted. He loves his country, and he has been a \n     faithful and devoted defender of the Nation's need for a \n     strong defense. No summer soldier, no sunshine patriot, he.\n       Youth is not a time of life--it is a state of mind. It is \n     not a matter of red cheeks, red lips and supple knees. It is \n     a temper of the will; a quality of the imagination. Youth \n     means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, \n     of the appetite for a adventure over a life of ease. This \n     often exists in a man of 50, more than in a boy of 20. Nobody \n     grows old by merely living a number of years; people grow old \n     by deserting their dreams.\n       Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm \n     wrinkles the soul.\n       Whether 70 or 16, there is in every being's heart a love of \n     wonder; the sweet amazement at the stars and starlike things \n     and thoughts.\n       You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as \n     young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear; as young \n     as your hope, as old as your despair.\n       In the central place of your heart, there is a wireless \n     station. So long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, \n     cheer, grandeur, courage, and power form the Earth, from men \n     and from the Infinite--so long are you young. When the wires \n     are all down and the central places of your heart are covered \n     with the snows of pessimism and the ice of cynicism, then are \n     you grown old, indeed!\n       In the words of Pericles: ``It is only the love of honor \n     that never grows old.''\n       Today, it is not the length but the quality of Strom \n     Thurmond's life which we celebrate. For that marvelous life \n     of character and courage I salute him. It is a privilege to \n     know him, an honor to serve with him, and an education to \n     ponder his remarkable life.\n\n\n                   Multiplication Table of Happiness\n\n     Count your garden by the flowers\n     Never by the leaves that fall;\n     Count your days by the sunny hours,\n     Not remembering clouds at all;\n     Count your nights by stars, not shadows,\n     Count your life by smiles, not tears,\n     And on this beautiful December afternoon,\n     Count your age by friends, not years.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nAmerican political icon, patriot, war hero, and lifelong South \nCarolinian, Senator Strom Thurmond. While many will recall Senator \nThurmond's half-century career on the political stage, I shall fondly \nremember the many kindnesses he extended to my family and me. He was a \nwarm-hearted, gentle man, and I will count it as one of my life's \nhonors to have served with him in the U.S. Senate.\n  I join my colleagues in extending my heartfelt condolences to his \nfamily who have lost a beloved husband, father, and grandfather. Strom \nwas a legend in the Senate and touched many of us during his long \ncareer. In fact, I will always remember Senator Thurmond's 90th \nbirthday party when he turned to the audience and said, ``If you all \neat right, exercise, and don't drink whiskey, you'll be here for the \n100th birthday party.'' Strom Thurmond was a remarkable American; I \ndon't think we'll see another one like him for a long time, if ever.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we mourn the loss of Strom Thurmond, the \nlegendary Senator who held his first public office in the late 1920s \nand who died on June 27 in his hometown of Edgefield, SC. The State of \nSouth Carolina lost a beloved native son and the Senate lost a \ncheerful, robust, honorable, and dedicated colleague. He was someone \nwho was always eager to help me and to accommodate my concerns. It was \nan honor to work with him on issues of national defense, foreign \npolicy, and many other matters important to the people of the United \nStates.\n  South Carolinians' outpouring of respect when he died was massive. \nSenator Thurmond had been a judge, a soldier who landed in Normandy as \na member of the 82nd Airborne Division in 1942, a Governor of South \nCarolina, and chairman of the Judiciary and Armed Services committees \nin this body. He was also someone who changed his mind on an issue of \ngreat import--race in America--and he was a fine example to his fellow \ncitizens on that score.\n  Strom Thurmond was an indomitable spirit. He represented continuity \nin the U.S. Senate, becoming, in 1996, its oldest serving Member and, \nin 1997, its longest serving Member. Those are for the record books. \nBut on a personal level, I can say I admired tremendously his buoyant \nspirit. I appreciated him for assisting me in so many ways, and for his \nstalwart service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9699-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THAILAND'S BUSINESS AS USUAL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the struggle for freedom in Burma, I \nam becoming increasingly convinced that Thailand is on the side of the \nrepresentative junta in Rangoon.\n  To with, the Foreign Minister of Thailand was recently quoted: ``We \nare trying to find an exit for the Myanmar Government, the also reduce \npressure from the international community.''\n  Instead of trying to find an ``exit'' for the repressive State Peace \nand Development Council, SPDC, Thailand should be trying to secure the \nrelease of democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other democrats \njailed in the wake of the brutal May 30 attack on the National League \nfor Democracy, NLD.\n  Thailand's ``business-as-usual'' approach places that country at odds \nwith other Associated of Southeast Asian Nation, ASEAN, members--\nincluding Malaysia. Given the SPDC's refusal to release Suu Kyi and \nother Burmese democrats, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir rightly \ncommented that Burma could be expelled from ASEAN ``as a last result.''\n  Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must defend democracy in Burma \nand should join with Malaysia and other ASEAN members in holding the \nSPDC accountable for their actions.\n  Thailand should take note that I included a provision in S. 1426, the \nfiscal year 2004 Foreign Operations appropriations bill, that \nconditions United States assistance to that country on a determination \nby the Secretary of State that Thailand: one, supports the advancement \nof democracy in Burma and is taking action to sanction the military \njunta in Rangoon; two, is not hampering the delivery of humanitarian \nassistance to people in Thailand who have fled Burma; and three is not \nforcibly repatriating Burmese to Burma.\n  It is past time for Thailand to prove its commitment to the cause of \nfreedom and the rule of law in Burma. The Thai Foreign Minister has an \nopportunity to set the record straight in Bali this week. He should not \nmiss it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9699-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9699-S9700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LINDA FLATT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my fellow Nevadan, \nLinda Flatt, from Henderson, NV.\n\n[[Page S9700]]\n\nLinda is a living example of how a person can turn her grief into \naction and help others.\n  On June 29, 1993, Linda's son Paul took his own life. He was 25 years \nold. In addition to having to accept the loss of her son, Linda had to \naccept the way she lost him.\n  First, Linda attended suicide survivors meetings. She transformed \nherself from being a victim to a survivor. She could have stopped there \nbut she did not.\n  Even when she was able to accept her son's suicide, Linda realized it \naffected other people. All she had to do was look at her own family. \nPaul had left behind many relatives and friends. Unfortunately, for \nevery family like Linda's, there are many more in Nevada and \nnationwide.\n  Linda educated herself about the problem of suicide. Eventually she \nlinked up with the Suicide Prevention Action Network and came to \nWashington for a National Awareness Event. This marked the beginning of \nLinda Flatt's transformation from suicide survivor to community \nactivist.\n  Since 1998, Linda Flatt has made it her business, as a private \ncitizen, to educate people in Nevada about suicide. She has not just \ntold them it is a problem; she has told them there is a solution. \nPrevention is the solution.\n  On the national front, we have developed a strategy for suicide \nprevention. But Nevada, which had the highest rate of suicide in the \ncountry until this year, did not. Linda Flatt did not think that was \nright.\n  Linda took the national model, and started presenting it to the \nNevada Legislature. She learned about State government and the \nlegislative process. She contacted the press and the media. She lined \nup witnesses for hearings. She proposed resolutions and budgets. And \nfinally, this year, the Nevada Legislature passed SB 49, which creates \na State Office of Suicide Prevention in Nevada.\n  On behalf of the citizens of the State of Nevada, I wish to thank \nLinda Flatt for her tireless efforts and unwavering faith. To say that \nLinda Flatt is a model citizen does not really do her justice. She has \nalready made a difference in the lives of countless people and will, no \ndoubt, continue to do so. I feel great pride in knowing and recognizing \nthe accomplishments of Linda Flatt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9700-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PROTECT ACT OF 2003 TECHNICAL AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives for passing S. 1280, the PROTECT Act of 2003 \nTechnical Amendment. This bill is directed to that portion of the \nPROTECT Act authorizing a pilot program to study the feasibility of \ninstituting a national background check for volunteers who work with \nchildren. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children will \nprovide their expertise by evaluating criminal records of volunteers \nprovided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine if the \nvolunteers are fit to interact and work with children.\n  When authorizing the pilot program, Congress immunized the National \nCenter for its operation of the child abuse cyber-tip line but \nneglected to extend it to their activities connected to their operation \nof the background check pilot program. In order for the Center to fully \nimplement the pilot program, this bill immunizes the Center for \ndecisions it makes based on the criminal records provided to them in \nany one of the following instances: 1. a decision that the records \nindicate that a volunteer is not fit to work with children; 2. a \ndecision that an individual is fit to serve as a volunteer based on the \ngovernment providing incomplete or inaccurate criminal history records; \nor, 3. a decision that an individual is fit to serve as a volunteer \nwhere the Center is provided no criminal history records.\n  Chairman Sensenbrenner, Senator Biden, and I have been the principal \nauthors of this bill. We all agree that this is the proper \ninterpretation of this technical amendment. I commend Chairman \nSensenbrenner in the House of Representatives for moving this time-\nsensitive bill through the House of Representatives so quickly.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the other body for its \nprompt action on S. 1280, legislation introduced by Chairman Hatch and \nmyself and passed unanimously by the Senate on July 14. Enactment of S. \n1280 will clear the way for the commencement of the Child Safety Pilot \nProgram created by the Protect Act, a program designed to keep our kids \nsafe from pedophiles and other criminals.\n  S. 1280 builds upon language included in the Protect Act at section \n108 which authorized a pilot program to study the feasibility of \nnational criminal history background checks for volunteers with \norganizations that work with children. In section 108, the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children is authorized to assist \nchild-serving organizations in evaluating criminal history records to \ndetermine whether potential volunteers are fit to work with children.\n  We need to do all that we can to keep pedophiles and other convicted \nfelons away from our kids. That was the intent of the background check \nprovisions Senator Hatch, Chairman Sensenbrenner, and I worked to \ninclude in the Protect Act. Instead of giving volunteer organizations \nraw criminal history data, the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, ``NCMEC'', agreed to review the FBI's data to \ndetermine whether it reveals a criminal history rendering someone unfit \nto work with children.\n  Under section 108 of the Protect Act, NCMEC will evaluate FBI-\nprovided criminal history records, make a determination whether these \nrecords render a potential volunteer unfit to work with children, and \npass this resulting fitness determination on to the requesting \nvolunteer organization. Unfortunately, the Protect Act did not limit \nNCMEC's civil liability in this area. NCMEC volunteered to take on this \ntask, but they indicated they would be unable to make fitness \ndeterminations if they are subject to civil suits by aggrieved \nvolunteers. And while the Protect Act provided NCMEC with a shield from \ncivil liability for operating its cyber tip line, so long as NCMEC does \nso consistent with the purpose of the tip line, no similar protection \nwas provided with respect to NCMEC's activities under the pilot \nbackground check program.\n  S. 1280 extends NCMEC's immunity from civil liability to actions they \ntake pursuant to the pilot program. NCMEC will still be subject to suit \nfor any criminal actions they take, and liable civilly if a plaintiff \ncan show actual malice or intentional misconduct on NCMEC's part. \nSpecifically, S. 1280 immunizes NCMEC for decisions it makes based on \nthe criminal records provided to them by the FBI in any of the \nfollowing instances: 1. When NCMEC provides a volunteer organization \nwith a fitness determination indicating that a volunteer is not fit to \nwork with children; 2. When NCMEC provides a volunteer organization \nwith a fitness determination that an individual is fit to serve as a \nvolunteer based on incomplete or inaccurate criminal history records \nprovided by the FBI; or 3. When NCMEC provides a volunteer organization \nwith a fitness determination that an individual is fit to serve as a \nvolunteer based on a lack of criminal history records from the FBI. As \nan author of S. 1280, I understand my interpretation of the legislation \nis consistent with that of Chairmen Hatch and Sensenbrenner.\n  Enactment of S. 1280 will permit the pilot programs authorized in the \nProtect Act to begin on the date called for in the legislation, July \n29, 2003. I thank my colleagues in the other body for taking prompt \naction on S. 1280. I thank Chairman Hatch for his continued devotion to \nchild safety issues, and I look forward to the commencement of the \nChild Safety Pilot Program next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9700-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9700-S9701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CANADIAN HARP SEAL HUNT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Humane Society of the United States, \nHSUS, has recently brought to my attention a matter that I want to \nshare with my colleagues. According to this prestigious organization, \nthe Canadian government provides millions of dollars of subsidies to \nthe sealing industry every year. These subsidies facilitate the \nslaughter of innocent animals and artificially extend the life of an \nindustry which has ceased to exist in most developed countries.\n  In 2001, a group of independent veterinarians traveled to observe the \nseal\n\n[[Page S9701]]\n\nhunt. What they witnessed was shocking to all who are concerned about \nthe humane treatment of animals. The images are difficult to envision \nbut harder to believe: skinning of live animals and the dragging of \nlive seals across the ice using steel hooks.\n  Few would argue that this industry still serves a legitimate purpose. \nA number of years ago, an economic analysis of the Canadian sealing \nindustry concluded that it provided the equivalent of only 100 to 150 \nfull-time jobs each year. In addition, the analysis found that these \njobs cost Canadian taxpayers nearly $30,000 each. The report concluded \nthat when the cost of government subsidies provided to the industry was \nweighed against the landed value of the seals each year, the net value \nof the sealing industry was close to zero.\n  There is little about the Canadian sealing industry that is self-\nsustaining. The operating budget of the Canadian Sealers Association \ncontinues to be paid by the Canadian government; their rent each month \nis paid by the provincial government of Newfoundland and Labrador; seal \nprocessing companies continue to receive subsidies through the Atlantic \nCanada Opportunities Agency; Human Resources Development Canada, and \nother federal funding programs for staffing and capital costs. The \nsealing industry, through the Sealing Industry Development Council and \nother bodies, receives assistance for product research and development, \nand for product marketing initiatives, both overseas and domestically. \nAll the costs of the seal hunt for ice breaking services and for search \nand rescue, provided by the Canadian Coast Guard, are underwritten by \nCanadian taxpayers.\n  Many believe that subsidizing an industry that only operates for a \nfew weeks a year and employs only a few hundred people on a seasonal, \npart-time basis is simply a bad investment on the part of the Canadian \ngovernment. The HSUS has already called upon the Canadian government to \nend these archaic subsidies and instead work to diversify the economy \nin the Atlantic region by facilitating long-term jobs and livelihoods.\n  The clubbing of baby seals can't be defended or justified, and Canada \nshould end it just as we ended the Alaska baby seal massacre 20 years \nago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9701-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9701-S9703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FBI CHALLENGES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nfaces tremendous challenges in the war on terrorism, particularly with \nits internal operations, where a culture of fear, retaliation, and \ncoverup demoralize agents and weaken the organizations.\n  Director Mueller has taken at least two important steps to address \nthis culture. First, he has recognized it, making him one of the first \nDirectors in recent memory to acknowledge the problem. His appointment \nof Judge Griffin Bell and Dr. Lee Colwell to study the Office of \nProfessional Responsibility, OPR, is an excellent example of his \nrecognizing the seriousness of the problem.\n  Second, Director Mueller has translated this attitude into action. \nFor example, earlier this year, he justly and fairly punished a senior \nmanager, which was especially noteworthy because he had been handpicked \nby the Director for the job. Just a few years ago, I could not have \nimagined an FBI Director taking action against a top official the way \nhe did with Robert Jordan, the Assistant Director of OPR. By \nimplementing the recommended punishment of the Justice Department \nInspector General (DOJ OIG), Director Mueller fairly applied high \nstandards to a senior-level FBI official.\n  I commend the Director for these positive developments, and that is \nwhy I feel the following issues are important.\n  Specifically, I am concerned about the FBI recently awarding \ncontracts to several former senior officials involved in wrongdoing \nduring their careers. The former top officials are Charles Mathews III, \nwho recently retired from the position of Special Agent in Charge of \nthe Portland, OR, Division; Thomas Coyle, who held the position of \nAssistant Director, Personnel Division; and Special Agent in Charge of \nthe Buffalo, NY, Division; and Joseph Wolfinger, who retired in the \nlate 1990s from the position of Assistant Director of the Training \nDivision in Quantico, VA.\n  First, it is my understanding that Mr. Mathews recently was selected \nto accompany several current FBI officials on a trip to Jakarta, \nIndonesia, to conduct training for law enforcement and security \nofficials.\n  Second, it is my understanding that MPRI, an Alexandria VA, defense \nand security contracting company, was awarded a contract worth between \n$500,000 and $1.5 million to conduct counter-intelligence training for \nFBI agents. Mr. Wolfinger, who holds the title of Senior Vice President \nand General Manager, heads MPRI's ``Alexandria Group,'' which ``will \nprovide the highest quality education, training, and organizational \nexpertise, to law enforcement and corporations around the world,'' \naccording to the company's Web site. Mr. Coyle is listed as ``Senior \nLaw Enforcement Affiliate'' for the company.\n  One reason I have questions about these former officials and/or their \ncompanies obtaining contracts is that they were involved in the Ruby \nRidge scandal (Mathews) and the ``Pottsgate'' scandal (Wolfinger). Mr. \nCoyle was involved with both Ruby Ridge and Pottsgate.\n  Ruby Ridge refers not only the deadly 1992 standoff at the Idaho home \nof Randall Weaver, but also the ensuring coverups of misconduct and \nlying by senior FBI officials. The Pottsgate scandal refers to the sham \nconference held in 1997 so friends and co-workers of then-Deputy \nDirector Larry Potts could fly to Washington for his retirement party \non the taxpayers' dime, rather than their own personal money.\n  It is not worth repeating the long and sorry history of the \nmisconduct of all the senior-level officials involved in the Ruby Ridge \nstandoff; Pottsgate; the ensuing investigations, re-investigations, and \nreviews of investigations; and the failure to take appropriate \ndisciplinary action in both matters. A full recounting covering more \nthan a dozen officials who were involved in wrongdoing would take \nhundreds of pages.\n  The most comprehensive, public details of these two scandals are \noutlined in the DOJ OIG's report, entitled ``A Review of Allegations of \na Double Standard of Discipline at the FBI,'' issued in November 2002.\n  The FBI's reputation and integrity suffered enough when these men \nescaped any appropriate discipline for wrongdoing during their careers. \nNot only did they avoid accountability, but recent developments \nindicate that their former colleagues and friends are rewarding them \nwith lucrative contracts. I am sure this is not the lesson Director \nMueller wants agents and the public to learn about the FBI and the way \nit handles misconduct in its top ranks.\n  Before I explain my other concerns about Mr. Mathews, Mr. Wolfinger/\nMPRI, and Mr. Coyle/MPRI profiting--either directly of indirectly--from \nthese contracts, a brief explanation of their involvement in misconduct \nis necessary. The following is based on the DOJ OIG's report on the \ndouble standard in discipline.\n  Mr. Mathews, in June 1994, led an internal inquiry into the findings \nof a previous criminal investigation regarding allegations of FBI \nmisconduct during the Ruby Ridge standoff. Danny Coulson, for whom Mr. \nMathews worked from 1988 to 1990 in Portand, OR, was one subject of the \ncriminal probes and Mr. Mathews' inquiry.\n  Mr. Mathews' probe led to discipline for several agents and officials \nat the scene of the standoff, but not for any headquarters officials--\nincluding Mr. Coulson and his boss, Mr. Potts. Later, the Justice \nDepartment, DOJ, conducted criminal and administrative investigations \ninto new allegations, including that Mr. Mathews and his investigation \ncovered up misconduct. While under investigation for those issues, Mr. \nMathews was promoted twice, and shortly after that DOJ investigation \nended in 2001, he was promoted a third time to head the Portland, OR, \nDivision. After contradictory conclusions at the senior levels of the \nDOJ under former Attorney General Janet Reno, Mr. Mathews, like other \nsenior officials, escaped any discipline.\n\n  However, the November 2002 DOJ OIG report later determined that:\n\n       Mathews should have been disciplined for failure to carry \n     out [his] assigned duties--completing thorough and impartial \n     inquiries--regardless of whether there was evidence of \n     improper motivation. Moreover,\n\n[[Page S9702]]\n\n     like DOJ OPR, we believe that there was sufficient evidence \n     in the record to sustain a finding that [Mathews] acted with \n     an improper purpose. (Page 64)\n\n  The DOJ OIG report also stated:\n\n       We also believe that Mathews' failure to rescue himself \n     despite his relationship with Coulson, taken together with \n     his statements and the unsubstantiated findings in his report \n     regarding approval of the rules of engagement, established by \n     a preponderance of the evidence that Mathews conducted an \n     inadequate investigation. (Page 64)\n\n  The Pottsgate scandal refers to the allegation, among others, that \nMr. Wolfinger, in October of 1997, arranged a conference to justify \nofficial business travel to Washington, DC, of senior officials so they \ncould attend the retirement party of Mr. Potts, who was Deputy Director \nof the FBI at the time. The investigation focused on whether: the \n``conference'' was a sham; it was used to justify the personal travel \nof officials to Washington for the party; those officials \nmisrepresented their actions on travel forms and other government \ndocuments; and the officials were less than honest to investigators \nabout their actions.\n  Mr. Wolfinger, the Assistant Director of the Training Division in \nQuantico, VA, was the organizer of the Thursday, October 9, 1997, \nretirement party for Mr. Potts. Just 7 days before the party, Mr. \nWolfinger ordered a subordinate to send out a communication to the \nfield announcing a conference for Special agents in charge, SACs, on \nFriday, October 10, 1997, the day after the party.\n  This ``conference'' was unusual in several ways, as the DOJ OIG \nNovember 2002 report points out. The conference--\n\n     announcement did not contain a conference schedule, a \n     starting or concluding time, a training identification \n     number, or travel instructions. The conference was scheduled \n     for a Friday, normally a travel day for FBI employees \n     following the conclusion of conferences. (Page 17)\n\n  The DOJ OIG report identifies other unusual characteristics of the \n``conference.'' Only five people attended: Mr. Wolfinger, the \nsubordinate he ordered to organize it, two SACs, and another \nindividual. The agent who was ordered to give a presentation was told \nof the conference only 3 days before, on October 7, 1997. The \nconference had no formal agenda, and it lasted between 45 minutes and \n90 minutes, rather than all day.\n  Despite the damning evidence, a disciplinary board of Senior \nExecutive Service, SES, officials decided the ``conference'' was not a \nsham, though the board did conclude ``the planners exercised poor \njudgment in not properly preparing for it.'' (Page 26)\n\n  The DOJ OIG report notes that it is unclear exactly what action, if \nany, the board during two meetings decided to take against Mr. \nWolfinger, who retired shortly after the board's meetings. Ultimately, \nhowever, it appears that Mr. Wolfinger was not punished. Michael Defeo, \nthe Assistant Director of FBI OPR at the time, told the DOJ OIG that \n``no recommendation as to Wolfinger was ultimately made . . .'' (Page \n28)\n  Mr. Coyle, a coworker of Mr. Wolfinger at MPRI, was one member of the \ndisciplinary board in the Pottsgate matter. The DOJ OIG concluded:\n\n       Coyle should not have participated because, at a minimum, \n     an appearance of a conflict of interest existed, if not an \n     actual conflict of interest. (Page 30)\n\n  As the DOJ OIG report notes, at the time of the board's decisions, \nMr. Coyle and Mr. Potts were subjects of the Ruby Ridge investigation. \nThe DOJ OIG wrote:\n\n       It was well known that many people wanted to attend the \n     Potts retirement party to show support for him because of the \n     Ruby Ridge investigation. That attitude was likely to be \n     especially strong for someone like Coyle who also was a Ruby \n     Ridge subject. We believe that Coyle should have recused \n     himself or been removed from these Board proceedings. (Page \n     30)\n\n  The actions of these officials during their careers at the FBI are \ntroubling. That is why I sent Director Mueller a letter today asking \nquestions about the contracts these men were awarded. I asked for a \nresponse by Wednesday, August 27, 2003.\n  Mr. Chairman, I also ask that the letter, dated today, July 22, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Robert Mueller,\n     Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Mueller: The purpose of this letter is to \n     inquire about the FBI recently awarding contracts to several \n     former senior officials. The former top officials are Charles \n     Mathews III, who recently retired from the position of \n     Special Agent in Charge of the Portland, Oregon Division; \n     Thomas Coyle, who held the position of Assistant Director, \n     Personnel Division, and Special Agent in Charge of the \n     Buffalo, New York Division; and Joseph Wolfinger, who retired \n     in the later 1990s from the position of Assistant Director of \n     the Training Division in Quanticao, Virginia.\n       First, it is my understanding that Mr. Methews recently was \n     selected to accompany several current FBI officials on a trip \n     to Jakarta, Indonesia, to conduct training for law \n     enforcement and security officials.\n       Second, it is my understanding that MPRI, an Alexandria, \n     Virginia defense and security contracting company, was \n     awarded a contract worth between $500,000 and $1.5 million to \n     conduct counter-intelligence training for FBI agents. Mr. \n     Wolfinger, who holds the title of Senior Vice President and \n     General Manager, heads MPRI's ``Alexandria Group,'' which \n     ``will provide the highest quality education, training and \n     organizational expertise, to law enforcement and corporations \n     around the world,'' according to the company's Web site.

Mr. President, I commend the Senate for the bipartisan \ncooperation in approving the Prison Rape Elimination Act.\n  I especially commend my lead Republican co-sponsor, Senator Sessions \nand his dedicated staff, Andrea Sander, William Smith, and Ed Haden. It \nhas been a privilege to work with Senator Sessions and the two lead \nsponsors of this legislation in the House, Congressmen Frank Wolf and \nBobby Scott.\n  I commend as well the extraordinary coalition of churches, civil \nrights groups, and concerned citizens who made this achievement \npossible. The coalition includes Amnesty International, Human Rights \nWatch, the Justice Policy Institute, the NAACP, the National \nAssociation of Evangelicals, the National Council for La Raza, Prison \nFellowship, Salvation Army, the Sentencing Project, the Southern \nBaptist Convention, and the Youth Law Center.\n  The coalition has been ably led by Michael Horowitz, a senior fellow \nat the Hudson Institute. I also commend Mariam Bell from Prison \nFellowship and the Wilberforce Forum, Vincent Schiraldi from the \nJustice Policy Institute, Lara Stemple from Stop Prison Rape, and John \nKaneb, the courageous citizen of Massachusetts whose unyielding effort \nand commitment to human rights has been invaluable to this legislation.\n  It has taken us nearly a century to get here. It was Winston \nChurchill who said in 1910 that the ``mood and temper of the public in \nregard to the treatment of crime and criminals is one of the most \nunfailing tests of the civilization of any country.''\n  Today, in 2003, we know that hundreds of thousands of inmates in our \nNation--hundreds of thousands, not only convicted prisoners but \npretrial detainees and immigration detainees as well--are victims of \nsexual assault each year. Of the 2 million prisoners in the United \nStates, it is conservatively estimated that 1 in every 10 has been \nraped. According to a 1996 study, 22 percent of prisoners in Nebraska \nhad been pressured or forced to have sex against their will. Human \nRights Watch has reported ``shockingly high rates of sexual abuse'' in \nU.S. prisons.\n  Prison rape has devastating physical and psychological effects on its \nvictims. It also has serious consequences for communities. Six hundred \nthousand inmates are released from prison or detention each year, and \ntheir brutalization clearly increases the likelihood that they will \ncommit new crimes after they are released.\n  Infection rates for HIV, other sexually transmitted diseases, \ntuberculosis, and hepatitis are far greater for prisoners than for the \npopulation as a whole. Prison rape undermines the public health by \ncontributing to the spread of these diseases, and often giving \npotential death sentences to its victims because of AIDS.\n  In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled that ``being violently assaulted in \nprison is simply not part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay \nfor their offenses against society.'' Federal, State, and local \ngovernment officials have a duty under the Constitution to prevent \nprison violence. Too often, however, officials fail to take obvious \nsteps to protect vulnerable inmates.\n  The Prison Rape Elimination Act has been carefully drafted to address \nthe crisis of prison rape, while still respecting the primary role of \nStates and local governments in administering their prisons and jails. \nThe act directs the Department of Justice to conduct an annual \nstatistical analysis of the frequency and effects of prison rape. It \nestablishes a special panel to conduct hearings on prison systems, \nspecific prisons, and specific jails where the incidence of rape is \nextraordinarily high. It also directs the Attorney General to provide \ninformation, assistance, and training for Federal, State, and local \nauthorities on the prevention, investigation, and punishment of prison \nrape. It authorizes $40 million in grants to strengthen the ability of \nState and local officials to prevent these abuses.\n  Finally, the act establishes a commission that will conduct hearings \nin the next 2 years and recommend national correctional standards on \nissues such as staff training, inmate classification, investigation of \nrape complaints, trauma care for rape victims, and disease prevention.\n  These standards should apply as soon as possible to the Federal \nBureau of Prisons. Prison accreditation organizations that receive \nFederal funding will be required to adopt the standards. Each State \nmust certify either that it has adopted and is in full compliance with \nthe national standards, or that the State will use 5 percent of prison-\nrelated Federal grants to come into compliance with the standards. \nStates that fail to make a certification will have their grants reduced \nby 5 percent.\n  The Prison Rape Elimination Act is an important first step. We know \nthat prison education programs reduce recidivism and facilitate the \nreentry of prisoners into society. Pell grant eligibility should be \nrestored to prisoners who are scheduled for release. Because the high \nincidence of HIV and hepatitis B and C in prisoners threatens the \nhealth of many others, medical testing and treatment for infected \nprisoners should be expanded and improved. Congress should also repeal \nthe provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act that prevent inmates \nwho have been abused from raising their claims in court.\n  I commend our Senate and House colleagues for their strong support of \nthe Prison Rape Elimination Act, and I look forward to its enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9703-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on September \n17, 2001. In Wilmington, DE, a 25-year-old man was charged with a hate \ncrime after he and a 22-year-old friend fled a liquor store with \nseveral bottles of alcohol. When the Middle Eastern manager of the \nstore attempted to stop the pair, the thief yelled, ``Bin Laden, you're \ngoing to pay for it,'' before striking him.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9703-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9703-S9704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

The family was \nreunited in Los Angeles when he was 2 years old, moving to suburban \nBaldwin Park. He competed on the Sierra Vista High School track team \nand also ran in a Los Angeles marathon. Upon graduation, he joined the \nNational Guard. When his tour of duty ended, he transferred to the \nArmy.\n  Sergeant Marin was assigned to Battery C, 3rd Battalion, 16th Field \nArtillery Regiment, and died on June 3, when his checkpoint south of \nBalad, Iraq, was attacked with gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades. \nHe was 27 years old.\n  He last saw his family during a January leave, 2 months before he \nleft for the Middle East. He called home twice in April and sent a \nMother's Day card that read: ``Don't worry, be happy.''\n  A native of Eureka, CA, CPT Andrew David La Mont was the youngest of \nnine children and came from a family with strong ties to the military. \nHis father and grandfather were career military men.\n  ``He was a tremendous son and a fantastic marine,'' said his mother, \nVivian La Mont. He was single and had served with the Marines since \ngraduating from San Diego State University in 1994. La Mont had \npreviously served in Kosovo and Afghanistan.\n  Twenty-one-year-old LCPL Jason Moore was described as a rather wild \nyoung man with a boundless spirit, whose enthusiasm led him to the \nMarine Corps.\n  Moore died on May 19 in Iraq when the CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter he \nhelped crew crashed into a canal. Four other Camp Pendleton marines \nwere killed in the same incident.\n  His parents, Bill and Gale Moore, buried their only son at Fort \nRosecrans National Cemetery.\n  He graduated from San Marcos High School in 2000. His neighbor Deane \nTerry said Moore was clearly bound for Marine aviation from a young \nage, after his interest in the Civil Air Patrol and radio-controlled \nplanes.\n  ``He was going to continue to aim high one way or another,'' said \nTerry, whose son was Moore's playmate. Terry described the day Moore \nreturned from Marine boot camp and stood straight and proud in his \nuniform in the Terry living room.\n  ``He was so excited to be a Marine,'' said Terry, who added that \nMoore joined the high school swim team just to prepare himself \nphysically for the service. ``He went at the Corps at full speed, not \nhesitating, not looking back.''\n  PVT Jose Gonzalez spoke very little English when he arrived as a \nfreshman at John Glenn High School in Norwalk, CA. By the time he \ngraduated in 2001, he had earned high honors in college preparatory \nclasses.\n  The Mexican native also played varsity baseball, becoming a player \nwho coach Bill Seals could count on at nearly any position: pitching or \nplaying in the outfield or infield. He always wore his team hat to \nschool, every day, year-round. The coach said it was about pride.\n  With his diploma in hand, Gonzalez embraced another part of American \nlife: the military. He entered the Marine Corps 2 months after \ngraduation and became a supply clerk.\n  Gonzalez deployed to Iraq with Camp Pendleton's 1st Force Service \nSupport Group and survived the war. On May 12, he was killed when \nordnance he was handling detonated. He was just 19 years old.\n  In Norwalk, Gonzalez is survived by parents and two teenage sisters. \nGonzalez was not forgotten at his old high school. John Glenn students \nhave created a memorial on the auditorium stage--they leave flowers, \ncandles, and signs offering tribute to the soft-spoken man who died for \nhis adopted country.\n  The last time Paul Tokuzo Nakamura, of Santa Fe Springs, called home \nfrom Iraq was on Father's Day, when he told his family that all was \nwell.\n  ``The first thing he told me was that he had showered and had steak \nfor dinner,'' his father, Paul Nakamura, said Wednesday. ``We know he \nwas lying. He didn't want us to worry.''\n  The 21-year-old Nakamura joined the Army Reserves out of patriotism \ndespite his father's protests.\n  ``One day he said, 'Mom, Dad, I'm so proud I was born in the United \nStates,''' his mother, Yoko, 55, told those gathered at a memorial \nservice.\n  Nakamura was stationed with the 437th Medical Company, based in \nColorado Springs, CO. He was sent to the Middle East in February and \nwas killed on June 19, when the ambulance he was in was struck by a \nrocket-propelled grenade in Al Iskandariyah, south of Baghdad.\n  ``He was a rascal--you would tell him not to do something, and he \nwould do it anyway,'' said his sister, Pearl. He was a lifeguard who \ntaught swimming at the Santa Fe Springs Aquatic Center since he was 17 \nand was on his high school's water polo team.\n  Twenty-five-year-old Army Ranger Andrew Chris followed in the \nfootsteps of his relatives when he joined the military in 2001. Both of \nhis grandfathers served in World War II, his father served in the Army, \nhis uncle in Special Forces and his brother Derek in the Navy. It was a \nway to connect with the generations of his family.\n  Chris was killed in combat operations on June 25, just a few days \nafter arriving in Iraq. Ordnance exploded near the vehicle Chris was \nriding in, and the Army Ranger died immediately.\n  Before Chris joined the Army, he lived for 5 years in California, \nmost of them in San Diego. After he graduated from high school in \nFlorence, AL, he moved to Lemoore, south of Fresno, to live with his \nbrother.\n  He spent many weekends exploring and camping in the mountains of \nCalifornia and Arizona. He was also well read, with a special interest \nin World War II and planned to teach high school history when he \ncompleted his military career.\n  Andrew Chris was quiet and reserved, and extremely loyal to family \nand friends. He had visited his brother Derek's family just before he \nwas sent to Iraq.\n  Josh Chris said knowing that his brother died doing what he loved has \nmade it easier to accept. ``He was spiritually and emotionally ready.''\n  From the outset of the conflict in Iraq, I have learned a great deal \nabout those who have died from the local newspapers. Yet there have \nbeen a few individuals whose stories remain largely untold to the \npublic.\n  One of those is Marine CPL Douglas Jose Marencoreyes, a 28-year-old \nfrom Chino, who was assigned to the Light Armored Vehicle-Air Defense \nBattery, 4th Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion. He was killed when \nthe transport truck he was riding in rolled over.\n  I also learned relatively little about 19-year-old Ryan Cox, from \nDerby, KS, who was stationed at 29 Palms, CA, and died due to a \nnoncombat weapons discharge on June 15.\n  Still, we know that he loved to surf and skydive and that, according \nto his mother, Robin Hamilton, he was doing what he wanted to do. ``He \nwas serving his country. I couldn't have asked for a better son.''\n  Nor, for that matter, could the United States. We must never forget \nto remind those left behind--mothers and fathers, wives and children--\nof how proud we are of America's brave sons and daughters.\n  We must never lose sight of their achievement or their sacrifice, not \nto mention the enormous sacrifices made by their families, the ones \nleft behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9704-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9704-S9705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION CONGRESSIONAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, it has become clear that \nwelfare programs created in the 1960s to be safety nets became spider \nwebs by the 1990s. The old welfare system provided monetary assistance \nbut did not do enough to provide job training, education, and other \npaths towards self-sufficiency. The welfare reforms of 1996 changed the \nold system and gave States more freedom to attempt new and innovative \napproaches to move people from welfare to work.\n  This legislation expired last year, and Congress must look to enhance \nthe successes of the 1996 law. I am pleased today to join Senator \nCarper in cosponsoring the Building on Welfare Reform Act--a bill that \nwill continue to help people move from welfare to work.\n  During my time as Governor, Nebraska began programs like Employment \nFirst and Families First that provided much-needed assistance to low-\nincome families and helped them find a way to leave the cycle of \nwelfare dependency. The average time a family spent on assistance fell \nnearly two-thirds and Nebraska taxpayers saved $14 million.\n  The best path to self-sufficiency is work. This bill increases the \npercentage of welfare recipients who must work from 50 to 70 over the \nnext 5 years. The bill also requires a 32-hour workweek from able \nwelfare recipients. States will receive credit for moving people from \nwelfare to work, not just off welfare. This will encourage States to \nsolve problems that present an obstacle to meaningful work and lasting \nindependence from public assistance programs.\n  Since 1996, welfare reform has been successful, not just because it \nrequires work but also because it provides the resources to families to \nmeet the work requirements. Our welfare reform proposal provides \nfunding for childcare, transitional jobs, and public-private \neducational partnerships that will allow welfare recipients to gain the \nskills they need to advance in the workplace and become independent.\n  Because a strong family is essential to breaking the cycle of \npoverty, our welfare reform proposal encourages families to stay \ntogether and provides assistance to families who do. Another provision \nprovides additional funds to prevent teen pregnancy with a bonus to \nStates that meet this goal.\n  Given flexibility and resources, States have worked their own magic \nsince the welfare program was revamped, and I will continue to support \nthis approach as we embark on the next generation of welfare reform.\n\n\n                           TRIBUTE TO INTERNS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I extend my appreciation to my \nsummer 2003 class of interns: Anne Wilzbacher, Joanna Busch, Angela \nWilson, Cliff Sullivan, Nick Herbold, Alex Nelson, Omar Ul Haq, Theresa \nReilly, Derek Wulf, Kalsoom Lakhani, Dave Townsend, Haley Wallace, Josh \nCraft, Ermira Babamusta, Becca North, Abby Smith, Michael Kuehner, \nCharles Monterio and Carolyn Timberlake. Each of them has been a \ntremendous assistance to me and to the people of Iowa over the past \nseveral months, and their efforts have not gone unnoticed.\n  Since I was first elected into the Senate in 1984, my office has \noffered internships to young Iowans and other interested students. \nThrough their work in the Senate, our interns have not only seen the \nlegislative process, but also personally contributed to our Nation's \ndemocracy.\n  It is with much appreciation that I recognize Anne, Joanna, Angela, \nCliff, Nick, Alex, Omar, Theresa Derek, Kalsoom, Dave, Haley, Josh, \nErmira, Becca, Abby, Michael, Charles and Carolyn for their hard work \nthis summer. It has been a delight to watch them take on their \nassignments with enthusiasm and hard work. I am very proud to have \nworked with each of them. I hope they take from their summer a sense of \npride in what they've been able to accomplish and an increased interest \nin public service and our democratic system and process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9705-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HONORING ANGELA CONNOLLY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ngovernment leadership exemplified by Angela Connolly, the Chairwoman of \nthe Polk County Board of Supervisors, in Des Moines, IA, who has been \nselected the National County Leader of the Year. American City and \nCounty, a national magazine about local government, honored Angela at \nthe 2003 Annual Conference of the National Association of Counties that \ntook place earlier this month. I have known Angela many years, and can \ntestify to her commitment to the use of government in making people's \nlives better.\n  Angela has exercised her leadership on a number of issues that have \ngreatly impacted Iowa's capital city in a positive way. Her advocacy \nand tireless work on the Iowa Events Center will bring a premiere \nentertainment and athletics venue to central Iowa, and she was key in \nsecuring Vision Iowa funding for the Capital City Vision Projects, \nwhich include a new science center, a higher education learning center, \na riverwalk, and a home for the World Food Prize. Angela also led the \nboard of supervisors through a reorganization that significantly \nreduced a budget deficit and brought about efficiencies in the delivery \nof county services.\n  Angela Connolly was elected to the Polk County Board of Supervisors \nin 1998, and is currently serving her second term and is the 2003 \nchairperson. Prior to her election, Angela served more than 20 years as \na Polk County employee. Angela is active in many civic and community \nactivities, serving on a dozen boards and commissions and nearly 20 \nadditional committees and community organizations. A champion of health \nand human services, she serves on boards advocating for services for \nchildren, persons with disabilities, and mental health treatment. Among \nthe boards she serves are: the Metro Mayors Group, Greater Des Moines \nPartnership, Greater Des Moines Convention and Visitors Bureau, Polk \nCounty Housing Trust Fund, Metropolitan Advisory Council, Polk County \nHealth Services, Polk County Correctional Services, and the Des Moines \nArts Festival.\n  Angela Connolly is an exemplary leader in county government, who \nserves her constituents with honor and integrity. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with her to make Iowa a great place to call \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9705-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9705-S9706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE CLARK COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I pay tribute to the Clark County \nFire Department and its personnel for their progress in improving fire \nprotection for the citizens of Clark County. Their recent \naccomplishments have not gone unnoticed.\n  Through hard work and increased investment in manpower, equipment, \ntraining, and facilities, the firefighters of Clark County have made \ngreat strides to serve their fellow Kentuckians. They finished \nconstruction of the Rogers-Parrish Fire Station No. 3 in Trapp which \ncompliments the fire protection provided by the main station on Barnes \nDrive and Station No. 2 on Fulton Road. Cooperation by the City of \nWinchester was instrumental to increasing fire protection by investing \nin better fire hydrants, better water distribution systems, and more \nadvanced fire training facilities.\n  While funding is a significant component to improving fire \nprotection, no dollar sign can be placed on the bravery, courage, and \ncommitment inherent in those who put themselves into harm's way to \nprotect those in danger. The firefighters of the Clark County Fire \nDepartment are heroes to so many and deserve our gratitude. At a \nmoment's notice, they can be relied upon to respond to any emergency \nregardless of the circumstances to assure the safety of those in need.\n  As our Nation takes measures to strengthen our homeland security, it\n\n[[Page S9706]]\n\nwill be imperative that fire departments throughout Kentucky and across \nAmerica follow the example of the Clark County Fire Department and work \nwith local municipalities to improve fire protection services. I am \nproud of their efforts and am grateful for how well they have \nrepresented the Commonwealth. I thank the Senate for allowing me to \nrecognize the Clark County Fire Department and its personnel for their \nservice to their community and to our Nation.

CLARK\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I pay tribute to Thomas D. Clark, \nKentucky's most prominent historian. On Monday, July 14, 2003, Mr. \nClark celebrated his 100th birthday, Remarkably, Mr. Clark's life has \nspanned nearly half of Kentucky's history.\n  Thomas Clark is an esteemed southern historian and writer, agrarian \nand preservationist. Having grown up on a cotton farm in Mississippi, \nMr. Clark came to the State as a graduate student enrolled in the \nUniversity of Kentucky in 1928. Less than 3 years later he decided to \nsettle in Kentucky and delve into its history.\n  In 1937, Mr. Clark's ``A History in Kentucky'' was published, and it \nis still considered the definitive work on Kentucky history by the \nState Department for Libraries and Archives. Mr. Clark was declared \nKentucky's historian laureate for life in 1990, and to this day, \nmaintains his enthusiasm and passion for Kentucky history. That he \nlived and experienced much of the history he wrote is testament to this \nman's inimitable and authoritative qualities.\n  In addition to being Kentucky's premier historian, Mr. Clark paid the \nState a great service by saving part of its history. In 1936 he stopped \nthe State librarian, who had run out of storage space, from selling \ntruckloads of records as scrap. He then encouraged the Governor to \ncreate a State archive and established a special documents collection \nat the University of Kentucky's library.\n  Mr. Clark's ardor for Kentucky and its history and his tenacity for \nhistorical preservation makes this man one of Kentucky's greatest \nheroes. For generations to come, Kentucky will be indebted to this man. \nI thank the Senate for allowing me to recognize Mr. Clark and voice his \npraises. He is Kentucky at its finest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9706-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HINSDALE CELEBRATES ITS 250TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today in honor of Hinsdale, NH. This \ngreat American community is celebrating the 250th anniversary of its \nfounding, and I am proud to recognize this historic event.\n  Over 4,000 people call themselves citizens of Hinsdale. From the \ntown's incorporation in 1753 through today, they have made enormous \ncontributions to not only New Hampshire's economic and cultural \nheritage but to our country's as well. Colonel Ebenezer Hinsdale, who \nmany consider to be the founder of the town, was described as a ``man \nfor all seasons.'' He was a missionary, a farmer, a soldier and a \nconservationist long before that term became commonplace. He built Fort \nHinsdale and served in the French and Indian Wars. He truly was a man \nof action. It is therefore appropriate that this community bears his \nsurname because successive generations of residents have continued to \nbuild upon the example he set. For example, Charles A. Dana, a Hinsdale \nnative, served as the Assistant Secretary of War during the Civil War \nand later was the editor of the old New York Sun, one of the most \nprominent daily newspapers in its day. Another native, Jacob Estey, \nfounded and manufactured the Estey Organ which was a must-have musical \ninstrument in the late 1800's. William Haile became the first \nRepublican Governor of New Hampshire in 1857 when the Republicans were \nstill a fledgling party. Clearly, he must have possessed strong \nleadership qualities.\n  In addition, Hinsdale can rightly claim to be the birthplace of the \nautomobile. In 1875, George A. Long, then an apprentice in the Holman & \nMerriman machine shop, built and successfully demonstrated a steam car \nright in Hinsdale. The first test of his invention, which was described \nas a boiler set upon a carriage with regular wooden wheels, was \nscheduled to take place late one night that year to avoid \nembarrassment. Of course, news of the test leaked out and a curious \ncrowd gathered to watch George Long's car run a few yards then stop. He \nmade improvements in it and he, and his invention, soon became known \nfor running horses and buggies right off the road. He later built a \nsecond steam auto with an advanced two-cylinder engine. This auto \nincluded adjustable seats for two, rubber tires, two speeds and front \nwheel brakes. Truly, George Long was a man ahead of his time.\n  All of these people and their stories illustrate the rich heritage \nfor which Hinsdale can rightly be proud. It is my honor to salute the \ncitizens of this great community as they celebrate Hinsdale's 250th \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9706-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE \n              ASSOCIATION CONGRESSIONAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \nAmerican Political Science Association on five decades of tremendous \nsuccess in its Congressional Fellowship Program. Since 1953, the \nA.P.S.A. has trained and supported over 1800 Fellows, bringing top \nacademic scholars, political journalists, experienced public servants, \nand others to the Hill. For 9 months, they learn from and contribute to \nthe political process. These Fellows include political scientists, \nsociologists, journalists, domestic and foreign policy specialists, \nphysicians, Native American Hatfield Fellows, staff from other \nlegislative bodies, and international scholars. All of them have \nbenefited greatly from the opportunity to take part in the legislative \nprocess, and Congress as an institution has been improved by their \nparticipation.\n  Throughout my careers in both the House and in the Senate, I have had \nthe pleasure of hosting A.P.S.A. Congressional Fellows in my office. \nBeginning in 1985, I have hosted eight Fellows, two of whom are with my \noffice now. Joe Bowersox, an associate professor of political science \nat Willamette University in Salem, OR, works on forestry issues, \nwildfire prevention, and a host of other environmental issues. Thad \nKousser, an assistant professor of political science at the University \nof California, San Diego has assisted with the budget, health care, and \npreventing government waste. Like all of the Fellows I host, they are \ntreated as professional staff. They have prepared me for hearings, met \nwith constituents and policy experts, drafted statements, worked out of \nmy State offices in Oregon, and helped me to craft legislation.\n  I am able to give so much responsibility to A.P.S.A. Fellows because \nthey have gone through such extensive training in their program. In the \nfall before they begin work, the Fellows attend 3 weeks of intensive \ninstruction in a broad range of domestic and foreign policy issues as \nwell as practical politics. The training is hosted by the Johns Hopkins \nSchool of Advanced International Studies and taught by a collection of \nWashington's top experts. After this orientation, the Fellows attend a \n4-day Advanced Legislative Institute Seminar run by the Congressional \nResearch Service. Even after they have joined an office, the Fellows \ncontinue their education by attending the Wilson Seminar Series on \nFriday afternoons. This comprehensive preparation is a large part of \nwhat has made the program so successful.\n  The program has also benefited from the enduring commitment of the \nAmerican Political Science Association to keep the connections between \nacademia and Congress strong. It is administered out of the \nAssociation's national headquarters and has in recent years been \nexpertly led by Jeff Biggs, a former A.P.S.A. Fellow himself. Other \ndistinguished alumni of the program include Thomas Mann, Norman \nOrnstein, Rep. Bob Filner, former Rep. Steve Horn, and Vice President \nDick Cheney. I hope that the next 50 years of the Fellowship will be as \nsuccessful as its first five decades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9706-4", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9706-S9707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S9707]]\n\nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9707-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9707-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT DETAILING THE PROGRESS OF SPENDING BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH \n DURING THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF FISCAL YEAR 2003 IN SUPPORT OF PLAN \n                            COLOMBIA--PM 46\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Appropriations:\nTo The Congress of The United States:\n  Consistent with section 3204(e), Public Law 106-246, I am providing a \nreport prepared by my Administration detailing the progress of spending \nby the executive branch during the first two quarters of Fiscal Year \n2003 in support of Plan Colombia.\n                                                      George W.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to tax issues related to the phase out of the \n     Oldsmobile; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 192\n\n       Whereas, The phase out of the Oldsmobile line of General \n     Motors is bringing to a close an historic chapter in American \n     automotive history. The end of this component of one of the \n     world's largest corporations also has significant \n     administrative and tax considerations that need to be \n     addressed quickly to provide for a fair and smooth transition \n     for those whose livelihoods are jeopardized; and\n       Whereas, As compensation for the loss of years of goodwill \n     and the erosion of the value of large financial investments, \n     Oldsmobile dealerships will be paid a one-time settlement. As \n     federal tax laws now stand, this payment would be subject to \n     personal and business federal taxes as income. In reality, \n     however, the settlement money clearly should be categorized \n     as involuntary converted property. Under this determination, \n     the manufacturer's settlement would be treated like other \n     property that can be converted to similar purposes over a \n     specific period of time; and\n       Whereas, Every effort should be made to encourage the \n     reinvestment of settlement resources to mitigate job loss, \n     lessen the economic stress to local communities, and protect \n     families from more serious financial difficulties. In \n     addition, it would be poor public policy for the federal \n     government to reap a tax revenue windfall as a result of this \n     rare and unique situation; and\n       Whereas, As the home of the Olds automotive legacy and 20 \n     of the top 50 Oldsmobile dealerships, Michigan has a major \n     stake in the fair treatment of these businesses and \n     individuals. It would be wrong for the tax code to act as a \n     disincentive to the reinvestment of the settlement dollars in \n     job-creating enterprises; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact H.R. \n     2374 to amend the Internal Revenue Code to consider certain \n     transitional dealer assistance related to\n\n[[Page S9708]]\n\n     the phase out of Oldsmobile as an involuntary conversion; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States House, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9708-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REPORTS OF COMMITTEES--Monday, July 21, 2003\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Ms. COLLINS, from the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 481.

A bill to expand the Federal tax refund intercept program to \ncover children who are not minors; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the Child \nSupport Fairness and Tax Refund Interception Act of 2003 today.\n  The Child Support Fairness and Tax Refund Interception Act of 2003 \ncloses a loophole in current Federal statute by expanding the \neligibility of one of the most effective means of enforcing child \nsupport orders--that of intercepting the Federal tax refunds of parents \nwho are delinquent in paying their court-ordered financial support for \ntheir children.\n  Under current law, eligibility for the Federal tax refund offset \nprogram is limited to cases involving minors, parents on public \nassistance, or adult children who are disabled. Custodial parents of \nadult, non-disabled children are not assisted under the IRS tax refund \nintercept program, and in many cases, they must work multiple jobs in \norder to make ends meet. Some of these parents have gone into debt to \nput their college-age children through school.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will address this inequity by \nexpanding the eligibility of the Federal tax refund offset program to \ncover parents of all children, regardless of whether the child is \ndisabled or a minor. This legislation will not create a cause of action \nfor a custodial parent to seek additional child support. It will merely \nassist the custodial parent in recovering debt that is owed for a level \nof child support that was determined by a court.\n  Improving our child support enforcement programs is an issue that \nshould be of concern to us all as it remains a serious problem in the \nUnited States. According to the most recent government statistics, \nthere are approximately seventeen million active cases in which a child \nsupport order requires a noncustodial parent to contribute to the \nsupport of his or her child. Of the almost $25 billion owed in 2001, \nonly $14 billion has been collected. In 1998, only 23 percent of \nchildren entitled to child support through our public system received \nsome form of payment, despite Federal and State efforts. Similar \nshortfalls in previous years bring the combined delinquency total to \napproximately $88 billion. We can fix this injustice in our federal tax \nrefund offset program by helping some of our most needy constituents \nreceive the financial assistance they are owed.\n  While previous Administrations have been somewhat successful in using \ntax refunds as a tool to collect child support payments, more needs to \nbe done. The IRS tax refund interception program has only collected \none-third of tardy child support payments. The Child Support Fairness \nand Tax Refund Interception Act of 2003 will remove the current barrier \nto fulfilling an individual's obligation to pay child support, while \nhelping to provide for the future of our nation's children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation, and ask unanimous consent that the text of legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1437\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Support Fairness and \n     Tax Refund Interception Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Enforcing child support orders remains a serious \n     problem in the United States. There are approximately \n     17,100,000 active cases in which a child support order \n     requires a noncustodial parent to contribute to the support \n     of his or her child. Of the $24,700,000,000 owed in 2001 \n     pursuant to such orders, $14,200,000,000, or 57 percent, has \n     been collected.\n       (2) It is an injustice for the Federal Government to issue \n     tax refunds to a deadbeat spouse while a custodial parent has \n     to work 2 or 3 jobs to compensate for the shortfall in \n     providing for his or her children.\n       (3) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) program to intercept \n     the tax refunds of parents who owe child support arrears has \n     been successful in collecting a tenth of such arrears.\n       (4) Congress has periodically expanded eligibility for the \n     IRS tax refund intercept program. Initially, the program was \n     limited to intercepting Federal tax refunds owed to parents \n     on public assistance. In 1984, Congress expanded the program \n     to cover parents not on public assistance. Finally, the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 made the program \n     permanent and expanded the program to cover parents of adult \n     children who are disabled.\n       (5) The injustice to the custodial parent is the same \n     regardless of whether the child is disabled, non-disabled, a \n     minor, or an adult, so long as the child support obligation \n     is provided for by a court or administrative order. It is \n     common for parents to help their adult children finance a \n     college education, a wedding, or a first home. Some parents \n     cannot afford to provide such help because they are \n     recovering from debt incurred to cover expenses that would \n     have been covered if the parent had been paid the child \n     support owed in a timely manner.\n       (6) This Act addresses such injustices by expanding the IRS \n     tax refund intercept program to cover parents of all adult \n     children, regardless of whether the child is disabled.\n       (7) This Act does not create a cause of action for a \n     custodial parent to seek additional child support. This Act \n     merely helps the custodial parent recover debt owed for a \n     level of child support that was set by a court after both \n     sides had the opportunity to present arguments about the \n     proper amount of child support.\n\n     SEC. 3. USE OF TAX REFUND INTERCEPT PROGRAM TO COLLECT PAST-\n                   DUE CHILD SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN WHO ARE \n                   NOT MINORS.\n\n       Section 464 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 664) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(2)(A), by striking ``(as that term is \n     defined for purposes of this paragraph under subsection \n     (c))''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) by striking ``(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     as used in'' and inserting ``In''; and\n       (ii) by inserting ``(whether or not a minor)'' after ``a \n     child'' each place it appears; and\n       (B) by striking paragraphs (2) and (3).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Inouye, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1438. A bill to provide for equitable compensation of the Spokane \nTribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation in settlement of claims the \nTribe concerning the contribution of the Tribe to the production of \nhydropower by the Grand Coulee Dam, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my friend and colleague Senator Murray, as well as the vice \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee Senator Inouye, that provides \nan equitable settlement to the Spokane Tribe of Indians. This bill \naddresses the decision of the Federal Government to take lands \nbelonging to the tribe in order to construct the Grand Coulee Dam on \nthe Columbia River.\n  For more than half a century, the Grand Coulee Project has made an \nextraordinary contribution to this Nation. It helped pull the economy \nout of the Great Depression. It provided the electricity that produced \naluminum required for airplanes and weapons that ensured our national \nsecurity. The project continues to produce enormous revenues for the \nUnited States, it is a key component of the agricultural economy in \neastern Washington, and plays a pivotal role in the electric systems \nserving the entire western United States.\n\n[[Page S9711]]\n\n  However, these benefits have come at a direct cost to tribal property \nthat became inundated when the U.S. Government built the Grand Coulee \nDam. Before dam construction, the free flowing Columbia River supported \nrobust and plentiful salmon runs and provided for virtually all of the \nsubsistence needs of the Spokane Tribe. After construction, the \nColumbia and its Spokane river tributary flooded tribal communities, \nschools, and roads, and the remaining stagnant water continues to erode \nreservation lands today.\n  The legislation Senators Inouye, Murray, and I are introducing today \nis similar to P.L. 103-436, which was enacted in 1994 to provide the \nneighboring Confederated Colville Tribes. This bill would provide the \nSpokane Tribe of Indians' with compensation that is directly \nproportional to the settlement afforded the Colville Tribes. \nSpecifically, the Spokane Tribe would receive 39.4 percent of the past \nand future compensation awarded the Colville Tribes pursuant to the \n1994 legislation. This percentage is based on the proportion of tribal \nlands impacted after the Federal Government built the Grand Coulee \nProject.\n  The United States has a trust responsibility to maintain and protect \nthe integrity of all tribal lands within its borders. When Federal \nactions physically or economically impact harm, our Nation has a legal \nresponsibility to address and compensate the damaged parties. \nUnfortunately, despite countless efforts, half a century has passed \nwithout justice to the Spokane people.\n  The time has come for the Federal Government to finally meet is \nfiduciary responsibility for converting the Spokane tribe's resources \nto its own benefit. Senators Inouye, Murray, and I believe that the \nlegislation we are proposing today will finally bring a fair and \nhonorable closure to these matters. We are pleased to see similar \nbipartisan legislation was introduced earlier this year in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I look forward to working with the Indian Affairs Committee and my \nSenate colleagues as this legislation proceeds through the Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no obligation, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1438\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the `Spokane Tribe of Indians of \n     the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable \n     Compensation Settlement Act.'\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) From 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the \n     Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its \n     tributaries to determine sites at which power could be \n     produced at low cost.\n       (2) The Corps of Engineers--\n       (A) identified a number of sites, including the site at \n     which the Grand Coulee Dam is located; and\n       (B) recommended that power development at those sites be \n     performed by local governmental authorities or private \n     utilities under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791 et \n     seq.).\n       (3) Under section 10(e) of that Act (16 U.S.C. 803(e)), a \n     licensee is required to compensate an Indian tribe for the \n     use of land under the jurisdiction of the Indian tribe.\n       (4) In August 1933, the Columbia Basin Commission, an \n     agency of the State of Washington, received a preliminary \n     permit from the Federal Power Commission for water power \n     development at the Grand Coulee site.\n       (5) In the mid-1930's, the Federal Government, which is not \n     subject to the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.)--\n       (A) federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project; and\n       (B) began construction of the Grand Coulee Dam.\n       (6) At the time at which the Grand Coulee Dam project was \n     federalized, the Federal Government recognized that the \n     Spokane Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n     Reservation had compensable interests in the Grand Coulee Dam \n     project, including compensation for--\n       (A) the development of hydropower;\n       (B) the extinguishment of a salmon fishery on which the \n     Spokane Tribe was almost completely financially dependent; \n     and\n       (C) the inundation of land with loss of potential power \n     sites previously identified by the Spokane Tribe.\n       (7) In the Act of June 29, 1940, Congress--\n       (A) in the first section (16 U.S.C. 835d) granted to the \n     United States--\n       (i) all rights of Indian tribes in land of the Spokane \n     Tribe and Colville Indian Reservations that were required for \n     the Grand Coulee Dam project; and\n       (ii) various rights-of-way over other land under the \n     jurisdiction of Indian tribes that were required in \n     connection with the project; and\n       (B) in section 2 (16 U.S.C. 835e) provided that \n     compensation for the land and rights-of-way was to be \n     determined by the Secretary of the Interior in such amounts \n     as the Secretary determined to be just and equitable.\n       (8) In furtherance of that Act, the Secretary of the \n     Interior paid--\n       (A) to the Spokane Tribe, $4,700; and\n       (B) to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, \n     $63,000.\n       (9) In 1994, following 43 years of litigation before the \n     Indian Claims Commission, the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit, Congress ratified an agreement between the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the \n     United States that provided for damages and annual payments \n     of $15,250,000 in perpetuity, adjusted annually, based on \n     revenues from the sale of electric power from the Grand \n     Coulee Dam project and transmission of that power by the \n     Bonneville Power Administration.\n       (10) In legal opinions issued by the Office of the \n     Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, a Task Force \n     Study conducted from 1976 to 1980 ordered by the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate, and hearings before Congress at \n     the time at which the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n     Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act (Public Law 103-\n     436; 108 Stat. 4577) was enacted, it has repeatedly been \n     recognized that--\n       (A) the Spokane Tribe suffered damages similar to those \n     suffered by, and had a case legally comparable to that of, \n     the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation; but\n       (B) the 5-year statute of limitations under the Act of \n     August 13, 1946 (25 U.S.C. 70 et seq.) precluded the Spokane \n     Tribe from bringing a civil action for damages under that \n     Act.\n       (11) The inability of the Spokane Tribe to bring a civil \n     action before the Indian Claims Commission can be attributed \n     to a combination of factors, including--\n       (A) the failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to carry \n     out its advisory responsibilities in accordance with that \n     Act; and\n       (B) an attempt by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to \n     impose improper requirements on claims attorneys retained by \n     Indian tribes, which caused delays in retention of counsel \n     and full investigation of the potential claims of the Spokane \n     Tribe.\n       (12) As a consequence of construction of the Grand Coulee \n     Dam project, the Spokane Tribe--\n       (A) has suffered the loss of--\n       (i) the salmon fishery on which the Spokane Tribe was \n     dependent;\n       (ii) identified hydropower sites that the Spokane Tribe \n     could have developed; and\n       (ii) hydropower revenues that the Spokane Tribe would have \n     received under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.) \n     had the project not been federalized; and\n       (B) continues to lose hydropower revenues that the Federal \n     Government recognized were owed to the Spokane Tribe at the \n     time at which the project was constructed.\n       (13) More than 39 percent of the land owned by Indian \n     tribes or members of Indian tribes that was used for the \n     Grand Coulee Dam project was land of the Spokane Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to provide fair and equitable \n     compensation to the Spokane Tribe, using the same \n     proportional basis as was used in providing compensation to \n     the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, for the \n     losses suffered as a result of the construction and operation \n     of the Grand Coulee Dam project.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING:\n  S. 1439. A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to reauthorize adoption incentives payments under section 473A of \nthat Act and to provide incentives for the adoption of older children; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, the Adoption Incentive Program has been a \nsuccessful program, which provides States with real incentives to find \npermanent homes for foster children. However, AIP's authorization \nexpires on September 30, 2003, and the program needs to be reauthorized \nthis year.\n  Under current law, States receive incentive payments for increasing \nthe number of adoptions from the public foster care system. The amount \nof payments is based on the number of adoptions above a State's \nbaseline, which is the highest number of adoptions in a State since \n1997.\n  Currently, States receive $4,000 for each foster child adopted above \nthe baseline number. The State can also receive $6,000 for each \nadoption above a baseline for children with special needs. While each \nState relies on individual criteria, ``special needs'' can include a \nchild's age, ethnicity, disability or having siblings.\n  AIP's success cannot be questioned. In fact, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, there was a 61 percent increase in \nadoptions of children from the public foster care system from 1997 to \n2001.\n  At the same time, states have earned about $144 million in adoption \nincentives for adoptions from 1998, to 2001. In my State, Kentucky has \nreceived about $1.6 million in adoption incentives during this time \nperiod.\n  However, it is now time to reauthorize and strengthen the program.\n  One of the biggest challenges in the foster care system today is \nfinding adoptive homes for older children. In fact, according to the \nAdoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, AFCARS, which \nis part of the Department of Health and Human Services, once children \nreach the age of 9, their chances of adoption diminish.\n  As of 2001, there were over 100,000 American children waiting to be \nadopted. Quit frankly, this is too many children waiting for loving \nhomes, regardless of their age. The bill I am introducing continues to \ngive States incentives to find homes for these kids, particularly older \nchildren.\n  My bill, the Adoption Incentive Program Reauthorization Act of 2003, \nreauthorizes the program from 2004 to 2008, at $43 million a year.\n  The bill continues to give States a payment of $4,000 for every child \nadopted above the State's baseline. Also, the bill requires States to \nestablish a separate baseline for adoptions of children over the age of \n9, and will provide a payment of $6,000 for all older children adopted \nabove the baseline.\n  Children deserve the stability and support of a permanent home and a \npermanent family. The Adoption Incentive Program has already proven \nsuccessful in encouraging states to act aggressively on a foster \nchild's behalf. It is now time to strengthen the program for the years \nto come.\n  I look forward to working on this issue with the other Members of \nCongress who are interested in adoption and hope we can get the program \nreauthorized soon.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1440. A bill to reform the Federal Bureau of Investigation; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am proud to be reintroducing the FBI \nReform Act of 2003 with Senator Patrick Leahy. This reform bill is \ndesigned to address the accountability problems that have plagued the \nFBI for years. For almost a decade, I have been engaged in FBI \noversight, and during that time, I have seen numerous scandals and \ncoverups. I am pleased to see that Director Mueller is committed to \nchanging the culture of the FBI. He is making good strides toward \novercoming past bad policies and procedures at the Bureau. However, \nCongress also has a role to play in this overhaul of the FBI.\n  A little over a year ago, a bill similar to this one was approved \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee. Since then, a number of the \nprovisions of that bill were enacted in separate legislation. However, \nsome of the most important provisions of that bill--provisions \nprotecting whistleblowers, creating a Security Career Program and \nCounterintelligence Polygraph Program, and ending the double standard \nfor discipline of senior FBI executives--have yet to be taken up by the \nfull Senate. These provisions are needed to maintain America's \nconfidence in the FBI.\n\n[[Page S9713]]\n\n  When I was growing up, I was surrounded by a generation that believed \nthe FBI could do no wrong. Yet today at a time when we rely on the FBI \nto protect us from acts of catastrophic terrorism that endanger the \nlives of the American people, a time when the need for confidence in \nthe FBI is at its greatest, Americans' trust and confidence in the FBI \nhas been shaken. Do not get me wrong, the majority of FBI agents and \nespecially those who are posted all over the heartland of this country, \nare honorable, hard working Federal servants who are doing a great job \nof protecting us from harm. However, there are a few bad apples that \nmust be dealt with because their actions give the Bureau a black eye. \nThe spy cases of Robert Hanssen and Chinese espionage in Los Angeles \nhave highlighted internal security problems. Retaliation against agents \nlike John Roberts, Frank Perry, and Patrick Kiernan, who did their duty \ninvestigating internal wrongdoing and spoke the truth to Congress, \nhighlight continuing cultural hostility to criticism. This bill goes a \nlong way to address these systemic problems and shore up trust and \nconfidence in the FBI in the wake of these concerns.\n  While Congress sometimes follows a hands-off approach to the FBI, the \nJudiciary Committees hearings and other oversight activities over the \nlast 2 or 3 years have highlighted the actions that Congress needs to \ntake to do its part in reforming the Bureau. The hearings that spurred \nthis legislation demonstrated the need to extend adequate whistleblower \nprotections to the FBI, enhance the Bureau's internal security program, \nend the double-standard for discipline, and modernize the FBI's \ninformation technology systems. These and additional management issues \nthe committee has explored are reflected in this bill. As the Patriot \nAct has increased the FBI's powers, as the American people have \nincreased their reliance on the FBI to stop terrorism, and as we \ncontinue to increase the FBI's funding, it is time for Congress to take \naction with a more hands-on approach. Let me provide some more detail \nabout the most important provisions of the FBI reform bill.\n  First, title I of the bill contains much needed protections for FBI \nwhistleblowers. As my colleagues know, I have long held that good \ngovernment requires that the brave men and women who blow the whistle \non wrongdoing be protected. It is my strong belief that disclosures of \nwrongdoing by whistleblowers are an integral part of our system of \nchecks and balances. However, although whistleblowers play a critical \nrole in ensuring that waste, fraud, and abuse are brought to light and \nthat public health and safety problems are exposed, the same \nwhistleblower protection laws that apply to almost all other Federal \nemployees do not currently apply to the FBI. In fact, it is a violation \nfor FBI agents to report problems to Congress. That restriction leaves \npatriotic, loyal FBI employees with little recourse. This bill will fix \nthat problem.\n  I truly believe that reform at the FBI will only occur when FBI \nemployees feel free to blow the whistle on wrongdoing. Without adequate \nwhistleblower protections, I am concerned that agents, such as Coleen \nRowley and others, who speak out about abuses and problems at the FBI \nwill be subject to retaliation. Thus, this bill finally gives FBI \nwhistleblowers the same rights and protections that other Federal \nemployees currently possess. When this bill is passed, FBI employees \nwho are retaliated against for blowing the whistle will be able to \navail themselves of all the protections afforded by the Whistleblower \nProtection Act.\n\n  In order to enhance internal security at the FBI, title II of the \nbill requires the FBI to establish a career security program and ensure \nthat appropriate management tools and resources are devoted to that \ntask. Modeled after the Department of Defense Acquisition Career \nProgram, security professional career development requirements would \nbring the FBI into line with the other Federal agencies that handle top \nsecret intelligence. This bill establishes and defines the Career \nSecurity Program and sets out the framework for career development and \ntraining in internal security. With the development of a Career \nSecurity Program, the FBI can meet the challenges of espionage, \ninformation technology vulnerability, and the threat of direct \nterrorist attack.\n  This bill requires the Attorney General to establish policies and \nprocedures for career management of FBI security personnel. It directs \nthe Director of the FBI to appoint a Director of Security who would \nchair a security career program board that would advise in the \nmanagement of hiring, training, education, and career development. The \nbill also requires the FBI Director to designate certain positions as \nsecurity positions. The bill requires that career paths to senior \npositions be published, and it ensures that all FBI personnel would \nhave the opportunity to acquire the education, training and experience \nneeded for senior security positions. Moreover, in order to ensure that \nsecurity professionals gain the stature that special agents enjoy, the \nbill provides that special agents would not have preference for \nsecurity positions and security positions could not be restricted to \nspecial agents unless the Attorney General makes a special \ndetermination.\n  Furthermore, the bill would direct that education, training, and \nexperience requirements be established for each position and that \nbefore assignment as a manager or a deputy manager of a significant \nsecurity program, a person would have to complete an accredited \nsecurity program management course and have at least 6 years security \nexperience, including 2 years in a similar program.\n  In addition to the Security Career Program, the bill will also \nenhance security through the creation of an FBI counterintelligence \npolygraph program. The program would consist of the periodic screening \nof employees and contractors who have access to sensitive information \nor restricted data. While the program recognizes the value of polygraph \nscreening, it also provides safeguards for those subject to polygraph \nexamination. The bill directs that the program have procedures to \naddress false positives, ensure quality control, requires that no \nadverse personnel action could be taken solely by reason of \nphysiological reaction on an exam without further investigation, and \nprovides that employees would have prompt access to unclassified \nreports of their exams that relate to adverse personnel action. Thus, \ntitle III provides increased security while at the same time protecting \nemployee rights.\n  Title IV requires the Attorney General to report on the legal \nauthority for the FBI's programs and activities. This report will help \nthe FBI focus on its most important duty--preventing terrorism--by \ncutting back on the FBI's jurisdiction, which has become cumbersome and \nunwieldy. Currently, the FBI investigates over 300 different Federal \noffenses, which are divided between violent crime, white collar crime, \norganized crime, drugs, national security, and civil rights. In many of \nthese areas, there are instances of concurrent or overlapping \njurisdiction with other Federal law enforcement agencies who specialize \nin investigating these crimes.\n  The FBI needs to scale back on the broad range of investigations \nwhich are duplicated by other Federal and State agencies. The Bureau \nneeds to completely jettison some of these areas and in other areas, \nthe Bureau could simply take a secondary role, allowing another agency \nto take the lead. In order to assist the FBI in scaling back its \njurisdiction, this bill directs the Attorney General to report to \nCongress on the legal authority for FBI programs and activities, \nidentifying those that have express statutory authority and those that \ndo not. The bill also requires the Attorney General to recommend what \ncriminal statutes for which he believes the FBI should have \ninvestigative responsibility.\n\n  Additionally, there exists a gross inequality in the way Senior \nExecutive Service, SES, employees of the FBI and rank and file agents \nare disciplined. SES employees are often given a slap on the wrist for \nan infraction, whereas the rank and file agents are often punished to \nthe letter of the law. Title V of the bill attempts to address this \ndouble standard. The bill attempts to address the double standard by \nproviding some flexibility in how SES employees can be punished. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee has heard repeatedly that this inflexibility \nis one of the main causes for the inequality in punishment at the FBI. \nUnder the current\n\n[[Page S9714]]\n\nsystem, the minimum suspension that an SES employee can receive is 14 \ndays. This means that the FBI's management is often left with the \nchoice of either an overly harsh penalty or no penalty at all. Often \nthey decide not to impose any meaningful disciplinary action.\n  In order to attempt to remedy this problem our bill lifts the 14-day \nminimum suspension for SES disciplinary cases to provide for additional \noptions in disciplining senior executive employees. Hopefully, this \nchange will help to remedy this double standard. In addition, our bill \nwould require the Office of Inspector General to submit to the \nJudiciary Committees of both houses, for 5 years, annual reports by the \nFBI Office of Professional Responsibility on its investigations, \nrecommendations, and their disposition including an analysis of whether \nany double standard is being employed.\n  Finally, title VI of the bill attempts to provide further enhancement \nto security at the Department of Justice as a whole. This title would \nimplement recommendations of the Webster Commission for enhancing \nsecurity at the DOJ. It requires the Attorney General to submit a \nreport to Congress on the manner by which the Department plans to \nimprove protection of security information at the DOJ. Moreover, this \ntitle authorizes funds to meet the demands for increased security at \nthe DOJ. Also, the bill would authorize funds for the DOJ Office of \nIntelligence Policy and Review to help meet the increased demands to \ncombat terrorism, process applications to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, participate effectively in counterespionage \ninvestigations, provide policy analysis and oversight on national \nsecurity matters, and enhance computer and telecommunications security.\n  Mr. President, I say to my fellow colleagues, it is time we acted on \nthe reforms in this bill. It has been almost a year since this bill \npassed unanimously out of committee. Let's act to reform the FBI and \nhelp maintain America's trust and confidence in the Bureau.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, with my \nfriend the senior Senator from Iowa, the FBI Reform Act of 2003.\n  This legislation stems from the lessons learned during a series of \nJudiciary Committee hearings on oversight of the FBI that I chaired \nbeginning in June 2001. The important changes which are being made \nunder the FBI's leadership after the September 11 attacks and the new \npowers granted the FBI by the USA PATRIOT Act have resulted in FBI \nreform becoming a pressing matter of national importance.\n  Since 9/11 and the anthrax attacks later that fall, we have relied on \nthe FBI to detect and prevent acts of catastrophic terrorism that \nendanger the lives of the American people and the institutions of our \ncountry. The men and women of the FBI are performing this task with \ngreat professionalism at home and abroad. We have all felt safer as a \nresult of the full mobilization of the FBI's dedicated Special Agents, \nits expert support personnel, and its exceptional technical \ncapabilities. We owe the men and women of the FBI our thanks.\n  For decades the FBI has been an outstanding law enforcement agency \nand a vital member of the United States intelligence community. As our \nhearings and recent events have shown, however, there is room for \nimprovement at the FBI. To fully rise to its current challenges, the \nFBI must face and understand the mistakes of the past and make the \nchanges needed to ensure that they are not repeated. In meeting the \ninternational terrorist challenge, the Congress has an opportunity and \nobligation to strengthen the institutional fiber of the FBI based on \nlessons learned from recent problems the Bureau has experienced.\n  This view is not mine alone. When FBI Director Mueller testified at \nhis confirmation hearings in July 2001, he forthrightly acknowledged \n``that the Bureau's remarkable legacy of service and accomplishment has \nbeen tarnished by some serious and highly publicized problems in recent \nyears. Waco, Ruby Ridge, the FBI lab, Wen Ho Lee, Robert Hanssen and \nthe McVeigh documents--these familiar names and events remind us all \nthat the FBI is far from perfect and that the next director faces \nsignificant management and administrative challenges.'' Since then, the \nJudiciary Committee has forged a constructive partnership with Director \nMueller to get the FBI back on track.\n  Congress sometimes has followed a hands-off approach about the FBI. \nBut with the FBI's new increased powers, with our increased reliance on \nthe Bureau to prevent terrorism, and with the increased funding \nprovided by the Congress should come increased scrutiny and \naccountability. Until the Bureau's problems are resolved and new \nchallenges overcome, we should be taking a hands-on approach.\n  Indeed our hearings and other oversight activities have highlighted \ntangible steps the Congress should take in an FBI Reform bill as part \nof this hands-on approach. Among other things, these hearings \ndemonstrated the need to extend whistleblower protection, end the \ndouble standard for discipline of senior FBI executives, and enhance \nthe FBI's internal security program to protect against espionage as \noccurred in the Hanssen case.\n  Director Mueller once said it is ``critically important'' that he \n``hears criticisms of the organization . . . in order to improve the \norganization.'' I could not agree more. More than ever, the FBI must be \nopen to new ideas, to criticism from within and without, and to facing \nup to and learning from past mistakes.\n  During the last Congress, the Judiciary Committee unanimously \napproved the Leahy-Grassley FBI Reform Act of 2001. Unfortunately, our \nbipartisan efforts were stymied by an anonymous Republican hold, which \nprevented the bill from being considered on the floor. While we did \neventually succeed in passing three of the bill's important reform \nprovisions as part of the Department of Justice authorization act, \nother needed reforms were senselessly blocked. These reforms, which \nremain as important and urgent as ever, are included in the bill we \nintroduce today.\n  There are five key elements of our bill.\n  First, it strengthens whistleblower protection for FBI employees and \nprotects them from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing.\n  Second, it addresses the issue of a double standard for discipline of \nsenior executives by eliminating the disparity in authorized \npunishments between Senior Executive Service members and other Federal \nemployees.\n  Third, it establishes an FBI Counterintelligence Polygraph Program \nfor screening personnel in exceptionally sensitive positions with \nspecific safeguards.\n  Fourth, it establishes an FBI Career Security Program, which would \nbring the FBI into line with other U.S. intelligence agencies that have \nstrong career security professional cadres whose skills and leadership \nare dedicated to the protection of agency information, personnel, and \nfacilities.\n  And fifth, it requires a set of reports that would enable Congress to \nengage the Executive branch in a constructive dialogue building a more \neffective FBI for the future.\n  The FBI Reform Act is designed to strengthen the FBI as an \ninstitution that has a unique role as both a law enforcement agency and \na member of the intelligence community. As the Judiciary Committee \ncontinues its oversight work and more is learned about recent FBI \nperformance, additional reforms may prove necessary. Especially \nimportant will be the lessons learned from the attacks of September 11, \nthe anthrax attacks, and implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act and \nother counterterrorism measures.\n  We need to help the FBI become as effective, as accountable and as \nagile as the American people need it to be to counter the threat of \nterrorism on our shores.\n  Strengthening the FBI cannot be accomplished overnight, but with this \nlegislation, we take an important step into the FBI's future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 1441. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect \nto false information regarding certain\n\n[[Page S9717]]\n\ncriminal violations concerning hoax reports of biological, chemical, \nand nuclear weapons; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The Protection \nAgainst Terrorist Hoaxes Act of 2003.'' This bill would amend Title 18 \nof the United States Code to, make it a Federal crime to knowingly make \na hoax report, involving a biological, chemical, nuclear weapon, or \nother weapon of mass destruction. Likewise, this bill would make it a \ncriminal offense to knowingly send such a hoax weapon to another.\n  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, our Nation has witnessed \na number of terror hoax reports. This in turn has triggered an equally \nlarge number of reports of suspected biological agents. No part of the \nNation has been spared, and my home State of Delaware has had several \nhundred reports of possible biological agents. The FBI has reported to \nCongress the staggering statistics involving these bioterrorism hoaxes \nand other reports of suspected biological agents. Prior to September \n11, the FBI had responded to about 100 cases involving potential use of \n``weapons of mass destruction,'' 67 of which involved alleged \nbiological weapons. Since mid-September 2001, however, that number has \nincreased by 3,000 percent.\n  The good news is that most of these reports were either hoaxes or \nreports made by well-meaning people whose suspicions were raised. The \nbad news is that any hoax reports were made in the first place, \ntriggering panic on the part of the public, and often forcing the \nFederal, State, and local governments to waste valuable time and \nresources responding to them. In one particularly egregious case, it \nhas been reported that an employee of the Connecticut Department of \nEnvironmental Protection falsely reported to security that he had found \na yellowish-white powder on his desk with the misspelled label \n``ANTHAX.'' The employee, a 48-year-old solid waste management analyst, \nknew the material was not toxic, it was determined to be coffee \ncreamer, but persisted in the false account. Eight hundred State \nemployees were evacuated from the building for 2 days while law \nenforcement officials tested the building, at a cost of $1.5 million in \nlost worker's time, another $40,000 in decontamination costs, and an \nundisclosed amount of money spent on rescue and law enforcement. The \nemployee is being charged in Federal court--not for the hoax report, \nbut for lying to Federal officials after the fact.\n  Indeed, the Justice Department reported to Congress that there is a \ngap in the existing Federal law regarding the prosecution of \nbioterrorism hoaxes. That is, while it is a crime to threaten to use, \nfor example, anthrax as a weapon against another person, it is not a \ncrime to make a hoax anthrax report. Accordingly, the Justice \nDepartment has repeatedly asked Congress to enact legislation which \nspecifically addresses hoaxes which involve purported biological \nsubstances, as well as chemical, nuclear and other weapons of mass \ndestruction. Just this month, the Justice Department stated in \ntestimony, ``changes in title 18 to expand the reach of the law to \nprohibit conduct resulting in such hoaxes would provide prosecutors \nwith an appropriate tool to respond to these situations.''\n  We should answer the call and act now to give law enforcement the \ntools they need to combat these despicable crimes. The Federal interest \nis indisputable, as States and localities are simply not equipped with \nthe expertise or resources to evaluate and respond to these hoaxes. A \ncomprehensive prohibition on such false reports is necessary to \npreserve scarce and vital Federal resources.\n  Accordingly, as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nCrime, Corrections and Victims' Rights, I introduce a bill today which \ncontains both criminal provisions and civil penalties for the hoax \nreporting of bioterrorism incidents. My bill simply says that if you \nknowingly engage in conduct--such as deliberately sending baking powder \nthrough the mail to your congressman or calling 911 to falsely report \nthe presence of anthrax in a public building--that is likely to create \nthe false impression concerning the presence of anthrax, or other \nsimilar things, that you have committed A Federal offense, punishable \nby up to 5 years in jail. Moreover, such a person may be fined the \ngreater of either $10,000 or the amount of money expended by the \ngovernment to respond to the false information. Finally, such a person \nmay also be ordered to reimburse the government if costs were incurred \nin responding to the false hoax. Let me be clear--this bill will not \ntarget innocent mistakes or people who make a report concerning a \nsuspected substance; it is aimed, rather, at deliberate hoax reports by \nthose who know they are spreading false information.\n  I have said many times on the floor of this body that the terrorist \nwin if they succeed in sowing seeds of panic into our daily lives. We \ncannot and will not let that happen. Similarly, we will not let these \nhoaxers get away with words and deeds which have the same effect. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Protection Against Terrorist Hoaxes \nAct of 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 1442. A bill to preserve the political independence of the \nNational Women's Business Council; to the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the National Women's Business Council \nprovides Congress, the Small Business Administration, and the \nInteragency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise with independent \nadvice and policy recommendations to foster women's business ownership. \nNow many of my colleagues may not know a great deal about the Council, \nits members, and what they do. But I can tell you that as a member of \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, the \nCouncil's advice is very helpful as we develop legislation that affects \nsmall businesses throughout the country.\n  The Council has broad latitude to address nearly any issue that it \nconsiders to be important for women in business. Whether it relates to \nhealth insurance, the economy, or fiscal policies, the Council brings a \nunique and valuable perspective. Women make up 46 percent of the \nNation's executive, administrative and managerial occupations and head \nup 7.1 million sole proprietorships. The National Women's Business \nCouncil is their voice.\n  The Council's independent voice is the key to its success and \ninfluence. The structure of the Council helps to maintain that \nindependence. The Council has 15 members. The Chair is appointed by the \nPresident and must be a prominent businesswoman. Six members come from \nwomen's business organizations, including representatives of women's \nbusiness center sites. The remaining eight members are political \nappointees, split evenly between Democrats and Republicans. These \npolitical slots are appointed by the SBA Administrator based upon the \nrecommendations of the Chair and Ranking Members of the Senate Business \nand Entrepreneurship Committee and the House Small Business Committee. \nAll of these ``party-affiliated'' members must be small business \nowners.\n  This bipartisan balance in the Council's membership helps to ensure \nthat any policy recommendations or positions the Council takes will \nreflect the needs of women in business and not the political agenda of \none political party over another. Certainly, the political balance is \nnot completely even because the Chair is appointed by the President, \nbut the Democrats have a strong voice with four members on the Council. \nThat will only be true, however, as long as the Democratic seats are \nfilled.\n  Unfortunately, this has not always been the case. Vacancies on the \nCouncil are supposed to be filled no later than 30 days after a seat \nbecomes open. However, over the past two years, the SBA has routinely \nfailed to meet this 30-day statutory deadline. The Council Chair was \nvacant from May 29, 2001 to May 21, 2002, a period of 11 months and 22 \ndays. As a result, the Council could not even meet.\n  Vacancies in the party-affiliated seats hurt the Council's \nindependence. Of the party-affiliated seats reserved for the \nPresident's party, one seat was vacant for three months; two were \nvacant for a period of seven months; and another went vacant for 21 \nmonths. Two of the seats reserved for Democrats remained vacant for \nnearly two years, another seat was vacant for seven months, and the \nfourth seat remains vacant today. In the past, these\n\n[[Page S9718]]\n\nvacancies have not been filled in a manner consistent with maintaining \na bipartisan balance and the independence of the Council. Let me give \nyou an example.\n\n  In February of this year the Council announced its support for \nAssociation Health Plans. This is an important issue for many small \nbusinesses and for the economy on the whole. At the time, the Council \nhad three Republican members and no Democrats. Regardless of what \nopinion you may have of the Association Health Plans issue, the \nCouncil's position can be dismissed by some as being political because \nof the partisan imbalance on the Council at the time it made its \nendorsement. Instead of being an unquestioned resource for Congress and \npolicy makers to rely on, the Council faces potential criticism that it \nis nothing more than a mouthpiece for one party over another.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to protect the independence of \nthe Council. The National Women's Business Council Independence \nPreservation Act of 2003 will ensure that the Council maintains its \nvalue as an advisor to Congress and the Administration. This measure \nsimply requires that vacancies in the party-affiliated seats be filled \nevenly so that the Council maintains a bipartisan balance. This will \nhelp to ensure that the Council's policy advice is free from any \npartisan taint.\n  My legislation also ensures accountability by requiring the SBA \nAdministrator to report to Congress on vacancies that remain unfilled \nfor more than 30 days. The report must cite the reasons for the \nvacancies, what is causing any delays in filling the positions, whether \nnominees were available for consideration, at what stage in the vetting \nprocess nominees are, whether there are any objections to the nominees \nand what those objections are, an estimate for when the vacancies will \nbe filled, and any other relevant information relating to the \nvacancies.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Women's Business \n     Council Independence Preservation Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Women's Business Council provides an \n     independent source of advice and policy recommendations \n     regarding women's business development and the needs of women \n     entrepreneurs in the United States to--\n       (A) the President;\n       (B) Congress;\n       (C) the Interagency Committee on Women's Business \n     Enterprise; and\n       (D) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration.\n       (2) The members of the National Women's Business Council \n     are small business owners, representatives of business \n     organizations, and representatives of women's business \n     centers.\n       (3) The chair and ranking member of the Committee on Small \n     Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Small Business of the House of Representatives make \n     recommendations to the Administrator to fill 8 of the \n     positions on the National Women's Business Council. Four of \n     the positions are reserved for small business owners who are \n     affiliated with the political party of the President and four \n     of the positions are reserved for small business owners who \n     are not affiliated with the political party of the President. \n     This method of appointment ensures that the National Women's \n     Business Council will provide Congress with non-partisan, \n     balanced, and independent advice.\n       (4) In order to maintain the independence of the National \n     Women's Business Council and to ensure that the Council \n     continues to provide Congress with advice on a non-partisan \n     basis, it is essential that the Council maintain the \n     bipartisan balance established under section 407 of the \n     Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 7107).\n\n     SEC. 3. MAINTAINING THE POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE \n                   NATIONAL WOMEN'S BUSINESS COUNCIL.\n\n       Section 407(f) of the Women's Business Ownership Act of \n     1988 (15 U.S.C. 7107(f)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``A vacancy'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--A vacancy''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Partisan balance.--When filling vacancies under \n     paragraph (1), the Administrator shall, to the extent \n     practicable, ensure that there are an equal number of members \n     on the Council from each of the 2 major political parties.''\n       ``(3) Accountability.--If a vacancy is not filled within \n     the 30-day period required under paragraph (1) or if there \n     exists an imbalance of party-affiliated members on the \n     Council for a period exceeding 30 days, the Administrator \n     shall submit a report, not later than 10 days after the \n     respective 30-day deadline, to the Committee on Small \n     Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Small Business of the House of Representatives, that \n     explains why the respective deadline was not met and provides \n     an estimated date on which any vacancies will be filled.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Ms. \n        Collins):\n  S. 1443. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to reauthorize the temporary assistance to needy families program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to take this time to \ntalk about the reauthorization of welfare reform, the reform launched a \nhalf dozen years ago. The authorization for those reforms has expired \nonce, has been renewed for a year, and will expire again at the end of \nthis year.\n  When Bill Clinton ran for President in 1992, he said a number of \nthings for which he is remembered. He said: It is the economy, stupid. \nAnd it is always the economy, stupid, as far as I am concerned. But he \nalso said we ought to change welfare as we know it. And we have.\n  Welfare reform was very much needed in the mid-1990s. A lot of people \nwho ended up on welfare stayed there for long periods of time. And one \nof the reasons why they stayed there for so long was because they and \ntheir families were better off being on welfare than not. If people on \nwelfare went to work, they lost some things. They lost maybe health \ncare for their kids, eligibility for food stamps, nutritional support \nfor their families, affordable housing. They certainly had to pay more \nfor affordable housing.\n  And what would they gain by going to work and getting off welfare? \nThe right to pay taxes: State income taxes, Federal income taxes, \nSocial Security taxes, Medicare taxes, and others. After losing those \ncertain things and gaining the right to pay those taxes, they would \nhave to deal with the costs included in childcare. Who is going to take \ncare of my kids? How will I pay for it? How will I get to work? Is \nthere transportation? Is there transit? Do I have a car? Is it a \nworking car? If I don't, how do I get one or pay for it or maintain it?\n  The reforms adopted in 1996 were actually endorsed by the National \nGovernors Association which served as a catalyst for the adoption of \nFederal law. There were a number of principles that underscored or \nunderwrote that welfare reform initiative of the mid-1990s. The first \nwas work first. We should not place emphasis on finding people for jobs \nthat may not exist. We ought to help people to go to work first.\n  The second principle was, work ought to pay more than welfare. People \nactually ought to be better off because somebody in that family is \ngoing to work every day.\n  The third principle was really a tough love principle. There ought to \nbe limits on the amount of time that people could be on welfare. States \ncould make it more stringent but a 5-year cap on the amount of time \npeople spent on welfare should be the law of the land. We should have a \ntough love approach. There ought to be a certain toughness in what we \nare doing.\n  People should show up for job interviews. They should take the jobs \noffered. They should not be able to walk away from the jobs. If they do \nthose kinds of things, they would face, in a number of States, the \nlikelihood of being sanctioned for their refusal or inability to go to \nwork and continue to work.\n  We also said that we realize there are some people on welfare who \nwill never come off. For reasons physiological, they are going to be \ndependent forever. We allowed the States to recognize some percentage--\nI think 20 percent--of the caseload of people who will not go to work.\n\n[[Page S9719]]\n\n  We said that it might be a smart idea to have a rainy day fund, in \ncase the economy falls off a cliff or we have a lot more people who \nshow up and need a welfare payment. So we provided for a rainy day \nfund.\n  Finally, we said there are really four critical elements that need to \nbe addressed in order for people to get off welfare and stay off \nwelfare for an extended period of time. No. 1, there had to be a job to \ngo to. No. 2, they have to have a way to get to the job. No. 3, there \nhas to be health care for the kids. If the kids get sick, parents are \nnot going to go to work. There has to be minimal health care for the \nfamily. People will not go to work if there is nobody to take care of \ntheir kids. So there needs to be some assistance given for childcare.\n  By most standards, the welfare reforms we began a half dozen years \nago are regarded as a success. The rolls are down by roughly half \nacross the country, including Delaware. Many families who used to be on \nwelfare are now working and those families are, for the most part, \nbetter off. In those families where somebody is going to work every \nday, that parent sets an example for their children that there is an \nexpectation to go to work, that there is dignity with work, and we are \nexpected to be self-aligned and self-sufficient, if we are \npsychologically able to do that.\n  I have heard the old adage, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' Some \npeople said that about the welfare reforms to be adopted in 1996--that \nthey were not broke and we ought not to fix them. Other people said we \nought to change it substantially, which is what we did in 1996. Some \nwould like to go back to a situation that existed prior to that time. \nOthers would like to go to an even tougher love arrangement, with the \nemphasis on toughness and not a whole lot of love involved.\n  Rather than saying if it ain't broke, don't fix it, I think the \nbetter approach is to say this: If it is not perfect, make it better. \nThe reforms we adopted 6 years ago can be improved upon and we can make \nit better.\n  I want to talk about a proposal Senator Nelson and I will be \noffering. As former Governors of our States, we believe it will build \non the changes adopted in 1996. It would make the system better and \nmake it one that is more likely to help people get off welfare and stay \noff for an extended period of time, and hopefully forever.\n  When we adopted the welfare reforms of 1996, we decided to take \nwelfare, which had been an entitlement program, and make it a block \ngrant program. I believe it provided that $16.5 million would be \ndistributed to States in block grants and States could apportion that \nmoney out, to be used for a variety of things, including cash welfare \npayments, childcare assistance, health care, and other things. They \ncould also use the money for transportation assistance. We put a 5-year \nlimit on the amount of time people, under Federal law, could be \neligible for welfare benefits. We also said in that law that we want \nStates to eventually increase their work participation rates.\n  If you look at the welfare caseload, the percentage of people doing \nwork or work-like activities, we wanted that to increase so by 2002 the \nwork participation would have gone up 50 percent from wherever it \nstarted. That is where it is today; the work participation rate is 50 \npercent.\n  We give a credit to States that moved people off of welfare since the \nmid to late 1990s. So if they have moved people off welfare, States can \nget a credit toward the work participation rate, with the 50-percent \nmandate.\n  As it turned out, when they moved half of the people off of the \nwelfare rolls and the work participation rate is 50 percent effectively \nby moving people off welfare to work, in most of the States we have \neliminated de facto the work participation rate. Most States have a \nzero work participation rate as a result.\n\n  Our bill changes that in a couple of ways. It gradually raises from \n50 percent to 70 percent, in 5-percent increments each year, the work \nparticipation rate, so that by 2008, today's rate would go up to 70 \npercent.\n  We provide for something called an employment credit. The employment \ncredit provides a credit to States against its work participation rate \nfor doing a couple of things. One, for moving people to work. Two, they \nget bonus credit for moving people to work at better paying jobs. Also, \nStates can earn partial credit against the work participation rate if \npeople are doing at least 16 hours of core work activities.\n  Under the current Federal law, a workweek for people who have kids \nover the age of 6 is 30 hours in order to count toward the work \nparticipation rate. Under current law, if a person has a child under 6, \nthey need to be working 20 hours in order to count toward the States' \nwork participation requirement.\n  Senator Nelson and I would change that a little bit. We say that--\nthere is one thing we don't change. If you have a child under the age \nof 6, it is still 20 hours. If they are over the age of 6, we expect \nthem to be working 32 hours, 8 of which can be activities other than \ncore work activities. An example would be assistance for substance \nabuse, or anything that is deemed to be eliminating the barrier toward \nemployment. If a person doesn't have a high school degree, they can be \nworking toward their GED, and that counts as part of that 8 hours. But \n24 hours of the 32 would have to be a core work activity. I will give \nyou some examples: private sector work, public sector work, community \nservice, and vocational education.\n  Senator Nelson and I also made a modification with respect to \neducation and training. Under current law, vocational education counts \nup to--I believe you count it toward your work participation rate for \n12 months. We make that 24 months. We put in a cap. If you had 100 \npeople on your caseload, no more than 30 percent of that 100 people who \nare involved in vocational education training or postsecondary can be \ncounted toward a State's work participation rate. We extend from 12 \nmonths to 24 months those who are participating in vocational credit.\n  If you want people to go to work, you have to make sure there is help \non the childcare side. If we are going to raise the hours, we expect \nthe people to do work or work-like activities. If we are going to raise \nthe work participation rate, we have to provide additional assistance. \nThere is an extra $6 billion that we provide for childcare over the 5-\nyear period.\n  In addition, we raise the social service block grant to a fully \nauthorized level over a 5-year period of time. On the transportation \nside, as I mentioned earlier, unless people can get to work--we can \nhave all the caps and participation rates we want but unless people can \nget to work, they are not going to be able to get off welfare and stay \noff of welfare.\n  In our legislation, we provide under current law where States can use \nthe TANF block grant for transportation assistance. We provide \nauthorizing language for another $15 million in authorization for \ntransportation. If you live in a rural area and there is no \ntransportation, States can help people buy cheaper but working cars to \nget where they need to go.\n  We make a change with respect to transitional health care. Under \ncurrent law, if I am on welfare and then I go to work, I lose my health \ncare. I can get 12 months of transitional assistance from Medicaid. We \nraise that. We give States the discretion to raise that to 24 months.\n  I see Senator Grassley has risen to speak. I will finish my remarks. \nI say this to him. I appreciate very much his effort in leading the \nFinance Committee. Senator Nelson and I have actually been privileged \nto be Governors of our States--8 years apiece--at the time we launched \nwelfare reform. We learned a lot from those experiences. We think it is \ngermane to the debate that is coming soon in the next steps in welfare \nreform. We hope to be part of the debate--maybe not in your committee \nbut certainly when we get the bill to the floor. As much as I \nunderstand what is taking shape here, I think there are common elements \nin what Senator Grassley is seeking to do and what Senator Nelson and I \npropose to do. We look very much forward to engaging with the chairman \nin the work he is doing now and with that which is going to be brought \nto the floor later this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill \nthat Senator Nelson and I are introducing be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9720]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1443\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat. \n     2105) was a fundamental change to reform the Federal welfare \n     system to shift it from an entitlement program into a \n     transition program to help families move from welfare to work \n     and personal responsibility.\n       (2) Since enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law, welfare \n     cash assistance caseloads have dropped dramatically, by \n     approximately 50 percent, and approximately \\2/3\\ of welfare \n     recipients who have left the cash assistance rolls have left \n     for work.\n       (3) Another sign of reform and progress is that funding has \n     shifted from providing monthly cash assistance for parents to \n     stay at home to over \\1/2\\ of the funding targeted to pay for \n     work supports, such as child care, transportation, job \n     placement, limited job training, or other priorities.\n       (4) Investments in child care and transportation, and \n     health care access will help continue this success and move \n     more people from welfare to work.\n       (5) While many families have moved from welfare to work, \n     many families struggle in low-wage jobs and have trouble \n     getting promised supports such as medicaid, child care, food \n     stamps, and other supports available under programs intended \n     to help families.\n       (6) Child poverty rates in the United States have improved \n     but they could be lower and they remain high when compared to \n     the rates of other developed countries. More must be done to \n     reduce child poverty in our Nation.\n       (7) State flexibility has been critical to the success of \n     the 1996 welfare reform law and will be important for States \n     to provide a broad range of services to address parents on \n     welfare with barriers to employment. State flexibility also \n     is important for States to continue successful welfare \n     programs that have cut the caseload in half since 1996.\n       (8) Children deserve to be raised in supportive homes, \n     preferably with 2 loving parents. It is crucial to end \n     policies that discriminate against serving 2-parent families \n     within the welfare system. It is also important to support \n     innovative programs to encourage full participation in child \n     support and child rearing by noncustodial parents.\n       (9) Despite declining national and State rates, 35 percent \n     of 10 girls in the United States get pregnant at least once \n     by age 20, nearly 900,000 girls get pregnant each year, and \n     there are nearly 500,000 teen births each year. The national \n     teen birth rate for Hispanic teen girls - the fastest growing \n     group - is declining the slowest.\n       (10) If teen birth rates had stayed at the 1991 peak level, \n     there would have been at least 800,000 additional babies born \n     to teenagers.\n\n                             TITLE I--WORK\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the Head Start Act to increase the \nreservation of funds for programs for low-income families with very \nyoung children, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, most Americans are very familiar with Head \nStart. This popular preschool program was created in 1965 to provide \neducation, health, nutrition and family support services to low-income, \n4- and 5-year old children. Head Start enjoys strong bipartisan support \nand is widely recognized as a success.\n  In response to the growing body of research about the critical \ndevelopment which occurs during the first 3 years of a child's life, \nHead Start was expanded in 1995 to serve infants and toddlers. The \nEarly Head Start Program provides comprehensive child development and \nfamily support services to infants and toddlers from birth through age \n3 and pregnant women. Currently, 10 percent of Head Start funds are set \naside for Early Head Start. An estimated 60,000 children currently \nreceive services nationwide. In Iowa, 1,259 children are served by \nEarly Head Start.\n  Numerous research findings, including a 7-year national evaluation, \nshow that Early Head Start is a success. Early Head Start made positive \nimpacts in children's cognitive, language, and social-emotional \ndevelopment. It was also found that compared to a control group, \nparents in Early Head Start not only read to their children more often \nbut also provided additional resources to support greater language and \nliteracy development.\n  These types of outcomes for our Nation's most vulnerable infants and \ntoddlers are tremendous considering how critical the early years are \nfor children's development. Data from the National Academy of Sciences \nshows that the first 3 years of a child's life are the most important--\n80 percent of brain development occurs by age 3. Children have \nunlimited potential to learn many things during this critical time. \nResearch conducted over the last several years shows how important it \nis for parents to read to their young children, talk with them, and \nstimulate learning through play. Children who do not have enriched \nlearning experiences during these important years can be stunted for \nlife. Babies and toddlers living in high-risk environments need \nadditional supports to foster necessary intellectual, social, and \nemotional development that lays the foundation for later success in \nschool and life.\n  Early Head Start provides this proven effective, targeted care, yet \nonly 3 percent of those eligible are being served. As a result, today I \nam introducing legislation that would increase the current set-aside to \n20 percent in 2008--to double the number of participants.\n  Investments in early intervention programs must become a national \npriority. This is the right thing to do for the young children of our \nNation, but it is also the most cost-effective thing for us to do. \nEvery dollar invested in quality pre-school programs saves $7 in future \ncosts for special education, welfare or corrections.\n  In 1991, the Committee for Economic Development, CED, called on the \nNation to rethink how we view education. This group of business leaders \nurged Federal policy makers to view education as a process that begins \nat birth, with preparations beginning before birth. I strongly support \nthis objective and have always been a strong advocate in early \nintervention activities such as Head Start, the WIC nutrition program \nand early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with \ndisabilities.\n\n  We must dedicate ourselves to making the CED vision a reality and \nbuild a strong foundation for education in this country. That begins \nwith ensuring that all children get off to a good, strong start and \nenter school ready to learn.\n  The legislation I am introducing today takes another step toward \nbuilding this foundation by doubling the set-aside for the Early Head \nStart Program for children ages zero to three by the year 2008. This \naction will continue to improve access to education and development \nservices for our youngest children to provide a good start in life. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S9737]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9710-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9710-S9737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CHAFEE:\n  S. 1437. A bill to expand the Federal tax refund intercept program to \ncover children who are not minors; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the Child \nSupport Fairness and Tax Refund Interception Act of 2003 today.\n  The Child Support Fairness and Tax Refund Interception Act of 2003 \ncloses a loophole in current Federal statute by expanding the \neligibility of one of the most effective means of enforcing child \nsupport orders--that of intercepting the Federal tax refunds of parents \nwho are delinquent in paying their court-ordered financial support for \ntheir children.\n  Under current law, eligibility for the Federal tax refund offset \nprogram is limited to cases involving minors, parents on public \nassistance, or adult children who are disabled. Custodial parents of \nadult, non-disabled children are not assisted under the IRS tax refund \nintercept program, and in many cases, they must work multiple jobs in \norder to make ends meet. Some of these parents have gone into debt to \nput their college-age children through school.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will address this inequity by \nexpanding the eligibility of the Federal tax refund offset program to \ncover parents of all children, regardless of whether the child is \ndisabled or a minor. This legislation will not create a cause of action \nfor a custodial parent to seek additional child support. It will merely \nassist the custodial parent in recovering debt that is owed for a level \nof child support that was determined by a court.\n  Improving our child support enforcement programs is an issue that \nshould be of concern to us all as it remains a serious problem in the \nUnited States. According to the most recent government statistics, \nthere are approximately seventeen million active cases in which a child \nsupport order requires a noncustodial parent to contribute to the \nsupport of his or her child. Of the almost $25 billion owed in 2001, \nonly $14 billion has been collected. In 1998, only 23 percent of \nchildren entitled to child support through our public system received \nsome form of payment, despite Federal and State efforts. Similar \nshortfalls in previous years bring the combined delinquency total to \napproximately $88 billion. We can fix this injustice in our federal tax \nrefund offset program by helping some of our most needy constituents \nreceive the financial assistance they are owed.\n  While previous Administrations have been somewhat successful in using \ntax refunds as a tool to collect child support payments, more needs to \nbe done. The IRS tax refund interception program has only collected \none-third of tardy child support payments. The Child Support Fairness \nand Tax Refund Interception Act of 2003 will remove the current barrier \nto fulfilling an individual's obligation to pay child support, while \nhelping to provide for the future of our nation's children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation, and ask unanimous consent that the text of legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1437\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Support Fairness and \n     Tax Refund Interception Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Enforcing child support orders remains a serious \n     problem in the United States. There are approximately \n     17,100,000 active cases in which a child support order \n     requires a noncustodial parent to contribute to the support \n     of his or her child. Of the $24,700,000,000 owed in 2001 \n     pursuant to such orders, $14,200,000,000, or 57 percent, has \n     been collected.\n       (2) It is an injustice for the Federal Government to issue \n     tax refunds to a deadbeat spouse while a custodial parent has \n     to work 2 or 3 jobs to compensate for the shortfall in \n     providing for his or her children.\n       (3) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) program to intercept \n     the tax refunds of parents who owe child support arrears has \n     been successful in collecting a tenth of such arrears.\n       (4) Congress has periodically expanded eligibility for the \n     IRS tax refund intercept program. Initially, the program was \n     limited to intercepting Federal tax refunds owed to parents \n     on public assistance. In 1984, Congress expanded the program \n     to cover parents not on public assistance. Finally, the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 made the program \n     permanent and expanded the program to cover parents of adult \n     children who are disabled.\n       (5) The injustice to the custodial parent is the same \n     regardless of whether the child is disabled, non-disabled, a \n     minor, or an adult, so long as the child support obligation \n     is provided for by a court or administrative order. It is \n     common for parents to help their adult children finance a \n     college education, a wedding, or a first home. Some parents \n     cannot afford to provide such help because they are \n     recovering from debt incurred to cover expenses that would \n     have been covered if the parent had been paid the child \n     support owed in a timely manner.\n       (6) This Act addresses such injustices by expanding the IRS \n     tax refund intercept program to cover parents of all adult \n     children, regardless of whether the child is disabled.\n       (7) This Act does not create a cause of action for a \n     custodial parent to seek additional child support. This Act \n     merely helps the custodial parent recover debt owed for a \n     level of child support that was set by a court after both \n     sides had the opportunity to present arguments about the \n     proper amount of child support.\n\n     SEC. 3. USE OF TAX REFUND INTERCEPT PROGRAM TO COLLECT PAST-\n                   DUE CHILD SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN WHO ARE \n                   NOT MINORS.\n\n       Section 464 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 664) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(2)(A), by striking ``(as that term is \n     defined for purposes of this paragraph under subsection \n     (c))''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) by striking ``(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     as used in'' and inserting ``In''; and\n       (ii) by inserting ``(whether or not a minor)'' after ``a \n     child'' each place it appears; and\n       (B) by striking paragraphs (2) and (3).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Inouye, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1438. A bill to provide for equitable compensation of the Spokane \nTribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation in settlement of claims the \nTribe concerning the contribution of the Tribe to the production of \nhydropower by the Grand Coulee Dam, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my friend and colleague Senator Murray, as well as the vice \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee Senator Inouye, that provides \nan equitable settlement to the Spokane Tribe of Indians. This bill \naddresses the decision of the Federal Government to take lands \nbelonging to the tribe in order to construct the Grand Coulee Dam on \nthe Columbia River.\n  For more than half a century, the Grand Coulee Project has made an \nextraordinary contribution to this Nation. It helped pull the economy \nout of the Great Depression. It provided the electricity that produced \naluminum required for airplanes and weapons that ensured our national \nsecurity. The project continues to produce enormous revenues for the \nUnited States, it is a key component of the agricultural economy in \neastern Washington, and plays a pivotal role in the electric systems \nserving the entire western United States.\n\n[[Page S9711]]\n\n  However, these benefits have come at a direct cost to tribal property \nthat became inundated when the U.S. Government built the Grand Coulee \nDam. Before dam construction, the free flowing Columbia River supported \nrobust and plentiful salmon runs and provided for virtually all of the \nsubsistence needs of the Spokane Tribe. After construction, the \nColumbia and its Spokane river tributary flooded tribal communities, \nschools, and roads, and the remaining stagnant water continues to erode \nreservation lands today.\n  The legislation Senators Inouye, Murray, and I are introducing today \nis similar to P.L. 103-436, which was enacted in 1994 to provide the \nneighboring Confederated Colville Tribes. This bill would provide the \nSpokane Tribe of Indians' with compensation that is directly \nproportional to the settlement afforded the Colville Tribes. \nSpecifically, the Spokane Tribe would receive 39.4 percent of the past \nand future compensation awarded the Colville Tribes pursuant to the \n1994 legislation. This percentage is based on the proportion of tribal \nlands impacted after the Federal Government built the Grand Coulee \nProject.\n  The United States has a trust responsibility to maintain and protect \nthe integrity of all tribal lands within its borders. When Federal \nactions physically or economically impact harm, our Nation has a legal \nresponsibility to address and compensate the damaged parties. \nUnfortunately, despite countless efforts, half a century has passed \nwithout justice to the Spokane people.\n  The time has come for the Federal Government to finally meet is \nfiduciary responsibility for converting the Spokane tribe's resources \nto its own benefit. Senators Inouye, Murray, and I believe that the \nlegislation we are proposing today will finally bring a fair and \nhonorable closure to these matters. We are pleased to see similar \nbipartisan legislation was introduced earlier this year in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I look forward to working with the Indian Affairs Committee and my \nSenate colleagues as this legislation proceeds through the Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no obligation, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1438\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the `Spokane Tribe of Indians of \n     the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable \n     Compensation Settlement Act.'\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) From 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the \n     Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its \n     tributaries to determine sites at which power could be \n     produced at low cost.\n       (2) The Corps of Engineers--\n       (A) identified a number of sites, including the site at \n     which the Grand Coulee Dam is located; and\n       (B) recommended that power development at those sites be \n     performed by local governmental authorities or private \n     utilities under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791 et \n     seq.).\n       (3) Under section 10(e) of that Act (16 U.S.C. 803(e)), a \n     licensee is required to compensate an Indian tribe for the \n     use of land under the jurisdiction of the Indian tribe.\n       (4) In August 1933, the Columbia Basin Commission, an \n     agency of the State of Washington, received a preliminary \n     permit from the Federal Power Commission for water power \n     development at the Grand Coulee site.\n       (5) In the mid-1930's, the Federal Government, which is not \n     subject to the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.)--\n       (A) federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project; and\n       (B) began construction of the Grand Coulee Dam.\n       (6) At the time at which the Grand Coulee Dam project was \n     federalized, the Federal Government recognized that the \n     Spokane Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n     Reservation had compensable interests in the Grand Coulee Dam \n     project, including compensation for--\n       (A) the development of hydropower;\n       (B) the extinguishment of a salmon fishery on which the \n     Spokane Tribe was almost completely financially dependent; \n     and\n       (C) the inundation of land with loss of potential power \n     sites previously identified by the Spokane Tribe.\n       (7) In the Act of June 29, 1940, Congress--\n       (A) in the first section (16 U.S.C. 835d) granted to the \n     United States--\n       (i) all rights of Indian tribes in land of the Spokane \n     Tribe and Colville Indian Reservations that were required for \n     the Grand Coulee Dam project; and\n       (ii) various rights-of-way over other land under the \n     jurisdiction of Indian tribes that were required in \n     connection with the project; and\n       (B) in section 2 (16 U.S.C. 835e) provided that \n     compensation for the land and rights-of-way was to be \n     determined by the Secretary of the Interior in such amounts \n     as the Secretary determined to be just and equitable.\n       (8) In furtherance of that Act, the Secretary of the \n     Interior paid--\n       (A) to the Spokane Tribe, $4,700; and\n       (B) to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, \n     $63,000.\n       (9) In 1994, following 43 years of litigation before the \n     Indian Claims Commission, the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit, Congress ratified an agreement between the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the \n     United States that provided for damages and annual payments \n     of $15,250,000 in perpetuity, adjusted annually, based on \n     revenues from the sale of electric power from the Grand \n     Coulee Dam project and transmission of that power by the \n     Bonneville Power Administration.\n       (10) In legal opinions issued by the Office of the \n     Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, a Task Force \n     Study conducted from 1976 to 1980 ordered by the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate, and hearings before Congress at \n     the time at which the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n     Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act (Public Law 103-\n     436; 108 Stat. 4577) was enacted, it has repeatedly been \n     recognized that--\n       (A) the Spokane Tribe suffered damages similar to those \n     suffered by, and had a case legally comparable to that of, \n     the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation; but\n       (B) the 5-year statute of limitations under the Act of \n     August 13, 1946 (25 U.S.C. 70 et seq.) precluded the Spokane \n     Tribe from bringing a civil action for damages under that \n     Act.\n       (11) The inability of the Spokane Tribe to bring a civil \n     action before the Indian Claims Commission can be attributed \n     to a combination of factors, including--\n       (A) the failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to carry \n     out its advisory responsibilities in accordance with that \n     Act; and\n       (B) an attempt by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to \n     impose improper requirements on claims attorneys retained by \n     Indian tribes, which caused delays in retention of counsel \n     and full investigation of the potential claims of the Spokane \n     Tribe.\n       (12) As a consequence of construction of the Grand Coulee \n     Dam project, the Spokane Tribe--\n       (A) has suffered the loss of--\n       (i) the salmon fishery on which the Spokane Tribe was \n     dependent;\n       (ii) identified hydropower sites that the Spokane Tribe \n     could have developed; and\n       (ii) hydropower revenues that the Spokane Tribe would have \n     received under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.) \n     had the project not been federalized; and\n       (B) continues to lose hydropower revenues that the Federal \n     Government recognized were owed to the Spokane Tribe at the \n     time at which the project was constructed.\n       (13) More than 39 percent of the land owned by Indian \n     tribes or members of Indian tribes that was used for the \n     Grand Coulee Dam project was land of the Spokane Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to provide fair and equitable \n     compensation to the Spokane Tribe, using the same \n     proportional basis as was used in providing compensation to \n     the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, for the \n     losses suffered as a result of the construction and operation \n     of the Grand Coulee Dam project.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING:\n  S. 1439. A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to reauthorize adoption incentives payments under section 473A of \nthat Act and to provide incentives for the adoption of older children; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, the Adoption Incentive Program has been a \nsuccessful program, which provides States with real incentives to find \npermanent homes for foster children. However, AIP's authorization \nexpires on September 30, 2003, and the program needs to be reauthorized \nthis year.\n  Under current law, States receive incentive payments for increasing \nthe number of adoptions from the public foster care system. The amount \nof payments is based on the number of adoptions above a State's \nbaseline, which is the highest number of adoptions in a State since \n1997.\n  Currently, States receive $4,000 for each foster child adopted above \nthe baseline number. The State can also receive $6,000 for each \nadoption above a baseline for children with special needs. While each \nState relies on individual criteria, ``special needs'' can include a \nchild's age, ethnicity, disability or having siblings.\n  AIP's success cannot be questioned. In fact, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, there was a 61 percent increase in \nadoptions of children from the public foster care system from 1997 to \n2001.\n  At the same time, states have earned about $144 million in adoption \nincentives for adoptions from 1998, to 2001. In my State, Kentucky has \nreceived about $1.6 million in adoption incentives during this time \nperiod.\n  However, it is now time to reauthorize and strengthen the program.\n  One of the biggest challenges in the foster care system today is \nfinding adoptive homes for older children. In fact, according to the \nAdoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, AFCARS, which \nis part of the Department of Health and Human Services, once children \nreach the age of 9, their chances of adoption diminish.\n  As of 2001, there were over 100,000 American children waiting to be \nadopted. Quit frankly, this is too many children waiting for loving \nhomes, regardless of their age. The bill I am introducing continues to \ngive States incentives to find homes for these kids, particularly older \nchildren.\n  My bill, the Adoption Incentive Program Reauthorization Act of 2003, \nreauthorizes the program from 2004 to 2008, at $43 million a year.\n  The bill continues to give States a payment of $4,000 for every child \nadopted above the State's baseline. Also, the bill requires States to \nestablish a separate baseline for adoptions of children over the age of \n9, and will provide a payment of $6,000 for all older children adopted \nabove the baseline.\n  Children deserve the stability and support of a permanent home and a \npermanent family. The Adoption Incentive Program has already proven \nsuccessful in encouraging states to act aggressively on a foster \nchild's behalf. It is now time to strengthen the program for the years \nto come.\n  I look forward to working on this issue with the other Members of \nCongress who are interested in adoption and hope we can get the program \nreauthorized soon.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1440. A bill to reform the Federal Bureau of Investigation; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am proud to be reintroducing the FBI \nReform Act of 2003 with Senator Patrick Leahy. This reform bill is \ndesigned to address the accountability problems that have plagued the \nFBI for years. For almost a decade, I have been engaged in FBI \noversight, and during that time, I have seen numerous scandals and \ncoverups. I am pleased to see that Director Mueller is committed to \nchanging the culture of the FBI. He is making good strides toward \novercoming past bad policies and procedures at the Bureau. However, \nCongress also has a role to play in this overhaul of the FBI.\n  A little over a year ago, a bill similar to this one was approved \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee. Since then, a number of the \nprovisions of that bill were enacted in separate legislation. However, \nsome of the most important provisions of that bill--provisions \nprotecting whistleblowers, creating a Security Career Program and \nCounterintelligence Polygraph Program, and ending the double standard \nfor discipline of senior FBI executives--have yet to be taken up by the \nfull Senate. These provisions are needed to maintain America's \nconfidence in the FBI.\n\n[[Page S9713]]\n\n  When I was growing up, I was surrounded by a generation that believed \nthe FBI could do no wrong. Yet today at a time when we rely on the FBI \nto protect us from acts of catastrophic terrorism that endanger the \nlives of the American people, a time when the need for confidence in \nthe FBI is at its greatest, Americans' trust and confidence in the FBI \nhas been shaken. Do not get me wrong, the majority of FBI agents and \nespecially those who are posted all over the heartland of this country, \nare honorable, hard working Federal servants who are doing a great job \nof protecting us from harm. However, there are a few bad apples that \nmust be dealt with because their actions give the Bureau a black eye. \nThe spy cases of Robert Hanssen and Chinese espionage in Los Angeles \nhave highlighted internal security problems. Retaliation against agents \nlike John Roberts, Frank Perry, and Patrick Kiernan, who did their duty \ninvestigating internal wrongdoing and spoke the truth to Congress, \nhighlight continuing cultural hostility to criticism. This bill goes a \nlong way to address these systemic problems and shore up trust and \nconfidence in the FBI in the wake of these concerns.\n  While Congress sometimes follows a hands-off approach to the FBI, the \nJudiciary Committees hearings and other oversight activities over the \nlast 2 or 3 years have highlighted the actions that Congress needs to \ntake to do its part in reforming the Bureau. The hearings that spurred \nthis legislation demonstrated the need to extend adequate whistleblower \nprotections to the FBI, enhance the Bureau's internal security program, \nend the double-standard for discipline, and modernize the FBI's \ninformation technology systems. These and additional management issues \nthe committee has explored are reflected in this bill. As the Patriot \nAct has increased the FBI's powers, as the American people have \nincreased their reliance on the FBI to stop terrorism, and as we \ncontinue to increase the FBI's funding, it is time for Congress to take \naction with a more hands-on approach. Let me provide some more detail \nabout the most important provisions of the FBI reform bill.\n  First, title I of the bill contains much needed protections for FBI \nwhistleblowers. As my colleagues know, I have long held that good \ngovernment requires that the brave men and women who blow the whistle \non wrongdoing be protected. It is my strong belief that disclosures of \nwrongdoing by whistleblowers are an integral part of our system of \nchecks and balances. However, although whistleblowers play a critical \nrole in ensuring that waste, fraud, and abuse are brought to light and \nthat public health and safety problems are exposed, the same \nwhistleblower protection laws that apply to almost all other Federal \nemployees do not currently apply to the FBI. In fact, it is a violation \nfor FBI agents to report problems to Congress. That restriction leaves \npatriotic, loyal FBI employees with little recourse. This bill will fix \nthat problem.\n  I truly believe that reform at the FBI will only occur when FBI \nemployees feel free to blow the whistle on wrongdoing. Without adequate \nwhistleblower protections, I am concerned that agents, such as Coleen \nRowley and others, who speak out about abuses and problems at the FBI \nwill be subject to retaliation. Thus, this bill finally gives FBI \nwhistleblowers the same rights and protections that other Federal \nemployees currently possess. When this bill is passed, FBI employees \nwho are retaliated against for blowing the whistle will be able to \navail themselves of all the protections afforded by the Whistleblower \nProtection Act.\n\n  In order to enhance internal security at the FBI, title II of the \nbill requires the FBI to establish a career security program and ensure \nthat appropriate management tools and resources are devoted to that \ntask. Modeled after the Department of Defense Acquisition Career \nProgram, security professional career development requirements would \nbring the FBI into line with the other Federal agencies that handle top \nsecret intelligence. This bill establishes and defines the Career \nSecurity Program and sets out the framework for career development and \ntraining in internal security. With the development of a Career \nSecurity Program, the FBI can meet the challenges of espionage, \ninformation technology vulnerability, and the threat of direct \nterrorist attack.\n  This bill requires the Attorney General to establish policies and \nprocedures for career management of FBI security personnel. It directs \nthe Director of the FBI to appoint a Director of Security who would \nchair a security career program board that would advise in the \nmanagement of hiring, training, education, and career development. The \nbill also requires the FBI Director to designate certain positions as \nsecurity positions. The bill requires that career paths to senior \npositions be published, and it ensures that all FBI personnel would \nhave the opportunity to acquire the education, training and experience \nneeded for senior security positions. Moreover, in order to ensure that \nsecurity professionals gain the stature that special agents enjoy, the \nbill provides that special agents would not have preference for \nsecurity positions and security positions could not be restricted to \nspecial agents unless the Attorney General makes a special \ndetermination.\n  Furthermore, the bill would direct that education, training, and \nexperience requirements be established for each position and that \nbefore assignment as a manager or a deputy manager of a significant \nsecurity program, a person would have to complete an accredited \nsecurity program management course and have at least 6 years security \nexperience, including 2 years in a similar program.\n  In addition to the Security Career Program, the bill will also \nenhance security through the creation of an FBI counterintelligence \npolygraph program. The program would consist of the periodic screening \nof employees and contractors who have access to sensitive information \nor restricted data. While the program recognizes the value of polygraph \nscreening, it also provides safeguards for those subject to polygraph \nexamination. The bill directs that the program have procedures to \naddress false positives, ensure quality control, requires that no \nadverse personnel action could be taken solely by reason of \nphysiological reaction on an exam without further investigation, and \nprovides that employees would have prompt access to unclassified \nreports of their exams that relate to adverse personnel action. Thus, \ntitle III provides increased security while at the same time protecting \nemployee rights.\n  Title IV requires the Attorney General to report on the legal \nauthority for the FBI's programs and activities. This report will help \nthe FBI focus on its most important duty--preventing terrorism--by \ncutting back on the FBI's jurisdiction, which has become cumbersome and \nunwieldy. Currently, the FBI investigates over 300 different Federal \noffenses, which are divided between violent crime, white collar crime, \norganized crime, drugs, national security, and civil rights. In many of \nthese areas, there are instances of concurrent or overlapping \njurisdiction with other Federal law enforcement agencies who specialize \nin investigating these crimes.\n  The FBI needs to scale back on the broad range of investigations \nwhich are duplicated by other Federal and State agencies. The Bureau \nneeds to completely jettison some of these areas and in other areas, \nthe Bureau could simply take a secondary role, allowing another agency \nto take the lead. In order to assist the FBI in scaling back its \njurisdiction, this bill directs the Attorney General to report to \nCongress on the legal authority for FBI programs and activities, \nidentifying those that have express statutory authority and those that \ndo not. The bill also requires the Attorney General to recommend what \ncriminal statutes for which he believes the FBI should have \ninvestigative responsibility.\n\n  Additionally, there exists a gross inequality in the way Senior \nExecutive Service, SES, employees of the FBI and rank and file agents \nare disciplined. SES employees are often given a slap on the wrist for \nan infraction, whereas the rank and file agents are often punished to \nthe letter of the law. Title V of the bill attempts to address this \ndouble standard. The bill attempts to address the double standard by \nproviding some flexibility in how SES employees can be punished. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee has heard repeatedly that this inflexibility \nis one of the main causes for the inequality in punishment at the FBI. \nUnder the current\n\n[[Page S9714]]\n\nsystem, the minimum suspension that an SES employee can receive is 14 \ndays. This means that the FBI's management is often left with the \nchoice of either an overly harsh penalty or no penalty at all. Often \nthey decide not to impose any meaningful disciplinary action.\n  In order to attempt to remedy this problem our bill lifts the 14-day \nminimum suspension for SES disciplinary cases to provide for additional \noptions in disciplining senior executive employees. Hopefully, this \nchange will help to remedy this double standard. In addition, our bill \nwould require the Office of Inspector General to submit to the \nJudiciary Committees of both houses, for 5 years, annual reports by the \nFBI Office of Professional Responsibility on its investigations, \nrecommendations, and their disposition including an analysis of whether \nany double standard is being employed.\n  Finally, title VI of the bill attempts to provide further enhancement \nto security at the Department of Justice as a whole. This title would \nimplement recommendations of the Webster Commission for enhancing \nsecurity at the DOJ. It requires the Attorney General to submit a \nreport to Congress on the manner by which the Department plans to \nimprove protection of security information at the DOJ. Moreover, this \ntitle authorizes funds to meet the demands for increased security at \nthe DOJ. Also, the bill would authorize funds for the DOJ Office of \nIntelligence Policy and Review to help meet the increased demands to \ncombat terrorism, process applications to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, participate effectively in counterespionage \ninvestigations, provide policy analysis and oversight on national \nsecurity matters, and enhance computer and telecommunications security.\n  Mr. President, I say to my fellow colleagues, it is time we acted on \nthe reforms in this bill. It has been almost a year since this bill \npassed unanimously out of committee. Let's act to reform the FBI and \nhelp maintain America's trust and confidence in the Bureau.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, with my \nfriend the senior Senator from Iowa, the FBI Reform Act of 2003.\n  This legislation stems from the lessons learned during a series of \nJudiciary Committee hearings on oversight of the FBI that I chaired \nbeginning in June 2001. The important changes which are being made \nunder the FBI's leadership after the September 11 attacks and the new \npowers granted the FBI by the USA PATRIOT Act have resulted in FBI \nreform becoming a pressing matter of national importance.\n  Since 9/11 and the anthrax attacks later that fall, we have relied on \nthe FBI to detect and prevent acts of catastrophic terrorism that \nendanger the lives of the American people and the institutions of our \ncountry. The men and women of the FBI are performing this task with \ngreat professionalism at home and abroad. We have all felt safer as a \nresult of the full mobilization of the FBI's dedicated Special Agents, \nits expert support personnel, and its exceptional technical \ncapabilities. We owe the men and women of the FBI our thanks.\n  For decades the FBI has been an outstanding law enforcement agency \nand a vital member of the United States intelligence community. As our \nhearings and recent events have shown, however, there is room for \nimprovement at the FBI. To fully rise to its current challenges, the \nFBI must face and understand the mistakes of the past and make the \nchanges needed to ensure that they are not repeated. In meeting the \ninternational terrorist challenge, the Congress has an opportunity and \nobligation to strengthen the institutional fiber of the FBI based on \nlessons learned from recent problems the Bureau has experienced.\n  This view is not mine alone. When FBI Director Mueller testified at \nhis confirmation hearings in July 2001, he forthrightly acknowledged \n``that the Bureau's remarkable legacy of service and accomplishment has \nbeen tarnished by some serious and highly publicized problems in recent \nyears. Waco, Ruby Ridge, the FBI lab, Wen Ho Lee, Robert Hanssen and \nthe McVeigh documents--these familiar names and events remind us all \nthat the FBI is far from perfect and that the next director faces \nsignificant management and administrative challenges.'' Since then, the \nJudiciary Committee has forged a constructive partnership with Director \nMueller to get the FBI back on track.\n  Congress sometimes has followed a hands-off approach about the FBI. \nBut with the FBI's new increased powers, with our increased reliance on \nthe Bureau to prevent terrorism, and with the increased funding \nprovided by the Congress should come increased scrutiny and \naccountability. Until the Bureau's problems are resolved and new \nchallenges overcome, we should be taking a hands-on approach.\n  Indeed our hearings and other oversight activities have highlighted \ntangible steps the Congress should take in an FBI Reform bill as part \nof this hands-on approach. Among other things, these hearings \ndemonstrated the need to extend whistleblower protection, end the \ndouble standard for discipline of senior FBI executives, and enhance \nthe FBI's internal security program to protect against espionage as \noccurred in the Hanssen case.\n  Director Mueller once said it is ``critically important'' that he \n``hears criticisms of the organization . . . in order to improve the \norganization.'' I could not agree more. More than ever, the FBI must be \nopen to new ideas, to criticism from within and without, and to facing \nup to and learning from past mistakes.\n  During the last Congress, the Judiciary Committee unanimously \napproved the Leahy-Grassley FBI Reform Act of 2001. Unfortunately, our \nbipartisan efforts were stymied by an anonymous Republican hold, which \nprevented the bill from being considered on the floor. While we did \neventually succeed in passing three of the bill's important reform \nprovisions as part of the Department of Justice authorization act, \nother needed reforms were senselessly blocked. These reforms, which \nremain as important and urgent as ever, are included in the bill we \nintroduce today.\n  There are five key elements of our bill.\n  First, it strengthens whistleblower protection for FBI employees and \nprotects them from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing.\n  Second, it addresses the issue of a double standard for discipline of \nsenior executives by eliminating the disparity in authorized \npunishments between Senior Executive Service members and other Federal \nemployees.\n  Third, it establishes an FBI Counterintelligence Polygraph Program \nfor screening personnel in exceptionally sensitive positions with \nspecific safeguards.\n  Fourth, it establishes an FBI Career Security Program, which would \nbring the FBI into line with other U.S. intelligence agencies that have \nstrong career security professional cadres whose skills and leadership \nare dedicated to the protection of agency information, personnel, and \nfacilities.\n  And fifth, it requires a set of reports that would enable Congress to \nengage the Executive branch in a constructive dialogue building a more \neffective FBI for the future.\n  The FBI Reform Act is designed to strengthen the FBI as an \ninstitution that has a unique role as both a law enforcement agency and \na member of the intelligence community. As the Judiciary Committee \ncontinues its oversight work and more is learned about recent FBI \nperformance, additional reforms may prove necessary. Especially \nimportant will be the lessons learned from the attacks of September 11, \nthe anthrax attacks, and implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act and \nother counterterrorism measures.\n  We need to help the FBI become as effective, as accountable and as \nagile as the American people need it to be to counter the threat of \nterrorism on our shores.\n  Strengthening the FBI cannot be accomplished overnight, but with this \nlegislation, we take an important step into the FBI's future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 1441. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect \nto false information regarding certain\n\n[[Page S9717]]\n\ncriminal violations concerning hoax reports of biological, chemical, \nand nuclear weapons; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The Protection \nAgainst Terrorist Hoaxes Act of 2003.'' This bill would amend Title 18 \nof the United States Code to, make it a Federal crime to knowingly make \na hoax report, involving a biological, chemical, nuclear weapon, or \nother weapon of mass destruction. Likewise, this bill would make it a \ncriminal offense to knowingly send such a hoax weapon to another.\n  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, our Nation has witnessed \na number of terror hoax reports. This in turn has triggered an equally \nlarge number of reports of suspected biological agents. No part of the \nNation has been spared, and my home State of Delaware has had several \nhundred reports of possible biological agents. The FBI has reported to \nCongress the staggering statistics involving these bioterrorism hoaxes \nand other reports of suspected biological agents. Prior to September \n11, the FBI had responded to about 100 cases involving potential use of \n``weapons of mass destruction,'' 67 of which involved alleged \nbiological weapons. Since mid-September 2001, however, that number has \nincreased by 3,000 percent.\n  The good news is that most of these reports were either hoaxes or \nreports made by well-meaning people whose suspicions were raised. The \nbad news is that any hoax reports were made in the first place, \ntriggering panic on the part of the public, and often forcing the \nFederal, State, and local governments to waste valuable time and \nresources responding to them. In one particularly egregious case, it \nhas been reported that an employee of the Connecticut Department of \nEnvironmental Protection falsely reported to security that he had found \na yellowish-white powder on his desk with the misspelled label \n``ANTHAX.'' The employee, a 48-year-old solid waste management analyst, \nknew the material was not toxic, it was determined to be coffee \ncreamer, but persisted in the false account. Eight hundred State \nemployees were evacuated from the building for 2 days while law \nenforcement officials tested the building, at a cost of $1.5 million in \nlost worker's time, another $40,000 in decontamination costs, and an \nundisclosed amount of money spent on rescue and law enforcement. The \nemployee is being charged in Federal court--not for the hoax report, \nbut for lying to Federal officials after the fact.\n  Indeed, the Justice Department reported to Congress that there is a \ngap in the existing Federal law regarding the prosecution of \nbioterrorism hoaxes. That is, while it is a crime to threaten to use, \nfor example, anthrax as a weapon against another person, it is not a \ncrime to make a hoax anthrax report. Accordingly, the Justice \nDepartment has repeatedly asked Congress to enact legislation which \nspecifically addresses hoaxes which involve purported biological \nsubstances, as well as chemical, nuclear and other weapons of mass \ndestruction. Just this month, the Justice Department stated in \ntestimony, ``changes in title 18 to expand the reach of the law to \nprohibit conduct resulting in such hoaxes would provide prosecutors \nwith an appropriate tool to respond to these situations.''\n  We should answer the call and act now to give law enforcement the \ntools they need to combat these despicable crimes. The Federal interest \nis indisputable, as States and localities are simply not equipped with \nthe expertise or resources to evaluate and respond to these hoaxes. A \ncomprehensive prohibition on such false reports is necessary to \npreserve scarce and vital Federal resources.\n  Accordingly, as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nCrime, Corrections and Victims' Rights, I introduce a bill today which \ncontains both criminal provisions and civil penalties for the hoax \nreporting of bioterrorism incidents. My bill simply says that if you \nknowingly engage in conduct--such as deliberately sending baking powder \nthrough the mail to your congressman or calling 911 to falsely report \nthe presence of anthrax in a public building--that is likely to create \nthe false impression concerning the presence of anthrax, or other \nsimilar things, that you have committed A Federal offense, punishable \nby up to 5 years in jail. Moreover, such a person may be fined the \ngreater of either $10,000 or the amount of money expended by the \ngovernment to respond to the false information. Finally, such a person \nmay also be ordered to reimburse the government if costs were incurred \nin responding to the false hoax. Let me be clear--this bill will not \ntarget innocent mistakes or people who make a report concerning a \nsuspected substance; it is aimed, rather, at deliberate hoax reports by \nthose who know they are spreading false information.\n  I have said many times on the floor of this body that the terrorist \nwin if they succeed in sowing seeds of panic into our daily lives. We \ncannot and will not let that happen. Similarly, we will not let these \nhoaxers get away with words and deeds which have the same effect. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Protection Against Terrorist Hoaxes \nAct of 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 1442. A bill to preserve the political independence of the \nNational Women's Business Council; to the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the National Women's Business Council \nprovides Congress, the Small Business Administration, and the \nInteragency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise with independent \nadvice and policy recommendations to foster women's business ownership. \nNow many of my colleagues may not know a great deal about the Council, \nits members, and what they do. But I can tell you that as a member of \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, the \nCouncil's advice is very helpful as we develop legislation that affects \nsmall businesses throughout the country.\n  The Council has broad latitude to address nearly any issue that it \nconsiders to be important for women in business. Whether it relates to \nhealth insurance, the economy, or fiscal policies, the Council brings a \nunique and valuable perspective. Women make up 46 percent of the \nNation's executive, administrative and managerial occupations and head \nup 7.1 million sole proprietorships. The National Women's Business \nCouncil is their voice.\n  The Council's independent voice is the key to its success and \ninfluence. The structure of the Council helps to maintain that \nindependence. The Council has 15 members. The Chair is appointed by the \nPresident and must be a prominent businesswoman. Six members come from \nwomen's business organizations, including representatives of women's \nbusiness center sites. The remaining eight members are political \nappointees, split evenly between Democrats and Republicans. These \npolitical slots are appointed by the SBA Administrator based upon the \nrecommendations of the Chair and Ranking Members of the Senate Business \nand Entrepreneurship Committee and the House Small Business Committee. \nAll of these ``party-affiliated'' members must be small business \nowners.\n  This bipartisan balance in the Council's membership helps to ensure \nthat any policy recommendations or positions the Council takes will \nreflect the needs of women in business and not the political agenda of \none political party over another. Certainly, the political balance is \nnot completely even because the Chair is appointed by the President, \nbut the Democrats have a strong voice with four members on the Council. \nThat will only be true, however, as long as the Democratic seats are \nfilled.\n  Unfortunately, this has not always been the case. Vacancies on the \nCouncil are supposed to be filled no later than 30 days after a seat \nbecomes open. However, over the past two years, the SBA has routinely \nfailed to meet this 30-day statutory deadline. The Council Chair was \nvacant from May 29, 2001 to May 21, 2002, a period of 11 months and 22 \ndays. As a result, the Council could not even meet.\n  Vacancies in the party-affiliated seats hurt the Council's \nindependence. Of the party-affiliated seats reserved for the \nPresident's party, one seat was vacant for three months; two were \nvacant for a period of seven months; and another went vacant for 21 \nmonths. Two of the seats reserved for Democrats remained vacant for \nnearly two years, another seat was vacant for seven months, and the \nfourth seat remains vacant today. In the past, these\n\n[[Page S9718]]\n\nvacancies have not been filled in a manner consistent with maintaining \na bipartisan balance and the independence of the Council. Let me give \nyou an example.\n\n  In February of this year the Council announced its support for \nAssociation Health Plans. This is an important issue for many small \nbusinesses and for the economy on the whole. At the time, the Council \nhad three Republican members and no Democrats. Regardless of what \nopinion you may have of the Association Health Plans issue, the \nCouncil's position can be dismissed by some as being political because \nof the partisan imbalance on the Council at the time it made its \nendorsement. Instead of being an unquestioned resource for Congress and \npolicy makers to rely on, the Council faces potential criticism that it \nis nothing more than a mouthpiece for one party over another.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to protect the independence of \nthe Council. The National Women's Business Council Independence \nPreservation Act of 2003 will ensure that the Council maintains its \nvalue as an advisor to Congress and the Administration. This measure \nsimply requires that vacancies in the party-affiliated seats be filled \nevenly so that the Council maintains a bipartisan balance. This will \nhelp to ensure that the Council's policy advice is free from any \npartisan taint.\n  My legislation also ensures accountability by requiring the SBA \nAdministrator to report to Congress on vacancies that remain unfilled \nfor more than 30 days. The report must cite the reasons for the \nvacancies, what is causing any delays in filling the positions, whether \nnominees were available for consideration, at what stage in the vetting \nprocess nominees are, whether there are any objections to the nominees \nand what those objections are, an estimate for when the vacancies will \nbe filled, and any other relevant information relating to the \nvacancies.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Women's Business \n     Council Independence Preservation Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Women's Business Council provides an \n     independent source of advice and policy recommendations \n     regarding women's business development and the needs of women \n     entrepreneurs in the United States to--\n       (A) the President;\n       (B) Congress;\n       (C) the Interagency Committee on Women's Business \n     Enterprise; and\n       (D) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration.\n       (2) The members of the National Women's Business Council \n     are small business owners, representatives of business \n     organizations, and representatives of women's business \n     centers.\n       (3) The chair and ranking member of the Committee on Small \n     Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Small Business of the House of Representatives make \n     recommendations to the Administrator to fill 8 of the \n     positions on the National Women's Business Council. Four of \n     the positions are reserved for small business owners who are \n     affiliated with the political party of the President and four \n     of the positions are reserved for small business owners who \n     are not affiliated with the political party of the President. \n     This method of appointment ensures that the National Women's \n     Business Council will provide Congress with non-partisan, \n     balanced, and independent advice.\n       (4) In order to maintain the independence of the National \n     Women's Business Council and to ensure that the Council \n     continues to provide Congress with advice on a non-partisan \n     basis, it is essential that the Council maintain the \n     bipartisan balance established under section 407 of the \n     Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 7107).\n\n     SEC. 3. MAINTAINING THE POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE \n                   NATIONAL WOMEN'S BUSINESS COUNCIL.\n\n       Section 407(f) of the Women's Business Ownership Act of \n     1988 (15 U.S.C. 7107(f)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``A vacancy'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--A vacancy''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Partisan balance.--When filling vacancies under \n     paragraph (1), the Administrator shall, to the extent \n     practicable, ensure that there are an equal number of members \n     on the Council from each of the 2 major political parties.''\n       ``(3) Accountability.--If a vacancy is not filled within \n     the 30-day period required under paragraph (1) or if there \n     exists an imbalance of party-affiliated members on the \n     Council for a period exceeding 30 days, the Administrator \n     shall submit a report, not later than 10 days after the \n     respective 30-day deadline, to the Committee on Small \n     Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Small Business of the House of Representatives, that \n     explains why the respective deadline was not met and provides \n     an estimated date on which any vacancies will be filled.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Ms. \n        Collins):\n  S. 1443. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to reauthorize the temporary assistance to needy families program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to take this time to \ntalk about the reauthorization of welfare reform, the reform launched a \nhalf dozen years ago. The authorization for those reforms has expired \nonce, has been renewed for a year, and will expire again at the end of \nthis year.\n  When Bill Clinton ran for President in 1992, he said a number of \nthings for which he is remembered. He said: It is the economy, stupid. \nAnd it is always the economy, stupid, as far as I am concerned. But he \nalso said we ought to change welfare as we know it. And we have.\n  Welfare reform was very much needed in the mid-1990s. A lot of people \nwho ended up on welfare stayed there for long periods of time. And one \nof the reasons why they stayed there for so long was because they and \ntheir families were better off being on welfare than not. If people on \nwelfare went to work, they lost some things. They lost maybe health \ncare for their kids, eligibility for food stamps, nutritional support \nfor their families, affordable housing. They certainly had to pay more \nfor affordable housing.\n  And what would they gain by going to work and getting off welfare? \nThe right to pay taxes: State income taxes, Federal income taxes, \nSocial Security taxes, Medicare taxes, and others. After losing those \ncertain things and gaining the right to pay those taxes, they would \nhave to deal with the costs included in childcare. Who is going to take \ncare of my kids? How will I pay for it? How will I get to work? Is \nthere transportation? Is there transit? Do I have a car? Is it a \nworking car? If I don't, how do I get one or pay for it or maintain it?\n  The reforms adopted in 1996 were actually endorsed by the National \nGovernors Association which served as a catalyst for the adoption of \nFederal law. There were a number of principles that underscored or \nunderwrote that welfare reform initiative of the mid-1990s. The first \nwas work first. We should not place emphasis on finding people for jobs \nthat may not exist. We ought to help people to go to work first.\n  The second principle was, work ought to pay more than welfare. People \nactually ought to be better off because somebody in that family is \ngoing to work every day.\n  The third principle was really a tough love principle. There ought to \nbe limits on the amount of time that people could be on welfare. States \ncould make it more stringent but a 5-year cap on the amount of time \npeople spent on welfare should be the law of the land. We should have a \ntough love approach. There ought to be a certain toughness in what we \nare doing.\n  People should show up for job interviews. They should take the jobs \noffered. They should not be able to walk away from the jobs. If they do \nthose kinds of things, they would face, in a number of States, the \nlikelihood of being sanctioned for their refusal or inability to go to \nwork and continue to work.\n  We also said that we realize there are some people on welfare who \nwill never come off. For reasons physiological, they are going to be \ndependent forever. We allowed the States to recognize some percentage--\nI think 20 percent--of the caseload of people who will not go to work.\n\n[[Page S9719]]\n\n  We said that it might be a smart idea to have a rainy day fund, in \ncase the economy falls off a cliff or we have a lot more people who \nshow up and need a welfare payment. So we provided for a rainy day \nfund.\n  Finally, we said there are really four critical elements that need to \nbe addressed in order for people to get off welfare and stay off \nwelfare for an extended period of time. No. 1, there had to be a job to \ngo to. No. 2, they have to have a way to get to the job. No. 3, there \nhas to be health care for the kids. If the kids get sick, parents are \nnot going to go to work. There has to be minimal health care for the \nfamily. People will not go to work if there is nobody to take care of \ntheir kids. So there needs to be some assistance given for childcare.\n  By most standards, the welfare reforms we began a half dozen years \nago are regarded as a success. The rolls are down by roughly half \nacross the country, including Delaware. Many families who used to be on \nwelfare are now working and those families are, for the most part, \nbetter off. In those families where somebody is going to work every \nday, that parent sets an example for their children that there is an \nexpectation to go to work, that there is dignity with work, and we are \nexpected to be self-aligned and self-sufficient, if we are \npsychologically able to do that.\n  I have heard the old adage, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' Some \npeople said that about the welfare reforms to be adopted in 1996--that \nthey were not broke and we ought not to fix them. Other people said we \nought to change it substantially, which is what we did in 1996. Some \nwould like to go back to a situation that existed prior to that time. \nOthers would like to go to an even tougher love arrangement, with the \nemphasis on toughness and not a whole lot of love involved.\n  Rather than saying if it ain't broke, don't fix it, I think the \nbetter approach is to say this: If it is not perfect, make it better. \nThe reforms we adopted 6 years ago can be improved upon and we can make \nit better.\n  I want to talk about a proposal Senator Nelson and I will be \noffering. As former Governors of our States, we believe it will build \non the changes adopted in 1996. It would make the system better and \nmake it one that is more likely to help people get off welfare and stay \noff for an extended period of time, and hopefully forever.\n  When we adopted the welfare reforms of 1996, we decided to take \nwelfare, which had been an entitlement program, and make it a block \ngrant program. I believe it provided that $16.5 million would be \ndistributed to States in block grants and States could apportion that \nmoney out, to be used for a variety of things, including cash welfare \npayments, childcare assistance, health care, and other things. They \ncould also use the money for transportation assistance. We put a 5-year \nlimit on the amount of time people, under Federal law, could be \neligible for welfare benefits. We also said in that law that we want \nStates to eventually increase their work participation rates.\n  If you look at the welfare caseload, the percentage of people doing \nwork or work-like activities, we wanted that to increase so by 2002 the \nwork participation would have gone up 50 percent from wherever it \nstarted. That is where it is today; the work participation rate is 50 \npercent.\n  We give a credit to States that moved people off of welfare since the \nmid to late 1990s. So if they have moved people off welfare, States can \nget a credit toward the work participation rate, with the 50-percent \nmandate.\n  As it turned out, when they moved half of the people off of the \nwelfare rolls and the work participation rate is 50 percent effectively \nby moving people off welfare to work, in most of the States we have \neliminated de facto the work participation rate. Most States have a \nzero work participation rate as a result.\n\n  Our bill changes that in a couple of ways. It gradually raises from \n50 percent to 70 percent, in 5-percent increments each year, the work \nparticipation rate, so that by 2008, today's rate would go up to 70 \npercent.\n  We provide for something called an employment credit. The employment \ncredit provides a credit to States against its work participation rate \nfor doing a couple of things. One, for moving people to work. Two, they \nget bonus credit for moving people to work at better paying jobs. Also, \nStates can earn partial credit against the work participation rate if \npeople are doing at least 16 hours of core work activities.\n  Under the current Federal law, a workweek for people who have kids \nover the age of 6 is 30 hours in order to count toward the work \nparticipation rate. Under current law, if a person has a child under 6, \nthey need to be working 20 hours in order to count toward the States' \nwork participation requirement.\n  Senator Nelson and I would change that a little bit. We say that--\nthere is one thing we don't change. If you have a child under the age \nof 6, it is still 20 hours. If they are over the age of 6, we expect \nthem to be working 32 hours, 8 of which can be activities other than \ncore work activities. An example would be assistance for substance \nabuse, or anything that is deemed to be eliminating the barrier toward \nemployment. If a person doesn't have a high school degree, they can be \nworking toward their GED, and that counts as part of that 8 hours. But \n24 hours of the 32 would have to be a core work activity. I will give \nyou some examples: private sector work, public sector work, community \nservice, and vocational education.\n  Senator Nelson and I also made a modification with respect to \neducation and training. Under current law, vocational education counts \nup to--I believe you count it toward your work participation rate for \n12 months. We make that 24 months. We put in a cap. If you had 100 \npeople on your caseload, no more than 30 percent of that 100 people who \nare involved in vocational education training or postsecondary can be \ncounted toward a State's work participation rate. We extend from 12 \nmonths to 24 months those who are participating in vocational credit.\n  If you want people to go to work, you have to make sure there is help \non the childcare side. If we are going to raise the hours, we expect \nthe people to do work or work-like activities. If we are going to raise \nthe work participation rate, we have to provide additional assistance. \nThere is an extra $6 billion that we provide for childcare over the 5-\nyear period.\n  In addition, we raise the social service block grant to a fully \nauthorized level over a 5-year period of time. On the transportation \nside, as I mentioned earlier, unless people can get to work--we can \nhave all the caps and participation rates we want but unless people can \nget to work, they are not going to be able to get off welfare and stay \noff of welfare.\n  In our legislation, we provide under current law where States can use \nthe TANF block grant for transportation assistance. We provide \nauthorizing language for another $15 million in authorization for \ntransportation. If you live in a rural area and there is no \ntransportation, States can help people buy cheaper but working cars to \nget where they need to go.\n  We make a change with respect to transitional health care. Under \ncurrent law, if I am on welfare and then I go to work, I lose my health \ncare. I can get 12 months of transitional assistance from Medicaid. We \nraise that. We give States the discretion to raise that to 24 months.\n  I see Senator Grassley has risen to speak. I will finish my remarks. \nI say this to him. I appreciate very much his effort in leading the \nFinance Committee. Senator Nelson and I have actually been privileged \nto be Governors of our States--8 years apiece--at the time we launched \nwelfare reform. We learned a lot from those experiences. We think it is \ngermane to the debate that is coming soon in the next steps in welfare \nreform. We hope to be part of the debate--maybe not in your committee \nbut certainly when we get the bill to the floor. As much as I \nunderstand what is taking shape here, I think there are common elements \nin what Senator Grassley is seeking to do and what Senator Nelson and I \npropose to do. We look very much forward to engaging with the chairman \nin the work he is doing now and with that which is going to be brought \nto the floor later this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill \nthat Senator Nelson and I are introducing be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9720]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1443\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat. \n     2105) was a fundamental change to reform the Federal welfare \n     system to shift it from an entitlement program into a \n     transition program to help families move from welfare to work \n     and personal responsibility.\n       (2) Since enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law, welfare \n     cash assistance caseloads have dropped dramatically, by \n     approximately 50 percent, and approximately \\2/3\\ of welfare \n     recipients who have left the cash assistance rolls have left \n     for work.\n       (3) Another sign of reform and progress is that funding has \n     shifted from providing monthly cash assistance for parents to \n     stay at home to over \\1/2\\ of the funding targeted to pay for \n     work supports, such as child care, transportation, job \n     placement, limited job training, or other priorities.\n       (4) Investments in child care and transportation, and \n     health care access will help continue this success and move \n     more people from welfare to work.\n       (5) While many families have moved from welfare to work, \n     many families struggle in low-wage jobs and have trouble \n     getting promised supports such as medicaid, child care, food \n     stamps, and other supports available under programs intended \n     to help families.\n       (6) Child poverty rates in the United States have improved \n     but they could be lower and they remain high when compared to \n     the rates of other developed countries. More must be done to \n     reduce child poverty in our Nation.\n       (7) State flexibility has been critical to the success of \n     the 1996 welfare reform law and will be important for States \n     to provide a broad range of services to address parents on \n     welfare with barriers to employment. State flexibility also \n     is important for States to continue successful welfare \n     programs that have cut the caseload in half since 1996.\n       (8) Children deserve to be raised in supportive homes, \n     preferably with 2 loving parents. It is crucial to end \n     policies that discriminate against serving 2-parent families \n     within the welfare system. It is also important to support \n     innovative programs to encourage full participation in child \n     support and child rearing by noncustodial parents.\n       (9) Despite declining national and State rates, 35 percent \n     of 10 girls in the United States get pregnant at least once \n     by age 20, nearly 900,000 girls get pregnant each year, and \n     there are nearly 500,000 teen births each year. The national \n     teen birth rate for Hispanic teen girls - the fastest growing \n     group - is declining the slowest.\n       (10) If teen birth rates had stayed at the 1991 peak level, \n     there would have been at least 800,000 additional babies born \n     to teenagers.\n\n                             TITLE I--WORK\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the Head Start Act to increase the \nreservation of funds for programs for low-income families with very \nyoung children, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, most Americans are very familiar with Head \nStart. This popular preschool program was created in 1965 to provide \neducation, health, nutrition and family support services to low-income, \n4- and 5-year old children. Head Start enjoys strong bipartisan support \nand is widely recognized as a success.\n  In response to the growing body of research about the critical \ndevelopment which occurs during the first 3 years of a child's life, \nHead Start was expanded in 1995 to serve infants and toddlers. The \nEarly Head Start Program provides comprehensive child development and \nfamily support services to infants and toddlers from birth through age \n3 and pregnant women. Currently, 10 percent of Head Start funds are set \naside for Early Head Start. An estimated 60,000 children currently \nreceive services nationwide. In Iowa, 1,259 children are served by \nEarly Head Start.\n  Numerous research findings, including a 7-year national evaluation, \nshow that Early Head Start is a success. Early Head Start made positive \nimpacts in children's cognitive, language, and social-emotional \ndevelopment. It was also found that compared to a control group, \nparents in Early Head Start not only read to their children more often \nbut also provided additional resources to support greater language and \nliteracy development.\n  These types of outcomes for our Nation's most vulnerable infants and \ntoddlers are tremendous considering how critical the early years are \nfor children's development. Data from the National Academy of Sciences \nshows that the first 3 years of a child's life are the most important--\n80 percent of brain development occurs by age 3. Children have \nunlimited potential to learn many things during this critical time. \nResearch conducted over the last several years shows how important it \nis for parents to read to their young children, talk with them, and \nstimulate learning through play. Children who do not have enriched \nlearning experiences during these important years can be stunted for \nlife. Babies and toddlers living in high-risk environments need \nadditional supports to foster necessary intellectual, social, and \nemotional development that lays the foundation for later success in \nschool and life.\n  Early Head Start provides this proven effective, targeted care, yet \nonly 3 percent of those eligible are being served. As a result, today I \nam introducing legislation that would increase the current set-aside to \n20 percent in 2008--to double the number of participants.\n  Investments in early intervention programs must become a national \npriority. This is the right thing to do for the young children of our \nNation, but it is also the most cost-effective thing for us to do. \nEvery dollar invested in quality pre-school programs saves $7 in future \ncosts for special education, welfare or corrections.\n  In 1991, the Committee for Economic Development, CED, called on the \nNation to rethink how we view education. This group of business leaders \nurged Federal policy makers to view education as a process that begins \nat birth, with preparations beginning before birth. I strongly support \nthis objective and have always been a strong advocate in early \nintervention activities such as Head Start, the WIC nutrition program \nand early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with \ndisabilities.\n\n  We must dedicate ourselves to making the CED vision a reality and \nbuild a strong foundation for education in this country. That begins \nwith ensuring that all children get off to a good, strong start and \nenter school ready to learn.\n  The legislation I am introducing today takes another step toward \nbuilding this foundation by doubling the set-aside for the Early Head \nStart Program for children ages zero to three by the year 2008. This \naction will continue to improve access to education and development \nservices for our youngest children to provide a good start in life. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S9737]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9737-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 198--EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE \n       DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE THAT STRUCK ALGERIA ON MAY 21, 2003\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 198\n\n       Whereas on the evening of May 21, 2003, a devastating and \n     deadly earthquake of a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale \n     and with a depth of 6 miles struck northern Algeria, killing \n     more than 2,260 people, injuring more than 10,000 others, and \n     leaving more than 200,000 people homeless;\n       Whereas the earthquake of May 21, 2003, has left thousands \n     of buildings in ruins and has severely disrupted health \n     services, water supply lines, electricity, and \n     telecommunications in Algeria;\n       Whereas severe aftershocks with magnitudes greater than 4.0 \n     have continued to terrify the people of Algeria and hamper \n     rescue efforts;\n       Whereas the strength, courage, and determination of the \n     people and Government of Algeria has been displayed since the \n     earthquake;\n       Whereas the people of the United States and Algeria share \n     strong friendship and mutual respect;\n       Whereas the United States airlifted to the earthquake-\n     affected population 174,000 blankets, 1,800 tents, electrical \n     equipment, water purification kits, and 3 medical supply kits \n     sufficient to benefit 10,000 people for at least 3 months;\n       Whereas the United States has provided $50,000 to the \n     Algerian Red Crescent Society for emergency relief supplies; \n     and\n       Whereas the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has \n     launched an emergency appeal for humanitarian and relief \n     assistance to address the devastation in Algeria that was \n     caused by the powerful earthquake: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its deepest sympathies to the people of \n     Algeria and particularly to the families of the victims and \n     the survivors for the tragic losses suffered as a result of \n     the earthquake that struck Algeria on May 21, 2003;\n       (2) expresses its support for the people and to the \n     Government of Algeria as they continue their efforts to \n     rebuild their cities and their lives;\n       (3) expresses support for humanitarian assistance provided \n     by the United States Agency for International Development and \n     other American and international relief organizations;\n       (4) recognizes the important role that is being performed \n     by the United States and the international community in \n     providing assistance to alleviate the suffering of the people \n     of Algeria; and\n       (5) encourages the continued commitment by the United \n     States and other countries and international organizations to \n     the rebuilding of the earthquake-affected areas in Algeria.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution \nexpressing sympathy for the victims of the devastating earthquake that \nstruck Algeria on May 21, 2003.\n  Algeria, a North African nation and former colony of France, was \nrocked by an enormous earthquake registering 6.8 on the Richter scale \non May 21 killing more than 2,000 people, injuring 10,000 and leaving \nhundreds of thousands homeless.\n  I rise to extend my heartfelt sympathy to the Algerian people and to \nencourage the United States to commit itself to help Algerians pick up \ntheir lives and move past this tragedy.\n  President Bush committed funds to the Algerian Red Crescent Society, \nand the U.S. airlifted disaster supplies, including blankets, tents, \nmedical supply kits.\n  It is important that in Algeria's hour of need that we act as a \nhumane Nation. The kindness of a compassionate America can help heal \nthe wounds of Algeria.\n  We must define ourselves as a nation by the goodness and compassion \nwe extend to our fellow human beings who inhabit this world with us.\n  Though it is not simply in our self-interest, we should be careful to \nview our compassionate acts as instruments of goodwill presenting the \ncase for American leadership to the world. These acts of compassion can \nserve to further our interests while reinforcing the American ideal as \nsomething other nations would want to attain.\n  Thomas Jefferson stated that America ``should have an Empire for \nLiberty,'' meeting a moral obligation to defend and promote freedom \nthroughout the world. That remains for any American foreign policy, but \nis only buttressed by our willingness to serve our fellow man.\n  It would be a tragedy in this case if we were to wait for our ship to \ncome in; we should swim out to meet it. Algeria can be the mark where \nAmerica as a leading moral nation can greet his fellow suffering man \nwith open arms and mercy.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on May 21 of this year a devastating \nearthquake shook lives in Algeria and across the world. Two thousand \ntwo hundred people were killed, 10,000 were injured, and 200,000 more \nwere left homeless. In response, support from the international \ncommunity has been overwhelming. The United Nations Disaster Assessment \nand Coordination Team estimates that 85 international flights from 27 \ndifferent countries landed in Algiers to assist in the emergency relief \nefforts. Officials in Algeria state that more than 30,000 government \nworkers and 10,000 military personnel were involved in relief \nactivities. The United States alone has given over $1.3 million in \nassistance, providing blankets, tents, and medical supplies.\n  Furthermore I am pleased that many businesses from my home State of \nOklahoma are now helping in the reconstruction. They will bring to \nAlgeria the best resources and equipment available to help rebuild the \nfallen cities. LWPB Architects, Atkins-Benham Constructors and Terex \nRoad Building Group are among the participating companies.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor this resolution by my colleague from Kansas \nthat expresses our deepest sympathies for the victims of this tragedy. \nIt is our hope that through this international partnership, Algeria \nwill arise a stronger nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/22/senate-section/article/S9737-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1318.

The programs supported by the Office of Science \nsupport many of the DOE's missions. The research of the Office lays the \nfoundation for many of the current and future developments in the \napplied missions of the DOE in energy, defense, and environmental \nissues.\n  Because of the limited time available for the hearing, witnesses may \ntestify by invitation only.

Mr. President, I would like to announce for the \ninformation of the Senate and the public that the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs \nwill hold a hearing entitled ``SARS: Best Practices for Identifying And \nCaring for New Cases.'' At the hearing, officials from the General \nAccounting Office will release the results from a study that I \nrequested of national best practices for identifying and locating SARS \ncases. This hearing is a followup to the subcommittee's May 2003 \nhearing on coordinating the response to individual SARS outbreaks among \nlocal, State, and Federal officials as well as between government \nofficials and the private sector. While officials from global health \nagencies have indicated that, for the moment, SARS appears to have \nstabilized, there is concern that this is simply a lull before the \nstorm. At the subcommittee's May 2003 hearing individuals within the \nhealth care community relayed their concerns that there will be \nreemergence of SARS this fall. With that in mind, the subcommittee's \nupcoming hearing will examine the best practices that can be identified \nfor controlling SARS within the health care and community setting.\n  The hearing will take place on Wednesday, July 30, 2003, at 9 a.m., \nin room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building.
