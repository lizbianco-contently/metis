Mr. President, the Senate will spend the day in \nexecutive session deliberating, once again, and for the ninth day, the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada to be a circuit court judge for the DC \nCircuit. The Senate will recess from 12:15 to 2:30 for the weekly party \nlunches. Between now and the next recess we have a number of important \nissues that the majority leader would like to see addressed. Therefore, \nhe hopes we can get passed this delay and let the Senate work its will \non this nomination. Senators should be advised, therefore, that \nrollcall votes are possible during the day.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The deputy minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend--in fact, the two \nSenators from Utah--that, as I indicated to the majority leader last \nnight, there are three ways we can move off Estrada. The nomination can \nbe pulled. The decision can be made by this administration that he will \nsupply the memos from the Solicitor's Office while he worked there that \nhe wrote and allow more questioning of Estrada. Thirdly, the majority \nleader can file a motion to invoke cloture to see if there are the 60 \nvotes to move ahead.\n  If that does not happen, we can stay on Estrada for a long time. If \nthere are other things to do--and I mentioned yesterday I doubt that \nthere are--if there are other things to do, then let's move to those. \nIf not, then we can stay in this procedural quagmire, which is \nsomething that has been done in the past.\n  As I indicated yesterday, there have been, of course, filibusters of \nPresidential nominations in the past and Presidential nominations of \njudges. They usually are not as open and notorious as this, the reason \nbeing they come at a later time in the session where time is of the \nessence. Now time is not of the essence. There are other things that \nthe leader has decided are not important enough to be on the floor at \nthis stage.\n  So I would hope that everyone would understand that we are anxious to \nmove on to other judicial nominations. We are anxious to move on to \nother legislative matters. But as long as Miguel Estrada refuses to \nanswer the questions or to submit the memos that we have requested, \nthis is going to be the procedural posture of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, and I have a few things to say.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to address, once again, the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada for the United States Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit.\n  Are we ready to go?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend for the Senate to lay \ndown the pending orders, please.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2621-6", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Estrada, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  We started the debate on this nomination during the week of February \n3. We debated the entire week of February 10. And now here we are again \nin our third week of debate, all because some of my Democratic \ncolleagues refuse to allow an up-or-down vote on this nomination.\n  The renowned former Senator from Massachusetts, Henry Cabot Lodge, \nonce said that ``[t]o vote without debating is perilous, but to debate \nand never vote is imbecile.'' Yet that is precisely what is happening \non Mr. Estrada's nomination. We are debating and debating and debating \nthe same points again and again but never actually voting on the \nnomination. Enough is enough. It is time to vote.\n  My Republican colleagues and I have tried to get an agreement to vote \non Mr. Estrada's nomination no fewer than three separate times. Each \ntime, our Democratic colleagues blocked our efforts. I even suggested \nthat we agree to debate on this nomination for 10 hours, then 20 hours, \nthen up to 50 hours before voting. Fifty hours. That is 10 hours of \nsolid debate every day for the entire week, and 2 \\1/2\\ times the \namount of time that we give for a reconciliation bill around here. But \neach time, our Democratic friends rejected our entreaties, without \nhesitation or even good explanation.\n  We have to ask ourselves why our colleagues across the aisle are so \nintent on preventing a vote on Mr. Estrada's nomination. I have heard \nall of their arguments. They allege he did not answer their questions, \nthat he lacks judicial experience, and that he cannot be confirmed \nbefore they see confidential and privileged memos he authored at the \nSolicitor General's Office, just to name a few. And those memos were \nhis recommendations to the Solicitor General with regard to appeal \ndecisions, with regard to certiorari decisions, with regard to amicus \ncuriae decisions--very specific information that, if compromised and \nforced to be given to the Congress of the United States, could chill \nany future honest recommendations.\n  But all of these arguments they have raised are reasons they believe \nMr. Estrada should not be confirmed. As misguided and wrong as they \nare, these are reasons my Democratic friends believe they should vote \nagainst Mr. Estrada. None of those arguments justifies the continuation \nof this filibuster to prevent an up-or-down vote on Mr. Estrada's \nnomination.\n  So I say now to my Democratic friends: Vote for him or vote against \nhim. That is what we should do. If you don't like Mr. Estrada, if you \ndon't believe he has the capacity to be a circuit court of appeals \njudge, vote no. But if you do, as I think a majority does in this body, \nwe would vote aye. Do as your conscience dictates you must, but do not \nprolong the obstruction of the Senate by denying a vote on this \nnomination. Do not continue to treat the third branch of our Federal \nGovernment--the one branch intended to be insulated from political \npressures--with such disregard that we filibuster its nominees. Do not \nperpetuate this campaign of unfairness. Vote for him or vote against \nhim but just vote.\n  Now, an editorial that appeared in the Washington Post last week \nsummed it up well. This editorial, aptly entitled, ``Just Vote'' \nobserved--let me read the one part I want to emphasize, though I would \nnot mind reading the whole thing--\n\n       The arguments against Mr. Estrada's confirmation range from \n     the unpersuasive to the offensive. He lacks judicial \n     experience, his critics say--though only three current \n     members of the court had been judges before their \n     nominations. He is too young--though he is about the same age \n     as Judge Harry T. Edwards was when he was appointed [by \n     President Carter] and several years older than Kenneth W. \n     Starr was when he was nominated. Mr. Estrada stonewalled \n     the Judiciary Committee, they claim, by refusing to answer \n     questions--though his answers were similar in nature to \n     those of previous nominees, including many nominated by \n     Democratic presidents. The administration refused to turn \n     over his Justice Department memos--though no reasonable \n     Congress ought to be seeking such material, as a letter \n     from all living former solicitors general attests. He is \n     not a real Hispanic and, by the way, he was nominated only \n     because he is Hispanic--two arguments as repugnant as they \n     are incoherent. Underlying it all is the fact that \n     Democrats don't want to put a thinking conservative \n     [Hispanic] on the court.\n\n  That is what it comes down to.\n  Continuing from the Post:\n\n       It's long past time to stop these games and vote.\n\n  I will read the editorial from beginning to end because it is the \nWashington Post. A lot of my friends on the other side love the \nWashington Post. I have to say that I love it, too, but not for the \nsame reasons. This is what it says:\n\n       The Senate has recessed without voting on the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit. Because of a Democratic filibuster, it spent much of \n     the week debating Mr. Estrada, and, at least for now, enough \n     Democrats are holding together too prevent the full Senate \n     from acting. The arguments against Mr. Estrada's confirmation \n     range from the unpersuasive to the offensive. He lacks \n     judicial experience, his critics say--though only three \n     current members of the court had been judges before their \n     nominations. He is too young--though he is about the same age \n     as Judge Harry T. Edwards was when he was appointed and \n     several years older than Kenneth W. Starr was when he was \n     nominated. Mr. Estrada stonewalled the Judiciary Committee by \n     refusing to answer questions--though his answers were similar \n     in nature to those of previous nominees, including many \n     nominated by Democratic presidents. The administration \n     refused to turn over his Justice Department memos--though no \n     reasonable Congress ought to be seeking such material, as a \n     letter from all living former solicitors general attests. He \n     is not a real Hispanic and, by the way, he was nominated only \n     because he is Hispanic--two arguments as repugnant as they \n     are incoherent. Underlying it all is the fact that Democrats \n     don't want to put a conservative on the court.\n       Laurence H. Silberman, a senior judge on the court to which \n     Mr. Estrada aspires to serve, recently observed that under \n     the current standards being applied by the Senate, not one of \n     his colleagues could predictably secure confirmation. He's \n     right. To be sure, Republicans missed few opportunities to \n     play politics with President Clinton's nominees. But the \n     Estrada filibuster is a step beyond even those deplorable \n     games. For Democrats demand, as a condition of a vote, \n     answers to questions that no nominee should be forced to \n     address--and that nominees have not previously been forced to \n     address. If Mr. Estrada cannot get a vote, there will be no \n     reason for Republicans to allow the next David S. Tatel--a \n     distinguished liberal member of the court--to get one when a \n     Democrat someday again picks judges. Yet the D.C. Circuit--\n     and all courts, for that matter--would be all the poorer were \n     it composed entirely of people whose views challenged nobody.\n       Nor is the problem just Mr. Estrada. John G. Roberts Jr., \n     Mr. Bush's other nominee to the D.C. Circuit, has been \n     waiting nearly two years for a Judiciary Committee vote. \n     Nobody has raised a substantial argument against him. Indeed, \n     Mr. Roberts is among the most highly regarded appellate \n     lawyers in the city. Yet on Thursday, Democrats invoked a \n     procedural rule to block a committee vote anyway--just for \n     good measure. It's long past time to stop these games and \n     vote.\n\n  I think the Washington Post has it just right. The fact is there \nhasn't been one good argument used against Mr. Estrada. They can't \npoint to one reason he should not be confirmed to this circuit court of \nappeals. They can't give one logical, good, substantive reason to \nreject him. But I still grant them the right to vote against him if \nthat is the way they feel. If they in their hearts feel that this man \nwill not operate on the court the way he should, then, by gosh, they \nhave a right to do that. Naturally, I do take opposition or issues with \nthe Post's characterization of how we treated the Clinton nominees, but \nother than that, I think it is dead on.\n  Let me tell you why I take opposition. If you look at the facts, as I \nhave said before, President Reagan was the all-time confirmation \nchampion. He amazingly got 382 judges confirmed.\n  But he had 6 years of a Republican Senate, with control of the \nJudiciary Committee by Republicans, to help him to do that. I have \nheard so much whining from the other side about how badly President \nClinton's nominees were treated. It is repeated in this editorial to a \nlimited degree. But the fact is, President Clinton got virtually the \nsame number as President Reagan. Three hundred seventy-seven Federal \njudges were confirmed during President Clinton's 8 years, and for 6 of \nthose years the Republicans controlled the Senate and the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. He was treated very fairly.\n  If you go back in time, when President Bush was President, Bush 1, \nwhen he left his Presidency and the Democrats controlled the committee \nat that\n\n[[Page S2623]]\n\ntime, there were 97 vacancies and 54 left holding. In other words, 54 \nnominees did not get heard. By the way, one of them was John Roberts, \nwho has been sitting here for 11 years, nominated three times by two \ndifferent Presidents for this circuit court of appeals job. It isn't \njust 2 years, as the Post said; it is 11 years, going on 12. That is \ndisgraceful. He is considered one of the two greatest appellate lawyers \nin the country, arguing 39 cases before the Supreme Court. Yet he was \nblocked last week in committee as well.\n  The fact is, when President Clinton left office and I was still \nchairman of the committee, there were 41 left holding. There were 67 \nvacancies, 30 fewer than when the Democrats last held the committee \nwith a Republican President leaving office. And there were 41 left \nholding versus the 54 left by the Democrats. We didn't cry about that--\nat least I didn't. That is part of the process. There are always some \nleft holding because it is a difficult process to get through. Could we \nhave done better? I think we could have done better; I will acknowledge \nthat. The fact is, we didn't cry when they left 54 hanging, and they \nshouldn't be crying because 41 of theirs were left hanging. By the way, \nof the 41, at least 9 were put up so late no committee chairman could \nhave gotten them through, so it was really only 32. And if you go back \nthrough these, for many there was no consultation with the Republican \nSenators, an absolute must in order to confirm people.\n  I happen to know this administration is consulting with Democrat \nSenators. To the degree that Senators say they are not, that is because \nthey interpret the consultation to mean doing what they want rather \nthan what the President wants. That is not the definition of \nconsulting.\n  There is a point here that bears repeating because I believe that in \nthe debate over Mr. Estrada's nomination this point has been lost. My \nDemocratic colleagues have articulated every reason under the Sun they \nbelieve they should vote against Mr. Estrada, yet they will not allow \nhis nomination to proceed to a vote. Why is this? I will tell you what \nI think, plainly put, with no window dressing: I think it is because \nthey are afraid Mr. Estrada will be confirmed if there is a vote on his \nnomination. I predict he will be. They believe a majority of the \nMembers of this body will vote to confirm him.\n  The only way they can prevent this from happening is to filibuster \nhis nomination. As I said last week, when a minority of Senators \nprevent a majority from voting on a judicial nomination, it is nothing \nbut tyranny of the minority. It is unfair, and it has no place in the \nprocess we use to confirm judges.\n  Last week, I noted that some of my Democratic colleagues were not \nalways so eager to use a filibuster to prevent a vote on judicial \nnominations.\n  I think it is important to note again what some of my colleagues had \nto say about filibustering judicial nominees when there was a Democrat \nin the White House. The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the \nSenator from Vermont, said in 1999:\n\n       I . . . do not want to see the Senate go down a path where \n     a minority of the Senate is determining a judge's fate on \n     votes of 41.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from California, who also serves on the \nJudiciary Committee, likewise said in 1999:\n\n       A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them \n     down.\n\n  She continued:\n\n       It is our job to confirm these judges. If we don't like \n     them, we can vote against them. That is the honest thing to \n     do. If there are things in their background, in their \n     abilities that don't pass muster, vote no.\n\n  My colleague from Massachusetts, a former Judiciary Committee \nchairman, said in 1998:\n\n       Nominees deserve a vote. If our Republican colleagues don't \n     like them, vote against them. But don't just sit on them--\n     that is obstruction of justice.\n\n  I wonder why it was obstruction of justice then but it is not today. \nIt does appear to be a double standard, as White House counsel said \nthis week on television. There is a double standard being applied to \nthis Hispanic nominee, without any legitimate, logical, good reason for \nholding him up.\n  I think I have made my point. When the shoe was on the other foot--\nwhen a Democratic President was the one nominating Federal judges--my \nDemocratic colleagues stood firm against the idea that a judicial \nnominee should be denied a vote. But now that it is a Republican \nPresident nominating Federal judges, things are obviously different to \nthem. They apparently no longer believe it is a problem to go down a \npath where a minority of the Senate is determining a judge's fate on \nvotes of 41, or requiring a supermajority vote of 60 in order to have a \nnominee approved and confirmed--even though our obligation is to advise \nand consent. That means a vote up or down. They no longer believe that \nvoting on a nominee--whether for or against--is the honest thing to do, \nand they no longer believe that denying nominees a vote is obstruction \nof justice--which is what they called it when they had the Presidency. \nAnd liberals were being nominated and confirmed by us then.\n  There is no question that we are in the middle of a full-blown \nfilibuster of Mr. Estrada's nomination. The Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer, has said they are not filibustering. What the heck is it then? \nPreventing a vote up or down on the nominee is called a filibuster. \nThey can prevent a vote, as long as they can require us to get 60 votes \nand as long as they have at least 41 votes against cloture. Never \nbefore has an appellate court nominee--or any lower court nominee, for \nthat matter--been defeated through a filibuster.\n  If this filibuster is successful, if Mr. Estrada's nomination is \ndenied a vote, we are entering into a sad new chapter in the \nconfirmation of judicial nominees. It is a chapter where the will of a \nminority of the Members of this body can obstruct the confirmation of a \nlower court nominee. Simply put, it is tyranny of the minority, and it \nis unfair.\n  I have to admit there were some on our side during the Clinton years \nwho wanted to filibuster some of his judges. In all honesty, I fought \nagainst that and helped to prevent it. We never had a true filibuster \nagainst a circuit court of appeals nominee. I thought it was unfair \nthen, and I think it is unfair today.\n\n  It is significant that, in addition to the Washington Post, many \nother fine newspapers across the country, from California to Maine, \nhave taken note of what is going on in the Senate and have spoken out \nagainst a filibuster. These are newspapers that generally do not, as a \nmatter of regular practice, comment on the Senate's confirmation of \nFederal judges. The fact that these newspapers have chosen to speak out \nagainst a filibuster of Mr. Estrada--a nominee with no connection to \ntheir own State--says quite a lot about the blatant unfairness of what \nis going on here.\n  Take, for example, the Riverside, CA, Press-Enterprise. In a February \n18 editorial, it said:\n\n       The Democrats' tactic employed last week of filibustering \n     the nomination of [Mr. Estrada] . . . is an anything-goes \n     strategy that ought to be abandoned.\n\n  This is a newspaper that happens to agree with the Democrats' \ncontention--which I think is absolutely baseless--that Mr. Estrada was \nnot completely open during his testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee. It is also a newspaper that was pretty harsh on us \nRepublicans in the same editorial--unjustly, in my view, but that is a \ndifferent story. The point is that its anti-filibuster position is even \nmore credible. The Press-Enterprise is saying that even if you did not \nlike the way Mr. Estrada answered questions before the committee, that \nis no reason to filibuster his nomination.\n  As they concluded:\n\n       [T]he process has to stop at some point. It's one of advice \n     and consent, not advise and confront.\n\n  Let's look at what some of the other newspapers across the country \nhave been saying since this filibuster started 3 weeks ago. Like the \nRiverside Press-Enterprise, many of these newspapers are quite harsh on \nus Republicans, too, but they are united on one point: The filibuster \nof Mr. Estrada's nomination is unfair and it should end.\n  Another California newspaper, the Redding Record Searchlight, had \nthis to say:\n\n       This filibuster comes at a time when there are all sorts of \n     pressing issues before the nation. The tactic has no excuse. \n     . . . If liberals in the Senate think conservatives will \n     spell the end of civilization if they become judges, they can \n     vote against Estrada. Keeping others from voting their \n     consciences on this\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\n     particular matter is more than slightly reprehensible.\n\n  The Bangor Daily News in Maine wrote that the Democrats:\n\n       are mistreating a fellow citizen through the same means \n     they fear an unqualified judge would employ: using their \n     authority to harshly punish someone on ideological grounds. \n     It is unfair no matter which party does it and it is harmful \n     to the working of the Senate.\n\n  Well, amen to that.\n  The Providence Journal-Bulletin in Rhode Island said:\n\n       The point about Miguel Estrada is not that he may or may \n     not harbor conservative judicial opinions. The point is that \n     he is an inspiring American success story, a brilliant \n     scholar, a distinguished public servant, and an outstanding \n     lawyer. For Senate Democrats to talk down his nomination is \n     not just embarrassing, but outrageous.\n\n  The Grand Forks Herald in North Dakota wrote in an editorial entitled \n``Stop the Filibuster'' that Senate Democrats ``should back off and let \nthe Senate vote.''\n  The Chicago Sun-Times asked:\n\n       [W]ho can look at the spectacle of the 108th Congress and \n     not believe that both justice and the basic operation of the \n     Nation is being sacrificed on the altar of ugly, \n     obstructionist, partisan politics?\n\n  They continued:\n\n       Our legal system cannot and must not be held hostage to \n     political nitpicking.\n\n  The Rochester, NY, Democrat and Chronicle opined:\n\n       Yet another fight over a judicial nominee should not \n     descend to filibuster.\n\n  The Detroit News wrote:\n\n       Estrada should have his nomination put up for an ordinary \n     vote, as have all of his predecessors.

The Founding Fathers placed it into a \n     political area. The president nominates and the Senate \n     confirms--or doesn't--but that doesn't mean anything goes.\n       The Democrats' tactic employed last week of filibustering \n     the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is an anything-\n     goes strategy that ought to be abandoned. However, with 49 \n     Democratic senators, they are likely to be able to muster the \n     41 votes needed to maintain a filibuster.\n       What makes the filibuster inappropriate is that it is \n     rarely used to block a judicial nominee, and Mr. Estrada \n     hardly qualifies as a target for such a big gun. Yes, he was \n     not completely open with members of the Judiciary Committee \n     when he appeared, and Democratic senators are frustrated by \n     the White House's refusal to release to them memoranda he \n     wrote as solicitor general.\n       But in the best of times, such a request would be out of \n     line, and these are closer to the worst than to the best for \n     the nomination process. If the memoranda were to be used as \n     an honest beginning to a discussion of Ms. Estrada's legal \n     views, there might be some justification for releasing the \n     documents that would normally be considered privileged.\n       One suspects that's not the role the Democrats have in mind \n     for the memoranda. They probably hope to expose Mr. Estrada's \n     conservative views, which no one doubts he holds, in hopes of \n     defeating the nomination or at least scoring some political \n     points.\n       The two parties have been allowing their political battles \n     over judicial nominees to escalate since Robert H. Bork's \n     nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987. One suspects \n     that Republicans, if they were in the minority, would have \n     done the same with the Estrada nomination. The parties need \n     to de-escalate.\n       A first step would be to not filibuster nominations like \n     this one of a well-qualified nominee. He's distinctly an \n     American success story, having immigrated from Honduras, gone \n     to Columbia and Harvard and served as a clerk to a Supreme \n     Court justice.\n       Democrats, or Republicans when they are in the minority, \n     may fairly make things tough on a nominee in committee or on \n     the Senate floor, in order to fashion nominations more to \n     their liking. But the process has to stop at some point. It's \n     one of advice and consent, not advise and confront.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Redding Record Searchlight, Feb. 15, 2003]\n\n             Senate Liberals Should Not Fear Vote for Judge\n\n       Miguel Estrada is--oh no, oh no, can it be?--a \n     conservative, and if that makes your heart pound with fear, \n     you may very well be a Democrat serving in the Senate. You \n     would then be among those trying to thwart majoritarian \n     decision-making with a filibuster, there being no chance that \n     an honest vote will go your way.\n       It's irresponsible and an outrage, this hysteria being \n     acted out by the Democrats to keep Estrada from serving on \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. But \n     the Democrats do have their excuses, each more petty and \n     pathetic than the next.\n       One excuse is that they just don't know enough about this \n     fellow, but there is a life history here, and a rather \n     amazing one: Estrada immigrated to this country from \n     Honduras, graduated with honors at Columbia College, was \n     editor of the Law Review at Harvard Law School, was a clerk \n     to a Supreme Court justice, has argued before the Supreme \n     Court 15 times, has done pro bono work for a down-and-outer \n     and has received the highest possible recommendation of the \n     American Bar Association.\n       Well, but the administration won't hand over memos he wrote \n     when he was in the solicitor general's office, say the Senate \n     Democrats. It apparently does not matter to them that \n     publicizing them could rob future memos of their candor and \n     that every former solicitor general of either party has said \n     the Democrats seek too much.\n       But listen, the Democrats continue, Estrada refused to blab \n     his heart out when he appeared before a Senate committee, as \n     if they did not know that its violates widely endorsed \n     principles to indicate beforehand how you as a judge might \n     decide cases that could come before you. Estrada did say he \n     would be an impartial judge loyal to the law. On other \n     topics--his broad political views--he was relatively quiet, \n     which is fine.\n       This filibuster comes at a time when there are all sorts of \n     pressing issues before the nation. The tactic has no excuse \n     (although there are explanations, such as a Democratic fear \n     that Estrada would be in line for a Supreme Court nomination \n     if he gets this other judgeship first). If liberals in the \n     Senate think conservatives will spell the end of civilization \n     if they become judges, they can vote against Estrada. Keeping \n     others from voting their consciences on this particular \n     matter is more than slightly reprehensible.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Bangor Daily News, Feb. 19, 2003]\n\n                           Voting on Estrada\n\n       George Washington took office April 30, 1789, but the \n     Senate waited until Aug. 5 of that year to reject one of his \n     nominees--Banjamin Fishbourn of Georgia, one of 102 \n     appointments submitted by President Washington to become \n     collectors, naval officers and surveyors of seaports. The \n     Senate thus established the use of its authority for advise \n     and consent and simultaneously demonstrated that no \n     appointment is too minor to fret over.\n       Just before they left for vacation last week, Senate \n     Democrats had begun what they say will be an extended \n     filibuster of the nomination of Miguel Estrada, nominated in \n     May 2001 by President Bush to become U.S. circuit judge for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit. The Democrats say they do \n     not have enough information about the nominee and cannot \n     persuade him to talk sufficiently about his judicial \n     philosophy so cannot allow a vote.\n       This lack of information, however, has not stopped \n     conservative groups from strongly supporting the nomination \n     and liberal groups from strongly opposing it. They know \n     enough to choose a position, as do the Democrats, who \n     actually mean by insufficient information that they would \n     like to reject a Bush nominee but were hoping to find a \n     larger reason for doing so than the fact that Mr. Estrada \n     apparently supports strong anti-loitering laws, to the \n     detriment of migrant workers.\n       Democratic Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada a couple of weeks ago \n     quoted comments his Republican colleagues offered during the \n     Clinton administration on the requirement that the Senate \n     ``do what it can to ascertain the jurisprudential views a \n     nominee will bring to the bench,'' to use an example from \n     Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. (Sen. Reid also offered \n     numerous precedents in which memoranda of the sort Mr. \n     Estrada wrote while advising the solicitor general have been \n     made public, as they have not with this nomination.) Sen. \n     Reid's point, of course, is that if this behavior was \n     acceptable for Republicans it ought to be acceptable for \n     Democrats. But for the public, it is not acceptable in either \n     case.\n       The Senate has a long history of rejecting presidential \n     nominations, from Cabinet appointments right down to \n     surveyors of seaports. Democrats, having drawn out this \n     nomination for maximum political effect, now face the \n     questions of backlash for appearing to beat up a nominee. \n     More importantly, they are mistreating a fellow citizen \n     through the same means they fear an unqualified judge would \n     employ: using their authority to harshly punish someone based \n     on ideological grounds. It is unfair no matter which party \n     does it and it is harmful to the working of the Senate.\n       The Democrats should consider that the information they \n     have in hand is all they will get and allow, even encourage, \n     a vote. If the information is insufficient, they should vote \n     no and see if they can round up enough votes to block the \n     nomination. If it is sufficient and they have no substantial \n     questions about Mr. Estrada's abilities, they should vote yes \n     even if they do not agree with all of\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\n     his politics.

To that \n     end, Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D.-S.D.) and his colleagues \n     have demanded not only supplementary detailed responses to \n     political inquiries, but also Mr. Estrada's confidential \n     memoranda written while he was an assistant solicitor \n     general. Every living solicitor general, Democratic and \n     Republican, has gone on record to oppose this unwarranted \n     intrusion into the deliberative process in the Justice \n     Department. And the Bush administration has been correct to \n     resist Democratic demands.\n       Make no mistake: Senate Democrats are worried that \n     President Bush might nominate conservative lawyers and \n     jurists to the federal bench. But that is no reason to reject \n     a highly qualified nominee. Just as Bill Clinton appointed \n     judicial liberals to the federal bench--including three \n     Supreme Court justices--it stands to reason that Mr. Bush \n     will nominate conservatives.\n       The process is called democracy. Democrats may not like the \n     results of the 2000 presidential election, but their recourse \n     is to win back the White House in 2004, not to subject \n     distinguished nominees like Miguel Estrada to political \n     torture.\n       And after all, judicial nominations are for life, and no \n     president can be clairvoyant. When Franklin Roosevelt \n     nominated Felix Frankfurter for the Supreme Court in 1939, he \n     had no idea that Justice Frankfurter would evolve into one of \n     the court's leading conservatives. And when the first George \n     Bush nominated David Souter for the court in 1989, he might \n     have changed his mind if he had known that Justice Souter \n     would become one of the court's reliable liberals.\n       The point about Miguel Estrada is not that he may or may \n     not harbor conservative judicial opinions. The point is that \n     he is an inspiring American success story, a brilliant \n     scholar, a distinguished public servant and an outstanding \n     lawyer.

The second is to convince a few Republicans to vote \n     against those nominees on the floor. Both of those methods \n     use politics' most-respected and time-honored technique: \n     persuasion--persuading voters in the first case, colleagues \n     in the second, of the strength and power of your argument.\n       In the U.S. Senate, however, there's also a coercive and \n     borderline-irresponsible method for the minority party to \n     have its way. That method is the filibuster. Senate Democrats \n     are staging one now against Miguel Estrada, an appeals court \n     nominee.\n       They should back off and let the Senate vote.\n       A filibuster is a delay that can't be broken without a \n     supermajority's consent. Now, at times in a democracy, a \n     ``tyranny of the majority'' may arise that principled \n     senators feel they must resist. This isn't one of those \n     times. Estrada is neither a criminal, nor a spy, nor a hack \n     whose nomination sprang from backroom deals where money \n     changed hands.\n       Just the opposite: He is, by every account, a living, \n     breathing embodiment of the American dream. An immigrant from \n     Honduras, Estrada spoke little English when he came to the \n     United States at age 17. Yet, he graduated with honors from \n     Harvard Law School, clerked for a Supreme Court justice and \n     built an honorable and exemplary career.\n       He's also a judicial conservative. And if there's one thing \n     that drives some Democrats berserk, it's a person from an \n     ethnic minority background who strays from the party line.\n       That's why the Democrats are filibustering. That's why \n     they're holding up matters of real-life war and peace. That's \n     why they're thwarting the majority's will and asserting an \n     anti-democratic veto power on a matter of congressional \n     routine.\n       And that's why they ought to back off.\n       Because frankly, those reasons are politics, nor principle. \n     And politics isn't enough.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Feb. 14, 2003]\n\n         Wheels of Justice Caught in Washington Gridlock, Again\n\n       ``The time has come for the U.S. Senate to stop playing \n     politics with the American judicial system.

But the Democrats \n     forget that, if they manage to torpedo the Republican agenda, \n     then the Republicans are not really fully in power, and \n     whatever problems are certain to come are the fault of both \n     parties.

Bush's nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. would further poison an \n     already badly damaged judicial nomination process.\n       Both parties share the blame for the wrecked process. But \n     Senate Democrats are now engaging in revenge for bad GOP \n     behavior in the second term of former President Clinton, when \n     Republicans stalled votes on a number of his nominees, \n     ultimately derailing them when Bush gained the presidency. \n     Until the GOP regained the Senate last November, they tied up \n     a number of Bush nominations in committee.\n       Now, the Democrats have a chance to rise above partisan \n     political hackery and end this stupid game. Instead, they are \n     seriously considering making the situation worse.\n       Miguel Estrada is a well-regarded native of Honduras who \n     served in the office of U.S. solicitor general under both \n     former Presidents Clinton and George H.W. Bush. The solicitor \n     general represents the U.S. government before the Supreme \n     Court.\n       Estrada has personally argued 15 cases before the nation's \n     highest court. He has been unanimously rated ``well-\n     qualified'' by the\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\n     American Bar Association--which Senate Democrats declared \n     would be the ``gold standard'' by which they would assess \n     judicial nominees when they controlled the Senate.\n       Estrada's nomination was one of those bottled up in \n     committee. With the GOP in control, his nomination has now \n     been voted out to the Senate floor. The nomination is drawing \n     more than the usual interest because Estrada, 42, is \n     considered a strong possibility for eventual nomination to \n     the U.S. Supreme Court by President Bush.\n       Senate Democrats are deciding just how much they want to \n     obstruct the president's nominees. A filibuster can only be \n     broken by 60 votes--9 votes more than is usually required for \n     a nominee to be approved. Reportedly, a filibuster has never \n     before been used to block an appointment to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals.\n       Democrats complained that Estrada, during his committee \n     hearings, declined to tell them his positions on particular \n     issues. It is a violation of the canons of judicial ethics \n     for potential judges to do that.\n       Democrats also demanded that he produce his memos and \n     recommendations while he was in the solicitor general's \n     office--which had never been done for any other candidate who \n     had been an assistant in that office. The demand was rejected \n     not only by Estrada, but by every former solicitor general \n     still living, including those who served Democratic \n     presidents.\n       The level of obstruction his nomination has faced has been \n     truly extraordinary. Michigan Sens. Carl Levin and Debbie \n     Stabenow--who are running their own vendetta in blocking four \n     Bush nominees to the Court of Appeals in Cincinnati--\n     shouldn't be a part of it. That would be an insult to their \n     Hispanic constituents.\n       Estrada should have his nomination put up for an ordinary \n     vote, as have all his predecessors. If he loses, fair enough. \n     But as filibuster would signal an unreasonable posture by \n     Democratic senators that could have long-term--and damaging--\n     consequences for how business is conducted in the U.S. \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with these newspapers that the perpetuation of \nthis filibuster against Mr. Estrada's nomination is extremely unfair. \nIt is unfair to the majority of the Members of the Senate who stand \nprepared to vote on Mr. Estrada's nomination. It is certainly unfair to \nMr. Estrada, whose life is in limbo while the Senate engages in its \nendless debate. It is unfair to the American people, who have a \njustified expectation that the Senate will vote on Mr. Estrada's \nnomination and move on to debate and consider other important business.\n  The solution is not to protract debate, upon which some of my \nDemocratic colleagues insist. The solution is not to go on a fishing \nexpedition for privileged, confidential memoranda Mr. Estrada once \nauthored on appeal recommendations, certiorari recommendations, and \namicus curiae recommendations. The solution is not to demand answers to \nquestions that Mr. Estrada already addressed when the Senate was under \nDemocratic control. The solution is for Senators to vote on Mr. \nEstrada's nomination. Vote for him or vote against him. Do what your \nconscience dictates.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              hillbillies\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise this morning--and I appreciate the \ngenerosity of the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont in \ngiving me this opportunity--to get something off my chest.\n  CBS Television is currently planning what that great company calls \n``a hillbilly reality show.'' I would like to say a few words about \nthat as a Senator who happens to be a hillbilly.\n  I can call myself that, Mr. President, but please don't you call me \nthat, for ``hillbilly'' is a term of derision that was first coined in \nApril of 1900 when the New York Journal had an article on ``Hill \nBillies'' with this description:\n\n       A free and untrammeled white citizen who lives in the \n     hills, has no means to speak of, talks as he pleases, drinks \n     whiskey when he gets it and fires off his revolver as his \n     fancy strikes him.\n\n  The description has not improved very much over the past 100 years. \nWhite minstrel shows depicting these ignorant creatures played to \nlaughing audiences in New York and Chicago in the 1920s and 1930s.\n  After a man named Al Capp saw one, he dreamed up the comic strip \n``Li'l Abner'' who lived in a place called Dogpatch with a mama who \nsmoked a pipe and a girlfriend named Daisy Mae who ran around \nbarefooted and half naked. It was a riot, and it made Al Capp a \nfortune.\n  A short time later, Snuffy Smith, a wife abuser with his ever-present \njug of moonshine, also appeared in comic strips around the Nation. Then \ncame Ma and Pa Kettle in the movies and the Beverly Hillbillies on \ntelevision. Even the contemporary poet and author James Dickey has \ncontributed to this false image of mountain people by portraying them \nas depraved cretins in his popular book and movie ``Deliverance.''\n  My neighbors and I have lived with this ridicule and overdrawn \nstereotype all of our lives, as did our parents and their parents \nbefore them. My roots run very deep in the Appalachian Mountains of \nNorth Georgia where I was born and raised and always have made my home. \nIt is where my children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren live \ntoday.\n  My ancestors were among the very first mountain settlers. They were \ndescendants of the Scotch-Irish who were driven out of Northern Ireland \nby the Stuart Kings. They landed in Maryland and Virginia and migrated \nwestward as far as the hostile Indians and French would allow, and then \nmoved southward into the heart of a region of rugged mountains and \nbeautiful valleys we now know as Appalachia.\n  They were accompanied and followed by the Huguenots, Pennsylvania \nQuakers, Palatine Germans, and various dissatisfied Protestant sects.\n  These mountain people were the very first Americans to fall back on \ntheir own resources as they settled in isolation from the remainder of \nthe Nation and the world.\n  Their language, customs, character, possessions, knowledge, and tools \nwere isolated with them and suspended in time, an unchanging microcosm \nof early American thought, culture, and mores.\n  These mountaineers possessed the qualities that formed the \nfundamental elements of pioneer American character: love of liberty, \npersonal courage, a capacity to withstand and overcome hardship, \nunstinted hospitality, intense family loyalty, innate humor, and trust \nin God.\n  It could be said that if they had one overriding characteristic, it \nwould have to be independence. They developed as extreme, rugged \nindividualists who never closed their doors, had inherent self-respect, \nwere honest and shrewd, knew no grades of society, and had unconscious \nand unspoiled dignity. They were utterly without pretension or \nhypocrisy.\n\n  When the Civil War came along, it was this area of the Mountain South \nthat opposed secession, for there were no vast plantations in the \nmountains of the South and very few slave owners among those poor \npeople. Some even fought on the side of the Union, with families \nsometimes divided over that terrible conflict.\n  Later, when the wars of the 20th century came along, it was the \nfamilies in the mountains of the South who sent a disproportionate \nshare of their young men who volunteered to fight in distant lands, far \naway from their peaceful valleys.\n  When this country was threatened to be torn apart over Watergate, it \nwas two great Members of this Senate from opposite parties but the same \npart of the country who helped keep this Nation on an even keel: \nDemocrat Sam Ervin from the mountains of North Carolina and Republican \nHoward Baker from the mountains of Tennessee.\n  I am very pleased and proud that these are my people, and I find that \none of the great ironies of history is that while the cowboy, another \ntype of frontiersman, has been glorified, the mountaineer--the first \nfrontiersman--has been ridiculed and caricatured in the image of a \nSnuffy Smith.\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\n  Why am I going into all of this? Because now in the 21st century--the \nenlightened 21st century--there are plans underway for a new hillbilly \nminstrel show using the same old stereotype, denigrating, laughing at, \nand ridiculing this group of people.\n  CBS calls it a reality show--CBS, the once proud and honorable \nbroadcasting company that brought us Edward R. Murrow and that \nunforgettable program of his, ``The Harvest of Shame.''\n  In the sixties, brave and courageous CBS reporters risked their lives \nto cover the civil rights struggles in the South, and for decades, \nCBS's ``60 Minutes'' has set the standard for all of television. But \ntoday in this money-grubbing world, CBS, it seems, has become just \nanother money-grubber.\n  It is now part of the giant Viacom. CBS has a CEO named Mr. Les \nMoonves, the man who is pushing this program-to-be; a man who obviously \nbelieves that network television is an ethics-free zone and that it is \nacceptable for big profits to always come ahead of good taste.\n  I do not know Mr. Moonves, but from his actions, it seems he is a \nperson who cares little about human dignity and believes television has \nno social responsibility. I suppose we should not be surprised, for his \nilk have been around long before the creators of Li'l Abner and Snuffy \nSmith. Since the beginning of civilization, there have always been some \nHomo sapiens who, it seems, had to have someone to look down upon, some \ngroup to feel superior to. For this kind of person, it is as basic to \ntheir human nature as the drive to reproduce or the urge for food and \nwater. They were there in the time of the Greeks. They were there in \nthe time of the Romans. They can be found all through the Bible. That \nis what the parable of the Good Samaritan is all about.\n  Jesus was very concerned about how the rejects of society were looked \ndown upon and warned us about ``a haughty spirit'' and an ``unkind \nheart.''\n  Shakespeare wrote about them as did Dickens and Steinbeck and \nFaulkner. And songwriter Merle Haggard, who knew personally how it \nfelt, wrote that memorable line ``another class of people put us \nsomewhere just below, one more reason for my mama's ``Hungry Eyes.''\n  This country was not meant to be this way. We are supposed to be \nbetter than that. More than two centuries ago, Moses Sexius was the \nwarden of the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, RI.\n  He wrote hopefully to the President of this new Nation of his delight \nat the birth of a government ``which to bigotry gives no sanction, to \npersecution no assistance, but generously affords to all liberty of \nconscience.''\n  That new President, George Washington, wrote back.\n  Here is a copy if the letter affirming that the Government of the \nUnited States ``would give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no \nassistance.'' That was Washington's dream for this country.\n  What CBS and CEO Moonves proposed to do with this Cracker Comedy is \n``bigotry'' pure and simple. Bigotry for big bucks. They will deny it. \nThey will say it is just harmless humor. But they know better and they \nfeel safe.\n  They know the only minority left in this country that you can make \nfun of, demean, humiliate, put down and hardly anyone will speak up in \ntheir defense are hillbillies in particular and poor rural people in \ngeneral. You can ridicule them with impunity.\n  Can you imagine this kind of program being suggested that would \ndisrespect an African American family or denigrate a Latino family? \nYears ago, the program Amos and Andy was removed from television--as it \nshould have been--because it was in poor taste and made fun of a \nminority.\n  In this wonderful and diverse country today, one of every six \nAmericans speaks some other language other than English in their homes. \nIn my home State of Georgia, their number has more than doubled in the \npast decade. I believe that may be the largest increase in the Nation.\n  From the red clay hills of Georgia to the redwood forests of \nCalifornia, all of us are struggling to answer the simple question: \nCan't we all get along?\n  And that daunting challenge, can't we live our lives as if we are all \ncreated equal? All of us: we eat, we sleep, we have strengths and \nweaknesses; we have dreams and anxieties. A tear knows no race, no \nreligion, no color. A tear has no accent. We all cry in the same \nlanguage.\n  Many years ago, the rabbis were asked why was it that in the \nbeginning God created just one man, Adam, and one woman, Sa-ba, or Eve. \nSurely, God could have created multitudes.\n  The rabbis answered that only one man and one woman were created to \nhelp us all remember that we all came from the same mother and father. \nSo no one should ever say, ``I'm better than you, ``and no one should \never feel, ``I'm less than you.''\n  CBS, Viacom, Mr. Moonves: I plead with you to call off your hillbilly \nhunt. Make your big bucks some other way. Appeal to the best in America \nnot the worst. Give bigotry no sanction.\n  For no one--not even a rich and powerful network like CBS--should \never use the airwaves of this Nation to say to one group of people in \nGod's image, ``We're better than you.''\n  And no one, Mr. Moonves, no one should ever be made to feel, \n``they're less than you.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \ncomments.\n  The Senator from Utah has spoken and will be coming back, and so I am \ngoing to speak about the Estrada nomination, the matter at hand. I say \nwhat everybody knows, especially those of us like the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, who have practiced law, becoming a Federal judge for \na lifetime is a privilege. It is not a right.\n  No nominee should be rewarded for stonewalling the Senate and the \nAmerican people. The Constitution directs Senators to use its judgment \nin voting on judicial nominees. It does not direct them to rubberstamp. \nIt says ``advise and consent,'' not advise and rubberstamp.\n  During the 17 months that the Democrats were in control of the \nSenate, we confirmed a record 100 of President Bush's judicial \nnominees. Interestingly enough, no judicial nominees of President \nBush's had been confirmed up to mid-July when I took over as chairman \nof the committee. Within 10 minutes of taking over as chairman of the \ncommittee, I called the first confirmation hearing, and in 17 months we \nset a record of moving nominations. We certainly acted faster, and I \nbelieve more fairly, than the Republicans did for President Clinton.\n  President Bush also has proposed several controversial nominees like \nMiguel Estrada. They divide the American people and the Senate. The \nPresident, of course, could easily end this impasse. I hope he will act \nto give Senators the answers they need to make informed judgments about \nthis nomination. That was suggested by one of the most distinguished \nand senior Republican Members of this Senate. So far it has been \nrejected by the White House. I hope they will reconsider. The President \ncan also help by choosing mainstream judicial nominees who can unite \ninstead of divide the American people.\n  Unfortunately, the White House seems to have this attitude that they \nshould divide and not unite, and I think that is a mistake. One of the \nunfortunate aspects of the President's determination to pack the \nFederal courts with extreme conservatives is a division that the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada has caused among Hispanics. Rather than \nnominate someone whom all Hispanic Americans would support, the \nPresident has chosen to divide rather than unite. The White House's \nideological litmus test has motivated the President to select another \nhighly controversial nominee rather than a consensus nominee.\n  Over the last several days, the division within the Hispanic \ncommunity has been the subject of a number of news reports. On February \n14, the Washington Times ran a front page story quoting a statement for \nthe National Council of La Raza noting that since the Latino community \nis clearly divided on the Estrada nomination, we find the accusation \nthat one side or another is anti-Latino to be particularly divisive and \ninappropriate.\n  The division was likewise noted in the Boston Globe on February 15, \nin a story by Wayne Washington. And on February 20, the Washington Post\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\nnoted the division in a story by Darryl Fears.\n  I ask unanimous consent that some of the articles on this issue be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 15, 2003]\n\n               Latinos Bitterly Debate Estrada Nomination\n\n                         (By Wayne Washington)\n\n       Washington.--President Bush's nomination of Miguel Estrada \n     for a federal judgeship has exposed sharp divisions among \n     Latinos, who are weighing the possibility of having one of \n     their own on a fast track to the US Supreme Court against a \n     fear that the minority group's interests could be harmed if \n     the Senate confirms that the conservative lawyer of Honduran \n     descent.\n       In the divisive intra-ethnic battle, some Latinos have \n     challenged Estrada's allegiance to the Hispanic community, an \n     accusation that others have sharply criticized. Each side has \n     at times accused the other of being anti-Latino. The debate \n     has gotten so nasty on Spanish-language television and over \n     the Internet that this week the National Council of La Raza, \n     a Latino group that says it is neutral on Estrada's \n     nomination, called for both sides to tone down their \n     language.\n       ``We urge those who are engaging in name-calling and \n     accusatory language to instead focus on the substantive \n     issues and merits of this nomination,'' the group said in its \n     statement. ``Since the Latino community is clearly divided on \n     the Estrada nomination, we find the accusation that one side \n     or another is `anti-Latino' to be particularly divisive and \n     inappropriate.''\n       Estrada's nomination to the Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia has been endorsed by the Hispanic Bar \n     Association, US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Latino \n     Coalition, and the League of United Latin American Citizens, \n     which is comparable to the NAACP. Opposed are the Mexican \n     American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Puerto Rican \n     Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Congressional \n     Hispanic Caucus, whose members are Democrats.\n       Bush nominated Estrada in May 2001, but Senate Democrats \n     blocked his approval. This week, they stalled the nomination \n     by threatening a filibuster. Estrada, 42, would be the first \n     Latino on the D.C. Appeals Court, where six of the nine \n     justices currently on the Supreme Court once served. Only 12 \n     of the 154 judges on federal appeals courts are Latinos; one \n     has never served on the nation's highest court.\n       Some observers have compared the volatile debate to \n     dissension among African-Americans when President George H.W. \n     Bush nominated Clarence Thomas--then a member of the D.C. \n     Court of Appeals--to the Supreme Court.\n       ``There are similar fault lines,'' said Lisa Navarrete, \n     spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, a nonprofit \n     Hispanic group that fights poverty and discrimination. ``Some \n     people said Clarence Thomas is African-American and would be \n     the only one on the court. He deserves our support. Others \n     felt that his views would be harmful to the community. \n     That's exactly what's happening here.''\n       Born in Honduras, Estrada immigrated to the United States \n     with his family as a teenager, graduated magna cum laude from \n     Columbia College, and earned a law degree from Harvard, where \n     he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He went on to \n     work as an assistant US attorney in New York and an assistant \n     to the solicitor general during the Clinton administration. \n     Currently, he is a partner in the Washington office of \n     Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.\n       His ethnicity and academic and legal record have been \n     enough to win the support of some Latinos, while critics \n     maintain that Estrada, a member of the conservative \n     Federalist Society, has not clearly spelled out his judicial \n     philosophy. He clerked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a \n     member of the conservative majority on the Supreme Court.\n       ``That Miguel Estrada is of the Hispanic culture counts far \n     more than the fact that he is a Republican or a Democrat,'' \n     said Tina Romero-Goodson, a social service official in New \n     Mexico. ``What weighs heavily with me is that he is Hispanic \n     and will have far more in common with me and mine than a \n     Democratic Anglo or African-American candidate.''\n       Representative Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, \n     said Estrada ``shares a surname'' with Latinos but has done \n     little to help them.\n       ``Mr. Estrada said he is unfamiliar with cases that are \n     important to our community,'' Menendez said. ``He has said \n     that his being Hispanic would be irrelevant to his role as a \n     judge. I don't want it to be irrelevant, and neither does the \n     community.''\n       That stark call to ethnic solidarity outrages other \n     Latinos.\n       ``I think it's just shameful,'' said Robert G. de Posada, \n     president of Latino Coalition, a nonprofit Washington-based \n     policy group. ``There is no other way to describe it.''\n       De Posada said Menendez and other congressional Democrats \n     are trying to portray Estrada as a well-off lawyer ``who \n     never had a problem in his life.''\n       Of Menendez, de Posada added: ``He's a Cuban-American who \n     looks completely white. I wonder: Has he faced the racism and \n     isolation that other Hispanics have faced? Can you challenge \n     his Hispanic-ness? I would never do that. He's a success \n     story. But so is Miguel Estrada.''\n       Pierre M. LaRamee, acting president of the Puerto Rican \n     Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Republicans have \n     attempted to portray Estrada as ``a Latino Horatio Alger.'' \n     That portrayal, LaRamee argues, makes it proper to question \n     just how representative he is of Latino communities.\n       ``He didn't come from a poor, disadvantaged background,'' \n     La Ramee said. ``He came from a background of relative \n     privilege. Of course, that's nothing negative about Miguel \n     Estrada. He's been successful.  .  .  . We'd rather have a \n     non-Latino judge who we believe would be a better judge.''\n       Supporters point out that Estrada did pro bono legal work \n     on antiloitering laws that some Latino community group \n     leaders believe led to the harassment of black and Latino \n     men.\n       Latinos who are not of Mexican-American descent have said \n     Estrada would get more support from Latinos if he were part \n     of it. Mexican-Americans are the largest subgroup of Latinos \n     in the United States.\n       ``There's a dirty little secret in the Hispanic \n     community,'' said Jennifer Braceras, a member of the U.S. \n     Commission on Civil Rights. ``There's a real intra-Hispanic \n     community rivalry. There's a real feeling in the Mexican-\n     American community that the first Latino Supreme Court \n     nominee should be Mexican-American.''\n       Not true, said Marisa Demeo, regional counsel for the \n     Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``It has \n     nothing to do with his ethnicity,'' she said. ``It has to do \n     with how he would be as a judge.''\n       Democrats are expected to resume their filibuster of \n     Estrada's confirmation when the Senate returns from a recess \n     on Feb. 24.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 20, 2003]\n\n                For Hispanic Groups, A Divide on Estrada\n\n\n               political, geographic fault lines exposed\n\n                           (By Darryl Fears)\n\n       When he spoke in support of federal judicial nominee Miguel \n     Estrada at a recent news conference, Jacob Monty masked his \n     harsh criticism of opponents in Spanish. He said Latinos who \n     are fighting against the Bush administration's choice for a \n     judgeship on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit ``no tienen verguenza''--have no shame.\n       That comment by Monty, a former chairman of the Texas-based \n     Association for the Advancement of Mexican Americans, was \n     just one shot in a bitter war of words that has divided \n     Latino politicians and civil rights organizations in ways \n     rarely seen.\n       It followed one fired by Rep. Robert Menendez (N.J.), a \n     member of the Democratic Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which \n     opposes the nominee. ``Being Hispanic for us,'' Menendez \n     said, ``means much more than having a surname''--a statement \n     his critics understood to imply that Estrada is not \n     ``Hispanic enough.''\n       The name-calling has reminded some observers of the \n     bitterness among African Americans during the Senate \n     confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Clarence \n     Thomas--a hearing that Thomas, a conservative black man, \n     likened to a lynching after liberal activists persuaded Anita \n     Hill, a former assistant, to come forward with sexual \n     harassment allegations against him.\n       Latino activists have differing perceptions of who Estrada \n     is and what kind of judge he would be.\n       Estrada's supporters say is a Latino success story, \n     immigrating as he did from Honduras at age 17 and going on to \n     graduate from Columbia College at Columbia University and \n     Harvard Law School, and clerking for Supreme Court Justice \n     Anthony M. Kennedy. He is now a partner with the District law \n     firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and a nominee for a judgeship \n     on what is considered the nation's second most powerful court \n     because it has jurisdiction over all appeals regarding \n     federal regulatory agencies.\n       Opponents question whether Estrada appreciates the \n     interests of poor people--his family came from the Honduran \n     elite--and say his conservative politics would color his \n     decisions on the bench. They say Estrada has a low regard for \n     hard-won civil rights protections that benefit Latinos.\n       Ideological wars over federal judicial nominations are \n     nothing new, but the fight among Latinos offers a small \n     window on how what will soon be the nation's largest ethnic \n     minority is divided by ideology and geography.\n       Of the Latino community's three most influential groups, \n     each has taken a different position on Estrada's nomination. \n     The League of United Latin American Citizens, based in Texas, \n     supports it; the Mexican American Defense and Educational \n     Fund, in California, opposes it, and the National Council of \n     La Raza, in Washington, has remained neutral.\n       The fuse for the current debate was lit in June, when \n     members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus met with Estrada \n     in the basement of the Capitol. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez (D-\n     Tex.) said the nominee at first looked uncomfortable as he \n     stared at the faces of 16 Democrats across the long \n     boardroom table.\n       ``We wanted to make sure the nominee . . . appreciates what \n     the court system means for Latinos,'' Gonzalez said recently. \n     Estrada was not available for comment.\n       ``We wanted him to give us some idea of how the role of a \n     judge impacts minority communities, and it just wasn't \n     there.''\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\n       Two weeks later, the caucus returned a recommendation \n     opposing Estrada's nomination to the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, then controlled by Democrats. Latino civil rights \n     groups read the recommendation, then met among themselves.\n       In October, the League of United Latin American Citizens \n     (LULAC) voted to support Estrada.\n       ``It was just very difficult for us not to support the guy, \n     given his impeccable credentials,'' said Hector Flores, \n     president of the Texas-based group. ``It's the American \n     dream, rising up from Honduras the way he has. The battle \n     isn't whether he's conservative; it's that he represents \n     Latinos, whether we like him or not.''\n       Flores said the vote to support Estrada was overwhelming, \n     but in recent days the California state delegation of LULAC \n     broke away from the national group in opposing the nominee. \n     In a Feb. 12 statement, a former president of LULAC, Mario \n     Obledo, opposed the nominee because of his ``sparse record'' \n     on civil and constitutional rights issues, and because he \n     declined to answer questions about his record in Senate \n     hearings.\n       LULAC's overall support was backed by Monty, the former \n     chairman of AAMA. His assertion that Estrada's opponents were \n     shameless was broadcast on C-SPAN and remembered by Flores, \n     who was present. Monty did not return several calls seeking \n     comment.\n       President Bush tried to keep up the pressure yesterday by \n     giving an interview by the Spanish-language Telemundo \n     network, and vigorously urged senators to confirm Estrada.\n       Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) recently said that Estrada's \n     Democratic opponents were ``anti-Latino,'' and brought howls \n     from his liberal colleagues and from leaders of Latino \n     organizations across the land.\n       Marisa Demeo, regional counsel for the Los Angeles-based \n     Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said \n     Hatch failed to mention three Latinos nominated for \n     judgeships by the Clinton administration whom Republican \n     senators opposed. Those nominations--of Jorge Rangel, Enrique \n     Moreno and Christine Arguello--were returned to President \n     Bill Clinton without a hearing or vote.\n       Demeo said LULAC and AAMA back Estrada for cosmetic \n     reasons. ``Because he's Latino, they would support him,'' she \n     said. ``They've been very strong in thinking there should be \n     a Latino sitting on the D.C. Circuit, and we say it is \n     important, but not as such a cost.''\n       The cost, she said, would be the weakening of civil rights \n     laws. ``The groups opposing have taken the analysis a step \n     further,'' Demeo said. ``We look at the record to determine \n     what kind of judge Mr. Estrada would be.''\n       MALDEF is supported by the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and \n     Educational Fund, the Southwest Voter Registration Project \n     and the Hispanic caucus, among other groups.\n       ``I don't know why the administration put up Estrada,'' \n     said Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter \n     Registration Project. ``He was marked as a right-wing \n     ideologue some time ago. Clearly, that is a tactic by the \n     Bush administration . . . not to really embrace issues that \n     are important to Latinos, but to try symbolic measures.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Hispanic lawmakers and leaders, including Representative \nXavier Becerra, Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, Representative \nGrace Napolitano, Representative Robert Menendez, Representative \nCharlie Gonzalez, and Los Angeles County supervisor Gloria Molina have \nall spoken publicly about their opposition to this nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent a recent news account of their statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Latino Politicians Split on Estrada\n\n\nPolitics: Groups applaud, pan Bush's nomination to second-highest court \n                                in U.S.\n\n                           (By Mike Sprague)\n\n       Los Angeles.--President Bush's nomination of Miguel Estrada \n     to the Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals is splitting this \n     area's Latino politicians.\n       On Friday, Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina and \n     U.S. Rep. Grace Napolitano, D-Santa Fe Springs, joined a news \n     conference held by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to \n     denounce Estrada and oppose his Senate confirmation to the \n     second-highest court in the United States.\n       ``When this gentlemen came before us, we asked specific \n     questions and he had very little offer,'' said Napolitano, \n     vice chairwoman of the 20-member caucus. ``He really was a \n     blank page. This could be our Latino Clarence Thomas.''\n       But Assemblyman Robert Pacheco, a Republican from the City \n     of Industry, who was reached by telephone later in the day \n     Friday, accused the caucus of taking a partisan stand.\n       ``They don't represent the entire Latino community,'' he \n     said. ``I'm very upset with the way they're approaching it, \n     because of the partisan nature.\n       ``What an opportunity for the Latino community to have \n     someone in that position who has earned his stripes, having \n     risen from poverty.''\n       The news conference was held at the Mexican-American Legal \n     Defense and Educational Fund's office in Los Angeles. The \n     organization also is opposing confirmation.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee recently approved the \n     nomination, but some Senate Democrats since then have \n     launched a filibuster to prevent a vote.\n       Estrada has served as assistant U.S. solicitor and an \n     assistant U.S. attorney.\n       Napolitano said that caucus members had interviewed \n     Estrada, and he hadn't responded favorably to their questions \n     on whether he had worked with any minority organizations or \n     on behalf of minorities and if he had been involved as a \n     volunteer.\n       Estrada said no to the questions, she said.\n       Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles, said that \n     Estrada shouldn't be confirmed to the court just because of \n     his ethnic origin.\n       ``We have worked very hard to ensure that Latinos are \n     nominated to high positions in the country,'' Roybal-Allard \n     said. ``Just because someone has a Hispanic surname doesn't \n     automatically qualify him for any position.''\n       Boyal-Allard also denied the caucus was acting for partisan \n     reasons.\n       ``Out of all the nominees, President Bush has appointed, \n     this is the first time we have been opposed,'' she said. \n     ``We're opposed to Miguel Estrada based on his lack of \n     qualifications.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Hispanic Lawmakers From California Oppose Bush's Court Nominee\n\n                            (By Paul Chavez)\n\n       Los Angeles.--Hispanic lawmakers from California stepped up \n     their campaign Friday against the first Hispanic to be \n     nominated for a spot on an important federal appellate court.\n       Three Democratic members of the Congressional Hispanic \n     Caucus and representatives from two advocacy groups said \n     lawyer Miguel Estrada, 41, has refused to answer key \n     questions about his position on cases, his background and \n     other key issues.\n       ``Ethnic origin is no automatic pass to becoming a judge on \n     the federal judiciary, you have to be qualified,'' said Rep. \n     Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles.\n       Estrada's nomination by President Bush has been held up in \n     the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, with Democrats launching \n     a filibuster to stall a full Senate vote until Estrada \n     answers more questions and provides documents from his work \n     with the Department of Justice.\n       Estrada was nominated in May 2001 by Bush for a seat on the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which has \n     been a steppingstone for three current justices on the U.S. \n     Supreme Court.\n       Estrada, a partner in the law firm that worked with Bush \n     during the Florida election recount, came to the United \n     States at age 17 from Honduras. He graduated from Harvard Law \n     School in 1986 and has argued 15 cases before the Supreme \n     Court.\n       Republicans have accused Democrats of treating Estrada \n     unfairly because he is a conservative Hispanic.\n       Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles, said the \n     decision to oppose Estrada's appointment was not easy.\n       ``This was a particularly difficult and disappointing \n     decision that had to be made given the fact that the Hispanic \n     caucus actively works long and hard to promote the \n     appointment of more Latino judges,'' she said.\n       The Hispanic caucus decided to oppose Estrada after \n     interviewing him, Roybal-Allard said.\n       ``Unfortunately, he did not satisfactorily answer any of \n     our questions with regard to his experience or sensitivity or \n     commitment to ensuring equal justice and opportunity for \n     Latinos,'' she said.\n       Rep. Grace Napolitano, D-Norwalk, said Estrada told the \n     caucus that he has not done any work on behalf of minority \n     organizations. She said such work was important since Estrada \n     ``could be our Latino Clarence Thomas.''\n       The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which is made up \n     exclusively of Democrats, along with the Mexican American \n     Legal Defense and Educational Fund have previously stated \n     their opposition to Estrada's appointment.\n       The California branch of the League of United Latin \n     American Citizens also said Friday it was opposed to his \n     nomination, although its national leadership has supported \n     Estrada. His nomination also has been supported by the U.S. \n     Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n       Democrats have sought documents written by Estrada when he \n     worked in the Justice Department's Solicitor General's \n     Office. But White House counsel Alberto Gonzales told \n     senators in a letter Wednesday that the administration would \n     not release the documents, which are normally not made \n     available.\n       All of the living former solicitors general--four Democrats \n     and three Republicans--have agreed with the White House \n     position, Gonzales said.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

I am sure they do so out of \nprinciple. I know they do not relish opposing this nomination. These \nare organizations, individuals who have devoted their lives to \nimproving the lives of Hispanic members. They worked for decades to \nincrease representation of Latinos on the courts of our country.\n  It is because of the history and dedicated efforts and deep-seated \ncommitment to the cause of equality for Hispanics I take their views \nseriously. I understand the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the \nPuerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund came to their conclusion \nafter a thorough review of the nomination but also after interviewing \nand meeting with the nominee.\n  Yesterday, we received a letter from 15 former presidents in the \nHispanic National Bar Association, 15 well-respected national leaders \nof this important bar association, leaders who date back to the \nfounding of the organization in 1972 have written to the Senate \nleadership to oppose this nomination. Their weighty opposition is based \non the criteria to evaluate judicial nominees this association has \nformally used since 1991. It has been their standard practice for the \npast 30 years.\n  In addition to the candidates' professional experience and \ntemperament, the criteria for endorsement also includes, ``one, the \nextent to which a candidate has been involved and supported and \nresponsive to the issues, needs, and concerns of Hispanic Americans; \nand, two, the candidates' demonstration of the concept of equal \nopportunity and equal justice under law.''\n  In the view of the overwhelming majority of the living past \npresidents of the HNBA, Mr. Estrada's record does not provide evidence \nhe meets those criteria. His candidacy falls short in those respects, \nthey say.\n  Now the Hispanic National Bar Association has been at the forefront \nof efforts to increase diversity on the Federal bench. They have been \nat the forefront of the effort to improve public confidence among \nHispanics and others in the fairness of the Federal courts. The most \nimportant thing in the Federal courts is the fairness, their integrity, \ntheir independence.\n  Time and time again I have asked, both when we have had nominees of \nDemocratic Presidents and Republican Presidents, is this nominee \nsomebody I believe I could walk into the court and be treated fairly? \nAs a Democrat or Republican, whether as plaintiff or defendant, whether \nrich or poor, white or person of color, no matter what my religion, no \nmatter what my background, would I be treated fairly?\n  During Democratic leadership of the Senate, we confirmed 100 of \nPresident Bush's nominees, and I voted for the overwhelming majority of \nthem. When I was chairman, I moved his nominees through far faster than \nRepublicans ever did for President Clinton when they were in charge, \nwhen they averaged only 39 confirmations per year during their six and \none-half years of control of the Senate. But I set the same test. \nSometimes to satisfy myself of the test I had to go to a hearing that \nlasted sometimes a day long to be sure. You have a conservative, I want \nto be sure they will be fair and not too much of an ideologue; the same \nway I did when I believed someone was too liberal and could be too much \nof an ideologue. I had to satisfy myself they would be fair.\n  Now, the HNBA has done the same. They want to make sure the Federal \ncourts are independent and fair. They have supported Republican \nnominees as well as Democratic nominees. These 15 individuals, all of \nwhom are past presidents of the Hispanic National Bar Association, \npeople who have devoted a great deal of time in their legal careers to \nadvancing the interests of Hispanics in the legal community, have felt \ncompelled to publicly oppose the Estrada nomination.\n  I regret very much that the White House, instead of seeking someone \nwho would unite the community, has brought in somebody who would divide \nthe community.\n  Yesterday, Delores Huerta, who cofounded the United Farm Workers with \nCaesar Chavez, wrote a column in the Oregonian opposing Mr. Estrada's \nconfirmation. I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                  [From the Oregonian, Feb. 24, 2003]\n\n     Dolores C. Huerta: Estrada Would Destroy Hard-Fought Victories\n\n                         (By Dolores C. Huerta)\n\n       As a co-founder of the United Farm Workers with Cesar \n     Chavez, I know what progress looks like. Injustice and the \n     fight against it take many forms--from boycotts and marches \n     to contract negotiations and legislation. Over the years, we \n     had to fight against brutal opponents, but the courts were \n     often there to back us up. Where we moved forward, America's \n     courts helped to establish important legal protections for \n     all farm workers, all women, all Americans, Now, though, a \n     dangerous shift in the courts could destroy the worker's \n     rights, women's rights, and civil rights that our collective \n     actions secured.\n       It is especially bitter for me that one of the most visible \n     agents of the strategy to erase our legal victories is being \n     called a great role model for Latinos. It is true that for \n     Latinos to realize America's promise of equality and justice \n     for all, we need to be represented in every sector of \n     business and every branch of government. But it is also true \n     that judges who would wipe out our hard-fought legal \n     victories--no matter where they were born or what color their \n     skin--are not role models for our children. And they are not \n     the kind of judges we want on the federal Courts.\n       Miguel Estrada is a successful lawyer, and he has powerful \n     friends who are trying to get him a lifetime job as a federal \n     judge. Many of them talk about him being a future Supreme \n     Court justice. Shouldn't we be proud of him?\n       I for one am not too proud of a man who is unconcerned \n     about the discrimination that many Latinos live with every \n     day. I am not especially proud of a man whose political \n     friends--the ones fighting hardest to put him on the court--\n     are also fighting to abolish affirmative action and to make \n     it harder if not impossible for federal courts to protect the \n     rights and safety of workers and women and anyone with little \n     power and only the hope of the courts to protect their legal \n     rights.\n       Just as we resist the injustice of racial profiling and the \n     assumption that we are lesser individuals because of where we \n     were born or the color of our skin, so too must we resist the \n     urge to endorse a man on the basis of his ethnic background. \n     Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus met with Miguel \n     Estrada and came away convinced that he would harm our \n     community as a federal judge. The Mexican American Legal \n     Defense and Educational Fund and the Puerto Rican Defense and \n     Education Fund reviewed his record and came to the same \n     conclusion.\n       Are these groups fighting Miguel Estrada because they are \n     somehow anti-Hispanic? Are they saying that only people with \n     certain political views are ``true'' Latinos? Of course not. \n     They are saying that as a judge this man would do damage to \n     the rights we have fought so hard to obtain, and that we \n     cannot ignore that fact just because he is Latino. I think \n     Cesar Chavez would be turning over in his grave if he knew \n     that a candidate like this would be celebrated for supposedly \n     representing the Hispanic community. He would also be \n     dismayed that any civil rights organization would stay silent \n     or back such a candidate.\n       To my friends who think this is all about politicians \n     fighting among themselves, I ask you to think what would have \n     happened over the last 40 years if the federal courts were \n     fighting against workers' rights and women's rights and civil \n     rights. And then think about how quickly that could become \n     the world we are living in.\n       As MALDEF wrote in a detailed analysis, Estrada's record \n     suggests that ``he would not recognize the due process rights \n     of Latinos,'' that he ``would not fairly review Latino \n     allegations of racial profiling by law enforcement,'' that he \n     ``would most likely always find that government affirmative \n     action programs fail to meet'' legal standards, and that he \n     ``could very well compromise the rights of Latino voters \n     under the Voting Rights Act.''\n       Miguel Estrada is only one of the people nominated by \n     President Bush who could destroy much of what we have built \n     if they become judges. The far right is fighting for them \n     just as it is fighting for Estrada. We must fight back \n     against Estrada and against all of them. If the only way to \n     stop this is a filibuster in the Senate, I say, Que viva la \n     filibuster!\n       Dolores C. Herta is the co-founder of the United Farm \n     Workers of America.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Here is what this Hispanic leader wrote:\n\n       It is true that for Latinos to realize America's promise of \n     equality and justice for all, we need to be represented in \n     every sector of business and every branch of government.

He would also be \n     dismayed that any civil rights organization would stay silent \n     or back such a candidate.\n\n  I deeply resent the charges leveled by Republicans that those \nopposing this nomination are anti-Latino or anti-Hispanic. As we began \nthis debate about 2 weeks ago, I urged Republicans who said such things \nto apologize for these baseless and divisive charges. They have yet to \ndo so. Because they have not apologized for these baseless charges, it \nprompted the League of Latin American Citizens, an organization that \nhas supported this nomination, to write to the Senate to protest the \ncharges leveled without basis by Republicans. I emphasize the League of \nUnited Latin American Citizens, which supports Mr. Estrada's \nnomination, has written to the Senate to protest the charges of bias \nleveled without basis by some Republicans.\n  Hector Flares, the LULAC National President wrote on February 12:\n\n       [W]e are alarmed by suggestions from some of the backers of \n     Mr. Estrada that the Senate Democrats and the members of the \n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus are opposing his nomination \n     because of his race, ethnicity or an anti-Hispanic bias. We \n     do not subscribe to this view at all and we do not wish to be \n     associated with such accusations.\n       LULAC has had a long and productive working relationship \n     with many Senate Democrats and all of the members of the \n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus and our experience is that they \n     would never oppose any nominee because of his or her race or \n     ethnicity. On the contrary, it is most often the Democratic \n     members of the Senate who support LULAC's priority issues. . \n     . .\n\n  I thank LULAC for disassociating itself with the base political \nefforts of Republicans to accuse those who oppose this nomination as \ndoing so based on race or ethnicity. On the contrary, it is most often \nthe Democratic Members of the Senate who support Hispanic priority \nissues.\n\n  I thank LULAC for disassociating itself with the base political \nefforts of some Republicans who accuse those who oppose this nomination \nof doing so based on race or ethnicity. I renew my request for an \napology for all the statements made in connection with the Senate \ndebate that suggest those opposed to this nomination are anti-Hispanic.\n  I think perhaps we should go back to a different time, a time when I \nfirst came to the Senate, when Republicans and Democrats assumed the \nbest motives of patriotism and honesty on the part of each other; when \nyou did not hear attacks made on people saying they are anti this race \nor that race or anti this religion or that religion. I am concerned.\n  I will speak only for myself, not for other Senators, but I look back \nat 29 years in the Senate, a record of one who I think has always stood \nfor antidiscrimination, one who has a record where I have never \nquestioned the race, ethnicity, or religion of anybody else. When I \nhear charges that opposition to a candidate, in this case opposition to \na candidate that has divided the American people, is done on the basis \nof that person's race, I find that more than distasteful, I find it \nwrong. In the same way, I found wrong the attacks on my religion by \nsome in the Republican Party because of opposition to 1 of this \nPresident's more than 100 nominees, especially since I made it very \nclear in my statements on this floor that I never once considered \nreligion or the background of any nominee for anything--nominees from \neither Republican or Democratic administrations. Not in any of the \nthousands upon thousands of nominees of both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents that I voted for have I ever once considered their religious \nbackground. So I find it distasteful when my religion is attacked by \nmembers of the Republican caucus, and I find it distasteful when \nmembers of that caucus attack Democrats on the claim that their \nprincipled opposition to this nomination is anti-Hispanic. I think the \nlargest Hispanic organization supporting Mr. Estrada made it very clear \nthey resent it, too. I join with them on that.\n  We know Mr. Estrada's short legal career has been successful. By all \naccounts he is a good appellate lawyer and legal advocate. He has had a \nseries of prestigious positions and is professionally and financially \nsuccessful. In my case, as the grandson of immigrants, as a son, a \nfather and grandfather, I know no matter the country of origin or \neconomic background that a family takes pride in the success of its \nchildren. Mr. Estrada's family has much to be proud of in his \naccomplishments, no matter what happens to this nomination.\n  He is now 41 years old. He has a successful legal career in a \nprominent corporate law firm, which was the firm of President Reagan's \nfirst Attorney General, William French Smith, and that of President \nBush's current Solicitor General, Ted Olson. I am told that Mr. Olson, \nalong with Kenneth Starr, have been among Mr. Estrada's conservative \nmentors. At his relatively young age, Mr. Estrada has become a partner \nin the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, having previously worked \nwith the Wall Street law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.\n  While in private practice, his clients included major investment \nbanks and health care providers. Mr. Estrada's financial statement, \nwhich Senator Hatch had printed in the Congressional Record, says he \nearned more than $\\1/2\\ million a year 2 years ago.\n  At his hearing, Mr. Estrada testified:\n\n       I have never known what it is to be poor, and I am very \n     thankful to my parents for that. And I have never known what \n     it is to be incredibly rich either, or even very rich, or \n     rich.\n\n  I will let his financial statement speak for itself on that point. \nHalf a million dollars a year in my State does put you in the upper \nbrackets.\n  So he is a well-compensated lawyer in a first-rate law firm. His \nfamily and friends take pride in his success, and rightfully so.\n  In his almost 6 years with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, with its thriving \nappellate court practice, developed by its senior partner, Ted Olson, \nwho was confirmed to be Solicitor General in June 2001, Mr. Estrada has \nhad one argument before the Supreme Court--just one. That was in \nconnection with a habeas petition on which he worked pro bono when he \nfirst came to the firm. It is one of the only pro bono cases he has \ntaken in his entire legal career, according to his testimony.\n  I am about to yield the floor. I note one thing, some of the speeches \non the other side of the aisle make you think everyone opposes the \nefforts of Democrats to get answers to fair questions and review \ndocuments provided in past nominations. Especially in the case where a \nsupervisor has called into question a nominee's ability to be fair, \nthat is all the more reason we should see what he did. There is also \nample precedent for the Senate Judiciary Committee examining memos \nwritten by Department of Justice attorneys, including Assistant \nSolicitor Generals--like Mr. Estrada was--in connection with \nnominations to either lifetime or short-term appointments, such as in \nthe nominations of Robert Bork, William Rehnquist, Brad Reynolds, \nStephen Trott, and Benjamin Civiletti.\n  There have been a number of papers and published editorials and op-\neds supporting our efforts to know more about Mr. Estrada before we \ngive him a lifetime seat, before we could never question him again, \nbefore we put him, for a lifetime, on one of the most powerful courts \nof the country.\n  On February 4, Senator Hatch said, and I will paraphrase: Mr. Estrada \nis not nominated to the Supreme Court--of course he is right--but his \nnomination may be even more important because the Supreme Court hears \nonly about 90 cases per year while the DC Circuit issues nearly 1,500 \ndecisions per year. These decisions affect the rights of working people \nand the environmental rights of all people. The Senate must not be a \nrubberstamp.\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some of the \neditorials in favor of the position the Democrats have taken here. Just \nto name a few, we have editorials from the New York Times, the Boston \nGlobe, and the Rutland Daily Herald, among others, as well as op-ed \nfrom the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, and letters to the \neditor of the Washington Post, disagreeing with their earlier \neditorial--touted by Republicans this morning--urging an immediate vote \nin spite of the precedent for requesting documents and getting answers \nto questions before giving someone such an important job.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 13, 2003]\n\n                   Keep Talking About Miguel Estrada\n\n       The Bush administration is missing the point in the Senate \n     battle over Miguel Estrada, its controversial nominee to the \n     powerful D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Democrats who have \n     vowed to filibuster the nomination are not engaging in \n     ``shameful politics,'' as the president has put it, nor are \n     they anti-Latino, as Republicans have cynically charged. They \n     are insisting that the White House respect the Senate's role \n     in confirming judicial nominees.\n       The Bush administration has shown no interest in working \n     with Senate Democrats to select nominees who could be \n     approved by consensus, and has dug in its heels on its most \n     controversial choices. At their confirmation hearings, \n     judicial nominees have refused to answer questions about \n     their views on legal issues. And Senate Republicans have \n     rushed through the procedures on controversial nominees.\n       Mr. Estrada embodies the White House's scorn for the \n     Senate's role. Dubbed the ``stealth candidate,'' he arrived \n     with an extremely conservative reputation but almost no paper \n     trail. He refused to answer questions, and although he had \n     written many memorandums as a lawyer in the Justice \n     Department, the White House refused to release them.\n       The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, insists that the \n     Senate be given the information it needs to evaluate Mr. \n     Estrada. He says there cannot be a vote until senators are \n     given access to Mr. Estrada's memorandums and until they get \n     answers to their questions. The White House can call this \n     politics or obstruction. But in fact it is senators doing \n     their jobs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 15, 2003]\n\n                             Rush to Judges\n\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee ought to come with a warning \n     sign: Watch out for fast-moving judicial nominees. Controlled \n     by Republicans, the committee is approving President Bush's \n     federal court nominees at speeds that defy common sense.\n       One example is Miguel Estrada, nominated to the US Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia. Nominated in May 2001, \n     Estrada had been on a slow track, his conservative views \n     attracting concern and criticism.\n       Some Republicans called Democrats anti-Hispanic for \n     challenging Estrada. He came to the United States from \n     Honduras at the age of 17, improved his English, earned a \n     college degree from Columbia, a law degree from Harvard, and \n     served as a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n       What has raised red flags is Estrada's refusal to answer \n     committee members' questions about his legal views or to \n     provide documents showing his legal work. This prompted the \n     Senate minority leader, Thomas Daschle, to conclude that \n     Estrada either ``knows nothing or he feels he needs to hide \n     something.''\n       Nonetheless, Estrada's nomination won partisan committee \n     approval last month. All 10 Republicans voted for him; all \n     nine Democrats voted against. On Tuesday Senate Democrats \n     began to filibuster Estrada's nomination, a dramatic move to \n     block a full Senate vote that could trigger waves of \n     political vendettas.\n       It's crucial to evaluate candidates based on their merits \n     and the needs of the country.\n       Given that the electorate was divided in 2000, it's clear \n     that the country is a politically centrist place that should \n     have mainstream judges, especially since many of these \n     nominees could affect the next several decades of legal life \n     in the United States.\n       Further, this is a nation that believes in protecting \n     workers' rights, especially in the aftermath of Enron. It's \n     an America that struggles with the moral arguments over \n     abortion but largely accepts a woman's right to make a \n     private choice. It's an America that believes in civil rights \n     and its power to put a Colin Powell on the international \n     stage.\n       Does Estrada meet these criteria? He isn't providing enough \n     information to be sure. And the records of some other \n     nominees fail to meet these standards.\n       Debating the merits of these nominees is also crucial \n     because some, like Estrada, could become nominees for the \n     Supreme Court.\n       The choir--Democrats, civil rights groups, labor groups, \n     and women's groups--is already singing about how modern-day \n     America should have modern-day judges. It's time for moderate \n     Republicans and voters to join in so that the president can't \n     ignore democracy's 21st-century judicial needs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 20, 2003]\n\n                    Symmetry in Judicial Nominations\n\n       The White House has a message for Democratic senators tying \n     up its judicial nominations: we won the election, you're \n     thwarting the people's will.\n       Not quite. Never mind it was an evenly divided electorate. \n     The selection of judges was a non-issue. George W. Bush \n     didn't even mention the topic in his speech at the GOP's \n     Philadelphia convention or in his acceptance remarks when he \n     finally emerged victorious--thanks to judges--after Florida.\n       In two of the three debates, judicial selections weren't \n     mentioned. In the other, candidate Bush, while ducking the \n     question of whether all his judicial appointments would be \n     anti-abortion, insisted he wouldn't have any litmus tests. \n     But he declared that, unlike Vice President Gore, he would \n     not appoint judicial activists; judges, he declared, ``ought \n     not take the place'' of Congress. As the president accuses \n     Democrats of playing politics, however, he nominates almost \n     nothing but pro-life judges and passionate activists of a \n     conservative stripe.\n       For all the emotions judicial appointments arouse on both \n     sides, the political implications for senators are wildly \n     exaggerated. Over the past several decades the only one who \n     lost an election because of a judicial vote was Illinois \n     Democrat Alan Dixon, defeated in a primary after he voted to \n     confirm Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court. What these \n     battles are about is energizing the base; that's why during \n     presidential campaigns they are retail, not wholesale, \n     issues.\n       Currently, Senate Democrats are staging a mini-filibuster \n     over the nomination of movement conservative Miguel Estrada \n     for the U.S. Court of Appeals to the dismay of not only \n     Republicans but many editorial writers. How dare they employ \n     politics! In these matters there should be a simple test: \n     symmetry. Or, as former Clinton Solicitor General Walter \n     Dellinger declares, ``Whatever factor a President may \n     properly consider, senators should also consider.'' Since \n     ideology clearly is the guiding force behind the slate of \n     Bush circuit court nominees, it's perfectly appropriate for \n     Senate Democrats to sue the same standard.\n       That's certainly the criterion Republicans used in the \n     Clinton years. Orrin Hatch is outraged at Democrats' \n     insistence that nominee Miguel Estrada, who refuses to \n     express an opinion on any Supreme Court decision, be more \n     forthcoming. Yet it was only a few years ago that the same \n     Utah Republican was insisting on the need ``to review . . .  \n     nominees with great specificity.''\n       In 1996 Sen. Hatch decried two Clinton, judicial nominees \n     as ``activists who would legislate from the bench.'' Later, \n     the then Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott, left no doubt \n     that it was ideology that prompted his objections to the \n     ``judicial philosophies and likely activism'' of prospective \n     judges.\n       Judicial activism used to be a term reserved for liberals. \n     Now much activism on the bench comes from the right, often, \n     in the words candidate Bush used to attack liberals, in the \n     form of judges who ``subvert'' the legislature. In recent \n     years, congressional measures such as the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, legislation to oppose violence against \n     women and to increase gun control have been gutted by \n     conservative judges.\n       As Indiana law professor and former Clinton Justice \n     Department official Dawn Johnson chronicled in a Washington \n     Monthly piece last year, the right-wing Federalist Society-\n     agenda envisions an activist judiciary that would roll back \n     many of the guarantees enacted by Congress under the Commerce \n     Clause and the 14th Amendment.\n       A contemporary example is Jeffrey Sutton, a brainy legal \n     scholar nominated for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     Mr. Sutton clearly is qualified but just as clearly would \n     turn back the clock on protecting people with disabilities. \n     Should senators who care about disability rights simply \n     ignore his ideology?\n       The right claims that central to the Democrats' opposition \n     to these nominees is abortion. And it's true that, more than \n     any other issue, abortion remains a litmus test for both \n     sides. Almost all the Bush circuit-court nominees have been \n     pro-life and a high percentage of the Clinton appointments \n     were pro-choice. But, as Mr. Sutton's selection shows, the \n     issues are much broader than the disproportionate influence \n     placed on abortion.\n       In the Estrada fight, some Republicans also allege an anti-\n     Hispanic motive. Opposition to his nominees sends ``the wrong \n     message to Hispanic communities,'' charges Georgia Sen. Saxby \n     Chambliss. For the record, Mr. Bush has nominated one \n     Hispanic judge to the circuit courts; President Clinton \n     nominated 11. Three of the Clinton nominations were killed by \n     Senate Republicans. Were they racially motivated? That makes \n     as much sense as the Estrada charges.\n       To be sure, the Democrats play the same games, though the \n     Clinton nominees, as a whole, were nowhere near as \n     ideological as the Bush picks. But there is some overreach; \n     the Democrats' efforts to get Mr. Estrada's private notes \n     when he worked in the solicitor general's office would set a \n     bad precedent.\n       Thoughtful people on both sides of the aisle worry about \n     these perpetual battles. Mr. Dellinger, for one, notes that \n     if the focus\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\n     is only on ``noncontroversial,'' selections, the result \n     chiefly would be courts full of ``relatively undistinguished \n     lawyers lacking any substantial record of creative \n     scholarship or advocacy.'' Instead, he proposes a more \n     constructive solution. Opposition leaders in the Senate would \n     develop a short list of distinguished scholars and \n     practitioners for the president to submit for the courts of \n     appeal. There is a precedent: President Bush last year \n     renominated Clinton nominee, Roger Gregory, the first African \n     American on the Fourth Circuit, in to win acceptance for his \n     other nominees.\n       Currently, Mr. Dellinger says if Senate Democrats proposed \n     a ``distinguished'' nominee like former Solicitor General \n     Seth Waxman for the U.S. Circuit Court, a deal could be \n     crafted whereby he and Bush nominees Mr. Estrada and John \n     Roberts are promptly confirmed. Republicans still would hold \n     the upper hand, but the rightward rush would be modified.\n       It makes a lot of sense and would result in a better \n     judiciary. But the activists on both sides have little \n     interest; it wouldn't energize their bases.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Feb. 24, 2003]\n\n                            Partisan Warfare\n\n       Senate Democrats are expected to continue their filibuster \n     this week against the appointment of Miguel Estrada, a 41-\n     year-old lawyer whom President Bush has named to the federal \n     appeals court in Washington, D.C.\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary \n     Committee, is in the middle of the fight over the Estrada \n     appointment. He and his fellow Democrats should hold firm \n     against the Estrada nomination.\n       Much is at stake in the Estrada case, most importantly the \n     question of whether the Democrats have the resolve to resist \n     the efforts of the Bush administration to pack the judiciary \n     with extreme conservative judges.\n       The problem with the Estrada nomination is that Estrada has \n     no record as a judge, and senators on the Judiciary Committee \n     do not believe he has been sufficiently forthcoming about his \n     views. It is their duty to advise and consent on judicial \n     nominees, and Estrada has given them no basis for deciding \n     whether to consent.\n       President Bush has called the Democrats' opposition to \n     Estrada disgraceful, and his fellow Republicans have made the \n     ludicrous charge that, in opposing Estrada, the Democrats are \n     anti-Hispanic. For a party on record against affirmative \n     action, the Republicans are guilty of cynical racial politics \n     for nominating Estrada in the first place. He has little to \n     qualify him for the position except that he is Hispanic.\n       Unless the Democrats are willing to stand firm against \n     Bush's most extreme nominations, Bush will have the \n     opportunity to push the judiciary far to the right of the \n     American people. Leahy, for one, has often urged Bush to send \n     to the Senate moderate nominees around whom Democrats and \n     Republicans could form a consensus. In a nation and a \n     Congress that is evenly divided politically, moderation makes \n     sense.\n       But Bush's Justice Department is driven by conservative \n     idealogues who see no reason for compromise. That being the \n     case, the Senate Democrats have no choice but to hold the \n     line against the most extreme nominees.\n       Leahy has drawn much heat for opposing Bush's nominees. But \n     he has opposed only three. In his tenure as chairman of the \n     committee, he sped through to confirmation far more nominees \n     than his Republican predecessor had done. But for the Senate \n     merely to rubber stamp the nominees sent their way by the \n     White House would be for the Senate to surrender its \n     constitutional role as a check on the excesses of the \n     executive.\n       The Republicans are accusing the Democrats of partisan \n     politics. Of course, the Republicans are expert at the game, \n     refusing even to consider numerous nominees sent to the \n     Senate by President Clinton.\n       The impasse over Estrada is partisan politics of an \n     important kind. The Republicans must not be allowed to shame \n     the Democrats into acquiescence. For the Democrats to give in \n     would be for them to surrender to the fierce partisanship of \n     the Republicans.\n       The wars over judicial nominees are likely to continue as \n     long as Bush, with the help of Attorney General John \n     Ashcroft, believes it is important to fill the judiciary with \n     extreme right-wing judges.\n       The Democrats, of course, would like nothing better than to \n     approve the nomination of a Hispanic judge. But unless the \n     nominee is qualified, doing so would be a form of racial \n     pandering. That is the game in which the Republicans are \n     engaged, and the Democrats must not allow it to succeed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to my distinguished \ncolleague. I noted that he mentioned the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation's past presidents' statement. I have seldom read a \nstatement that is so absolutely bankrupt as this statement. I have \nseldom read anything that has disgusted me as much as these past \npresidents of this Hispanic Bar Association in this letter. I have \nnever seen less backing for a letter than what these people have signed \noff on.\n  First, let me note for the record that the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation supports Mr. Estrada's nomination. So these people have \ngone way off the reservation. They may have been past presidents, but \nthey should never be allowed to be a president of this bar association \nagain. They ought to throw them out of the bar association because they \nentered into politicization of this nominee, in contradiction to what \ntheir own bar association has done in endorsing him. The bar \nassociation speaks for its many members, not these 15 former \npresidents. We know why they have done this, because they are 15 \npartisans. It is disgraceful.\n  Let me read part of this letter--``Based upon our review and \nunderstanding. . . .''\n  What kind of review? They talked to their friends on the Democratic \nside? Is that where they got this stuff? Most of which is absolutely \nfalse and distorted:\n\n       Based upon our review and understanding of the totality of \n     Mr. Estrada's record and life's experiences, we believe that \n     there are more than enough reasons to conclude that Mr. \n     Estrada's candidacy falls short in these respects.\n\n  Listen to this:\n\n       We believe for many reasons including his virtually \n     nonexistent written record. . . .\n\n  Could I make a little point here that I think needs to be made? These \nare the appellate briefs in the 15 Supreme Court cases. There has not \nbeen a nominee before this Senate in recent years who has been able to \nhave that type of illustration of what they do.\n  These inane people who have entered into partisan politics have \ndisparaged a man who is 10 times better than they are. It is \nunbelievable the lengths and the depths to which they will stoop to \nbetray one of their own fellow Hispanic people.\n  I hope the rest of the members of the Hispanic Bar Association will \nrise up and let them know how for off the mark they are.\n  Listen to this:\n\n       We believe that for many reasons including: his virtually \n     nonexistent written record, his . . . judicial and academic \n     teaching experience--\n\n  This is the written stuff that they can't match--very few of them--or \neven come close to matching. I don't think any of them can. The reason \nI don't think so is because not many people in this world have that \ntype of a record--a written, open record that anybody can read and \nfind. There are not many attorneys living today who have argued 15 \ncases before the U.S. Supreme Court and have the record of winning 10 \nof them.\n  They say he doesn't have any academic teaching experience. You mean \nyou can't be a judge?\n  Let us put it this way. Since there have been many academics who have \ngone on the Federal bench in circuit courts of appeals, the Supreme \nCourt, and district courts, do you mean the Hispanics can't go on the \nbench unless they have academic and teaching records?\n  That is what this seems to say by 15 former presidents of the \nHispanic Bar Association which has endorsed him. They have gone against \ntheir own organization. It is hard to believe.\n  Then they said:\n\n       We believe that for many reasons including: his virtually \n     nonexistent written record.\n\n  Look at that record. He has verbally expressed an unrebutted extreme \nview?\n  I haven't heard an extreme view throughout this whole process, and we \nhave a transcript that thick of questions by our friends on the other \nside, and ourselves really. Extreme views? I haven't heard any extreme \nviews. I don't think anybody has made a case that he has extreme views.\n  Then the letter says, ``his lack of judicial or academic teaching \nexperience--\n  OK. What they are saying--these Hispanic Bar Association presidents--\nis that hardly any Hispanics will ever qualify for the circuit court of \nappeals or even the district court because they haven't had any \njudicial experience or teaching experience. They are condemning their \nown people. What a ridiculous, dumb statement. I don't swear. But I'll \nbe darned. I am having a tough time not swearing here.\n  Then it says in parentheses:\n\n     (against which his fairness, reasoning skills and judicial \n     philosophy could be properly tested)\n\n  What about the five of the eight on the current court who haven't any \njudicial experience? And I don't know\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nmany of them who have had any teaching experience. You can go through \ndozens of Clinton appointees who never had any either.\n  Why the double standard for Miguel Estrada? Why? I am having a rough \ntime answering that question.\n  There are some answers which I hope aren't true. But I am starting to \nthink they are true.\n  It says:\n\n     . . . his poor judicial temperament.\n\n  Since he has never been a judge, how do they know what his judicial \ntemperament is? The fact is that none of them--I don't believe any of \nthem--even know Miguel Estrada. And if they do, they know he has a \ndecent temperament.\n\n  Do you know where they get that? They get that from some of our \nfriends on the other side who believe that Paul Bender, who we have \ndiscredited, I believe, fairly and honestly, who gave him the highest \npossible ratings when Miguel was his junior, when he was Miguel's \nsupervisor in the Solicitor General's Office, and then off the cuff \nsays he doesn't have a judicial temperament, in essence.\n  Who are you going to believe? The things that he put in writing at \nthe time when they were really important and when they really made a \ndifference or the off-the-cuff remarks that a partisan Democrat \nliberal--about as liberal as you can get--would say to try to scuttle a \nnomination? These guys buy it--lock, stock, and barrel. What kind of \nlawyers are they? Then they say:\n\n     . . . his total lack of any connection whatsoever to, or lack \n     of demonstrated interest in the Hispanic community.\n\n  How do they know that? They are prejudging this man without knowing \nall the people he has met with and worked with and for whom he has been \nan example. Every Hispanic young person can look up to Miguel Estrada \nbecause he is the embodiment of the American dream.\n  My gosh. This is the most biased, uninformed, stupid, dumb letter I \nhave ever read, and it is done for purely partisan purposes against a \nfellow Hispanic. I can't believe it. I couldn't believe it when I saw \nthis.\n  Then it says:\n\n     . . . his refusals to answer even the most basic questions \n     about civil rights and constitutional law.\n\n  Give me a break. He spent as much if not more time than almost any \nnominee we have had over the last 27 years to the circuit court of \nappeals. We simply did not treat people as this man is being treated by \nsome on the other side--not everybody. What do they know about his \nknowledge of civil rights and constitutional law? I happen to believe \nMiguel Estrada will be one of the champions for civil rights, and he is \ncertainly one of the tough lawyers with regard to constitutional law--\nsomething I doubt very many of these past presidents had much \nexperience in. Maybe they do. I would like to hear from them if they \ndo. But I am disgusted with them. If they do, that makes it even worse \nbecause they have misjudged him if they have the experience in these \nareas--and I doubt that they do.\n  Then they say:\n\n     . . . his less than candid responses to other straightforward \n     questions of Senate judiciary members.\n\n  Where did they get that? I bet none of them have read this \ntranscript. I doubt that many of them saw the hearings. Where would \nthey get that? It certainly wasn't from this side, I guarantee you, \nbecause we saw him answer the questions. He just didn't answer them the \nway our colleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted him to answer \nthem. They couldn't lay a glove on him. That is why this is a phony \nrequest for confidential and privileged materials from the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office--the attorney for our country and for the people in \nthis country.\n  Let me tell you that when I practiced law, my files were \nconfidential, too. There is no way I would have given them to anybody. \nThere is no court in the land that would force me to give them to \nanyone. They are privileged; that is, since I am an attorney. Can you \nimagine the privilege the Solicitor General's Office can assert--and \nthey have.\n\n  Like I said, seven former Solicitors General--four of whom were \nDemocrats--have said this is ridiculous. Yet it keeps coming up. It is \na red herring. It is a double standard. It is a standard applied to \nMiguel Estrada that has never in history been applied to anybody else.\n  The letter request was to give up his recommendations on appeals, \ncertiorari matters and amicus curiae matters.\n  Then it says:\n\n     . . . and because of the administration's refusal to provide \n     the Judiciary Committee the additional information and \n     cooperation it needs to address these concerns.\n\n  Give me a break. He has made himself available. Any Democrat who \nwants to talk to him he will talk to. A number of them refused to even \ntalk to him. Why is that?\n  So they are trying to do justice here? Why is that so? Why is this \nHispanic independent thinker being treated this way? I suggest that it \nis because he is Hispanic and he is an independent thinker. He doesn't \njust toe the line.\n  I am disgusted. Some of these people I know. They should have done \nbetter by their fellow Hispanics. They should have thought twice before \nputting their names on this piece of garbage called a letter by past \npresidents. It is a disgrace to the Hispanic community. It is a \ndisgrace to the Hispanic National Bar Association and the rest of the \nmembership that is behind Miguel Estrada. And it is a disgrace to them \npersonally to do this type of disgraceful thing in a miserably partisan \nway.\n  I don't want to spend any more time on it. It doesn't deserve it. I \ndidn't mean to be so aggravated, but these types of things just \naggravate me to death.\n  I fought very hard for Clinton's nominees. The other side knows it. I \nwas very fair to their nominees. They know it. Was everyone fair to \nthem? Not everybody, but I was. I expect fairness to be given to our \nnominee and to their President's nominees.\n  Finally, I didn't agree with President Clinton's nominees' ideology \nin probably none of the cases--none of the nominees. But that wasn't \nthe issue. The issue was whether they were qualified. And there has \nvery seldom been a person as qualified as Miguel Estrada. All you have \nto do is point to the ABA's unanimous well-qualified rating, the \nhighest rating they could possibly give. They are tough.\n  Now, having said that, I am really disappointed in my colleagues on \nthe other side because they have tried to say the standing committee of \nthe American Bar Association was prejudiced and stacked in coming up \nwith this rating. They do not have a good argument to make, so they \nmake a phony argument.\n  I want to respond to statements by one of my Democratic colleagues \nyesterday, suggesting that Mr. Estrada's ABA rating was somehow rigged. \nI hate to say it, but this is stooping low, too, to make that kind of a \nstatement.\n  Before I address these statements head on, I think it is first \nappropriate to lay the predicate, to lay the significance of Mr. \nEstrada's ABA rating.\n  Let me just look at this chart. This chart is entitled ``Senate \nDemocrats Praise the ABA.''\n\n       [The] ABA evaluation has been the gold standard by which \n     judicial candidates have been judged.\n\n  That was Senator Patrick Leahy in March 2001.\n\n       What ABA is simply telling us, and has historically, is \n     whether or not a prospective judge is competent.\n\n  That was Senator Tom Daschle on March 22, 2001.\n\n       [I] fear . . . that the Judiciary Committee will be less \n     able than the ABA to discern a nominee's legal \n     qualifications.\n\n  That was Senator Dianne Feinstein on March 31, 2001, the \ndistinguished Senator from California. She is right.\n\n       The ABA, with its extensive contacts in the legal community \n     all across the country, is the best organization to evaluate \n     the integrity, professional competence and judicial \n     temperament of potential nominees.\n\n  That was Senator Russell Feingold in July 2001.\n\n       [T]he ABA . . . has always been impartial. . . . [The ABA \n     is] hardly partisan or ideological. . . . The ABA is the \n     national organization of all lawyers: Democrats, Republicans, \n     liberals, conservatives.\n\n  That was Senator Charles Schumer on May 9, 2001.\n  We have had our problems with the ABA when there were, it seemed to \nme, prejudicial decisions from time to time made. And I have had some \nreal problems with them. But I have to say,\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\nthey certainly have cleaned up their act, and I said this before the \nend of the Clinton administration, even though I have not been happy \nwith any one single organization having a vetting responsibility, which \nis what some of my colleagues always wanted the ABA to have.\n  Now, let's consider Miguel Estrada. The ABA rated him ``well \nqualified'' unanimously--that is the highest possible score--at around \nthe time my Democratic colleagues heaped praise on the ABA. But now, 2 \nyears later, some of my friends across the aisle apparently want to \nadopt a new rule: ABA ratings are the gold standard--unless we don't \nlike the nominee.\n  It is against this backdrop that one of my Democratic colleagues, the \ndistinguished minority whip, now asserts that respected Washington \nlawyer Fred Fielding somehow tricked the ABA into rating Miguel Estrada \nunanimously well qualified.\n  Now, I have great respect and loving friendship for my friend from \nNevada. Everybody knows that. I care for him deeply. But I could hardly \nbelieve my ears when I heard that one. I think it is important to set \nthe record straight, and so here are the facts. I have to presume my \ncolleague just did not know the facts and, therefore, went off on this \ntangent, and I hope he will withdraw that statement once he hears what \nthe facts are.\n\n  Mr. Fielding was a member of the ABA standing committee that rates \njudicial nominees when Miguel Estrada was unanimously rated well \nqualified. Mr. Fielding left the ABA committee in November 2001. He did \nnot become affiliated with Boyden Gray's Committee for Justice until \nAugust 2002. In fact, the Committee for Justice was not even founded \nuntil August 2002. There is no way the Committee for Justice could have \ninfluenced Mr. Fielding's duties at the ABA because the Committee for \nJustice did not even exist at the time.\n  From 1996 to 2002, when he was on the ABA committee, Fred Fielding \nconsistently evaluated nominees fairly and with an open mind. He voted \nto rate many of President Clinton's circuit court nominees ``well \nqualified,'' including the following:\n  Allan Snyder, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals; Robert Katzmann, the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals; Marjorie Rendell, the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals; Maryanne Barry, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; \nRobert Cindrich, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; Stephen Orlofsky, \nthe Third Circuit Court of Appeals; Andrew Davis, the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals; Alston Johnson, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals; \nRonald Gilman, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals; Kathleen McCree \nLewis, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals; Ann Claire Williams, the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals; Susan Graber, the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals; James Duffy, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals; Richard \nTallman, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals; Raymond Fisher, the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals; Stanley Marcus, the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals; Frank Hull, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals--all of \nthose rated by Mr. Fielding as unanimously well qualified.\n  You can hardly say this man was as was described yesterday; in fact, \nnot at all. Anybody who knows Fred Fielding knows he is an honest man. \nIt is offensive to have that type of characterization made, even in the \nheight of a very political battle, which this appears to be--well, to \nbe. I could have said 2 weeks ago: to be coming.\n  Now, as that list illustrates, Mr. Fielding voted to give numerous \nClinton circuit nominees the highest rating possible. If he had been \npromoting a partisan agenda, he would not have voted to find a single \nClinton nominee well qualified, or he certainly would have found a \nnumber of those, perhaps, not well qualified--even though they deserved \nthe qualification they got--if he was partisan.\n  There is simply no reason to believe his vote to find Miguel Estrada \nwell qualified reflected anything other than his unbiased, nonpartisan \nassessment of Mr. Estrada's fitness for the Federal bench.\n  Moreover, there is simply no way Mr. Fielding alone could have been \nresponsible for the ABA's unanimous decision to rate Miguel Estrada \n``well qualified.'' The ABA's rules make clear that every member of the \nratings committee must evaluate each nominee independently:\n\n       After careful consideration of the formal report and its \n     enclosures, each member submits his or her rating vote to the \n     Chair.\n\n  Now, that is an insult to the other members of the standing committee \nfor somebody to imply they would all pay attention to a ``corrupt'' Mr. \nFielding, if that were even possible, which, of course, it is not.\n\n  Mr. Fielding's background as a Republican was more than offset by the \ncommitted Democrats who served on the ABA committee at the time and who \njoined in the unanimous decision to give Miguel Estrada a well-\nqualified rating.\n  For example, according to public records, the chairman of the ABA \ncommittee at the time Mr. Estrada was rated well qualified contributed \nto the election campaign of Senator Schumer. This individual agreed \nthat Miguel Estrada is ``well qualified,'' the highest rating possible.\n  Now, I am not going to accuse the chairman of the ABA committee at \nthe time, because he donated to Senator Schumer's campaign--which he \nhad every right to do--I am not going to accuse him of being improper, \nas I believe the implication was for Mr. Fielding.\n  Get this point. The ABA's Second Circuit representative contributed \nto Senator Robert Torricelli's reelection campaign and to the New \nJersey Democratic State Committee. This individual agreed that Miguel \nEstrada should be given the highest rating: ``well qualified,'' \nunanimously, the highest rating.\n  I am not going to say that person was biased because that person gave \nto Senator Torricelli. It is apparent he was not biased.\n  How about the ABA's Fourth Circuit representative? He made political \ncontributions to Senator Charles Schumer, Senator Tom Daschle, Senator \nJean Carnahan, former Vice President Al Gore, Representative Jerrold \nNadler, Representative Martin Frost, Representative Anthony Weiner, \nRepresentative Ellen Tauscher, and Representative Charles Rangel. This \nindividual agreed that Miguel Estrada is ``well qualified.'' I do not \nthink these people would be influenced by some Republican saying: Well, \nwe ought to pull a fast one here and get this fellow well qualified \nwhen he was not worthy of being well qualified.\n  There is no question that Fred Fielding is a Republican. There is no \nquestion that he supports Republicans politically. But there is also no \nquestion he is a person of impeccable honor and integrity who has \nserved as White House Counsel and that he would do what is right on \nthis committee, just like these Democrats did what was right in rating \nMiguel Estrada as well qualified.\n  How about this: The ABA's Sixth Circuit representative--this is on \nthe standing committee--contributed to the Democratic National \nCommittee, Senator Frank Lautenberg, Senator Charles Schumer, former \nSenator Bill Bradley, Senator Edward Kennedy, Representative Richard \nGephardt, and the Arizona State Democratic Central Executive Committee. \nNow, this individual agreed that Miguel Estrada is ``well qualified,'' \nthe highest rating the standing committee could give. He could not be a \nmore partisan Democrat, but I believe he is doing the job fairly on the \ncommittee.\n  The fact that he supports Democrats, I wish he didn't as much as a \nRepublican, but the fact that he supports Democrats I find no problem \nwith.\n  How about this one: The ABA's Seventh Circuit representative \ncontributed to Emily's List, the feminist political organization; \nVoters for Choice, one of the pro-abortion organizations; Senator Patty \nMurray; former Representative Geraldine Ferraro, former Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun; Senator Mary Landrieu; Senator Jean Carnahan; Senator \nBarbara Mikulski, and Senator Dick Durbin. Yet he voted ``well \nqualified.'' So Fielding is out of line? Come on. That is phony.\n  How about the ABA's Eighth Circuit representative. He contributed to \nSenator Joseph Biden, Senator Hillary Clinton, Senator Paul Wellstone, \nSenator Jean Carnahan, and former Vice President Al Gore. This \nindividual agreed that Miguel Estrada is ``well qualified.'' I don't \nthink he had any\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\nbias in that. I don't think Fred Fielding had all that influence with \nall these big-time Democrats. I really don't. I don't think anybody in \ntheir right mind does.\n  How about the ABA's Eleventh Circuit representative. He contributed \nto Senator Max Cleland. This individual agreed that Miguel Estrada is \n``well qualified.'' Did he have a bias? Do you think he was influenced \nby Fred Fielding?\n  How about the ABA's Federal circuit representative who contributed to \nEmily's List, the pro-feminist list; Senator Chuck Robb; the Democratic \nNational Committee. This individual agreed that Miguel Estrada is \n``well qualified.'' That is just the beginning of the story.\n  At the start of the 108th Congress, the ABA then reaffirmed Mr. \nEstrada's unanimous well-qualified rating. It appears that the \nDemocrats on this year's ABA committee are equally enthusiastic about \nMiguel Estrada's nomination.\n  The ABA's DC Circuit representative--Fred Fielding's successor--\ncontributed to the Democratic National Committee and Emily's List. This \nindividual agreed that Miguel Estrada is ``well qualified.''\n  The ABA's Federal circuit representative contributed to Senator \nHillary Clinton, the Irish American Democrats, Representative Nancy \nPelosi, the Democratic National Committee, Senator John Breaux, former \nVice President Al Gore, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign \nCommittee. This individual agreed that Miguel Estrada is ``well \nqualified.''\n  I wonder why all these Democrats on the ABA's standing committee find \nhim well qualified while our friends on the floor are filibustering \nthis well-qualified individual? I don't understand it. It seems to me \nto be a double standard.\n  The ABA's Fourth Circuit representative contributed to Senator John \nEdwards in the North Carolina Democratic Victory Fund and Bill Bradley. \nThis individual agreed that Miguel Estrada is ``well qualified.''\n  The ABA's Eighth Circuit representative contributed to the Missouri \nDemocratic State Committee and Senator Jean Carnahan. This individual \nagreed that Miguel Estrada is ``well qualified.'' There are a lot of \nDemocrat leaders who contributed to a lot of Democrats running for \noffice who all found Miguel Estrada well qualified, unanimously well \nqualified.\n  What is clear from this recitation of political contributions is that \nin Mr. Estrada's case, the attorneys on the ABA committee put aside \ntheir political views and provided the Senate with a neutral and \ndispassionate analysis of his qualifications.\n  Fred Fielding, of course, did not hijack the ABA process, nor was Mr. \nFielding's participation in that process ``unethical,'' as my \nDemocratic colleagues suggested.\n  It is time to get rid of these phony arguments. In the case of Miguel \nEstrada, the process worked just as the ABA intended. It took a lot of \nvery partisan Democrats acting in a nonpartisan way fulfilling their \nduties on the ABA standing committee to find him well qualified, not \njust when Mr. Fielding was on the committee but also the second time in \nthis Congress.\n  That is pretty important stuff. I have to respond to Senator Leahy's \nremarks that Miguel Estrada handled only one pro bono case. That is not \naccurate. I am sure my colleague must have overlooked the case of \nCampaneria v. Reid. Miguel Estrada represented pro bono, without fee, a \ncriminal defendant seeking to vacate his conviction on grounds that the \nadmission of his confession at trial violated the Miranda rule. The two \njudges on the Second Circuit panel hearing the case agreed with Miguel \nEstrada that his client's right to remain silent had been violated but \nultimately ruled that the error was harmless. One judge dissented, \narguing that the admission of Mr. Campaneria's confession was not \nharmless. Miguel Estrada spent countless pro bono hours on that case \nwhich further illustrates his commitment to equal access to justice for \nall.\n  Since Senator Leahy brought up Mr. Estrada's pro bono work, let me \nremind him of Mr. Estrada's work in Strickler v. Green. This is an \nimportant case as well. It is important to bring it up in light of what \nhas been said. Miguel Estrada represented, free of charge, Tommy David \nStrickler, who was convicted of abducting a college student from a \nshopping center and murdering her. Miguel Estrada devoted hundreds of \nhours to Mr. Strickler's appeal without being paid. Ultimately, the \nSupreme Court held that although a Brady violation had occurred when \nthe prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense, the \nerror was harmless. Mr. Strickler was accordingly executed, but it does \nnot negate the fact that Miguel Estrada gave that kind of service free.\n  It was a legitimate question, too. The court did not rule for Miguel \nEstrada in the case, but he did do what he has been accused of not \ndoing, and that is giving pro bono service for a person in need.\n  I would like to read a portion of a letter the committee received \nfrom Mr. Estrada's cocounsel in the case, Barbara Hartung:\n\n       [Miguel Estrada] values highly the just and proper \n     application of the law. . . . Miguel's respect for the \n     Constitution and the law may explain why he took on Mr. \n     Strickler's case, which at the bottom concerned the \n     fundamental fairness of a capital trial and death sentence. I \n     should note that Miguel and I have widely divergent political \n     views and disagree strongly on important issues. However, I \n     am confident that Miguel Estrada will be a distinguished, \n     fair and honest member of the federal appellate bench.\n\n  Why do we have these arguments that are not right? Why are we doing \nthat to this man? Why is it that this Hispanic man who is an \nindependent thinker and who has an amazing record for a person of his \nage, who has the qualifications to be on the Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia, why are we doing this to him? Why the \ndouble standard? Nobody else has been treated this shabbily, especially \nby these past presidents of the Hispanic Bar Association. Keep in mind \nthat Hispanic National Bar Association supports Miguel Estrada. \nYet these people gratuitously signed this ridiculous letter. I hope \nthey feel ashamed of themselves. They ought to be.\n\n  The Hispanic community ought to tell them to be ashamed of \nthemselves. I believe they will. I think that is going on right now. \nThe Hispanic people are starting to catch on on this and what is going \non. It just plain isn't fair. It just plain isn't right. It just plain \nis not a good thing to do to filibuster a Federal judicial nominee. It \njust isn't. We have always had some who wanted to do it, but we on this \nside have always been able to stop them. This is the first true \nfilibuster that we have had on a Federal judicial nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know there are others who wish to speak, \nbut I wanted to take a minute to talk about my friend's comments about \nMr. Fielding.\n  I think that while my name was mentioned--and I have the greatest \nrespect for my friend from Utah. We are close personal friends. Our \nfamilies are friends. We have been in each other's homes. There is \nnothing personal about this. This is a partisan matter we are bringing \nbefore the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the political contributions that people make is \ncertainly very different from being an inside political operative, as \nMr. Fielding was. In fact, for lack of a better way to describe him, he \nwas an inside guy for the Republicans and had been for many years. I \nwill list in a minute the many things he had done.\n  Mr. President, the more I hear about the ABA, the more convinced I am \nthe Republicans were right when they said let us not have the ABA \ninvolved in this. I think those people who said that were absolutely \nright. I didn't know as much about the ABA as I do now. I practiced law \nfor a long time before I came here. I was a trial attorney. I didn't \nbelong to the ABA. I thought it was a bad organization then, and the \nmore I hear about it today, the worse I think it is. I think what they \nhave done on these judicial nominations--Democratic and Republican--\nreeks, smells. There are thousands of lawyers in the country, thousands \nof members of the ABA. Couldn't they get people who are selecting \nnominees who could pass the smell test? In this one, this ABA \nqualification should be thrown right in the trash.\n  Mr. President, it is not the Senator from Nevada who feels Mr. \nFielding\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\nwas wrong in what he did. Here is an article out of a newspaper dated \nyesterday, by Tom Brune. The headline is ``Estrada Endorser Had \nPartisan Role.'' It goes on to say--this is a news article, not an \neditorial:\n\n       The lawyer who recommended the American Bar Association's \n     highest rating for controversial appellate judge candidate \n     Miguel Estrada took part in partisan Republican activities \n     during his term as a nonpartisan judicial evaluator for the \n     Bar, according to records and interviews.\n\n  The man who wrote this column said what I quoted. He says:\n\n       While serving on the ABA's nonpartisan Standing Committee \n     on the Federal Judiciary, veteran Washington lawyer Fred F. \n     Fielding also worked for Bush-Cheney Transition Team, \n     accepted an appointment from the Bush administration and \n     helped found a group to promote and run ads supporting Bush \n     judicial nominees, including Estrada.\n\n  An editorial comment here, Mr. President. That is only part of his \npolitical involvement. Let me read part of it. There are other things.\n\n       Fielding cofounded the Committee for Justice, with Bush \n     confidante and former White House counsel C. Boyden Gray. \n     They founded this organization to help the White House with \n     the public relations end of its effort to pack the bench and \n     to run ads against Democrats. . . .\n\n  In addition, Fielding has a long career as a Republican insider. He \nserved as Deputy Counsel to President Richard Nixon. He then served on \nthe Reagan-Bush campaign in 1980, the Thursday Night Group. He served \non the Lawyers for Reagan advisory group, the Bush-Reagan transition, \n1980-1981. He served--this is a dandy--he was conflict of interest \ncounsel. That is a laugher. He worked with the Office of Government \nEthics, which is also a joke. He served on the White House transition \nteam. He served in the Office of Counsel to the President, as deputy \ncounsel to President Reagan. He served on the Bush-Quayle campaign in \n1988; as Republican National Convention legal advisor; as campaign \ncounsel to Senator Quayle; and as deputy director of the Bush-Quayle \ntransition team. He served on the Bush-Quayle campaign, 1992, as the \nsenior legal advisor conflict of interest counsel and the Republican \nNational Committee advisor. He served as the legal advisor to the Dole-\nKemp campaign, 1996.\n  Mr. President, in short, the Bush White House could not have \nhandpicked somebody with better partisan credentials than Fielding to \nevaluate his DC Circuit Court nominees.\n\n  The ABA should be ashamed of themselves. Lawyers are trying to have a \nreputation that is good and does not have conflicts of interest, that \nis ethical. This thing reeks.\n  Estrada graduated with honors from Harvard. You cannot take that away \nfrom him. He is a fine lawyer, but this ABA thing, take it away because \nit means nothing. How can one have confidence that Mr. Fielding did not \npaint a very rosy picture for partisan reasons.\n  The article by Mr. Brune goes on to say:\n\n       Fielding evaluated Estrada in the month after President \n     George W. Bush nominated him on May 9, 2001, ABA officials \n     said. That was just weeks after Fielding vetted executive \n     appointments for Bush's transition team and a year before he \n     helped start the partisan Committee for Justice, records \n     show.\n       Contrary to what was said a few minutes ago, Fielding did \n     cofound this group while a member of the ABA evaluation \n     committee.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       The overlap has thrust Fielding--and his evaluation . . .--\n     into the heated political battle over Estrada's nomination. . \n     . .\n       . . . On February 12, Senator Harry Reid charged that \n     Fielding had a conflict.\n\n  I said at that time, and there is a quote in the newspaper:\n\n       Doesn't Mr. Fielding's dual role--purportedly \n     ``independent'' evaluator and partisan foot soldier--violate \n     ABA rules?\n\n  As the investigative reporter notes:\n\n       Those rules say no Standing Committee member should \n     participate in an evaluation if it would give rise to the \n     appearance of impropriety or would otherwise be incompatible \n     with the committee's purpose of a fair and nonpartisan \n     process.\n\n  It goes on to say, ``Former ABA President Robert Hirshon said he was \nconcerned when in late July 2002 he read reports that Fielding had \njoined Republican C. Boyden Gray to start the Committee for Justice.''\n\n       ``That raised some concerns in my mind,'' said Hirshon, \n     ``given the fact that our committee has been tarred by both \n     conservatives and liberals as poster boys for the other side. \n     . . .''\n       He called Roscoe Trimmier, Jr., then the Standing Committee \n     chair, and asked him to talk with Fielding. ``I don't see how \n     you can do both,'' Hirshon said. If Fielding became involved \n     in Gray's group, he couldn't serve as an ABA evaluator again, \n     he said.\n       . . . Fielding is still listed as a board member of the \n     Committee for Justice.\n       ``I don't see the conflict,'' Gray said--\n\n  I bet he didn't. He helped form the Committee for Justice.\n  He added that\n\n       Fielding didn't vet Estrada while on the transition team \n     and left the ABA post soon after the group formed.\n       But Nan Aron, executive director of the liberal Alliance \n     for Justice, which opposes Estrada, charges that Fielding is \n     too partisan to do a fair evaluation.\n\n  The article notes:\n\n       Fielding was President Ronald Reagan's White House \n     counsel--\n\n  And some of the things I have already put into the Record.\n  Listen to this fact uncovered by the reporter:\n\n       In May, Bush appointed Fielding to an international center \n     that settles trade disputes.\n\n  He gets $2,000 a day plus expenses for this.\n  The article also notes that:\n\n     last fall, President Bush thanked Fielding publicly during a \n     rally for his judicial nominees.\n\n  I bet he did.\n  The article also notes that Burbank, a Professor of ethics at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania says Fielding's activities raise questions \nof appearances, which would cause more damage to the ABA. Ironically, \nBush removed the ABA from his long-held role prescreening judicial \nnominees because of the evaluators' perceived liberal bias.\n\n       \"In light of the controversy concerning the proper role of \n     the ABA Standing Committee,'' Burbank said, ``it seems to me \n     to be a shame to structure the process in such a way that \n     reasonable people might be concerned.''\n\n  Mr. President, let me simply say that the evaluation by Fred Fielding \nis a scam, it is unfair, it is not right. There certainly is an \nappearance of unfairness and partisanship. If you want to debate Miguel \nEstrada based on this ABA qualification, I will do that all day long. \nThere are many positive things Estrada has. This is not one of them. \nThis was an evaluation done by a very partisan person, who has only \nrecommended well qualified ratings for Bush nominees in D.C.\n  I repeat what I said a few minutes ago. The more I learn about the \nABA, the less I feel inclined to support the ABA for anything they \nwant. In this situation, if I ever have anything to do with it in the \nfuture, the ABA should be eliminated. It would be one less process we \nwould have to go through to get people on this floor. The ABA's ``gold \nstandard'', as far as I am concerned, is tarnished, and rightfully so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am disappointed. I just read over all of \nthe Democrats on the Standing Committee who have contributed to \nDemocratic Party politics. I have never accused any of these people. \nAlong with these are these judges on this chart. What does that mean? \nThat he wasn't right when he found unanimously well qualified all of \nthe Clinton judges, or nominees?--that is not right--when he voted for \nMiguel, along with all of these Democrats I have listed who have \ncontributed?\n  All I can say is I think we have answered the points. I agree no \noutside body should be a voting instruction. I have always felt that. \nBut I have to say the ABA has been part of the process, whether we like \nit or not, for a long time. There were plenty of Democrats who voted \nfor Miguel Estrada as well qualified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n\n\n                     Dealing With Economic Problems\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was home in South Dakota over the last \nweek, and I had the opportunity to talk with farmers and ranchers, \nbusinesspeople, educators, and government leaders. What I bring back \nfrom those many discussions is the strong belief that if there is \nanything we do in the Senate over the course of the next several weeks, \nit ought to be addressing the economic problems that our country is \nfacing.\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\n  I wish I had an accurate count of the number of times in various ways \nbusiness men and women and farmers and ranchers asked the question: So \nwhy are you spending all of this time on a judge when our country is in \nsuch economic disarray?\n  This is an important issue, the Estrada nomination, but we have said \nfrom the beginning, and I think we will be able to continue to say with \nauthority, that there will not be any resolution until the Solicitor \nGeneral documents are released and until Mr. Estrada is more \nforthcoming with regard to his positions.\n  We can take up time on the Senate floor week after week, or we can \nput it aside, make some decision with regard to whether or not there \nwill be some reconciliation on that issue and answer the question posed \nby so many South Dakotans to me last week: When will we address the \neconomy? When will we recognize that there is a lot more productive use \nof the Senate's time than an unending debate about Miguel Estrada?\n  They do not understand why we are stymied and why we are unresponsive \nto the growing concern they have about the direction the economy is \ntaking.\n  There is a growing credibility gap between what the President and the \nadministration says and what they do, between their rhetoric and their \nreality. The President has taken occasion to go around the country to \ntalk about his concern for the economy. On several occasions over the \nlast couple of weeks, he has made his speeches about his concern for \nthe economy and his approach through his tax cuts. I have to say, if he \ncared, if he was concerned, he would ask the Senate to take up this \nmatter immediately. It will not be a day too soon.\n  A report was released this morning that said consumer confidence is \nnow at a 10-year low. Consumer confidence, as registered and reported \nthrough its index, has plummeted to 64 from a revised 78 just last \nmonth. That is the lowest rating since 1993, 10 years. Unemployment is \nrising. We have seen an increase in the number of unemployed by 40 \npercent. We now have 8.3 million Americans out of work and 2.5 million \nprivate sector jobs have been lost just in the last 2 years. The \nunemployment spells are lengthening, wage growth is now stagnant, and \nthe shortage of jobs has slowed wage growth so that only those at the \nvery top are still experiencing wage increases that outpace inflation. \nWe now have the worst job creation record in 58 years, while State \nbudgets continue to be plagued with deficits of close to $70 billion. \nSome have reported even more than that.\n  We have an economic crisis that is not being addressed, and while \nthat economic crisis grows, there is another concern expressed to me \nlast week by scores of South Dakotans who are our first responders. Our \nfire departments, our police departments, those involved in crisis \nmanagement all tell me they haven't a clue as to what they would be \nrequired to do should some emergency come about. There is no \ncoordination. There is absolutely no training.\n  When I asked them last week, What would you suggest I go back and \ntell the President and my colleagues, they said: Understand that unless \nwe have training, unless we have communications equipment, unless we \nhave more of a coordinated effort to bring us into the infrastructure \nrequired for response, we will not be able to live up to the \nexpectations of the people right here. Help us.\n\n  We have attempted to help those first responders over and over: last \nDecember, with $2.5 billion that the President said we could not \nafford; last month with $5 billion that the President, once again, said \nwe could not afford. You tell those first responders that we cannot \nafford providing them the resources to do their job when we look at \nwhat has happened in just the last 48 hours in our basing arrangements \nwith Turkey. According to press reports, we can afford up to $6 billion \nin grants and $20 billion in loan guarantees for Turkey, but for some \nreason we cannot afford providing homeland and hometown assistance--\ndirect, coordinated help--to provide the training and communication and \ncoordination required. That is a credibility gap that I think this \nPresident needs to address.\n  I hope we can set aside this issue of Mr. Estrada and deal with the \nissue about which our people, regardless of geography, are concerned. \nThe President has a plan, Democrats have proposed a plan, and there is \na significant difference between the two. There, too, we find a \ncredibility gap.\n  An article was written in the New York Times that appeared this \nmorning by David Rosenbaum entitled ``The President's Tax Cut and Its \nUnspoken Numbers.'' I ask unanimous consent that this article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 25, 2003]\n\n            The President's Tax Cut and Its Unspoken Numbers\n\n                        (By David E. Rosenbaum)\n\n       Washington, Feb. 24.--The statistics that President Bush \n     and his allies use to promote his tax-cut plan are accurate, \n     but many of them present only part of the picture.\n       For instance, in a speech in Georgia last week, the \n     president asserted that under his proposal, 92 million \n     Americans would receive an average tax reduction of $1,083 \n     and that the economy would improve so much that 1.4 million \n     new jobs would be created by the end of 2004.\n       No one disputes the size of the average tax reduction, and \n     the jobs figure is based on the estimate of a prominent \n     private economic forecasting firm.\n       But this is what the president did not say: Half of all \n     income-tax payers would have their taxes cut by less than \n     $100; 78 percent would get reductions of less than $1,000. \n     And the firm that the White House relied on to predict the \n     initial job growth also forecast that the plan could hurt the \n     economy over the long run.\n       The average tax cut (the total amount of revenue lost \n     divided by the total number of tax returns) is over $1,000 \n     because a few rich taxpayers would get such large reductions. \n     For households with incomes over $200,000, the average cut \n     would be $12,496, and the average for those with incomes over \n     $1 million would be $90,222.\n       But the cut for those with incomes of $40,000 to $50,000, \n     according to calculations by the Brookings Institution and \n     the Urban Institute, would typically be $380. For those with \n     incomes of $50,000 to $75,000, it would be $553.\n       The president's jobs figure was based on a preliminary \n     analysis by Macroeconomic Advisers, of St. Louis. The firm, \n     to whose services the White House subscribes, issued \n     projections in January concluding that by raising \n     disposable income, bolstering stock values and reducing \n     the cost of capital, the president's program would lead to \n     1.365 million new jobs by the end of next year.\n       But the White House has never mentioned the caution in the \n     second paragraph of the firm's report. The forecasters \n     predicted that if the tax cuts were not offset within a few \n     years by reductions in government spending, interest rates \n     would rise, private investment would be crowed out, and the \n     economy would actually be worse than if there had been no tax \n     changes.\n       The president has not proposed spending reductions that \n     would offset the tax cuts. To the contrary, the \n     administration has argued that the budget deficits resulting \n     from the cuts would be too small to harm the economy.\n       Another argument that administration officials make \n     regularly is that under the president's plan, the wealthy \n     would bear a larger share of the nation's tax burden than \n     they do now. A table released last month by the Treasury's \n     office of tax analysis showed that people with incomes over \n     $100,000 would see their share of all income taxes rise to \n     73.3 percent from the current 72.4 percent.\n       At the same time, the table showed, taxpayers with incomes \n     of $30,000 to $40,000 would get a 20.1 percent reduction in \n     income taxes, and those earning $40,000 to $50,000 would get \n     a 14.1 percent cut.\n       The problem with figures like those is that a large \n     percentage of a small amount of money may be less important \n     to a low- middle-income family's lifestyle than a small \n     percentage of a large amount of money would be to a rich \n     family. For example, a $50 tax cut would be a 50 percent \n     reduction for a household that owed only $100 in taxes to \n     start with, but that small amount of money would not \n     significantly improve the family's well-being.\n       A better measure may be the increase in after-tax income, \n     or take-home pay, that would result from tax cuts. According \n     to data from the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation, \n     the tax reduction of $380 for a family with an income of \n     $45,000 would amount to less than 1 percent of the \n     household's after-tax income. But the $12,496 tax cut \n     received by a family with an income of $525,000 would mean a \n     3 percent increase in money left after taxes.\n       The president and his advisers also offer a variety of \n     incomplete statistics to bolster their proposal to eliminate \n     the taxes on most stock dividends.\n       Among the points they make are that more than half of all \n     taxable dividends are paid to people 65 and older, that their \n     average saving from eliminating the tax on dividends would be \n     $936, that 60 percent of people receiving dividends have \n     incomes of $75,000 or less and that up to 60 percent of \n     corporate profits are lost to income taxes paid by either \n     the companies or the stockholders.\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\n       All that is true, but here is a more complete picture:\n       Only slightly more than one-quarter of Americans 65 and \n     older receive dividends. Two-thirds of the dividends the \n     elderly receive are paid to the 9 percent of all elderly who \n     have incomes over $100,000.\n       Tht Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution and the \n     Urban Institute calculated that the average tax cut from the \n     dividend exclusion would be $29 for those with incomes of \n     $30,000 to $40,000 and $51 for taxpayers with incomes of \n     $40,000 to $50,000.\n       On the other hand, the two-tenths of 1 percent of tax \n     filers with incomes over $1 million (who have 13 percent of \n     all income) receive 21 percent of all dividends, and the Tax \n     Policy Center figured that their average tax reduction from \n     the dividend exclusion would be $27,701. For taxpayers with \n     incomes of $200,000 to $500,000, the typical tax cut from the \n     exclusion was calculated at $1,766.\n       In instances where both the corporation and the shareholder \n     are paying taxes at the maximum rate, it is possible, as the \n     administration maintains, for 60 percent of the profits to be \n     taxed away. But calculations based on I.R.S. data and \n     performed by Robert S. McIntyre of the nonpartisan Citizens \n     for Tax Justice show that on average, only 19 percent of \n     corporate profits are paid in taxes by companies and \n     shareholders combined.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the President talks about his plan \nproviding 92 million Americans with an average tax reduction of $1,083, \nand yet with closer scrutiny and attention, with a more careful review \nof the facts, we find that is not the case at all. That is like Bill \nGates and Tom Daschle averaging their income. If he and I averaged our \nincome, mine would be somewhere around $39 billion. I only wish I had \n$39 billion to average with Bill Gates, but I do not. But that is the \nmethod this President is using to provide these average numbers with \nregard to the beneficiaries of his tax cut.\n  Here are the facts: 78 percent of Americans are going to get less \nthan $1,000, and over half of all taxpayers will get less than $100 \nunder the President's plan. That is right, less than $100. That is all \nmore than half of all taxpayers will receive under the President's \nplan. That is fact. That is a credibility gap. That is saying one thing \nand doing another. That is saying the average American gets $1,000 but \nactually, in fact, the average American is going to get under $100.\n  There is a credibility gap across the board. He said his plan will \ncreate 1.4 million jobs by the end of 2004.\n  According to the same report President Bush cites by macroeconomic \nadvisers of St. Louis, his tax cuts actually have the potential to harm \nthe economy in the long run, but the President did not mention any \nreferences to those parts of the report stated later on.\n  The President has said eliminating the double taxation of dividends \nis good for enhancing the lifestyle of millions of Americans all across \nthe country. The reality is that only 22 percent of those with incomes \nunder $100,000 reported any dividend income in the year 2000. The \naverage tax cut from the dividend exclusion would be $29 for those with \nincomes below $40,000.\n  There is a lot to discuss. There is a great need in this country to \ndo what the American people are hoping we will do, and that is take up \nissues they are concerned about, to address the issues they will rise \nand fall on over the course of the next several months.\n  I cannot tell my colleagues the emotion I feel in the room oftentimes \nas I talk to businessmen whose lips would quiver, whose eyes would \nmoisten, who would tell me: Tom, I do not know if I can be in business \na year or two from now if things do not change. I have not sold a piece \nof farm equipment in 2 years. I have seen my sales plummet more than 20 \npercent in the last 3 months. I have no confidence about how we are \ngoing to turn this around, they tell me, unless you in Washington \nunderstand that things have to be done to make this economy better.\n  What do we do? We come back to Washington and we are back in the same \nold trap, talking about the same old thing. That will not change until \nMr. Estrada is more forthcoming. So we can spend time on the economy or \nwe can spend time talking about issues that have no relevance to the \ndaily lives of the people of South Dakota and the people all across \nthis country.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the minority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I truly appreciate the focus on issues that matter \ndirectly to the people who live in our States and who live across the \ncountry.\n  The Senator spoke about the individual business person who had not \nsold any farm equipment. We are closing the last two autoplants in New \nJersey over the next 2 or 3 years. They have already cut down to one \nshift. Bell Labs, one of the great research institutions of America, \nhas literally been a part of the reduction of 130,000 jobs at Lucent, a \nlot of them in New Jersey. A lot of the Bell Labs people are doing \nbasic core research, and the people are very upset.\n  That is what that consumer confidence number is. It is incredible in \nthe history of real measurements of what is going on in the minds of \nAmerican consumers. By the way, it is going on in business, too.\n  I ask the minority leader whether he saw yesterday's survey from \nManpower, Inc. They said only 20 percent of businesses in America think \nthey will add any jobs in the next 6 months, an indication of the kind \nof depth of concern that actually exists in the business community in \nconjunction with consumer confidence.\n  I applaud the minority leader for making sure we are being focused to \nhave a debate about something that matters to people's lives, and I \nhope we can bring forth a real debate about a stimulus program to get \nour economy going, put people back to work because that is where real \nconcerns seem to be. I presume that is the kind of question the Senator \nis receiving in South Dakota.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate very much the comments of the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey because I think among us all no one knows these \neconomic issues better than he does.\n  Again, I would say to the distinguished Senator, this is part of that \ncredibility gap I was referring to. The President professes to be \nconcerned, the President talks about his proposals to address the \neconomy, and yet we are not planning to take up any economic stimulus \nfor months, I am told. It may be May before it comes to the Senate. How \ncan anybody with any truthfulness express concern about the economy and \nsay, no, but we will just do it later? We will not do it this week, we \nwill not even do it this month, we will do it sometime down the road \nbut, yes, I am concerned.\n  When they look at consumer confidence, when they look at the numbers \nof jobs lost, when they see those plants close, when they see the \nconsumer confidence drop as precipitously as it has, how in the world \ncan anybody in the world confess to be supportive of economic recovery \nand economic stimulus with numbers like that and the inaction we see \nfrom the White House?\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the minority leader will yield for one other \nobservation and question, has the Senator noticed the fact that we have \nlost almost another trillion dollars in market value? And by the way, \nthat translates into 401(k)s and IRAs for individuals. Those are some \nvery serious numbers, actually since this program with regard to \ndividend disclosure has been announced. There is a credibility gap \nbetween the reality of what is being suggested as an economic growth \nprogram and what is actually occurring out in the real world. Certainly \nmy constituents and the people I hear from around the country and in \nthe business community are saying much of the same thing. I presume \nthat is what the Senator is hearing as well from the folks in South \nDakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I say to the Senator from New Jersey, that is exactly \nwhat I am hearing from the people of our State. As I have traveled \naround the country, I hear it in other parts of the country as well. \nThis is a very serious issue that will not go away, and I think the \nmore we face the uncertainty of war, the more we face the uncertainty \nof international circumstances, the more this domestic economic \nquestion is going to be exacerbated.\n  People want more certainty. They want more confidence. They want to \nat least believe we understand how serious it is out there and we are \ngoing to do something to address it. And what do we do? We come back \nafter a week's break and not one word about the economy from the other \nside, not one word about the recognition of how serious this problem \nis. We are still talking about the Estrada nomination.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 414\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to legislative \nsession\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\nand begin the consideration of Calendar No. 21, S. 414, a bill to \nprovide an economic stimulus package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I believe I still have the floor \nprivilege.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrat leader still has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from South Dakota yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the minority leader for coming to the floor, and \nI hope those who are following the debate understand what just \nhappened. The minority leader of the Senate has asked this Senate to \nmove to the issue of the state of America's economy, that we take up \nimmediately the question of what we can do to save businesses, create \njobs, and I think foster some hope in America.\n  There was an objection immediately from the Republican side of the \naisle. They do not want to discuss this issue.\n  I ask the minority leader the following: Since he has been home--and \nI have been in communication with the people of my State of Illinois--\nis it not a fact now that we have reached a point where our economy is \ndissembling, our foreign policy is in disarray, and this Congress is \ntotally disingenuous, it ignores the reality of the challenges facing \nAmerica today? I also ask the minority leader if he would tell me what \nhe believes we should be debating at this point in time to do something \nabout turning this economy around and bringing hope back to America.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his observation \nand his question. If we go home--and I know the Senator from Illinois \nwas just home as well--there are two issues on the minds of virtually \nevery American right now. I was asked questions everywhere I went \npertaining to the Senator's first question, and that, of course, is \nwhat is going to happen in Iraq? We generally have an idea of what may \nevolve over the course of the next few weeks, and there is not much \nthat South Dakotans can do about that.\n  The second question is, What is going to happen to my economic \ncircumstance?\n  I talked to one businessman who had to lay off a couple of his \nemployees, and it hurt him dearly. They had worked for him for a long \nperiod of time. He said: Tom, I have no choice.\n  I talked to people who had their health insurance dropped, in part \nbecause business was so bad their employer could no longer sustain the \ncost incurred of paying their health insurance. They said: We \nunderstand, but at least we got to keep our job.\n\n  But what are you going to do about it? That is the question. What are \nwe going to do about it? What will the majority do about it? What \nmessage are we going to send to those people to whom we must show some \nempathy if, indeed, these conversations with our constituents mean \nanything at all? That is why it is imperative we are cognizant of the \nmessage we send today, tomorrow, the next day, and the next day.\n  As this economy worsens, we spend our Senate time totally consumed \nwith one nomination having to do with a circuit court nominee for the \nDistrict of Columbia. This is the third week we have been on it. We can \nresolve this matter if Mr. Estrada will come forth with the \ninformation. But if he will not, let's move to something else until he \ndoes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have followed this debate on a daily basis. If I am not \nmistaken, the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, came to the floor with a \npositive and constructive suggestion. He said that this nominee, Miguel \nEstrada, should produce the written documents from his experience \nworking for the Department of Justice, working for the Supreme Court. \nIn fact, he even suggested at one point they be produced so they can be \nreviewed carefully by both the Republican and Democratic leaders of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and then a determination be made as to \nwhether there should be followup hearings or questions and ultimately a \nvote so there would be disclosure. This suggestion did not come from a \nDemocratic Senator; it came from a Republican Senator, Mr. Bennett of \nUtah.\n  I thought it was a fair suggestion to break the logjam, to resolve \nthis nomination up or down, and to move on to the people's business.\n  Can the Senator from South Dakota, our minority leader, tell me \nwhether that suggestion of producing those documents really is \nconsistent with what we are trying to achieve so we can once and for \nall give Mr. Estrada his fair hearing and final determination? Is that \nwhat this is about?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is exactly what this is about. I thank the Senator \nfor asking the question. It is no more complicated than that.\n  On a bipartisan basis, Republican and Democrat Senators have said we \nneed the best information that can be provided by any nominee before we \nare called upon to fulfill our constitutional obligation. That is what \nwe are suggesting. We need that information to make the best judgment. \nThat information is being withheld.\n  If I had an applicant for a job in my office and I said, I want you \nto fill out this application and I will be happy to consider your \nqualifications for employment in my office, and he or she said, I don't \nthink I will fill out the second and third page, I will give you the \nfront page, I will give you the name, address, and maybe my employment \nhistory, but that is it, you have to make a guess as to the rest of my \nqualifications because I am not telling you, I would say to that \nprospective employee, come back when you can fill out the full \napplication. That is what I would say. That is what every employer in \nthis country would say.\n  Remarkably, when I went home last week and explained the issue to my \nconstituents, they said: That sounds fair. That sounds reasonable. If \nan applicant for a lifetime position on the second highest court of the \nland is not willing to fill out his job application, how in the world \nshould we consider that nominee as a bona fide applicant for the \nposition in the first place? That, again, is a diversion from what I \nthink most people are concerned about. They are concerned about this, \nand they want fairness, but they are a whole lot more concerned about \nwhether they will be giving job applications to anyone in their State \nin their circumstances because they are doing the opposite.\n\n  We do not have lifetime applications for jobs in South Dakota because \nthe economy is very soft. If anything, we are losing jobs in South \nDakota. So while we talk about 1 job for the circuit court, we have \nlost 2.5 million jobs in the last 2 years in this economy. That does \nnot make sense. That is what the American people want us to address.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a last question, many \npeople on the other side suggested we are picking on Miguel Estrada, we \nhave focused on this man, a Hispanic nominee, and this is somewhat \npersonal in terms of what we are trying to achieve.\n  I ask the Senator minority leader, is it not our constitutional \nresponsibility to establish a standard and process to apply to all \njudicial nominees so that there is full disclosure from them as to who \nthey are, what they believe, their values, so if they are given a \nlifetime appointment on the court, we at least know, going in, who \nthese people might be. Is it not also the fact, as the Senator from \nSouth Dakota has told us, that Miguel Estrada has consistently refused \nto do just that, consistently refused to answer the questions, \nconsistently refused to disclose the documents, consistently refused to \ntell us who he is as he seeks one of the highest Federal judicial \nappointments in the land?\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota, is this an issue which goes \nbeyond Miguel Estrada and calls into question the constitutional \nresponsibility of the Senate when it comes to judicial nominees? We \nhave approved 103 Federal judges for this Republican President, and I \nhave voted for the overwhelming majority of them. Are we not in this \ndiscussion trying to raise the fundamental issue of equity and process \nas to the responsibility of the Senate under the Constitution?\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois has said it very well. That is \nexactly what this is about. At one level, this is about fulfilling \nconstitutional obligations. This is about following precedent. This is \nabout making sure there is fairness as we consider these nominees for \nall courts, but especially for courts at that level.\n  This is also about something also, about the management of the \nSenate. While the Senate has been concerned about one job for the last \n3 weeks, a lot of us are saying we ought to be concerned about the 8.3 \nmillion jobs we do not have in this country today as a result of \ndisastrous economic policies on the part of this administration, 2.5 \nmillion of which have been lost in the last 2 years. We spend our time \ntalking about one job; there is no talk on the other side about all of \nthose millions of jobs lost in this country because there is no \neconomic policy.\n  What we are suggesting this morning is that there ought to be some \nconsideration for those jobs, too; that to be consumed by one job and \nnot consumed, or at least willing to address those millions of other \njobs, is something I cannot explain to the people of my State or to the \npeople of our country. I hope our Republicans will do something along \nthose lines in the not too distant future.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Two questions. I want to follow up again on what the \nSenator from South Dakota said in the dialog with my colleague from \nIllinois. First, I know the Estrada judge issue has gotten a lot of \nattention in the newspapers. When I go back to my State of New York, \nvirtually no one asks me about it--very few people. I get lots of \npeople asking about the war and also about the economy and jobs. Is \nthat particular to New York because we had September 11 or is the same \nthing happening in South Dakota?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I say to the Senator from New York, before he came to \nthe floor, I began my comments by reporting conversations I had with \npeople back home last week. I was moved by the comments, by the \nreports, by the emotion I felt as I talked to people whose businesses, \nwhose jobs, are perhaps more precarious than they have been for years. \nAll the statistics bear that out. Consumer confidence is the lowest in \n10 years, the number of those unemployed going up by millions in the \nlast 2 years; every economic indicator is pointing to the growing \ncrisis we face in the economy.\n  Yet what do we do? We find ourselves once again most likely scheduled \nfor the entire week, debating 1 job rather than the 2.5 million jobs \nlost just in the last 2 years alone.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague will yield for another question, we have \nseen in the newspapers the talk that the Democrats are filibustering, \nthat Democrats are preventing the Senate from going forward to other \nissues, whereas the Republicans are eager to go to other issues.\n  The real truth on this floor is, first of all, that we have asked \njust now to go to economic issues, that last week when the Republican \nleadership--they run the show--decided to bring up this omnibus budget, \nthe Estrada nomination did not stand in the way. We did it. We voted in \none fell swoop for the entire Federal budget, and, in fact, last week \nthis floor, because the Republican leadership chose to do so, actually \nvoted on three other judges who I believe passed unanimously, if not \nclose to unanimously. And the filibuster, in a sense--in a very real \nsense--is not being conducted by the Democrats but rather, led by my \ncapable and good friend from Utah, by the Republicans, and we would be \nhappy to move on to other issues that are pressing, that are on \npeople's minds, and maybe come back to this issue at some point when we \nget the requested material.\n  Just to rephrase my question, who is really preventing us from moving \nforward? Who is filibustering? Why are we staying on this issue? Is \nthat the Senator's choice as the leader of the Democrats or is that the \nchoice of our good friend from Tennessee as leader of the Republicans?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator from New York put his finger on \nexactly the question. We just attempted to move on to something else. \nWe were prevented from doing so. It is not just something else but \nperhaps the single most important domestic issue facing our country \ntoday. Yesterday, the request was made and agreed to that we take up \nthe Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, as we should have agreed. I am glad that \nwe were able to take it up and pass it.\n  The Senate has demonstrated the ability to move off this legislation \nwhen it sees fit. We did it just yesterday. As the Senator from New \nYork suggests, we did it again a few weeks ago with passage of the \nomnibus legislation. We are capable of moving off the bill and dealing \nwith the other issues. I can't explain why we have chosen--why our \nRepublican colleagues have chosen--to stay on this legislation even \nthough we know there are so many more pressing issues that ought to be \ntaken up. I can't explain their intransigence. I can't explain why they \nwant to prolong this debate. I can't explain why they are unwilling to \nconsider the 2.5 million jobs rather than the one job that we continue \nto debate on the Senate floor. That is inexplicable to me.\n  I just hope the American people understand. We have come back after \nlistening to our people. They made it clear to us what they want us to \ntake up. They want us to deal with the economy. They want us to deal \nwith the real problems we have with homeland security and the lack of \ntraining, the lack of communication and the lack of good technology and \nequipment which they need so badly. They do not have that either. That, \ntoo, would be economic in many respects, if we can provide that \nassistance. But it is not being provided because it is not being given \nthe attention. Therein lies the credibility gap. Something is said and \nnothing is done. There is a big difference between rhetoric and reality \nwhen it comes to this administration and many of our colleagues on the \nother side.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague will yield for just one final question, \nmight it not be fair to say that it is not the Democrats filibustering \nto prevent Estrada from coming forward for a vote but, rather, the \nRepublicans are filibustering until they get the vote on Estrada, which \nthey have so far refused to call for? Is that an unfair \ncharacterization?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is exactly what happened this morning. If we were \nfilibustering we would not have suggested that we get off the issue. A \nfilibuster is to prolong the debate. We want to end the debate. We want \nto move on to something far more pressing to the people of this country \nthan the one job. We want to talk about those 2.5 million jobs that we \nhave lost. Therein lies the issue.\n  I hope the Republicans will bring this debate to a close so long as \nit doesn't appear that Mr. Estrada is willing to cooperate. At such \ntime as he is prepared to do so, we can take this matter up again. But \nin the meantime, we ought to be concerned about those millions of jobs \nthat continue to be lost because of congressional inaction and because \nof a failed economic policy on the part of the administration.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, will the distinguished minority leader \nyield for one more question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I asked questions earlier about the \nprivate sector. I think we have all 50 Governors from across this \nNation now in the Nation's Capital. I know many of them come to visit \ntheir Senate representatives and their congressional representatives. I \nwonder if the minority leader has had one single Governor approach him \nwith respect to the Estrada nomination or whether he has had one single \nor multiple Governors come and talk about the state of their fiscal \naffairs in their State governments and their unbelievable difficulty in \ntrying to maintain employment and support in Medicaid and all the other \nissues. I was just wondering if the minority leader has had any \ndiscussions with them about Judge Estrada versus the sake of the \neconomy--or homeland security for that matter.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator from New Jersey asked the question \nthat makes the point. The answer is absolutely no. Our Governors, of \ncourse, are hearing from the same people we are hearing from. They are \nconcerned about the status quo. Someone once told me the status quo was \nLatin\n\n[[Page S2642]]\n\nfor the ``mess word.'' Their concern for the ``mess word'' and this \nmess continues to be compounded by a budget deficit that grows by the \nmonth. We are told now that we could exceed $70 billion. Some have \nsuggested that the figure could be as high as $100 billion in debt. \nThey are struggling with their own budgets in part because of the mess \nwe created for them in Medicaid, in education, in homeland defense, \nunfunded mandates, and the sagging economy, and no real economic plan \nin place. Their message in coming to Washington is: Fix it; help us \naddress this issue and be a full partner recognizing that you, too, \nhave a full responsibility to engage with us in solving this issue.\n  I think if you took a poll of all 50 Governors, should we stay on the \nEstrada nomination or should we address the economy and these budgetary \nquestions, it would be unanimous--Republican and Democrat--they would \nsay no; fix the economy and help us solve our own financial and fiscal \nproblems. Do not be as consumed as you are about one job until you \nsolve the problem for those 2.5 million jobs that haven't been \naddressed.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I join with my colleagues on this side of the aisle in \ncomplimenting the leader and for rating this issue one job versus 2.5 \nmillion jobs. We have a major issue in this country with regard to our \neconomy, and that is at the top of our agenda.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard these crocodile tears on the \nother side. It is amazing to me because they know what a phony issue \nis--the request for confidential and privileged memorandum from the \nSolicitor General's Office--and they are building their whole case on \nthat. All they have to do to go on to anything else in the Senate is to \nexercise the advice and consent that the Constitution talks about; that \nis, to vote up and down. If they feel as deeply as they do about these, \nI think, spurious arguments that have been made just in the last few \nminutes--by the way, made by people who had all of last year to come up \nwith a budget, and for the first time in this country couldn't even do \nthat. The reason they didn't is because they knew it was pretty tough. \nThey criticized us all these years for coming up with these tough \nbudgets because we had to make the decisions. Senator Domenici from New \nMexico has had to make tough decisions as Budget Committee chairman. We \nalways came up with a budget, as tough as it was. We are criticized all \nthe time for not having enough money for the poor and this and that and \neverything else, every phony argument in the books. Yet when they had \nthe opportunity and saw how tough it is to come up with a budget, my \ngosh, they did not do it, nor did they do all those appropriations \nbills that we had to do once we took over.\n  All they have to do to go on to these wonderful economic issues--and \nwe all want to do it--is allow a vote up or down. They don't like \nMiguel Estrada for one reason or another. Some of them are perhaps \nsincere reasons. I think other reasons are that they think he is just \nan independent Hispanic. Frankly, they do not like him. Vote him down, \nif you want. They have that right. If they feel sincerely that they are \nright in voting him down, vote him down. But let us have a vote. I have \nheard the distinguished Senator from Illinois ask, Why doesn't Mr. \nEstrada produce those papers? He is not in the Solicitor General's \nOffice. He is not the Attorney General of the United States. He is not \nthe Chief Counsel of the White House. He hasn't controlled those \npapers. As far as he is concerned, he is proud of his work and they \ncould be disclosed. The problem is seven former Solicitors General--\nfour of them are Democrats--said you can't give those kinds of papers \nup because it would ruin the work of the Solicitor General's Office.\n  Look, if they are sincere and they really want to get on to the \nbudget work they never did last year, the appropriations work they \nnever did last year--we had to do it--then just vote. It is tough work. \nBy gosh, it is tough to come up with a budget. I know the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico has had to go through a lot of torment and \ncriticism year after year to come up with a budget. But he always did, \nand we always did. We were maligned by the other side because we were \nnever good enough, because we had to live within the budget \nconstraints. When they found that they had to live within the budget \nconstraints, they skipped a beat and missed doing the budget.\n  Here they are coming in here with crocodile tears saying a circuit \ncourt of appeals judge is not important enough. Well, if he is not, \nvote him down, let's have a vote, and let's vote him down. Now----\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my good friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could finish. I am wound up right now. I would like \nto unwind a little bit before I yield to my dear friend.\n  And to say that we are filibustering because we are trying to get a \nvote on this? Why don't we just do that? Why don't I just--I ask \nunanimous consent that we proceed to a vote on the Miguel Estrada \nnomination, so we can get to all these important budget matters. It \nwould be a quick way of doing it. And those who do not like Miguel \nEstrada: vote him down. Those who do: vote him up. I ask unanimous \nconsent that we proceed to a vote on Miguel Estrada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SESSIONS). Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I ask to amend the unanimous consent request, that after \nthe Justice Department provides the requested documents relevant to Mr. \nEstrada's Government service, which were first requested in May 2001, \nthe nominee then appear before the Judiciary Committee to answer the \nquestions which he failed to answer in his confirmation hearing and any \nadditional questions that may arise from reviewing such documents.\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can you amend a unanimous consent request? It is my \nunderstanding that you can't.\n  Mr. REID. Of course you can. Absolutely. We do it all the time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not if we object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada can ask the Senator \nfrom Utah to modify his request.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I refuse to modify it. I think we ought to vote up \nor down.\n  Look, if you folks are sincere on this other side--and, my goodness, \nI have to believe you must be, although I think if you are not, it is \nthe most brazen thing I have seen in a long time to come here and act \nlike the whole world is being held up because we want to fill one of \nthe most important judge seats in this country. And we want to do it \nwith a person who has had this much of a transcript of record, who has \nthis much of a paper trail that they have been able to examine, who has \nhad 2 years sitting here waiting for a stinking solitary vote.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. HATCH. Why not give him a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Utah?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. HATCH. Oh, my goodness.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the distinguished minority leader said that \nhalf of the American people are only getting $100 out of this tax cut. \nI happen to know, the people who are at the $40,000 level are getting \nabout a $1,000 tax cut. Just understand, the top 50 percent in our \nsociety pay 96-plus percent of the total income taxes in this country. \nSo that is another phony argument.\n  I have to say, there are 52 million people in the stock market who \nhave wanted dividends in spite of the representations that were made \nhere. And in this downturn in the economy, perhaps they have not been \nable to get dividends because the companies have not done well. But \nthis downturn started in the year 1999 or 2000. This President was not \nthe President at the time. He has inherited these problems.\n\n  I just have to say that for people who never passed a budget last \nyear, and did not pass hardly any of the appropriations bills, to come \nin here and use these crocodile tears, that this is somehow holding up \nour economic wherewithal in this country, when they refuse to allow a \nvote, as we just saw--I think there is something wrong here.\n\n[[Page S2643]]\n\n  Just remember, even the Washington Post said, ``Just Vote.'' Just \nvote, fellows and ladies. All you have to do is vote. If you don't like \nMiguel Estrada, vote him down.\n  The reason they don't want a vote, and the reason this is a \nfilibuster, is that they know Miguel Estrada has the votes here on the \nfloor to be confirmed.\n  And for those who think that the economy is everything, let me just \nmake a point. The judiciary is one-third of these separated powers. If \nwe don't have a strong judiciary in this country, we will never have a \nstrong economy because the Constitution would not be maintained. I \nwould have to say this body has not maintained it through the years, as \nI have seen unconstitutional legislation after unconstitutional \nlegislation move through here. It isn't this body that has preserved \nthe Constitution, nor has it been the executive branch. We have seen a \nlot of unconstitutional things over there over the years, although I \nbelieve people have tried to sincerely do what is right. But it has \nbeen the courts that have saved this country and the Constitution.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will. Let me make one more statement.\n  It has been the courts. This is an important position, and if we are \ngoing to have to go through this on every circuit court of appeals \nnominee because the other side just doesn't like them--they don't have \na good, valid reason for voting against Miguel Estrada, other than this \nphony red herring issue about the Solicitor General's Office, which I \ndon't think anybody in their right mind would buy.\n  ``Just Vote,'' the Washington Post said.\n  I will be happy to yield to my colleague.\n\n       Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. And I know he feels \n     passionately about this. Many of us feel passionately about \n     this.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. More than passionately.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to ask the Senator two questions.\n  The first question is this. My colleague said, in a very well done \nspeech--I read it--before the University of Utah Federalist Society, in \n1997:\n\n       Determining which of President Clinton's nominees will \n     become activists is complicated and it will require the \n     Senate to be more diligent and extensive in its questioning \n     of nominees' ``jurisprudential views.''\n\n  Now, in fairness to my friend----\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have a question. I am coming to it. In fairness, the \nSenator just said how important the judiciary is.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Now, in those papers, the books that my colleague has \nheld up--I have read them. I read the whole transcript. I was there for \nmuch of it. I chaired that hearing.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. There is a lot more than a transcript here.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I know. I ask my colleague, does Miguel Estrada talk \nabout how he feels about the 1st amendment, or the 2nd amendment, or \nthe 11th amendment, or the commerce clause, or the right to privacy, or \nall the major issues that he will rule on for the rest of his life if \nhe becomes a judge? And if he does not, other than to say, ``I will \nfollow the law''--and we all know judges follow the law in different \nways--then why isn't what is good for the goose good for the gander?\n  In other words, when it was a Democratic nominee--and this is not tit \nfor tat. My colleague, who cares about the judiciary, said he needed \nextensive questions. We didn't get that opportunity because, as my \ncolleague well knows, Mr. Estrada just said, on every issue asked, ``I \nwill follow the law.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Ask a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My question to my colleague is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York will place a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Why shouldn't we be accorded the same right, as he \nespoused in his speech in 1997, to get all the details to this \nappointment to the second highest court of the land, which is going to \nhave a lifetime--Mr. Estrada has a job now; but this is a different \njob--a lifetime appointment that will affect everybody? Why is the one \ndifferent than the other?\n  Mr. HATCH. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Look, I don't withdraw that statement. That statement is \nan important statement. The distinguished Senator from New York and his \ncolleagues had almost 2 years. The distinguished Senator from New York \nconducted this hearing. The distinguished Senator from New York said it \nwas a fairly conducted hearing. The distinguished Senator from New York \nhad a right to ask any questions he wanted. He did. The distinguished \nSenator from New York had a right to ask written questions. He did not.\n  He could have asked: What do you think about the 11th amendment? \nListen, that is a question that is almost improper because you are \nsaying----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Could I ask my colleague to yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish answering your question. He could have \nasked: What do you feel about the first amendment? Are you kidding? \nThat is not a question that should be asked a judicial nominee. And any \njudicial nominee would answer: What I feel is irrelevant--which is the \nway he answered it. It is what the law says. Frankly, he answered that \ntime after time after time on question after question after question.\n  Where were the written questions of the distinguished Senator from \nNew York? They were not there. You had a chance to do it. You didn't do \nit. Now, after the fact, 2 years later, this man has been sitting \nthere, waiting for fairness, being treated totally unfair, and he can't \nget--my gosh, he can't get a vote up or down, which is what the \nWashington Post says we should do.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I know Senator Domenici has been waiting a long time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Sir, I was waiting longer than Senator Domenici. If my \ncolleague will yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. No. Senator Domenici has been waiting for well over an \nhour. And, well, I am not yielding the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah how much longer he intends to speak on this round?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to discuss for a few \nminutes with the Senate, and those who are interested in what we are \ndoing here, first, the issue of the American economy and what we ought \nto be doing about it because the other side of the aisle--the \nDemocratic leadership in the Senate--has decided that they are not \ngoing to permit us to vote on a most eminently qualified nominee, whose \nqualifications I will discuss shortly.\n  They come to the floor and discuss an issue--to wit, the American \neconomy and the plight of the American worker--as if they can do \nsomething about that problem, as if they have a solution to the \neconomic woes in this country, as if they could do something in the \nSenate that would help the working people.\n\n  They have no plan. The plans they have submitted are, according to \nmost economists, far inferior to the only plan we have, and that is the \nplan of the President of the United States.\n  Nobody should be fooled by this discussion. We can take to the floor \nfor the next 5 weeks and have speeches by the other side of the aisle \nclaiming that they are concerned about the working people, that we have \nproblems in the economy, but none of that will do anything to help the \nAmerican people. If we know how to help them, we have to do something. \nAnd to do something, we have to act in the Senate and the House or the \nPresident has to act. As a matter of fact, the Budget Committee, which \nis currently chaired by the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nNickles, which I used to chair, and which 3 years ago was chaired by a \nDemocrat because they were in control, has to produce a budget before \nwe can do anything.\n  So in response to all the rhetoric, we can take no action until we \nhave a\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\nbudget that lays forth what we will do, when we will do it, and how we \nwill do it.\n  I submit that the chairman of the Budget Committee this year will \nproduce a budget on time. It will come to the floor on time. I predict \nit will be passed on time, as compared with last year when the other \nside of the aisle was in charge of the budget. They produced no budget. \nThey came to the floor and said: We can't produce it because it is too \nhard and we don't have the votes. So we did nothing. Isn't that \nspectacular, that the leadership on that side of the aisle, the last \ntime they were charged with doing something for the American people \nwith a budget, punted? They punted. They had no plan. They produced \nnone.\n  Today, when we have a bona fide issue that we can do something \nabout--that is, appoint a circuit court judge who is qualified--they \nhave the effrontery to come to the floor and engage in a discussion as \nif a discussion about the plight of the American worker would solve the \nproblems of the American worker. What will their discussions do for the \nAmerican worker? Do they have some grand plan they want to come down \nhere and talk about? They have been doing it in spite of whatever the \ndebate is. They have been talking about whatever plan they had. I have \nnot seen it foment any great enthusiasm on the part of those who are \nworried about the American economy, unless it is themselves talking to \nthemselves. I have heard no great group of American economists saying: \nBoy, they have a great plan to help the American workers. Quite to the \ncontrary.\n  There is only one plan around that has significant support. And if \nthey want to change it, they will have their opportunity. But it will \nnot get changed with speeches. It will get changed when the bills come \nto the floor. They will be here in due course. As a matter of fact, \nthey will be here faster than they ever got here when the Democrats \nwere in control.\n  We have a commitment from the chairman of the Budget Committee that \nit will be here on time and that it will be a plan that will be voted \non by that committee and presented to us so we can vote on it on behalf \nof the American people. That side will have their chance to amend it, \nif they can. That is what we are going to do. We are going to start \nthat and then move it right along. We will move it more expeditiously \nthan it has ever been moved before because we have the will, we have \nthe leadership in the White House, and we understand that we have \nto produce a budget resolution with the requisite mandates to the \ncommittees of the Senate to reduce taxes in whatever way we \ncollectively want, be it the President's wishes or some other plan. But \nwe have to do it--not speeches, not coming down here and creating \nsomething sort of a let's have another showdown here on the floor, \nlet's talk about the economy because we don't want the Senate to vote \non the issue that is justifiably before us--to wit, whether or not \nMiguel Estrada is entitled to have a vote.\n\n  I thought it might be interesting to look at a few comparisons. I \ntook some of these judges who sit on the DC Circuit. Let's see how they \ncompare with the nominee and what happened to them as they came before \nthe Senate.\n  We have Karen Henderson, appointed by George Bush; we have Justice \nRogers and David Tatel; then we have Miguel Estrada. Let's look at a \ncomparison. These judges are there on the bench, they were appointed \nand confirmed. Here is one from Duke University, Judge Henderson, who \nattended the University of North Carolina Law School. It is \ninteresting, as far as other things are concerned that those candidates \ndid to prepare them to sit on the bench, such as Circuit Court \nclerkships, Supreme Court clerkships, and Federal Government service. \nLook, these others had none. Yet, they were deemed to have had adequate \nexperience to go on the bench. And Miguel Estrada is not.\n  Look at what he has done compared to them. Just look at the list. \nObviously, he graduated from a comparably good law school. His is \nHarvard. One of theirs was Chicago. One of theirs was Harvard. One was \nNorth Carolina. And then look at all the other things he has done. Yet \nthey say he is unqualified. But these two--these three get appointed. \nThey are serving, and they are apparently qualified.\n  Look at the really important issue. Look at how long it took this \njudge from the time her name was submitted to take her seat on the \nbench--51 days. No aspersions on this judge. She must be great. She got \nthere in 51 days. But she had none of the experience Miguel Estrada \nhad. She graduated from a good law school, certainly. And she went to \nan undergraduate school, got a degree at Duke, a great university.\n  But how about experience, the experience of being part of the \nAttorney General's Office of the United States, which this candidate \ndid under a Democrat and a Republican, a circuit court clerkship, \nSupreme Court clerkship? They had none of that, and look at how quickly \nthey got appointed: 51 days, 113 days, 108 days. Look at Miguel \nEstrada: 650 days and counting since he was recommended until today \nwhile they continue to say: No vote.\n  Again, we have a lot of time in the Senate. So the Democrats can come \ndown here this afternoon, and nobody is going to keep them from \ndebating the economy. If they want to equate a debate in the Chamber of \nthe Senate about the economy and call it 2 million to 1, or whatever \nwords they were using, let them have it. It doesn't do anything to help \nthe American people and the working man. What it does is detract from \nthe fact that they want to change the precedent of this institution.\n  I am hopeful that before we are finished, good leaders on that side \nof the aisle, including the distinguished minority leader, will \nexercise some common sense about the future of the Senate and the \nappointment of Federal judges. The future of this institution as an \ninstitution that is supposed to look at the Presidential nominees and \nwork with Presidents and then indicate whether we want to approve them \nor not is in real jeopardy because they are about to say that from this \nday forward, because of their stubbornness about this nominee, they are \ngoing to change the rules so that judges will need 60 votes, not the \nmajority rule that we thought existed.\n  I will not yield to my good friend. I see him standing out of the \ncorner of my eye, and I will save his words. Please understand, I will \nyield soon.\n  So what they would like to do is to change from 51 votes being \nnecessary to approve judges of the United States under our \nConstitution--because of what I perceive as nothing more than an \nunfounded fear--and you know, their fear is not the one that has been \nexpressed. Their fear is that this young man will be a great judge and, \nbesides that, he is Hispanic, whether you want to argue, as some would, \nthat a Honduran who is Hispanic is not Hispanic, which is a most \nincredible argument. If we were to start that across America when we \nare talking about Hispanics, we are going to have to decide which one \nis Hispanic, and if a Honduran with his family name is not one, as some \nwould say on that side of the aisle, that is pure, absolute lunacy.\n  So they are going to say we don't want him there, but it is not \nbecause they fear him as a circuit court judge. They fear him because \nhe is then, if he sits on the circuit court, a legitimate, potential \nU.S. Supreme Court member. We have not had one who is Hispanic. They \nare frightened to death. While all of their fear is illegitimate, some \nof it is selfish fear because they think their party should be the one \nthat nominates a Hispanic who would be on the U.S. Supreme Court. They \nthink that because Hispanics are predominantly members of the \nDemocratic Party, they should be the party that puts into position a \nHispanic who might go to the highest bench in the country.\n  I believe that is a terrific burden to place on this young man, who \nat this early age has accomplished more, by way of experience, legal \naccomplishments, and academic accomplishments, than any of the members \nsitting on the circuit court today.\n  I finished talking about those judges who were far less experienced \nand how long it took them to become judges. Now I will take these \njudges who have comparable experience to Miguel Estrada. I find that by \nlooking in the records and seeing what they did. In addition to the law \nschools and undergraduate, it looks like circuit court clerkships, \nlooks like Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S2645]]\n\nclerkship, looks like Federal Government service are pretty much \nequivalent to what Miguel Estrada has. Look here, it took only 15 days \nfrom the time of nomination to confirmation. Raymond Randolph, \nappointed by George Bush, attended Drexel University; graduated from \nPennsylvania Law School, summa cum laude, much like Miguel Estrada; who \nwas a circuit court clerk for a Second Circuit Judge; Assistant \nSolicitor General and Deputy Solicitor General. That is much like \nMiguel Estrada. It took 66 days from nomination to vote. A comparably \nequipped nominee, it took 66 days.\n  Another one is Merrick Garland, appointed by President Clinton, \ngraduate of Harvard, summa cum laude; Harvard Law School, circuit court \nclerk, special assistant--very much the same as Miguel. That took only \n71 days. Isn't that amazing? Very comparable credentials. This man has \nbeen waiting 650 days--Miguel Estrada--and it is continuing day by day.\n  I don't get a chance to come down here as frequently as some, \nalthough Senator Nickles and I agreed many months ago that we would be \nspecial friends to Miguel Estrada and help him as he moved through \nhere. He has so many helpers in a job that is very simple. Senator \nNickles spoke yesterday and he referred to that special kinship. I \nhaven't been here as often as some but I have heard some very good \nspeeches. I heard some very good efforts on the part of the other side \nof the aisle to justify the delays that are taking place. Some have \nwondered whether it does any good for Republicans to insist that this \nman be given an up-or-down vote, and that whatever is occurring on the \nother side of the aisle--I have given you four or five reasons it may \nbe occurring--but I suggest our effort is doing some good.\n\n  I will tell you that in my State three newspapers over the weekend \nannounced in open and bold editorials that the Democrats should stop \nthe filibuster, retreat from it, and get on with the vote. One of them \nis a newspaper known as the Santa Fe New Mexican. Obviously, those who \nknow our State know that this paper--a very old newspaper--is certainly \nnot a conservative newspaper. They say in their editorial--the lead \nwords are--Bingaman--meaning our Senator--``Bingaman should lead the \nDems' filibuster retreat.'' They have a very lengthy discussion of why \nmy colleague, the junior Senator from New Mexico, should lead the \nDemocrat retreat from the filibuster that is working its way on the \nDemocrat side. I ask that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n\n             [From the Santa Fe New Mexican, Feb. 24, 2003]\n\n             Bingaman Should Lead Dems' Filibuster Retreat\n\n       As legendary prizefighter Joe Louis said of an upcoming \n     opponent reputed to be fast on his feet: ``He can run, but he \n     can't hide.''\n       Senate Democrats, along with the Republican majority, fled \n     Washington last week as their way of honoring Presidents' \n     Day. The annual recess suspended their filibuster against a \n     federal judgeship vote. The Dems are making an unwarranted \n     stand, and an unseemly fuss, over the nomination of Miguel \n     Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n       The filibuster--protracted talking under senatorial \n     privilege--had consumed a week of debate about Estrada before \n     the senators left town. Now they're gravitating back to the \n     Potomac, and the Dems can hide no longer. Resumption of their \n     verbose balking will make them look ridiculous--at a time \n     when the nation needs statesmen to stand up against the White \n     House warmonger and his partisans commanding Capitol Hill.\n       The Democrats have chosen a particularly poor target: \n     Estrada, who came from Honduras as a boy and went on to lead \n     his law class at Harvard, is better qualified than many a \n     Democratic appointee now holding life tenure on one federal \n     bench or another.\n       But after confirming so many less-qualified judges while \n     they held power, Estrada's senatorial tormentors now offer \n     ``reasons'' why he shouldn't be confirmed; too young; too \n     bashful about answering leading questions; appointed only \n     because he's Hispanic--or, to some senators' way of thinking, \n     not Hispanic enough.\n       What really rankles with the Democrats, though, is \n     Estrada's politics. He's a conservative. Surprise, surprise; \n     we've got a conservative president, and it's the president \n     who makes the appointments to the federal judiciary.\n       As the party on the outs, the Dems had better get used to \n     like-minded appointments from the president. If their game-\n     playing goes on, a disgusted American public might keep \n     George W. Bush in office for the next six years. The country \n     certainly didn't see any reason to balance Bush against a \n     Democratic Congress when it had a chance just a few months \n     ago. With their spiteful behavior toward Bush appointees, the \n     Dems aren't exactly gaining goodwill.\n       If they find the Republican so repugnant, let 'em vote \n     against him; at least they'll be putting their ideals--or \n     their party colors--on display. But this is no Mr. Smith \n     against some diabolical establishment; it's a bunch of sore \n     losers making themselves even more so.\n       To break a filibuster by cloture takes 60 senators. The \n     Senate's 51 Republicans need nine of the 48 Democrats, or \n     eight of them and ex-Republican Jim Jeffords of Vermont.\n       New Mexico's Jeff Bingaman should lead the Democratic \n     blockade-runners. By all measures, Bingaman is a class act; a \n     lawyer who knows that senators have no business obstructing \n     appointments on purely political grounds. He also knows that \n     Republicans aren't going to hold the White House forever; \n     that sooner or later a Democratic president will be choosing \n     judges. And he realizes that Republicans, like their mascot, \n     have long memories.\n       The last thing our justice system needs is an ongoing feud \n     over appointments to district and appellate judgeships. Let \n     Judge Estrada's confirmation be a landmark of partisan \n     politics' retreat from the courtroom.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have a rather active University of \nNew Mexico newspaper. It is named the Daily Lobo, after the athletic \nteam. They have a columnist there, Scott Darnell, who wrote:\n\n       Miguel Estrada isn't probably someone with an immense \n     amount of name recognition--yet.\n\n  That is this University of New Mexico editorial comment. Then they \nproceed to quote the distinguished Democratic Senators who have in the \npast stated that we should not filibuster Federal judge appointments. \nThey cite Ted Kennedy, our distinguished Senate colleague, and Patrick \nLeahy, our distinguished colleague, and they quote from them as to why \nwe should not use a filibuster when it comes to the appointment of \njudges.\n  Of course, the editorial asks, Why now? The editorial proceeds to \ntalk about this young judge and his great qualifications. It indicates \nthat we should not make this mistake in changing what we have been \ndoing for so many years and create a 60-vote requirement for a \njudgeship.\n  Then the third article is from the largest newspaper in the State--\nthe Albuquerque Journal. They have a very lengthy editorial piece. The \nheadline is ``End Filibuster, Put Court Nominee to Vote.'' That is the \ndaily Albuquerque newspaper. They merely conclude that the time has \ncome. That is from my home State. I suggest when you put the three \ntogether, they have gotten the message very well. They have heard both \nsides. They quote arguments made on the other side and find them \nwithout merit, and they proceed to indicate that, without question, the \ntime has come to have a vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those two articles be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Journal, Feb. 24, 2003]\n\n               End Filibuster, Put Court Nominee to Vote\n\n       What the Colt revolver was on the dusty streets of the Old \n     West, the filibuster is on the floor of the U.S. Senate: The \n     great equalizer gives 41 senators the ability to bring the \n     chamber's business to a halt.\n       The tactic should be unholstered only on issues of high \n     principle or grave importance. Considering the issues \n     currently confronting Washington, the judicial nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada does not rise above partisan wrangling. To \n     block a vote on his appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit is an abuse of the \n     filibuster.\n       Democrats say the filibuster is justified because too \n     little is known about Estrada and he has not been forthcoming \n     about his judicial philosophy.\n       New Mexico Sen. Jeff Bingaman said Friday he has not made \n     up his mind about backing continuation of the delay tactic, \n     and echoed the Democratic indictment of the Honduran \n     immigrant as a stealth conservative.\n       ``Obviously, you become suspicious of a person's point of \n     view if he won't answer questions,'' Bingaman said.\n       Let's get on past mere suspicions of Democrats and declare \n     guilt by association. Estrada is the choice of President \n     Bush. His views doubtlessly come closer to mirroring Bush's \n     than those of left-leaning Democrats or those of Clinton's \n     judicial nominees.\n       Feminist Majority president Eleanor Smeal, for one, doesn't \n     need any more information about Estrada to know that in \n     blocking him, ``the Democrat leadership is giving voice to \n     its massive base of labor, civil rights, women's rights, \n     disability rights, environmental, gay and lesbian rights \n     groups.''\n\n[[Page S2646]]\n\n       Oh, then this is about constituent politics.\n       There's another constituent-oriented facet: Miguel Estrada \n     is a successful immigrant, current front-runner to become the \n     first Hispanic Supreme Court justice and an obvious role \n     model--in short, a poster boy for Republican recruitment of \n     minorities away from the one, true political faith.\n       This isn't about suspicions; Estrada is Democrats' worst \n     nightmare from a partisan perspective.\n       From a personal perspective, Democrats who have worked with \n     him in the Clinton administration have high praise. Seth \n     Waxman, Clinton's solicitor general, called Estrada a ``model \n     of professionalism.'' Former Vice President Al Gore's top \n     legal adviser, Ron Klain, said Estrada is ``genuinely \n     compassionate. Miguel is a person of outstanding character \n     (and) tremendous intellect.''\n       During Judiciary Committee hearings in September, Estrada \n     said: ``although we all have views on a number of subjects \n     from A to Z, the first duty of a judge is to a put all that \n     aside.''\n       That's good advice for a judge, and it's good advice for \n     senators sitting in judgment of a nominee. Put aside pure \n     partisan considerations; weight Estrada's qualifications, \n     character and intellect; end the filibuster and put this \n     nomination to a vote.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Daily Lobo, Feb. 24, 2003]\n\n                     Estrada Naysayers Hypocritical\n\n                           (By Scott Darnell)\n\n       Miguel Estrada isn't probably someone with an immense \n     amount of name recognition--yet.\n       President Bush appointed him to an open seat on the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit on May 9, \n     2001; he immigrated to the United States from Honduras when \n     he was 15 years old, graduated from Harvard Law School magna \n     cum laude in 1986, has been a clerk for a Supreme Court \n     justice, an assistant U.S. attorney and the assistant \n     solicitor general, among other stints in private practice. He \n     is supported by many national organizations, including the \n     Hispanic Business Council, the Heritage Foundation, the \n     Washington Legal Foundation and the Hispanic Business \n     Roundtable.\n       Unfortunately, Estrada's confirmation has been delayed and \n     prevented by many Democrats within the Senate, an action \n     fueled by many leftist groups, organizations and lobbyists in \n     America. Currently, Senate Democrats are planning to, or may \n     actually be carrying out, an intense filibuster against \n     Estrada's nomination; filibustering, or taking an issue to \n     death, is definitely a method for lawmakers to prevent a \n     policy or other initiative from ever coming to fruition--\n     ending a filibuster is difficult, especially in our closely \n     divided Senate, taking a whopping 60 votes.\n       The most unfortunate part of the Senate Democrats' \n     obstruction on Capitol Hill lies in the fact that many high-\n     ranking Senate Democrats have at one time condemned \n     nomination filibusters quite harshly, leaving their intense \n     efforts to carry out a filibuster today very hypocritical. \n     For example, Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the \n     Judiciary Committee, said, from Congressional Record in 1998, \n     that ``I have stated over and over again . . . that I would \n     object and fight any filibuster on a judge, whether it is \n     somebody I opposed or supported.''\n       Sen. Ted Kennedy said, from Congressional Record in 1995, \n     that, ``Senators who feel strongly about the issue of \n     fairness should vote for cloture, even if they intend to vote \n     against the nomination itself. It is wrong to filibuster this \n     nomination, and Senators who believe in fairness will not let \n     a minority of the Senate deny [the nominee] his vote by the \n     entire Senate.''\n       Finally, Sen. Barbara Boxer, from California said, \n     from Congressional Record in 1995, that, ``The nominee \n     deserves his day, and filibustering this nomination is \n     keeping him form his day.''\n       It seems people can change quite a bit in only a matter of \n     years.\n       But why are Senate Democrats and many leftist organizations \n     so dead set against Estrada's nomination? The obvious answer \n     lies in the fact that the court he is being nominated to is \n     considered the second-highest court in the nation and often \n     times though of as a stepping stone to the Supreme Court.\n       Secondly, Senate Democrats and organizations such as the \n     NAACP or the AFL-CIO recognize Estrada's ethnicity--they \n     recognize his heritage and the future he is making for \n     himself--but let's face it, he's just the wrong type of \n     minority. He's Hispanic and these politicians and \n     organizations are all for the pro-active advancement of \n     Hispanics, just not his type of Hispanic. The National \n     Association for the Advancement of Colored People is now \n     going to read ``The National Association for the Advancement \n     of Colored People Who Believe in ONLY Leftist Principles and \n     Ideology.''\n       Miguel Estrada will not, while in whatever courtroom he may \n     preside over, pander to the interests of those who wish to \n     establish and ingrain a persistent racial inequality in \n     America, those who do not now carry out the legacies of past \n     civil rights leaders, but instead bastardize those past \n     efforts by forcing racial tension upon Americans to keep \n     society at their beck and call while gaining personal \n     notoriety, prestige and wealth.\n       If the Senate Democrats try to filibuster Estrada's \n     nomination, they will be holding back debate and action on \n     the immediate national and foreign issues affecting this \n     country, such as creating and passing the appropriate \n     economic stimulus package, among other important topics.\n       If the Senate feels that Estrada has committed a criminal \n     or moral transgression at some point in his life that would \n     injure the integrity and standing of his service as justice \n     of one of our nation's highest courts, they should provide \n     sufficient evidence to that end and take whatever measures \n     necessary to disallow a moral or actual criminal from taking \n     the bench. But, in this case, no such criminal or moral \n     transgression can be seen, and the argument against his \n     nomination is purely idealogical; a filibuster would \n     represent a blatant obstruction of our political system and a \n     disservice to the American people. So, as Democratic Sen. \n     Barbara Boxer put it so succinctly a few years ago, ``Let the \n     nominee have his day.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I repeat, it is one thing to delay; it \nis another thing to talk a lot; and it is yet another thing to attempt \nto get the issue that is before us and find a way around it and cloud \nthe issue. That is all that is happening this morning with the \ndiscussion by the Democratic leadership, joined by certain Democratic \nSenators, when they argue that Republicans, by insisting that we vote \non this nominee, are in some way failing to do justice to the economic \nproblems that exist in our country.\n  I hope it doesn't take a lot more discussion for people to understand \nthat is absolutely an untruth. It is an absolutely irrelevant argument. \nThey can talk all they like about the economy and quit talking about \nMiguel Estrada and not one single thing will happen to benefit the \nAmerican workers, not one thing.\n  We need to do something, and what we must do is decide whether we \nwant the President's plan or some modification of it. The only way we \ncan do that is to move with dispatch on the issues before us, those \nissues, in the way prescribed under our rules. There is no one \nsuggesting we should throw away our rules and pass a plan tomorrow \nmorning. Nobody is suggesting we do that.\n  In due course, in the matter of only a few weeks, we will be voting \non whose plan should be adopted to help the American economy move \nforward.\n  I submit that the facts are overwhelming that the arguments against \nMiguel Estrada are not justified. Those arguments do not justify these \ndelays.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2646-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n         CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, nearly 2 years ago, President George Bush \nnominated Miguel Estrada to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia. When confirmed, he will be the first Hispanic \nmember of this court. But the other side of the aisle has stalled. In \nfact, as I look back, we have been on this particular nomination since \nFebruary 5. The other side has continued to stall this nomination, \npreventing something that is very simple, that I think the American \npeople now understand, and that is a very simple up-or-down vote.\n  Every Senator in this body can decide either they support this \nnomination or they do not. Earlier today, attempts were made from the \nother side of the aisle to bring up other legislation with the call \nthat it is time to move on, and I agree; it is time to move on. We have \nhad hours and days and nights to debate and discuss the opportunity \ngiven to both sides of the aisle, and now it is time for us to vote on \nthis nominee.\n  For nearly 2 years, the nomination of this man--now, remember, the \nAmerican Bar Association has deemed him well qualified--has languished \nas some in this body have played politics with his future. They have \nconsistently refused to give Miguel Estrada this very\n\n[[Page S2647]]\n\nsimple right, I would argue, and that is an up-or-down vote.\n  In fact, the tactic, which is a filibuster--and the American people \nunderstand it is a filibuster--is something my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have said they would not use, filibustering of such a \nnominee. They have said that in the past. Yet they are filibustering \nthis nomination on the floor of the Senate. We feel that is wrong. We \nwill continue to fight for this up-or-down vote for this qualified \nnominee.\n  We came back from a recess yesterday. It is fascinating as we look \naround the country, even the newspapers, if we look at the top 57 \nnewspapers--I do not think one can say the top 57, but to read what 57 \nmajor newspapers in this country are seeing and saying in terms of \ntheir editorials, indeed, 50 newspapers from 25 States and the District \nof Columbia have editorialized either in favor of the Estrada \nnomination and/or, I should say, against this filibuster of a nominee, \nin essence saying, yes, please give him an up-or-down vote.\n  It seems, because we are demanding a supermajority to become the \nstandard, that the other side of the aisle is holding this Hispanic \nnominee, Miguel Estrada, to a higher standard than any other nominee to \nthis court has ever been held. I think this is wrong. It is \nunreasonable, using a filibuster and forcing a judicial nominee to \neffectively gather 60 votes rather than 50 votes for confirmation. It \nsets a new and unreasonable precedent.\n  In the sense of fairness, I once again appeal to my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to give us that vote. Clearly, Senators have \nhad adequate time to debate this nominee. I myself have come to this \nfloor on five separate occasions to attempt to reach an agreement with \nthe other side of the aisle for a time certain for a vote on the \nconfirmation, and each time my Democratic colleagues object to giving \nhim a simple up-or-down vote.\n  The two arguments I am hearing from the other side of the aisle are, \none, they want unprecedented access to this confidential memoranda and, \nsecondly, they need more information.\n\n  The first, to my mind, is a specious argument. It has been talked \nabout again and again on the floor. It is almost a fig leaf because \nthey know it cannot and should not be complied with.\n  I do want to address the second argument very briefly, not so much in \nsubstance but in terms of how we can bring this matter to a conclusion \nfor the American people and for this nominee, so we can get to an up-\nor-down vote, and that is if they really feel there are specific \nquestions that have not been answered, to reach out and figure some \nreasonable way to get the information to those questions. Again, \noutside of the rhetoric that flows back and forth and outside the heat \nof the argument, in the spirit of working together, I do want to \nsuggest we work together on both sides of the aisle--and I would be \nhappy to do it with the Democratic leader or his representative--toward \nputting together a reasonable list of questions that Members may wish \nto pose to Miguel Estrada. I would hope that once we agree upon the \nquestions, submit them, and get the answers back, that process would \nallow us to come back to what I think we should be able to turn to \nimmediately, but with the filibuster we are unable to, and that is to \nhave a vote this week on the nomination.\n  I am really talking more process at this point, with an appeal to the \nother side for us to put together questions to submit and, once we \nreceive those answers, be able to have a vote this week. Thus, I ask \nunanimous consent that the vote on the confirmation of the nomination \nof Miguel Estrada occur at 9:30 on Friday, February 28.\n  Before the Chair puts the question, I would add, and I want to \nstress, that I will work toward getting answers to any reasonable list \nof questions that could be worked out on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the majority leader to modify his proposal in the \nfollowing manner: I ask unanimous consent that after the Justice \nDepartment complies with the request for documents we have sought, \nnamely the memoranda from the Solicitor's Office which were first \nrequested on May of 2001, the nominee then appear before the Judiciary \nCommittee to answer the questions which he failed to answer in his \nconfirmation hearing and additional questions that may arise from \nreceiving any such documents.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will not modify my unanimous consent \nrequest as spelled out.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as we have just heard from our \ndistinguished majority leader, the Senate has had the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada since May 9, 2001. This man has been waiting for \nconfirmation for almost 2 years. This is the most qualified person who \nhas never gotten a vote in the Senate. In fact, the American Bar \nAssociation rated Miguel Estrada unanimously well qualified, the \nhighest possible rating. Never before have Senators filibustered such a \nnominee.\n  Mr. Estrada would be the first Hispanic to serve on the Nation's \nsecond most important Federal court, adding diversity to our judicial \nsystem. Miguel Estrada's nomination is supported by a number of \nHispanic organizations, including the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation, the League of United Latin American Citizens, and the U.S. \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce. The Austin American Statesman wrote last \nFriday: If Democrats have something substantive to block Miguel \nEstrada's confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia, it is past time they share it.\n  Miguel Estrada's nomination was announced in May of 2001 and has been \nheld hostage since by the Senate Democrats who have yet to clearly \narticulate their objections to him.\n  Mr. Estrada is widely regarded as one of the Nation's top appellate \nlawyers, having argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. He is currently a partner in a Washington, DC, law firm and \npractices law. He is truly an American success story.\n\n  Miguel Estrada emigrated to the United States from Honduras at the \nage of 17, speaking very little English. He graduated magna cum laude \nfrom Harvard Law School and served as a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court \nJustice Anthony Kennedy. He has been in the judicial system. He is an \nesteemed academic. He has a stellar record. Yet Miguel Estrada cannot \nget a vote on the floor of the Senate. He has been a highly respected \nFederal prosecutor in New York City. He served as Assistant Solicitor \nGeneral under President George H.W. Bush for 1 year and under President \nClinton for 4 years.\n  His nomination has broad bipartisan support, including support from \nhigh-ranking Clinton administration officials such as former Solicitor \nGeneral Seth Waxman and Ron Klain, the former counselor to Vice \nPresident Al Gore.\n  Mr. Estrada has worked throughout his career while he has been in the \npublic sector and the private sector to uphold our Constitution and \npreserve justice.\n  That we cannot get a vote on this qualified man is incredible. I am \nafraid it could be the beginning of a precedent that, in my opinion, is \nunconstitutional.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood the need to have three separate and \nequal branches of government so there would be checks and balances \nthroughout our system. They gave to the President the right to appoint \na Federal judiciary, a Federal judiciary that has lifelong \nappointments. They gave to the Senate the right of confirmation--advise \nand consent as it is called in the Constitution--that has always meant \na majority vote. If a two-thirds vote has ever been required by the \nConstitution, it is specified. So we are talking a simple majority, a \nsimple majority to confirm the nominees of the President. That is the \ncheck and the balance in the system.\n  What we see today is an amendment to the Constitution, but it has not \ngone through the process required under the Constitution where an \namendment would get a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress and \nthen it would go to the States to be passed. That is the requirement to \nchange the Constitution of this country.\n\n[[Page S2648]]\n\n  However, today we are changing the Constitution because we are, in \nessence, requiring 60 votes to break a filibuster in order to confirm \nthis judge, Miguel Estrada. Why have we set a bar of 60 votes for this \nman? What is the thought process of the Democrats who are filibustering \nthis appointment that they would substitute a 60-vote requirement for \nthe constitutional provision that has always meant 51 votes or a \nmajority of those present, a simple majority? And yet we are setting a \nnew bar, a 60-vote bar, without going to the people, without going \nthrough the process of a constitutional amendment. This is not right. \nThis man has been pending for 21 months.\n  We are now in the Chamber. He has come out of committee. We are in \nthe Chamber trying to get a vote of a simple majority to put the first \nHispanic on the DC Court of Appeals, a Hispanic who graduated with \nhonors, magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School, with years of \nexperience as one of the most highly esteemed appellate lawyers in \nAmerica, and we cannot get a vote on Miguel Estrada.\n  Let me read some of the editorials that have been written about this \nnomination. On February 18, 2003, the Washington Post wrote:\n\n       The Senate has recessed without voting on the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit. Because of a Democratic filibuster, it spent much of \n     the week debating Mr. Estrada, and, at least for now, enough \n     Democrats are holding together to prevent the full Senate \n     from acting. The arguments against Mr. Estrada's confirmation \n     range from the unpersuasive to the offensive. He lacks \n     judicial experience, his critics say--though only three \n     current members of the court had been judges before their \n     nominations. He is too young--though he is about the same age \n     as Judge Harry T. Edwards was when he was appointed and \n     several years older than Kenneth W. Starr was when he was \n     nominated. Mr. Estrada stonewalled the Judiciary Committee by \n     refusing to answer questions--though his answers were similar \n     in nature to those of previous nominees, including many \n     nominated by Democratic presidents. The administration \n     refused to turn over his Justice Department memos--though no \n     reasonable Congress ought to be seeking such material, as a \n     letter from all living former solicitors general attests. He \n     is not a real Hispanic and, by the way, he was nominated only \n     because he is Hispanic--two arguments as repugnant as they \n     are incoherent. Underlying it all is the fact that Democrats \n     don't want to put a conservative on the court.\n       Laurence H. Silberman, a senior judge on the court to which \n     Mr. Estrada aspires to serve, recently observed that under \n     the current standards being applied by the Senate, not one of \n     his colleagues could predictably secure confirmation. He's \n     right. To be sure, Republicans missed few opportunities to \n     play politics with President Clinton's nominees. But the \n     Estrada filibuster is a step beyond even those deplorable \n     games. For Democrats demand, as a condition of a vote, \n     answers to questions that no nominee should be forced to \n     address--and that nominees have not previously been forced to \n     address. If Mr. Estrada cannot get a vote, there will be no \n     reason for Republicans to allow the next David S. Tatel--a \n     distinguished liberal member of the court--to get one when a \n     Democrat someday again picks judges. Yet the D.C. Circuit--\n     and all courts, for that matter--would be all the poorer were \n     it composed entirely of people whose views challenged nobody.\n       Nor is the problem just Mr. Estrada. John G. Roberts Jr., \n     Mr. Bush's other nominee to the D.C. Circuit, has been \n     waiting nearly two years for a Judiciary Committee vote. \n     Nobody has raised a substantial argument against him. Indeed, \n     Mr. Roberts is among the most highly regarded appellate \n     lawyers in the city. Yet on Thursday, Democrats invoked a \n     procedural rule to block a committee vote anyway--just for \n     good measure. It's long past time to stop these games and \n     vote.\n\n  Mr. President, the Washington Post has shown the fallacy of all the \narguments that have been thrown out there against Mr. Estrada: Well, he \ndid not answer questions; well, he is too young; well, he is not \nHispanic enough.\n  Give me a break. This is ridiculous. This is a man who is one of the \nmost highly qualified appellate lawyers in America, who has a stellar \nacademic record, who has a stellar reputation in public life, who has \nstrong bipartisan support, and who cannot get a vote in the Senate \nbecause he is being filibustered.\n  This just is not right. It is time we call this what it is. It is a \nfilibuster. It is a change of the constitutional requirement for advice \nand consent from the Senate. It is a change of the Constitution without \nany procedure that is required to amend our Constitution. It is setting \na new standard that Democrats and Republicans before have always agreed \nwould never be done. When Democrats were in control, they did not \nfilibuster nominees or they did not allow filibusters of nominees by \nRepublicans, and Republicans are in control. And we are asking for the \nsame courtesy, the same tradition, and, in fact, the same respect for \nthe Constitution. The Constitution says advise and consent. When the \nConstitution requires more than a 51-vote margin or a simple majority, \nit so states. That is not the case in confirmation of judges, and it \nhas not happened before on a partisan basis. There was one bipartisan \nfilibuster. There has never been a partisan filibuster before.\n\n  There is no controversy about this nominee. There have been \ncontroversies before--controversies where you could legitimately see a \ndifference in qualifications or in background issues or in experience \nissues. None of that applies to this nominee.\n  I think it is time the Democrats state if there are real objections. \nFor instance, if there are more questions to be answered, have another \nhearing, or submit the questions in writing and let Miguel Estrada have \na chance to answer these questions. Miguel Estrada has offered to go \nand visit with many Democrats who have not found the time to be able to \nsee him. Yet we can't get a vote in the Senate on this distinguished \nnominee.\n  Let me read an article by Rick Martinez from the Raleigh News & \nObserver:\n\n       Once again, a minority is being denied a vote. Democrats in \n     the U.S. Senate have threatened a filibuster to block the \n     confirmation of Hispanic Miguel Estrada, nominated by \n     President Bush to the federal Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     circuit.\n       If Estrada were applying to the University of Michigan law \n     school, Democrats, it seems, would support giving him 20 \n     points just for being Hispanic. Given the party's unqualified \n     support of affirmative action, why shouldn't it ante up to 10 \n     or 15 Senate votes for confirmation simply because of his \n     ethnicity? Goodness knows that Hispanics, now the nation's \n     largest ethnic group, are largely unrepresented in the \n     federal judiciary.\n       Democrats counter that their opposition is based on \n     Estrada's views and qualifications. If so, at what point \n     along the ladder from law student to the federal bench is \n     race no longer relevant?\n       For Democrats, it was when Estrada stepped on a rung they \n     viewed as conservative. Once that ideological line was \n     crossed, all the benefits of affirmative action--increased \n     representation, diversity of social experience, providing an \n     example for minority youth--no longer applied to the \n     Honduran-born lawyer.\n\n  Mr. Martinez says:\n\n       The whole Estrada tiff is the latest warning to Hispanics \n     that racial politics is about power, not equality. Hispanics \n     have been given fair warning that those who wander off their \n     pre-assigned ideological plantation will pay a heavy price. \n     Ethnic hit man, Rep. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, \n     unleashed an ugly personal attack on Estrada by questioning \n     his Hispanic heritage. To date not one Democratic leader has \n     taken Menendez to task for his unwarranted remarks. That they \n     came from a man with a Latin surname doesn't make them any \n     more legitimate or any less offensive than if they came from \n     Sen. Trent Lott.\n       Democrats, write this down. We Hispanics don't all look \n     alike, we don't all think alike, and God has yet to appoint \n     Menendez to pass judgment on our ethnicity. Ideology has \n     never been an ethnic prerequisite, and it shouldn't be for \n     one on the federal bench either.\n\n  There are approximately 50 editorials written throughout the country \nabout the qualifications of this man. This one written by Rick Martinez \nin Raleigh, NC, basically says there is a different standard for \nHispanics--that Hispanics are not a monolith and they shouldn't be \njudged as a monolith. In fact, Miguel Estrada is one of the most \nqualified people--not one of the most qualified Hispanics, one of the \nmost qualified people who--have ever been nominated for an appellate \ncourt in our country. He has the experience. He has the background. He \nhas the academic credentials. And he has a reputation that is sterling. \nYet we can't get a vote on Miguel Estrada.\n  I hope those who are refusing to allow a vote on Miguel Estrada will \nlisten to the League of United Latin American Citizens--LULAC--which \nhas come out strongly for this qualified man and that does not really \nunderstand why there is a different standard being set for him than is \nbeing set for other appellate court nominees.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation president, who represents 25,000 Hispanic American lawyers \nin the United States, endorsing Mr. Estrada, the National Association \nof Small Disadvantaged Businesses, which came out in\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\nstrong support of Mr. Estrada, and a bipartisan group of 14 former \ncolleagues in the Office of the Solicitor General at the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice who have come out foursquare for Miguel Estrada.\n  There is no legitimate reason being stated not to give Miguel Estrada \na vote. To say that he didn't answer questions, if legitimate--if they \nwould ask him questions and let him answer them, but they haven't. \nSaying he is too young is ridiculous; saying he is not Hispanic when he \ncame to our country from Honduras at the age of 17 speaking little \nEnglish--and he wanted a part of the American dream. But he didn't want \nit given to him; he wanted to earn it.\n  He worked his way into Columbia University and was a Phi Beta Kappa. \nHe worked his way into Harvard Law School and graduated magna cum \nlaude. He worked to get a partnership with a major law firm after being \na Supreme Court Justice clerk which is reserved for only the best \ngraduates of law schools in our country.\n  This man deserves a vote. He deserves the respect of the \nConstitution, and he is not getting it as we speak today. The \nConstitution says advise and consent. The Constitution says a \nmajority--not 60 votes out of 100 but a simple majority. It is what has \nalways been required for the President's nominees. That is the check \nand balance in our system.\n  I hope the Senate will do the right thing. If there are legitimate \nquestions, raise them. Let Mr. Estrada answer them. But this man \ndeserves a vote, and the Constitution deserves respect and adherence by \nthis body.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CRAPO). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask for permission to speak on behalf \nof Miguel Estrada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I am still new to this body having been \nhere less than 2 months at this point in my career in the Senate. After \nspending 8 years in the House of Representatives, I am still feeling my \nway through with respect to finding the microphone, and things like \nthat.\n  I am somewhat at a loss when it comes to the process through which we \nare now going. It is totally unlike any type of process that I \nexperienced in the House of Representatives because we don't confirm \njudges anywhere except in the Senate. I spent 26 years as a lawyer \nbefore being elected to the House of Representatives. In my 26 years as \na lawyer, I tried hundreds of cases, and on appeals dozens and dozens \nof cases, and I had a number of opportunities to appear before both \ntrial judges and appellate judges, on a variety of different issues.\n  At any one moment before an appellate court, you can pretty well look \nat a judge and tell whether or not that judge has done his homework on \nyour issue. You have a sense of whether or not he has the intellect to \ninterpret the issue and be very responsive to your argument. And if you \never find a judge who is not responsive, you can check his background, \nand you may find out that maybe he did not have the intellect to follow \nthe course of your argument.\n  So when I look at the background of Miguel Estrada and try to decide \nwhether or not, were I to appear as a lawyer before him, he would be \nthe type of individual to whom I could make an argument and have him \ninterpret that argument, even though it is on a very complex issue, I \nbelieve he would be. I have to tell you, his is one of the most unusual \nprofiles I have ever seen of any member of the bar, much less any \npotential member of the bench.\n  It is unusual not just because his is a true American dream story. It \nis unusual because this man, as a practicing lawyer in public service \nand in the private sector, has distinguished himself above all other \nlawyers with whom he has ever been associated.\n  He is a man who has distinguished himself by coming to the United \nStates, not speaking much, if any, English, and not only attending \nmajor universities, but graduating from those universities with high \nhonors: from Columbia University with an undergraduate degree, and \nHarvard Law School with a law degree.\n  At Harvard Law School he was a member of the editorial board of the \nLaw Review. And those of us who went to law school know there are only \na few Law Review editorial board members. I can still remember in my \nlaw school class those who were members of the law review. Out of my \nclass, of the 200 who started in law school, there were--I think about \nfive of them--who were members of the Law Review. So it is a very \ndistinct intellectual group of students who make the Law Review. And \nthe editors of the Law Review are the elite of those very few who are \ndesignated with law review status.\n  The intellectual background of this man is unquestioned. He does have \nthe capability of interpreting and deciphering any complex issue that \nmight be presented to him as a member of the appellate court bench.\n  So when I think about, again, appearing before a man with his type of \nbackground, to argue a complex case, I think it would be wonderful to \nknow you have somebody with the qualifications and the capability of \nMiguel Estrada to really listen to your argument and make the kind of \ndecision every lawyer wants to have made on his or her particular case.\n  One thing that confuses me about Miguel Estrada's nomination is, I \nwas told while I was in law school that I should join the American Bar \nAssociation as a student. And I did. I was a very active member of the \nAmerican Bar Association in my small, rural community in Georgia for \nall of the 26 years I practiced law.\n  The American Bar Association is a very well respected, very highly \nrecognized peer group within our profession. The American Bar \nAssociation was asked to review Mr. Estrada, as they review every other \njudicial nominee, and to make a recommendation to this body as to \nwhether or not he is qualified to be confirmed by this body to the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit Court. They came back and said: Not only \nis he qualified, not only does he possess the academic and intellectual \nand legal background to serve on the Circuit Court for the District of \nColumbia, but he is well qualified. We are giving him the highest \nrecommendation that lawyers can give to a lawyer who seeks confirmation \nto any court.\n\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have already seen that we \nhave some judges who come through the committee who do not receive the \nhighest recommendation from the American Bar Association, but \nnevertheless get confirmed by this body. And they should, because \neverybody is not going to get that highest qualification recommendation \nfrom the American Bar Association.\n  But Mr. Estrada got the highest qualification from his peers--those \nmen and women who practice law with him, who talked to other lawyers \nwho practiced law with him, who know how he functions day in and day \nout in the practice of law, who know his temperament and his \ncapabilities as well as his ability to serve in the capacity of an \nappellate court judge. And for that body to come forward and say, we \nare going to give him the highest recommendation possible is just \nanother one of the assets he brings to this body from the standpoint of \nconfirming his nomination.\n  I was not here when Mr. Estrada had his hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee. That took place in September of last year when the committee \nwas controlled by the Democrats. At that point in time, from what I \nread in the record, Mr. Estrada appeared before the Judiciary Committee \nfor a full day's hearing. Every member of the Judiciary Committee had \nthe opportunity to ask Mr. Estrada any question they wanted to. And \nthey did.\n  There has been some question about whether or not he was totally \nforthcoming in his answers, whether he gave complete responses to the \nquestions that were asked of him. Well, in addition to having the \nopportunity to ask Mr. Estrada questions at the time of his hearing, \nwhether Mr. Leahy was chairman or now with Mr. Hatch as chairman, the \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee always have the opportunity to \nsubmit written questions in addition to those questions that are asked \nat the hearing.\n  If a Judiciary Committee member is not satisfied with answers to \nquestions he or she asked, he or she simply has the right to come back \nand say, I want\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\nyou to go into further detail with respect to this particular issue, to \ntell me whatever it is I want to have answered. Only two members of the \nJudiciary Committee came forward and said: We have additional questions \nwe want to ask. Those two were both Democrats. They had the right to do \nit. They did it. And I respect them for coming back with additional \nquestions when they felt they did not get totally complete answers. The \nfact of the matter is, though, those questions were answered \nimmediately by Mr. Estrada.\n  So for somebody to come forward now on the other side of the aisle \nand say, we do not think he fully answered our questions, where were \nthey? Where were they at the time of the hearing? Why didn't they come \nforward after the hearing if they were not satisfied at the hearing and \nsubmit additional written questions?\n  To come to this body now and to say Mr. Estrada was not totally \nforthcoming at the time of the hearing just shows this particular \nnomination has dipped itself into the depths of political partisanship. \nAnd it is not right.\n  I am biased. I am a lawyer. I think I am a member of the greatest \nprofession that exists in the United States of America. I think we have \na great judicial system because even though a lot of people throw rocks \nat our system--and I myself even have criticized it from time to time--\nwe have the best system in the world. We have the best system in the \nworld because it works. And people of all walks and backgrounds have \nthe opportunity to have their cases heard by a judge, whether it is Mr. \nEstrada or a magistrate court judge in Colquitt County, GA. People have \nthe right to have their cases heard.\n  And now, for somebody to come forward and say, I asked this guy a \nquestion, and he did not really answer my question, therefore, I am \ngoing to vote against him, I think just throws another rock at our \njudicial system that should not be thrown.\n  Referring, again, to Mr. Estrada's qualifications being called into \nquestion, this is an issue that has been batted back and forth between \npolitical parties. I have listened to an extensive amount of the debate \nover the past 2 or 3 weeks, both as Presiding Officer as well as on and \noff the floor. I have listened to my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle raise issues relative to Mr. Estrada. In talking about \nqualifications of anybody to go to the bench, particularly the circuit \ncourt versus the district court, you can look at an individual lawyer \nand say, this man or this woman has appeared before the highest court \nin the land, the Supreme Court, not once, not twice, not 3 times, but \n15 times to argue cases, and he has distinguished himself very well in \nthose 15 arguments. As we all know, sometimes you are on the winning \nside and sometimes you are on the losing side, but 10 out of the 15 \ntimes that Mr. Estrada has been to the U.S. Supreme Court, irrespective \nof whether he was on the appellate side, which is the losing side going \nin, or whether he was on the appellee's side, the winning side going \nin, he has prevailed at the end of the day. So for a guy to argue 15 \ntimes before the U.S. Supreme Court and to win 10 of them is a very \ndistinguishable record.\n  The fact that he even argued cases before the Supreme Court very \nhonestly puts him in a category of lawyers that is the most highly \nrespected group of lawyers that exists in the United States today. \nThere are just not many folks who have the opportunity to argue a case \nbefore the Supreme Court. Here we have a man who has argued 15 cases \nbefore them.\n  Another argument I have heard time and time again is that we should \nbe able to see the memos that he submitted to his boss while he was \nassistant to the Solicitor General. Some believe we should be able to \nsee what was in his mind from a legal perspective, and use those memos \nto try to determine whether or not he has the judicial qualifications \nand temperament to serve as a member of the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Let me tell you what that is like. As a practicing lawyer, if I have \nsomebody come into my office and I interview them and take notes and I \nthen take their case and go into my law library and do extensive \nresearch on the issue for my client to make sure that I am well \nprepared from a legal precedent standpoint and I then write a \nmemorandum, which I have put in my file to make sure that at the \nappropriate time--when the case either comes to a hearing or I have an \nargument with opposing counsel--that memorandum is personal and \nprivileged to me and my client.\n  What the Democrats have asked for is, to view the collateral memos \nthat were prepared by Mr. Estrada for his boss, the Solicitor General, \nwhile he was working in the Clinton administration and while he was \nworking in the Bush 41 administration. That is wrong. They should not \nask for it in the first place, but the Justice Department is absolutely \nright in refusing to produce them. They should not produce those memos \nbecause those memos are personal. They are private. They are \nprivileged.\n  Every lawyer in the country ought to be outraged that the Justice \nDepartment is even being asked for those memoranda to be presented to \nthis body for review when they were prepared in a private setting, in a \nsetting in which there was a lawyer-client relationship in existence. \nThose types of memos have never been allowed to be offered into court \nfor proof of any issue, and they should not be required to be presented \nhere in this body.\n  Speaking of politics being involved here, again, as a new Member of \nthis body and a new member of the Judiciary Committee, I am having a \nlittle trouble understanding the politics of this issue. I could \nunderstand it if Mr. Estrada has been a lifelong Republican, had the \ntattoo of an elephant on him and was a known advocate or radical that \nheld forth extreme positions. I could understand the politics involved \nin seeking to block this man by the folks on the other side of the \naisle.\n\n  But that is not the case. Here we have a man who came to the United \nStates speaking little or no English, a man who went to two of the \nfinest schools in America not known for their conservative-leaning \nstudents or faculty, Columbia University and Harvard. I don't know \nwhere they lean, but they are certainly not conservative-leaning \nuniversities.\n  That is his background. He comes from an administration that was not \na conservative-leaning administration, the Clinton administration. He \nworked for 4 years in that administration. He worked for the Solicitor \nGeneral in the first Bush administration for a year and then the \nClinton administration for 4 years. There is nothing to indicate that \nthis man would have an off-the-wall conservative-leaning philosophy.\n  I do not understand the politics of somebody coming up and saying: \nWell, we think he may be too conservative or he may be radical.\n  Those kinds of statements were made within the Judiciary Committee, \nand there is simply no basis for them.\n  The fact is, every Solicitor General who lives today who has worked \nfor any administration, whether it is Republican or Democratic, has \ncome forward and signed a letter saying, No. 1, the privileged \nmemoranda sought to be produced from the Justice Department should not \nbe produced because they will compromise future administrations. They \nnever should be produced. And No. 2, they recommend Mr. Estrada for \nconfirmation by this body.\n  When somebody in that position makes a statement, it takes it totally \nout of the realm of politics and puts it in the realm of \nprofessionalism, which is where it ought to be. We ought to have good, \nquality, competent men and women going to the bench.\n  As a Member of the House of Representatives during the Clinton \nadministration, I had a good friend who was nominated to the District \nCourt for the Northern District of Georgia. She is a good lawyer. She \nwas a really outstanding U.S. attorney. She is not a Republican, but I \nthought she ought to be put on the district court. She was, in fact, \nappointed, and she was confirmed by this body because she was a good \nlawyer. She was the type of person who ought to be on the bench.\n  The same thing holds true for Mr. Estrada. All you have to do is look \nat his record. It is pretty easy to tell that he is a good lawyer. When \nyou talk to other lawyers about him, I promise you, in the legal \nprofession, you know very quickly whether or not somebody is well \nrespected and well thought of.\n  Mr. Estrada has the respect of his colleagues. We have searched high \nand\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\nlow. If anybody has anything negative to say about Mr. Estrada, it has \ncome forward. Only one coworker who he worked with over the years has \nhad anything negative to say about Mr. Estrada.\n  Do you know what is unusual about that? That same individual, who was \nhis supervisor in the Office of Solicitor General during the Clinton \nyears, gave him a rating on two different years. That review rating \nthat was given to Mr. Estrada was ``outstanding'' by this particular \nindividual who is now the only member of the Solicitor General's \nOffice, or any other place where Mr. Estrada was employed, who has had \nanything whatsoever, to say in a negative capacity regarding Mr. \nEstrada.\n  So whether it is people he worked for, whether you look at his \nqualifications from an educational standpoint, vis-a-vis an \nintellectual standpoint, whether it is the Hispanic community that you \nlook to for a recommendation on Mr. Estrada--everywhere you look, he \ngets nothing but the highest marks, the absolute highest marks.\n  One other area in which I think Mr. Estrada has really excelled is \nwith respect to what we in the legal community refer to as pro bono \nwork. Pro bono work is done different ways in different parts of the \nworld. In my part of Georgia, a practicing lawyer does pro bono work \nwhen he or she takes appointed criminal cases usually. Occasionally, \nyou will represent an individual in a civil matter and you don't get \npaid for it. That is what we talk about as a pro bono type case. Mr. \nEstrada has been very active in the world of pro bono service. In fact, \nhe handled one case that was a death row inmate case, which is not the \nnormal type of case that a lawyer of Mr. Estrada's background would \nhandle. But he took the case and, obviously, he did the work necessary \nto fully, totally, and very professionally represent his client, \nbecause he spent almost 400 hours in research and preparation for \nrepresenting this individual--a death row inmate's case.\n  For a man to spend 400 hours--I don't know what his billable rate is, \nbut even at my billable rate in rural Georgia, that would have been an \nawful lot of money that Mr. Estrada sacrificed for the sake of making \nsure this death row inmate had more than adequate representation. In \nfact, with Mr. Estrada, the death row inmate was represented by an \noutstanding lawyer who had the capability--and I am absolutely certain \nhe did--to do everything necessary to fully and totally represent his \nclient.\n  Now, one final criticism of Mr. Estrada is that he has no judicial \nexperience. Well, I don't buy this argument. In fact, I think, if \nanything, it may be to his advantage. Having judicial experience \nsometimes, I think, could be even a negative factor, although in a case \nwhere you had somebody as qualified as Mr. Estrada, it would not make \nany difference one way or the other. But you have an individual here \nwho has legal experience. That is what is important. He has legal \nexperience in being able to work on complex cases, and most of the \ntime, cases that come before the circuit court are complex cases. Mr. \nEstrada has the ability to deal with those complex cases because he has \nhandled them for years and years as a practicing attorney in the public \nand private sectors. He has the type of background that lends itself to \nbeing able to deal with those complex cases and make a rational, \nreasonable interpretation of the Constitution, which every judge is \nexpected to do and which is exactly what Mr. Estrada said he would do \nat his hearing in September before the Judiciary Committee.\n  I close by saying there have been 57 newspaper editorials I have seen \nrelative to the nomination of Mr. Estrada and the treatment of his \nnomination on the floor of the Senate. Of the 57 editorials that have \nappeared in newspapers all across America, 50 have been favorable \ntoward Mr. Estrada. One of those editorials appeared in a newspaper in \nmy home State, in Atlanta, GA. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote \nan editorial--about 3 weeks ago now--that was complimentary to Mr. \nEstrada and critical of the Senate for not moving on his nomination.\n  Let me tell you, when it comes to politics, the Atlanta Journal-\nConstitution is not on one side most of the time; they are on one side \nall of the time. I have never received, in my political career, the \nendorsement of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, except for the one \ntime when I did not have an opponent and I guess they had to endorse \nme. To say that they are in any way leaning toward the conservative \nside on any issue would be outlandish. But even the Atlanta Journal-\nConstitution came out and said this is wrong.\n\n  This man is a good and decent man. He has the intellect and \nbackground to serve on the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia \nCourt of Appeals, and he should be confirmed. That line has been \nrepeated by newspapers in America day in and day out for the last \nseveral months.\n  The Augusta newspaper, also in my State, wrote a glowing editorial \nalso recommending that this body confirm the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  I think, without question, that the right arguments have been made in \nsupport of Mr. Estrada. Just in winding down--I see my friend from \nNevada here, and I don't know whether he wants time or not--I want to \nsay that, from the standpoint of support from the Hispanic community, \nthere has been overwhelming support from every aspect of the Hispanic \ncommunity. When you look at the League of United Latin American \nCitizens--that is what we call LULAC--which is the Nation's oldest and \nlargest Hispanic civil rights organization, the president of that \norganization, Mr. Rick Dovalina, wrote a letter, and this is what he \nsaid about Mr. Estrada:\n\n       On behalf of the League of United Latin American Citizens, \n     the nation's oldest and largest Hispanic civil rights \n     organization, I write to express our strong support for the \n     confirmation of Mr. Miguel A. Estrada. . . . Few Hispanic \n     attorneys have as strong educational credentials as Mr. \n     Estrada who graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from \n     Columbia and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where \n     he was editor of the Harvard Law Review. He also served as a \n     law clerk to the Honorable Anthony M. Kennedy in the U.S. \n     Supreme Court, making him one of a handful of Hispanic \n     attorneys to have had this opportunity. He is truly one of \n     the rising stars in the Hispanic community and a role model \n     for our youth.\n\n  The Hispanic National Bar Association president, Rafael A. Santiago, \nstated as follows:\n\n       The Hispanic National Bar Association, national voice of \n     over 25,000 Hispanic lawyers in the United States, issues its \n     endorsement. . . . Mr. Estrada's confirmation will break new \n     ground for Hispanics in the judiciary. The time has come to \n     move on Mr. Estrada's nomination. I urge the Senate Committee \n     on the Judiciary to schedule a hearing on Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination and the U.S. Senate to bring this highly qualified \n     nominee to a vote, said Rafael A. Santiago, of Hartford, \n     Connecticut, National President of the Hispanic National Bar \n     Association.\n\n  So this man has the qualifications. He has the educational \nbackground. He has the legal background. He has the intellect. He has \nthe support of Democrats. He has the support of Republicans. He has the \nsupport of liberals. He has the support of conservatives. He has the \nsupport of the Hispanic community. The only support he is lacking to \nbring this nomination to a vote on the floor of the Senate is the \nsupport from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Not allowing this nomination to come to the floor for a vote is not \nfair, it is not judicially just. It is not just in any way from an \nethical, moral, or judicial standpoint.\n  Mr. Estrada's nomination has been debated back and forth now for, \ngosh, going on 3 weeks. I guess 3 weeks starting tomorrow--a total of 4 \nweeks. We were here 2 weeks, we were out 1 week, and now we are back. \nSo I guess it is a total of 4 weeks. We have a lot of business that \nneeds to be brought before this body. We have a jobs growth package \nthat needs to be debated and passed that the President has put forth. \nWe have the impending conflict with Iraq and the continuing war on \nterrorism that needs to be dealt with on the floor of this body. We \nneed to move to other business.\n  We need the folks on the other side of the aisle to come forward and \nsay: OK, we will give you a vote. We do not think he is qualified, but \nwe are willing to give Mr. Estrada a vote. That is the right thing to \ndo, that is the just thing to do, and that is the judicial thing to do. \nIf they want to vote against him, vote against him, but if we want to \nvote for him, we ought to have the opportunity to vote for him. We \nought\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\nnot require 60 votes. We ought to require 51 votes, as I think our \nConstitution requires, and we ought to bring the name of Miguel Estrada \nto the floor of the Senate and have a vote.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Massachusetts yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Georgia just \nstated that there is a lot of business this Senate has to do and that \nwe should get off the Estrada nomination and get on to these other \nmatters. The Senator from Massachusetts, I am sure, agrees with my \nfriend from Georgia that we have a lot of business to do.\n  I know from having worked with the Senator from Massachusetts over \nthe years--and I ask the Senator if he will acknowledge this--there is \nbusiness we need to do that we have been prevented from doing. For \nexample, something we have not heard a word about is the minimum wage. \nPeople in Nevada are desperate. We have a service industry. Sixty \npercent of the people in Nevada who receive the minimum wage are women; \nfor 40 percent of those women, that is the only money they get for the \nfamilies. That would be a good issue to take up--minimum wage--doesn't \nthe Senator from Massachusetts agree?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is entirely correct. I was listening to my \nnew friend from Georgia talking about the business that needs to be \ndone. As the Senator remembers very well, our leader, Senator Daschle, \ntried to bring before the Senate an economic stimulus program that \nwould have provided assistance to working middle-income families. It \nwould have provided assistance to small business. It would have \nprovided funding for education and the programs for which the \nGovernors, Republicans and Democrats alike, indicated support. It would \nhave provided additional assistance to the States to meet their \nMedicaid challenges. I hope to get to that in a moment. And it would \nhave permitted funding in transportation. This would have made an \nimportant difference in trying to restore our economy.\n\n  The Senator, as part of the leadership, is familiar with the fact \nthat Senator Daschle was prepared to bring that up and start that \ndebate, but there was objection from the other side.\n  The Senator brings up the issue of minimum wage, and he knows how \nstrongly I feel about an increase in the minimum wage which Republicans \nhave denied us the opportunity to have. As the Senator has pointed out, \nmore than 60 percent of those who are minimum wage recipients are \nwomen. So this is a women's issue. Of the women who receive the minimum \nwage, a majority of them have children, so it is a children's issue. It \nis a women's issue and it is a children's issue. Since a great number \nof those who receive minimum wage are men and women of color, it is a \ncivil rights issue. It is a women's issue, a children's issue, a civil \nrights issue, and, most of all, it is a fairness issue because most \nAmericans think that if someone works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the \nyear, they should not live in poverty.\n  The great majority of Americans feel that way. We want to put that \nbefore the Senate and Republicans refuse to let us have a vote on that \nissue. We have been battling that issue not just for 10 days, not just \nfor 2 weeks, but we have been battling that issue for the last 5 years.\n  I agree with the Senator when he says we have been trying to get \nmatters before the Senate. We could bring up minimum wage. I am quite \nprepared as the principal sponsor--it is not a complicated issue. We \nhave debated that issue time in and time out, year in and year out. It \nis not a complicated issue. We ought to be able to have debate and an \nup-or-down vote on that issue.\n  I think of all these statements of let the majority have a ruling on \nthis nomination. Does the Senator remember as I do when we voted on a \nprescription drug program and a majority in the Senate was for the \nproposal of Senator Graham of Florida and Senator Miller, of which I \nwas proud to be a cosponsor? That would have provided a comprehensive \nprescription drug program for all who needed it in the United States. \nWe had 52 Members, a clear majority, for a prescription drug program, \nthe third leg of the Medicare stool on which our seniors rely: \nhospitalization, physician care, prescription drugs. We had the 52 \nvotes, and do you think we were permitted to have a vote in the Senate? \nNo, our Republicans objected to that. How short is their memory.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware that this extended debate deals with \nthe job of one person, a man by the name of Miguel Estrada. It is not \nas if he is not working. Does the Senator agree he is partner in one of \nthe most prestigious law firms in America and pulling down hundreds of \nthousands of dollars a year? I say to my friend from Massachusetts, \nshould not the Senate be more concerned about the millions of people \nwho are underemployed, the millions of people who are unemployed, the \npeople who are lacking health care--44 million people with no health \ncare--and many people who are underinsured? Should not the Senate be \ndealing with those people rather than one person who is employed making \nhundreds of thousands of dollars a year?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Nevada, I think \nhe makes the case. It is such a compelling, overwhelming, rational case \nhe makes about what is happening across this country. I know it is \ntrue, when the Senator from Nevada speaks about those who are \nunemployed, those who are underemployed, he is speaking for the people \nof Massachusetts. That statement the Senator just made is of central \nconcern to the families in my State who are seeing now the highest \nunemployment in some 10 years, and the prospects are difficult, as \npeople look down the road.\n  It was not always this way. We have seen it was not. I ask my \ncolleague and friend, so many on the other side throw up their hands \nand say: It is the economic cycles. Is it not true that the longest \nperiods of economic growth and price stability have been under \nDemocratic Presidents? We had it over the last 8 years under President \nClinton. That was not an accident. The time before that was in the \nearly 1960s under President Kennedy. The longest periods of economic \ngrowth, price stability, and full employment were under Democrats. That \nis the record. That is the history.\n  We want to get back to a sound economic policy. A sound economic \npolicy means creating jobs and having price stability, and the Senator \nunderstands this very clearly. Our minority leader, Senator Daschle \ndoes, and that is what we hope to resume with an effective economic \nprogram that can make a difference to families across this country.\n  The Senator from Nevada being a leader in this body, I am interested \nin whether the Senator agrees with me that the people in his State, as \nwell as mine--I know I speak for all of New England on this. People are \nconcerned, deeply concerned, about their economic future and they are \nconcerned, obviously, about their security, the dangers which all of us \nare familiar with in terms of terrorist activities. In my State, they \nare concerned about their sons and daughters, especially if they are in \nthe Reserve or the National Guard. We now have the highest calling up \nof the Reserves and the Guard since World War II. Communities are \nparticularly concerned because more often than not, people who are \nbeing called up are those who have also been trained as auxiliary \nfirefighters, police officers, or first responders in the medical \nprofessions.\n\n  What I hear the Senator from Nevada saying is we should try to \nrespond to these kinds of anxieties. The leaders have provided a \nprogram which has galvanized many of our Members--all of the Members on \nour side--and his point is that as leaders in our party we should be \nfocused on that program.\n  I was listening to my friend from Georgia talking about the attitude \nof some Hispanic leaders. I have a letter from 15 past presidents of \nthe Hispanic National Bar: We, the undersigned past presidents, write \nin strong opposition to the nomination of Miguel Estrada for a judge on \nthe Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. I\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\nwill later come back to the statement they made.\n  Despite the pressure from our Senate Republicans and the White House \nto abandon our principles and our obligations, the Senate Democrats \nintend to abide by our constitutional duty to provide advice and \nconsent in the judicial confirmation process. The White House, however, \ncontinues to refuse to give us the information necessary for our \nconsideration of the nomination of Miguel Estrada. The White House is \nasking the Senate to rubberstamp its judicial nominees when those \nnominees will have enormous power over the lives of the people we \nserve. If we confirm nominees to a lifetime appointment to the Federal \nbench without looking into their record, we would open the door for the \nWhite House to roll back civil rights, workers' rights, and important \nenvironmental protections, along with many other Federal rights we have \nworked so hard to develop.\n  The danger involving the DC Circuit is even greater, because that \ncourt has exclusive jurisdiction over so many issues that affect all \nAmericans. Since the Supreme Court hears relatively few cases in these \nareas, the DC Circuit is often the court of last resort for individuals \nto obtain the justice they deserve. If Mr. Estrada is confirmed, he \nwill be called upon to decide many of these cases. Often, individuals \nhave been victimized unfairly and in a manner not envisioned by the \nConstitution. They have come to the Federal courts for protection and \nrelief. In doing so, they have changed America. They have made this \ncountry a stronger, better, and fairer land. They helped America \nfulfill its promise of equal opportunity, equal rights, and equal \njustice under the law. They have given real meaning in people's lives \nto the great principles of the Constitution and the many laws Congress \nhas enacted over the years to protect these basic rights.\n  When we consider the nomination of Mr. Estrada, we need to understand \nthe crucial importance of these cases and how the rights of so many \nothers can be decided by a single case. These cases would not \nnecessarily have turned out the way they did if we did not have Federal \njudges who are acutely aware of the rights and the needs of the most \nvulnerable Americans, and how their rulings affect so many people's \nlives.\n  Would Mr. Estrada be such a judge? Would he have this strong sense of \njustice of the needs of people he would serve? We do not know because \nwe have been prevented from learning about this nominee, and the White \nHouse is trying to keep it that way.\n\n  Our response is clear. We will not confirm Mr. Estrada unless we know \nwhat kind of jurist he would be. Our constitutional responsibility \nrequires no less.\n  Let me describe a few of the landmark cases the judges of the DC \nCircuit have decided. In Barnes v. Costle in 1977, the DC Circuit was \nfaced with a situation that was and still is far too common in the \nAmerican workplace. Paulette Barnes had been hired by the Environmental \nProtection Agency, but she quickly discovered she would not be able to \ndo her work effectively. Her male supervisor repeatedly asked her to \njoin him after work for social activities. She politely declined. He \nthen made repeated sexual remarks and propositions to her. She refused. \nBut her supervisor would not be deterred. He kept harassing her and \neven tried to convince her his behavior was common. Ms. Barnes could \nnot escape these overtures and the unfair pressure she faced, because \nher job required her to work with her boss.\n  After she repeatedly refused to have an affair, he started to \nretaliate against her. He belittled her work. He took away many of her \nresponsibilities. He harassed her continuously. Finally, he had her \nfired because she refused to go along with his demands.\n  Ms. Barnes sued her employer under title VII of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964. Congress passed this important legislation in order to end \nworkplace discrimination and open the doors to equal employment for all \nAmericans, but the EPA did not see it this way. Its lawyers argued when \nCongress enacted title VII, we did not intend sexual harassment to be \nincluded in the ban on sexual discrimination.\n  What Ms. Barnes faced was not discrimination, they said. She was not \nfired because she was a woman but because she refused to engage in \nsexual activities with her supervisor. Fortunately, the judges of the \nDC Circuit understood the importance of the case. They took time to \nlook into the record. They found our intent in passing title VII was to \ngive women and minorities equal rights in the workplace so everyone \nwould have a truly equal opportunity to succeed.\n  The judges agreed that so long as harassment of this kind was allowed \nto continue, women could not have equal rights in the workplace. They \nruled that allowing female workers to suffer harassment to keep their \njobs is a type of discrimination that has long relegated women to \nlower-level jobs and made it more difficult for them to have equal \nrights in the workplace.\n  The DC Circuit held that harassment of the type suffered by Ms. \nBarnes was illegal sex discrimination. If not for the judges of the DC \nCircuit, her case could have turned out very differently. Thus, the \nimportance of the DC Circuit.\n  In 2003, the outcome of Ms. Barnes' case would almost certainly be a \nforegone conclusion. We know today the kind of behavior she faced is \nunacceptable, but in Ms. Barnes' case the trial judge dismissed her \nsuit because he thought such harassment was not prohibited by title \nVII. That behavior was not unacceptable until the DC Circuit said it \nwas unacceptable.\n  Would Mr. Estrada be the type of judge to give the meaning we \nintended to our legislation? Would he protect the rights of women and \nminorities? Would he take the time to consider how his rulings will \naffect them? We do not know, because the White House does not want us \nto know.\n  In a second case in 1981, Bundy v. Jackson, the DC Circuit considered \nthe plight of another woman who had suffered severe harassment at work. \nSandra Bundy proved at trial that while she was employed by the \nDistrict of Columbia, she was repeatedly propositioned by some of her \nsupervisors and they made crude and offensive remarks to her. She \ncomplained to another supervisor, but he replied it was natural for the \nother men in the office to harass. He then began the same type of abuse \nand propositioned her several times. A coworker obtained her home phone \nnumber, which she had unlisted, and started calling to proposition her. \nThe facts in this case were so extreme and Ms. Bundy's situation was so \noppressive that the district judge in the case actually made a formal \nfinding that making of improper sexual advances to female employees was \nstandard operating procedure, a fact of life, a normal condition of \nemployment in her job. Miss Bundy began to complain more forcefully and \nher performance ratings began to suffer. She was denied a promotion and \ncontinued to endure anguish on the job.\n\n  When she took her case to court, the company admitted the harassment \nand argued it was legal. Can you believe that? The company admitted the \nharassment and argued it was legal. The company contended because Miss \nBundy had not been fired or demoted, she could not claim a violation of \ntitle VII. The DC Circuit rejected this argument, as it obviously \nshould have. The court held that the terms and conditions of employment \ninclude the psychological work environment. The court agreed that an \nemployer can oppress an employee with such offensive and damaging \nremarks that the oppression rises to the level of discrimination, even \nif the employer does not demote or fire the employee.\n  As in Barnes, the court in Bundy showed thoughtful and careful \nconsideration of what Congress intended to do for the American \nworkplace when it passed title VII.\n  The court also considered the precarious situation in which Miss \nBundy found herself and in which too many women often find themselves \ntoday. The court held unless Miss Bundy's rights were protected, many \nother workplaces could oppress and harass women in similar ways without \nany fear of legal repercussions. The DC Circuit held that title VII \nprotects all Americans from harassment at work, whether or not \nharassment includes a formal change in job description.\n  We cannot dismiss these examples merely as evidence that America has \nchanged since the 1970s and early 1980s. It was the courts such as the \nDC Circuit and opinions such as Barnes and\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\nBundy that made America change. The conclusion of these cases was not \nforegone. In both cases, the district judge had dismissed the claim, \nsaying that what the women had alleged was not a violation of title \nVII. It took the judges on the DC Circuit, with genuine respect for the \nrule of law, to give effect to what Congress intended when it passed \ntitle VII. The DC Circuit did more than uphold the law. It gave \npractical effect to the right of women to be free from sexual \nharassment in the workplace.\n  We can now look back at the employers' arguments and in those cases \nsay that they are preposterous. The sad truth, however, is that those \narguments did not become preposterous until the DC Circuit said they \nwere.\n  A third case to demonstrate the importance of this court is in \nFarmworker Justice Fund v. Brock. In 1987, the DC Circuit reviewed \nevidence developed over the course of many years that farm workers were \nbeing deprived of basic sanitation. The Department of Labor mandated \nthe availability of drinking water, hand-washing facilities, and \nbathroom facilities in many other workplaces, but the Department said \nprotections were not necessary for farm workers. The result was that \nmany farm workers worked long hours in the heat and Sun without \nadequate drinking water. They worked under unacceptable hygiene \nconditions, without bathroom facilities, and with no place to wash \ntheir hands. Infectious diseases often spread quickly among farm \nworkers.\n  Congress addressed this problem years before. The Occupational Safety \nand Health Act mandated that the Department issue rules on workplace \nconditions for farm workers but the Department disagreed. It thought \nthat improving the working conditions of these laborers was a low \npriority, and for years the Department refused to say when it would \neven consider a rule to protect these workers. The Department also \nargued that although there was clear evidence of unacceptable risk to \nthe health of farm workers, it would not promulgate a rule to end these \nconditions because the States were better able to do so. The DC Circuit \ncorrectly rejected that argument and brought safe and sanitary working \nconditions for farm workers across the country. The court held that the \nintent of Congress in passing OSHA was to limit the Department's \ndiscretion. The court ordered the Department to pass these regulations \nwithin a specific timeframe. The court said that workplace safety was \nprecisely a matter for the U.S. Department of Labor to address to \nensure safe conditions across the country. In deciding this case, the \nDC Circuit gave farm workers the protections they needed and ensured \nthat a generation of workers would grow up healthier and safer.\n\n  A fourth excellent example of the importance of the DC Circuit is \nLaffey v. Northwest Airlines. In that case, decided in 1976, the DC \nCircuit considered the disparate pay that Northwest Airlines offered \nits male and female employees. Even before that case, it was clear that \nunder the Equal Pay Act companies could not pay men and women different \nsalaries for doing the same job. The airline thought it could avoid \nthis requirement for its in-flight cabin attendants by creating two \nseparate job categories for men and women. The two categories had \nessentially the same duties but different names and very different pay \nand promotion opportunities.\n  Both men and women would seat passengers and ensure their safety \nduring the flight and both would deal with any medical problems that \narose during the flight. They would both serve food and clean up the \ncabin. But the airline would only hire women to be stewardesses, a \nclassification that meant being confined to domestic flights, while \nmale persons were assigned to international flights. Even on domestic \nflights, stewardesses had to work in the more crowded sections of the \nplane while men worked in first class. In fact, if there was any real \ndifference between the two jobs, it was that the women had the more \ndifficult assignment. Yet the men received up to 55 percent more for \ndoing essentially the same job.\n  The DC Circuit refused to allow the airline to design the jobs in a \nway that relegated women to low-paying positions with little chance of \npromotion. The court understood that when we passed the Equal Pay Act, \nCongress was not concerned with arbitrary technicalities. We were \nconcerned with protecting the lives and livelihood of real people.\n  The DC Circuit gave effect to this intent. It held that where two \nindividuals have jobs that are essentially identical because they have \nthe same duties and responsibilities, an employer cannot discriminate \nagainst one of them by paying them less.\n  A fifth example of this indispensable role of the court is the \nCalvert Cliffs Coordinating Committee in which the DC Circuit in 1971 \nconsidered the National Environmental Protection Act which requires \nFederal agencies to balance their activities with their impact on the \nenvironment. In passing the act, Congress asks large agencies for the \nfirst time to consider ways to protect the environment.\n  In a challenge to this requirement, the Atomic Energy Commission was \nsued to stop activities that were adversely affecting the environment. \nThe Commission said that it had taken environmental concerns into \naccount and thought that these concerns were outweighed by the need for \nnuclear testing. The DC Circuit held that under the act, the \nCommission, as all other Federal agencies, must take environmental \nconcerns seriously, must justify the burden that its activities would \nplace on the environment.\n\n  Our duty, the court said, is to see that important legislative \npurposes prevailing in the Halls of Congress are not lost or \nmisdirected in the vast hallways of the Federal bureaucracy. There is \nno better description of the unique demands on the DC Circuit. It has \nsole jurisdiction over many basic issues affecting the people of our \ncountry. The Senate needs to know that the judges of that court \nunderstand the enormous challenge of ensuring that the important \npolicies we seek to achieve are actually implemented under the laws we \npass.\n  In each of these examples, the DC Circuit has dealt with situations \nwhere real people face real problems in obtaining the justice they \ndeserve. The court responded, as the Constitution says that it should, \nfree from the pressures of politics. The DC Circuit respected the rule \nof law and applied it fairly.\n  Would Mr. Estrada continue this tradition? Or would he look for \nopportunities to limit or even roll back basic rights? We do not know \nbecause the White House insists on keeping the Senate and the country \nin the dark about this nomination. The fundamental rights of the \nAmerican people are too important to be entrusted to a person about \nwhom we know so little. Until we learn what kind of jurist Mr. Estrada \ncan be, the Senate should not confirm him.\n\n\n                         Medicare and Medicaid\n\n  Mr. President, a front page article in yesterday's New York Times \nshould be essential reading for every Member of the Senate and for \nevery American. It describes the Bush administration's stealth attack \non Medicare and Medicaid--an attack driven by an extreme right-wing \nagenda and by powerful special interests.\n\n  The administration is proposing unacceptable changes in the \nobligations of government to its citizens. Under the Bush plan, the \nNation's long-standing commitment to guarantee affordable health care \nto senior citizens, the poor, and the disabled would be broken. \nMedicare is a promise to the Nation's senior citizens, but for the \nadministration, it is just another profit center for HMOs and other \nprivate insurance plans. Medicaid is a health care safety net for poor \nchildren and their parents, the disabled, and low income elderly, but \nthe administration would shred that safety net to pay for tax cuts for \nthe rich and to push its right-wing agenda.\n  The promise of Medicare could not be clearer. It says, play by the \nrules, contribute to the system during your working years, and you will \nbe guaranteed affordable health care during your retirement years. For \nalmost half a century, Medicare has delivered on that promise. All of \nus want to improve Medicare, but the administration's version of \nimproving Medicare is to force senior citizens to give up their doctors \nand join HMOs. That is unacceptable to senior citizens and it should be \nunacceptable to the Congress. There is nothing wrong with\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\nMedicare that the administration's policy can fix.\n  The administration has a variety of rationalizations for its assault \non Medicare--and each of these rationalizations is wrong. Republicans \nhave never liked Medicare. They opposed it from the beginning and have \nnever stopped trying to undermine it. The Newt Gingrich Congress tried \nto destroy it a decade ago, but the American people rejected that \nstrategy, and President Clinton vetoed it. Now that Republicans control \nboth Houses of Congress and the Presidency, they are at it again. Their \nplan would say that no senior can get the Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage they need without joining an HMO.\n  It is no accident that the administration's scheme hinges on forcing \nsenior citizens into HMOs or other private insurance plans. Whether the \nissue is Medicare or the Patients' Bill of Rights, the administration \nstands with powerful special interests that seek higher profits and \nagainst patients who need medical care. If all senior citizens are \nforced to join an HMO, the revenues of that industry would increase \nmore than $2.5 trillion over the next decade. Those are high stakes. \nThere will be a big reward for HMOs and the insurance industry if the \nadministration succeeds. But there is an even greater loss for senior \ncitizens who have worked all their lives to earn their Medicare, and \nthat loss should be unacceptable to all of us. Senior citizens should \nnot be forced to give up the doctors they trust to get the prescription \ndrugs they need.\n  The Bush administration cloaks this plan in the language of \nreasonableness. They say that they just want to reduce Medicare's cost, \nso that it will be affordable when the baby boom generation retires. \nBut HMOs are a false prescription for saving money under Medicare.\n  Administrative costs under Medicare are just 2 percent. Ninety-eight \ncents of every Medicare dollar is spent on medical care for senior \ncitizens. By contrast, profit and administrative costs for Medicare \nHMOs average eighteen percent, leaving far less for the medical care \nthe plan is supposed to provide.\n  This chart is a pretty graphic reflection of this point. ``Private \ninsurance, a recipe for reduced benefits or higher premiums.''\n  These are the administrative costs and profits: under Medicare, 2 \npercent; under private insurance, 18 percent.\n  I ask the administration, how is spending more money on \nadministration and profit supposed to reduce Medicare costs?\n  In fact, Medicare has a better record of holding down costs than HMOs \nand private insurance. Since 1970, the cost per person of private \ninsurance has increased 40 percent more than Medicare. Last year, the \nper person cost of Medicare went up 5.2 percent, but private insurance \npremiums went up more than twice as fast 12.7 percent. Across the \ncountry, families are seeing their health premiums soar and their \nhealth coverage cut back. If the administration really thinks this is \nthe right prescription for Medicare, they should talk to working \nfamilies in any community in America.\n  This chart indicates that private insurance will not reduce Medicare \ncosts or improve its financial stability. It illustrates the increases \nin Medicare costs versus private insurance premiums: 5.2 percent under \nMedicare; 12.7 percent under private insurance.\n  The administration claims that drastic changes are needed because \nMedicare will become unaffordable as the ratio of active workers \nsupporting the program to the number of retirees declines. But analyses \nfrom the Urban Institute, using the projections of the Medicare \nTrustees, show that Medicare will actually be less burdensome for the \nnext generation of workers to support than it is for the current \ngeneration. Economic growth and productivity gains will raise incomes \nof workers by enough to more than offset both the change in the ratio \nof workers and the yearly increase in medical costs. In fact, the real \nproduct per worker--after Medicare is paid for--will increase from \n$66,000 to $101,000. The issue is priorities. For this administration, \nthe priority is making the powerful and wealthy still more powerful and \nwealthy--not assuring affordable health care for senior citizens.\n  This administration also claims that the changes it is proposing are \nintended to help senior citizens by giving them more choices. The real \nchoice that senior citizens want is the choice of the doctor and \nhospital that will give them the care they need--not the choice of an \nHMO that denies such care.\n  This chart, ``Senior citizens choose Medicare, not private insurance, \nshows the proportion of senior citizens choosing Medicare versus \nMedicare HMOs'': In 1999, 83 percent chose Medicare; 17 percent, HMOs; \nand in 2003, 89 percent, Medicare, while 11 percent, HMOs.\n  Seniors have a choice today and they choose Medicare. Even so, this \nadministration's proposal will say to seniors: if you want to receive \nthe prescription drug program, you will have to get it under an HMO.\n  Senior citizens who want it already have a choice of HMOs and private \ninsurance plans that offer alternatives to Medicare. But by and large, \nsenior citizens have rejected that choice. In 1999, 17 percent of \nsenior citizens chose an HMO. By 2003, only eleven percent chose one.\n  Congress enacted Medicare in 1965, because private insurance could \nnot and would not meet the needs of senior citizens. In 2003, private \ninsurance still won't meet their needs. Vast areas of the country have \nno private insurance alternative to Medicare. Two hundred thousand \nseniors will be dropped by HMOs this year, because the HMOs are not \nmaking enough profit. Last year, HMOs dropped half a million seniors. \nIn 2001, they dropped 900,000 seniors. Yet that is the system the \nadministration wants to force on senior citizens.\n  This chart shows the number of senior citizens that have effectively \nbeen dumped from Medicare HMO coverage. We find that in 2001, 934,000 \nseniors were dropped; in 2002, 536,000 dumped; in 2003, 215,000; in the \nyear 2000, 327,000; and 407,000 in 1999. HMOs have been dropping \nseniors who wanted voluntarily to be in the HMO system.\n  Under the Bush plan, states will have an incentive to cut back \ncoverage for those in need and spend the money that should go for \nhealth care on other projects.\n  The Child Health Insurance Program, CHIP, which now gives more than \nfive million children the chance for a healthy start in life will be \nabolished.\n  Millions of senior citizens will no longer be able to count on \nfederal nursing home quality standards to protect them if they are \nunable to remain in their own homes.\n  Spouses of senior citizens who need nursing home care will no longer \nbe guaranteed even a minimum amount of income and savings on which to \nlive.\n  We know that state budgets are in trouble because of the faltering \neconomy. The demands on Medicaid are greater than ever, as more \nfamilies lose their job and their health care. Instead of the money \nthat states need to maintain the Medicaid safety net, the Bush \nadministration gives states a license to shred it. Every day, this \nadministration makes it clearer that tax cuts to make the rich richer \nis a higher priority than health care for senior citizens, and low \nincome children, and the disabled. It's time for Congress and \nadministration to stand up for the priorities of the American people--\nnot the priorities of the wealthy and powerful.\n  Medicare and Medicaid are two of the most successful social programs \never enacted. It makes no sense for the administration to try to impose \nits harsh right wing agenda on programs that have done so much to bring \ngood health care and genuine health security to vast numbers of senior \ncitizens, low-income families and the disabled. The American people \nwill reject this misguided program and so should the Congress.\n  The administration is not in favor of real choices for the elderly. \nThey don't favor letting senior citizens choose their own doctor. They \ndon't favor a fair and unbiased choice between and HMO and Medicare. \nSenior citizens already have that. What the Bush administration favors \nis a Hobson's choice, where senior citizens are forced to choose \nbetween the doctor they trust and the prescription drugs they need. And \nthat is an unacceptable choice. The administration's plan for Medicare \nwill victimize 40 million senior citizens and the disabled on Medicare. \nI want to just draw the attention of the Members to this chart I have \nin the Chamber.\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\nThese are the Medicare HMOs. There are huge gaps for senior citizens, \nareas of the country with no Medicare+Choice plans. There are vast \nareas of the country, outlined in red, where they do not even have this \nprogram. And still, the administration wants to insist that seniors \nsubscribe to it.\n\n  Under the Bush plan, long-term Federal spending for health care for \nthe needy will be reduced under their new proposed block grant program \nfor Medicaid. That idea was proposed under then-Congressman Gingrich \nalmost a decade ago. Under the new program, long-term Federal funding \nfor health care for the needy will be reduced so that more money will \nbe available for tax cuts for the wealthy. Under the Bush plan, States \nwill have an incentive to cut back coverage for those in need and spend \nthe money that should go for health care on other projects.\n  The Child Health Insurance Program, the CHIP program, which now gives \nmore than 5 million children the chance for a healthy start in life, \nwill effectively be abolished.\n  Millions of senior citizens will no longer be able to count on the \nFederal nursing home quality standards to protect them if they are \nunable to remain in their own homes. I was here not many years ago when \nwe took days to debate the kinds of protections that we were going to \ngive to our seniors who were in nursing homes. The examples out there \nof the kinds of abuses that were taking place were shocking to all of \nus. So we passed rules and regulations. But under this particular \nproposal, the administration is recommending millions of seniors will \nno longer be able to count on Federal nursing home quality standards to \nprotect them if they are unable to remain in their homes. Spouses of \nsenior citizens who need nursing home care will no longer be guaranteed \neven a minimum amount of income or savings on which to live.\n  We know that State budgets are in trouble because of the faltering \neconomy. The demands on Medicaid are greater than ever as more families \nlose their jobs and their health care. Instead of the money that States \nneed to maintain the Medicaid safety net, the Bush administration gives \nStates a license to shred it.\n  Every day, this administration makes it clearer that tax cuts to make \nthe rich richer is a higher priority than health care for our senior \ncitizens and low-income children and the disabled. That is the bottom \nline: Every day, this administration makes it clearer that tax cuts to \nmake the rich richer is a higher priority than health care for our \nsenior citizens and low-income children and the disabled.\n  It is time for Congress and the administration to stand up for the \npriorities of the American people, not the priorities of the wealthy \nand the powerful.\n  Medicare and Medicaid are two of the most successful social programs \never enacted. It makes no sense for the administration to try to impose \nits harsh right-wing agenda on programs that have done so much to bring \ngood health care and genuine health security to vast numbers of senior \ncitizens, low-income families, and the disabled.\n  The American people will reject this misguided program, and so should \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to.\n  Mr. REID. I have listened on the floor and off the floor to the \nSenator's statement, and especially about Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n  I ask the Senator, we have heard now for 2 years from this \nadministration that the answer to the problems of the country are tax \ncuts, tax cuts, tax cuts. I ask the Senator--and I am confident of the \nanswer--if he is aware that the deficit this year will be the largest \nin the history of the world, about $500 billion if you do not mask it \nwith the Social Security surpluses?\n  Now, I am asking the Senator from Massachusetts, will the proposals \nby this administration in their tax cut proposal do anything to help \nthe people in Nevada and Massachusetts and the rest of the country who \nare desperate for help in regard to Medicare and Medicaid?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Absolutely not. And your observation goes right to the \nheart of the central issue that we have in the Senate; that this is a \nquestion of choices. It is a question of priorities. It is a question \nof choices, whether we are going to allow this emasculation of Medicare \nand Medicaid--especially when Medicaid looks after so many needy \nchildren. About one-half of the coverage is actually for poor children, \nalthough more than two-thirds of the expenditures are for the elderly \nand the disabled. But it looks after an enormous number of the poorest \nof children, and also after the frail elderly.\n  And the Medicare system, we guaranteed in 1965--I was here at that \ntime. I was here in 1964 when it was defeated. It was defeated in 1964, \nand then 8 months later it was proposed here on the floor of the Senate \nand it passed overwhelmingly. And 17 Senators who were against it in \n1964 supported it in 1965. The only intervening act during that period \nof time was an election--an election. Finally, our colleagues had gone \nback home and listened to the needs of our elderly people, the men and \nwomen who had fought in the World Wars, who brought this country out of \nthe Depression, who sacrificed for their children, who worked hard, \nplayed by the rules, and wanted some basic security during their senior \nyears from the dangers of health care costs.\n  We made a commitment. The Senator remembers. I have heard him speak \neloquently on it. And in that 1965 Medicare Act we guaranteed them \nhospitalization and we guaranteed them physician services, but we did \nnot guarantee prescription drugs because only 3 percent of even the \nprivate insurance carriers were carrying it at that time.\n  I ask the Senator whether he would agree with me that now \nprescription drugs are as indispensable, are as essential to the \nseniors in Nevada as hospitalization and physician visits? They are in \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nanswer the question of the Senator from Massachusetts without the \nSenator from Massachusetts losing the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Massachusetts, while the Senator \nwas serving in the Senate in those years, in the early 1960s and mid \n1960s, I was serving on the hospital board of Southern Nevada Memorial \nHospital, the largest hospital district in Nevada at that time. I was \nthere when Medicaid came into being.\n  Now, does the Senator realize--and I think he has heard me say this \nbefore; and I ask this in the form of a question, although I don't need \nto; I have the floor to answer the Senator's question--prior to \nMedicaid coming into being, that for that hospital of ours, that public \nhospital, 40 percent of the senior citizens who came into that hospital \nhad no health insurance?\n\n  And when we had people come into that hospital with, as I referred to \nthem then, an old person--I don't quite look at it the same now--they \nwould have to sign to be responsible for their mother, their father, \ntheir brother, their sister, whatever the case might be, that they \nwould pay that hospital bill. And if they did not pay, do you know what \nwe would do? We had a collection department. We would go out and sue \nthem for the money.\n  Now, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, the distinguished \nSenator, for virtually every senior who comes to the hospital--it does \nnot matter where they are in America--they have health insurance with \nMedicare.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. Medicare is an imperfect program, but it is a good program.\n  And I answer the question about pharmaceuticals, prescription drugs. \nWhen Medicare came into being, seniors did not need prescription drugs \nbecause we did not have the lifesaving drugs we have now. We did not \nhave the drugs that made people feel better. We did not have the drugs \nthat prevent disease. Now we have those.\n  I say to my friend from Massachusetts, rather than spending the time \nhere, as we are dealing with a man who has a job, Miguel Estrada, \nmaking hundreds of thousands of dollars a year--rather than dealing \nwith him, I would rather be dealing with people in Nevada who have no \nprescription drugs.\n  In America, the greatest power in the world, we have a medical \nprogram for senior citizens that does not have a prescription drug \nbenefit. That is embarrassing to us as a country. And\n\n[[Page S2657]]\n\nwhat are we doing here? We are debating whether a man should have a \njob.\n  We understand the rules. If they want to get off this, then let them \nfile cloture. If they want to get out of this, let them give us the \nmemos from the Solicitor's Office. Let him come and answer questions or \nlet them pull the nomination.\n  The reason they are not doing that is, they don't want to debate this \nstuff. Look at the chart the Senator has. Tax cuts of $1.8 trillion, \nwhat does that do to Medicare and Medicaid? I hope I have answered the \nSenator's question. A prescription drug benefit is a priority, and it \nhas to be a program more than just in name only.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his usual eloquence and passion.\n  Just to sum up two items, as we discussed earlier, we passed a \nprescription drug program. Fifty-two Members of the Senate did so last \nyear. I don't know why we couldn't debate it. I am sure our leader \nwould support that effort.\n  Finally, let me point out something the Senator has mentioned. This \nchart summarizes it all. Under the administration's program for the \nStates, over a 10-year period, Medicaid will be cut $2.4 billion, while \nthere will be $1.8 trillion in tax cuts.\n  This is a question of priorities. I went through the various charts \nthat reflected how this $2.4 billion Medicaid cut will be achieved \nversus the $1.8 trillion in tax cuts. This is a question of choice. \nThis is a question of priorities when it comes to the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs. The quicker we get the chance to debate these and \nget some votes on them, the better off our seniors will be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada has asked that we \nvote on Miguel Estrada. I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to a \nvote on Miguel Estrada now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator's request be modified \nin the following fashion: I ask unanimous consent that after the \nJustice Department finds the requested documents relevant to Mr. \nEstrada's government service, which were first requested in May of \n2001, the nominee then appear before the Judiciary Committee to answer \nthe questions which he failed to answer in his confirmation hearing and \nany additional questions that may arise from reviewing such documents.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I object and restate my unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. REID. To which I object. I object.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I just heard the Democrat leader come to \nthe floor to demand a vote on Miguel Estrada so we could move on to \nother important issues. He had the opportunity to have that vote, and \nhe objected. He wants to raise the issue of moving judges to a \nsupermajority vote, denying this man, Miguel Estrada, a vote on the \nfloor of the Senate under the constitutional clause of advice and \nconsent to the President.\n  Let me talk about that for a few moments. Before I talk about that, \nas the chairman of the Aging Committee who has spent countless hours, \nas has the Senator from Massachusetts, on the issue of Medicare, he and \nI would both agree that when Medicare was passed in 1965, some 33 years \nago, medicine was practiced much differently than it is now. Yet he is \nsaying we want Medicare just like it was, and we want to add a new \nprogram to it.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts well knows, when he voted for \nMedicare in 1965, it was expected to be about a 10, 20-billion-dollar-\nplus program. Today it is verging on a quarter of a trillion dollars, \nat least by the end of the decade, and it will potentially, by 2030, \nconsume a quarter of the U.S. Government's budget.\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts knows as well as I that the \nworld has changed and health care delivery has changed and that we are \nnot going to practice 33-year-old medicine on 2003 seniors. They don't \nexpect it. They don't want it. They demand change.\n  In that change comes prescription drugs as a reasonable and right \napproach. But as we offer that to America's seniors, let us offer them \na modernized, contemporary health care delivery system. Let us not lurk \nin the concept of a 33-year-old system that is now close to pushing us \nto deny services simply because it has become so costly and so \nbureaucratic. To deny them anything more than a modern health care \ndelivery system with prescription drugs in it is to deny them the \nobvious; that is, quality health care.\n  Those are the facts. Those are the statistics. We can certainly \ndebate those today. But we ought to be debating Miguel Estrada. The \nDemocrats want to debate him. They deny us the vote that he is entitled \nto have. So for a few moments today, I would like to visit about Miguel \nEstrada.\n  Before I do that, I found this most intriguing. This is a fascinating \nissue. We suggest that it is partisan, and it appears to be almost at \ntimes. Yet I noticed in the Record of today a few quotes from a \nDemocrat Senator. He said:\n\n       Mr. President, the court provides the foundation upon which \n     the institutions of government and our free society are \n     built. Their strength and legitimacy are derived from a long \n     tradition of Federal judges whose knowledge, integrity, and \n     impartiality are beyond reproach. The Senate is obligated, by \n     the Constitution and the public interest, to protect the \n     legitimacy and to ensure that the public's confidence in the \n     court system is justified and continues for many years to \n     come. As guardians of this trust, we must carefully \n     scrutinize the credentials and qualifications of every man \n     and woman nominated by the President to serve on the Federal \n     bench. The men and women we approve for these lifetime \n     appointments make important decisions each and every day \n     which impact the American people. Once on the bench, they may \n     be called upon to consider the extent of our rights to \n     personal privacy, our rights to free speech, or even a \n     criminal defendant's right to counsel. The importance of \n     these positions and their influence must not be dismissed. We \n     all have benefited from listening to the debate about \n     Miguel Estrada's qualifications to serve on the district \n     court. After reviewing Mr. Estrada's personal and \n     professional credentials, including personally \n     interviewing the nominee, I believe he is qualified to \n     serve on the district court, and I will vote for him.\n\n  That is Senator Nelson of Nebraska. That Senator wants a vote. I want \na vote. We owe Miguel Estrada a vote--not a supermajority vote, not an \neffort to change the rules of the Senate, not an effort to deny the \nconstitutional responsibility of this body that the other side is now \ndoing, tragically enough, for the politics of the business instead of \nthe substance of the issue. That is a tragedy that ought not be laid \nupon the floor of this Senate nor ought to come before what has been a \nresponsible process and very important procedure.\n  I have been out in my State for a week, as have many of my \ncolleagues. I say oftentimes to Idahoans: We watch the President. We \nsee him every night on television. We, Members of the Senate and the \nother body, make headlines and are often talked about in the press. But \nvery seldom does the third and equally important branch of Government, \nthe judicial branch, get the attention. There are no natural lobbyists \nin general. There is no influence out there urging and pushing that the \ncourts be treated responsibly, that these vacant positions be filled so \nthat courts can do their duty and responsibility under the Constitution \nand provide for fair judgment of those who might come before them.\n  That responsibility lies in the President of the United States and in \nthe Senate. We are the ones responsible for assuring that the courts \nare filled when those positions are vacant by appropriate people who \nhave great integrity, who have moral and ethical standards, and who \nbelieve in the Constitution of our country.\n  Miguel Estrada fails on none of those qualifications. Here today, for \nthe first time, Mr. Estrada is a target for a much larger hit; that is \nto suggest that a minority of the Senate could ultimately control the \nSupreme Court of the United States. I believe that is the battleground, \nwhile a lot of subterfuge may go on, smoke and mirrors, or diversion of \nattention; and I think most people who are now watching this debate are \nbeginning to understand there is something very strange about it.\n  There used to be an old advertisement on television asking, ``where's \nthe beef.'' Well, where's the issue here? Where is the substance of the \nissue, after the committee of jurisdiction, the Judiciary Committee, on \nwhich I serve, and on which the Senator from Massachusetts serves, very \nthoroughly went\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\nthrough the background of Miguel Estrada? He came out with high \nqualifications, having been reviewed by the ABA. Wherein lies the \nproblem--the simple problem of allowing this name and nomination to \ncome to the floor for a vote--a vote. I tendered that vote a few \nmoments ago by unanimous consent, to see it denied on the other side of \nthe aisle because they say you must have a super vote, a 60-plus vote. \nNo, we suggest the Constitution doesn't say that. We suggest that \nthreshold has never been required. So I think what is important here is \nthe reality of the debate and how we have handled it.\n  I have the great privilege of serving from the West, from the State \nof Idaho. There are a lot of traditions out there. One of the great \ntraditions is sitting around campfires, visiting, telling stories, and \ntalking about the past. Probably one of the most popular stories to \ntell in the dark of night in only the glow of the campfire is a good \nghost story. It scares the kids, and even the adults get a little \nnervous at times because their back side is dark and only their faces \nare illuminated. The imagination of the mind can go beyond what is \nreally intended. So great stories get told at the campfire.\n  I have listened to this debate only to think that great stories are \nattempting to be told here--or should I suggest that ghost stories are \nbeing proposed here--about Miguel Estrada. Why would we want to be \nsuggesting there is something about this man that is not known, that \nthere is not full disclosure on all of the issues? I suggest there is \nfull disclosure. The other side is deliberately obstructing a \nnomination that has been before the Senate for 21 months. In that 21 \nmonths, there were no ghost stories; nothing new was found, except the \nreality of the man himself--the reality of a really fascinating and \nvaluable record for the American public to know.\n  Their argument is that because they cannot find anything wrong with \nhim--no ghost stories--then there have to be bad things hidden. \nSomebody could not be quite as good as Miguel Estrada. Why not? There \nare a lot of people out there who achieve and are phenomenally \nsuccessful, morally and ethically sound, and well based, and who \nbelieve in our Constitution and are willing to interpret it in relation \nto the law and not to the politics of something that might drive them \npersonally.\n  I don't believe in activist judges on the courts. I don't believe \nthey get to go beyond the law or attempt to take us where those of us \nwho are lawmakers intend us not to go or where the Constitution itself \nwould suggest we do not go. So search as they may, they cannot find. \nAnd when they cannot find, they will obstruct. They have obstructed. \nWeek 1. We are now into week 2. My guess is we will be into week 3 or \n4. Hopefully, the American people are listening and understanding \nsomething is wrong on the floor of the Senate; something is wrong in \nthat there is an effort to change the Constitution of our country \nsimply by process and procedure--or shall I say the denying of that. I \nthink those are the issues at hand here. That is what is important.\n\n  Mr. President, there was nothing more in telling a ghost story than \nin the imagination that came to the mind. There is nothing wrong with \nMiguel Estrada, except in the imagination in the minds of the other \nside, who would like to find a story to tell. But they cannot find one, \ndig as they might. There have been 21 months of effort, 21 months of \ndenial. Why? Are we playing out Presidential politics on the floor of \nthe Senate this year? It is possible. I hope we don't have to go there, \nand we should not. These are issues that are much too important.\n  This President has done what he should do. It is his responsibility \nto find men and women of high quality and high integrity, who are well \neducated and well trained in the judicial process and system--search \nthem out and recommend them, nominate them to fill these judgeships. \nThat is what he has done. Now he is being denied that.\n  A difference of philosophy? Yes, sure. It is his right to choose \nthose he feels can best serve. He has found and has offered to us men \nand women of extremely high quality. Yet, at these higher court levels, \nand here in the district court, they are being denied.\n  Miguel Estrada has been under the microscope and nobody has found the \nproblem. On the contrary, we have found much to admire. At least let me \nspeak for myself. I have found much to admire in Miguel Estrada. By \nnow, I don't need to repeat his history. I don't need to repeat the \nstory of a young man coming to this country at 17 years of age, hardly \nable to speak English, who changed himself and the world around him, so \nthat he is now recognized by many as a phenomenal talent and a scholar. \nLet me just say I think he and his family should be very proud of his \nachievements. They should also be proud of his receiving the \nnomination. Of all the people, they surely do not deserve to have the \njudicial nomination process turned into some kind of gamut, in which \nyou run a person through and you throw mud at them, or you allege, or \nyou imply, or you search for the ultimate ghost story that doesn't \nexist, to damage their integrity, to damage the image and the value and \nquality of the person.\n  Senators are within their rights to oppose any judicial nominee on \nany basis they choose. In the last 8 years, when President Clinton was \nPresident, I voted for some of his judges; I voted against some of them \nbecause they didn't fit my criteria of what I thought would be a \nresponsible judge for the court. But I never stood on the floor and \ndenied a vote, obstructed a vote. I always thought it was important \nthat they be brought to the floor for a vote. Then we could debate them \nand they would either be confirmed or denied on a simple vote by a \nmajority of those present and voting. That is what our Constitution \nspeaks to. That is what our Founding Fathers intended. They didn't \nbelieve we should allow a minority of the people serving to deny the \nmajority the right to evaluate and confirm the nominations of a \nPresident to the judicial branch of our Government.\n  If they want to administer a particular litmus test, as one of our \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee has been advocating, that is \ntheir choice. If they simply do not like the way a nominee answered the \nquestions that were put to him, then they can vote against the nominee \nfor all of the reasons and the responsibilities of a Senator. But to \nsay they cannot vote because there is no information about the nominee, \nor because he has not answered their questions, or because critical \ninformation is being withheld, well, that is clearly a figment of their \nimagination. That is a ghost lurking somewhere in the mind of a \nSenator, because for 21 months, try as they might, that ghost, or that \nallegation, has not been found or fulfilled.\n  In the real world, there is an enormous record on this nominee, \nbigger than the records of most of the judiciary nominees who have been \nconfirmed by the Senate. In the real world, Mr. Estrada has answered \nquestion after question, just not always the way his opponents wished \nhe would answer them; not just exactly the way his opponents would wish \nhe had answered them, but he did answer them. In the real world, there \nis no smoking gun in the privileged documents that the opposition is \nunreasonably and inappropriately requesting.\n  There is something very familiar about the tactic being used against \nMiguel Estrada, and I finally realized what it was. This is the same \nobstructionism we have seen again and again from our friends on the \nother side, the same process that denied us the right to a budget, the \nright to appropriations for 12 long months. They could not even produce \na budget. So we brought it to the floor and in 4 weeks we finalized \nthat process.\n  For the last year and a half, we have lived with that issue of \nobstructionism, and today we are with it again. Now we are in our \nsecond week of denying an up-or-down vote. What is wrong with having an \nup-or-down vote? That is our responsibility. That is what we are \ncharged to do under the Constitution.\n  I believe that is the issue. Instead of fighting on policy grounds, \nthey are simply wanting to deny this issue to death. In the last \nCongress, as I mentioned, we had no budget, we saw an Energy Committee \nshut down because they would not allow that Energy Committee to write \nan energy bill, and they would not allow authorizing committees to \nfunction in a bipartisan way when they controlled the majority. Denial \nand obstruction is not a way to run a system. It is certainly not the \nway to operate the Senate.\n\n[[Page S2659]]\n\n  Now we have a personality. Now it is not an abstract concept. Now it \nis not a piece of a budget or a dollar and a cent, as important as \nthose issues are. We are talking about an individual who has served our \ncountry well, who has achieved at the highest levels, who is a man of \ntremendous integrity, and because he does not fit their philosophic \ntest, the litmus test of their philosophy as to those they want on the \ncourt, but he does achieve all of the recognition of all of those who \njudge those who go to the court on the standards by which we have \nalways assessed nominees to the judiciary system, that is not good \nenough anymore. The reason it is not good enough is because it is \nPresident George Bush who has made that nomination.\n  In the current Congress, that is an issue with which we should not \nhave to deal. We should be allowed to vote, and I hope that ultimately \nwe can, and certainly we will work very hard to allow that to happen. \nThat is what we ought to be allowed to offer: to come to the floor, \nhave an up-or-down vote on Miguel Estrada, debating for 1 week, \ndebating for 2 weeks, debating for 3 weeks, if we must, but ultimately \na vote by Senators doing what they are charged to do.\n  That is the most important step and, of course, that is the issue. Or \nis the issue changing the name of the game, changing or raising the \nbar, in this instance, to a higher level of vote, not for Miguel \nEstrada but for future votes, possibly a Supreme Court Justice? I do \nnot know what the strategy is, but there is a strategy.\n  It is undeniable because we have seen it day after day, time after \ntime. We watched it when they chaired the Judiciary Committee last \nyear. I now serve on the Judiciary Committee. I went there this year \nwith the purpose of trying to move judges through, trying to get done \nwhat is our responsibility to do, trying to fill the phenomenal number \nof vacancies. When there are vacancies in the court and caseloads are \nbuilding, that means somebody is being denied justice. We should not \nallow our judiciary system to become so politicized by the process that \nit cannot do what it is charged to do. Therein lies the issue. I \nbelieve it is an important issue for us, and it is one I hope we will \ndeal with if we have to continue to debate it.\n\n  Let me close with this other argument because I found this one most \ninteresting. They said: We are just rubberstamping George Bush's \nnominations. Have you ever used a rubberstamp? Have you ever picked up \na stamp, tapped it to an ink pad, tapped it to a piece of paper? That \nis called rubberstamping. My guess is it takes less than a minute, less \nthan a half a minute, less than a second to use a rubberstamp.\n  That is a false analogy. Twenty-one months does not a rubberstamp \nmake; 21 months of thorough examination, hours of examination by the \nAmerican Bar Association. I am not an attorney, but my colleague from \nNevada is. It used to be the highest rating possible that the American \nBar Association would give in rating the qualifications of a nominee. I \nused to say that rating was probably too liberal. Now I say it is a \nrespectable rating. Why? Because the bar on the other side has been \nraised well beyond that rating. Now we are litmus testing all kinds of \nphilosophical attitudes that the other side demands a nominee have, and \nif they say, We are simply going to enforce or carry out or interpret \nthe law against the Constitution, that is no longer good enough. \nRubberstamping? A 5-second process, a 2-second process, or a 21-month \nprocess? I suggest there is no rubberstamping here.\n  I suggest the Judiciary Committee, under the chairmanship of Pat \nLeahy, now under the chairmanship of Orrin Hatch, has done a thorough \njob of examining Miguel Estrada, who has a personal history that is \ninspiring, work achievement that is phenomenally impressive, a \ncompetence and a character that has won him testimonials from all of \nhis coworkers and friends, Democrats and Republicans, liberal and \nconservative.\n  As I mentioned, I am a new member of the Judiciary Committee. It is \nthe first time in 40 years that an Idahoan has served on that \ncommittee, and I am not a lawyer. So I look at these nominees \ndifferently than my colleagues who serve on that committee who are \nlawyers. But I understand records. I understand achievement. I \nunderstand integrity. I understand morals, ethics, and standards that \nare as high as Miguel Estrada's.\n  I am humbled in his presence that a man could achieve as much as he \nhas in as short a time as he has. I am angered--no, I guess one does \nnot get angry in this business. I am frustrated, extremely frustrated \nthat my colleagues on the other side would decide to play the game with \na human being of the quality of Miguel Estrada, to use him for a target \nfor another purpose, to use him in their game plan for politics in this \ncountry, to rub themselves up against the Constitution, to have the \nWashington Post say: Time's up. Enough is enough. To have newspaper \nafter newspaper across the country say: Democrats, you have gone too \nfar this time. Many are now saying that, and that is too bad to allow \nthat much partisan politics to enter the debate.\n  We all know that partisan politics will often enter debates, but it \ndoes not deny the process. It does not obstruct the process. It does \nnot destroy the process. Ultimately, the responsibility is to vote, and \nit is not a supermajority. The Senator from Nevada knows that, and the \nSenator from Idaho knows that. I could ask unanimous consent again that \nwe move to a vote on the nomination of Miguel Estrada, and the Senator \nwould stand up and say: I object.\n  That is how one gets to the vote on the floor of the Senate. After \nthe issue has been thoroughly considered, Senators ultimately move to a \nvote. That is my responsibility as a Senator. That is one that I will \nwork for in the coming days. That is one that many of my colleagues are \nworking for.\n  We will come to the floor, we will continue to debate the fine points \nof Miguel Estrada, but we will not raise the bar. We should not set a \nnew standard. In this instance, we should not allow a minority of \nSenators to deny the process because there is now a substantial \nmajority who would vote for Miguel Estrada because they, as I, have \nread his record, have listened to the debate, have thoroughly combed \nthrough all of the files to understand that we have a man of \nphenomenally high integrity who can serve this country well on the \nDistrict Court of Appeals that he has been nominated by President Bush \nto serve on.\n  Our responsibility is but one: to listen, to understand, to make a \njudgment, and to vote up or down on Miguel Estrada. So I ask the \nquestion, Is that what the other side will allow? Or are they going to \ncontinue to deny that? Are they going to continue to demand that a new \nstandard be set? The American people need to hear that. They need to \nunderstand what is going on on the floor of the Senate, and many are \nnow beginning to grasp that.\n  As newspapers talk about it, some in the Hispanic community are now \nconcerned that somehow this has become a racist issue. I do not think \nso. I hope not. It should not be. It must not be. Tragically, we are \ntalking about a fine man who is ready to serve this country and who is \nbeing caught up in the politics of the day, and that should not happen \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Before I got into politics, I was a rancher in Idaho, and I can vouch \nfor the fact that a lot of cowboy traditions are still alive and well \nin the Intermountain West. One of those great traditions is \nstorytelling--gathering around a campfire and telling ghost stories. \nSome of those stories can be pretty scary. But nobody really believes \nthem--certainly not adults, and not in the light of day.\n  I am reminded of that storytelling tradition of the West when I look \nback on the debate surrounding Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. District. The reason this debate reminds me of \nthose old ghost stories is that the opposition's arguments amount to \njust that: stories about imagined ghosts and monsters, told for the \npurpose of frightening people.\n  I have been serving in the Senate for better than a decade, and I \nhave seen a lot of filibusters about a lot of things, but this is the \nfirst time I have seen a filibuster over nothing--that's right: \nnothing. The other side is deliberately obstructing the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada because after 21 months they can find nothing wrong with \nthis nominee.\n  Their argument is that because they cannot find anything wrong with \nhim,\n\n[[Page S2660]]\n\nall the bad things must be hidden, and therefore they need more time \nfor their fishing expedition on this nomination. Only now, that fishing \nexpedition is going into documents that are privileged, and public \npolicy itself would be violated by breaking that privilege. That's not \njust my opinion--as we have heard again and again, it is the opinion of \nthe seven living former Solicitors General, both Democrat and \nRepublican.\n  With nothing to complain about, the opposition is trying to get us \nall to believe that there must be some terrible disqualifying \ninformation that is being withheld from the Senate. What that terrible \ninformation is, they leave us to imagine: maybe some writings that will \nreveal a monster who is going to ascend to the bench where he can rip \nthe Constitution to shreds and roll back civil liberties. Maybe \nsomething even worse.\n  These are nothing more than ghost stories, deliberately attempting to \nfrighten the American people and this Senate. It is time to shine the \nlight of day on this debate, time to realize there is no monster under \nthe bed.\n  And it is high time that the Democrat leadership put a stop to the \npolitics of character assassination that go along with all this \nstorytelling. It is outrageous to suggest that Miguel Estrada is hiding \nsomething, or being less than forthcoming with this Senate. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee had plenty of time over the last 21 months to find \nsome real problem with this nominee--but no such problem was found. The \nAmerican Bar Association reviewed him, found nothing wrong with him, \nand even gave him its highest rating--``well qualified.'' The Bush \nadministration looked into his record before sending up the nomination. \nAnd let's not forget that he worked for the previous administration, \ntoo, which not only hired him but gave him good reviews.\n  So Miguel Estrada has been under the microscope, and nobody has found \na problem with him. On the contrary, we have found much to admire--at \nleast, let me speak for myself--I have found much to admire about Mr. \nEstrada. By now, his story is pretty well known to anyone who follows \nthe daily news, let alone Senators who study the nominees who come \nbefore them, so I won't repeat it again. Let me just say that I think \nhe and his family should be very proud of his achievements. They should \nalso be proud of his receiving this nomination. And of all people, they \nsurely do not deserve to have the judicial nomination process turned \ninto some kind of grueling gauntlet through the mud being generated by \nthe opposition.\n\n  Senators are within their rights to oppose any judicial nominee on \nany basis they choose. If they want to administer a particular litmus \ntest, as one of our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee has been \nadvocating, that is their choice. If they simply do not like the way a \nnominee answered the questions that were put to him, then they can vote \nagainst that nominee for that reason.\n  But to say they cannot vote because there is no information about \nthis nominee, or because he has not answered their questions, or \nbecause critical information is being withheld--well, apparently they \ndo not live in the same world the rest of us do. Because in the real \nworld, there is an enormous record on this nominee--bigger than the \nrecords on most of the judicial nominees who have been confirmed by the \nSenate. In the real world, Mr. Estrada has answered question after \nquestion--just no always the way that his opponents wished he would \nhave answered. And in the real world, there is no smoking gun in the \nprivileged documents that the opposition is unreasonably and \ninappropriately requesting.\n  There is something very familiar about this tactic being used against \nMiguel Estrada, and I finally realized what it was: this is the same \nobstructionism that we have seen again and again from our friends on \nthe other side. Instead of fighting on policy grounds, they just \nobstruct and delay the issue to death. In the last Congress, we never \ngot a budget, we never got an energy bill--just more obstruction and \ndelay. And in this current Congress, instead of having an honest up-or-\ndown vote on this nominee, they filibuster about the past history of \njudicial nominees under former administrations.\n  Another of my colleagues revealed during this debate that \nobstructionism is a tactic out of a playbook for stopping President \nBush from getting his nominees to the higher courts--maybe not every \ncourt, but certainly the circuit courts and maybe someday the Supreme \nCourt. We have heard on this Senate floor about that playbook advising \nour Democrat colleagues to use the Senate rules to delay and obstruct \nnominees--first in committee and then on the Senate floor.\n  This is the first step in raising the bar for all of President Bush's \nnominees. That is the goal--to raise the bar, to impose new tests never \nenvisioned in the Constitution, for anyone nominated by President Bush. \nMake no mistake about this: it is partisan politics at its most \nfundamental. Instead of the Senate performing its constitutional role \nof advise and consent, the Democrat leadership intends to put itself in \na position to dictate to the President who his nominees can be. Instead \nof allowing the normal process to work--the process through which all \njudicial nominees have gone before--they are fashioning a new set of \ntests that will become the standard.\n  And while I am talking about raising the bar, let me anticipate the \nargument of the opposition. I have heard a lot from my Democrat \ncolleagues about how they are offended at being expected to \n``rubberstamp'' President Bush's nominees. Last I checked, it takes \nabout two seconds to ``rubberstamp'' something; you just pound the \nstamp on an inkpad and then on a piece of paper, and you are done.\n  This nomination, on the other hand, has been in the works for 21 \nmonths, involved extensive hearings by a then-Democrat-led Judiciary \nCommittee, included supplemental questions posed by Committee members, \na non-unanimous vote of that Committee, and weeks of debate on this \nfloor. For any Senator to say this amounts to being pushed into \n``rubberstamping'' this nominee is hogwash.\n  Furthermore, anybody who wants to complain about ``rubberstamping'' \nought to be out here standing side by side with Republicans, demanding \nan up-or-down vote on this nominee. I say to my colleagues, if you are \nnot satisfied that this nominee will be a good judge on the Court of \nAppeals, then vote against him. If you are sincere about your \nobjections, and not just playing political games, then you have nothing \nto lose by demanding a fair vote.\n\n  I do not see how anybody could read the record on this nominee and \nlisten to the debate in this Senate and not conclude that Miguel \nEstrada will serve the United States with distinction on the Federal \nbench. His personal history is inspiring; his work achievements are \nimpressive; his competence and character have won him testimonials from \nfriends and coworkers of every political stripe.\n  I am a new member of the Judiciary Committee--the first Idahoan to \nserve on that committee in more than forty years--and I am proud to say \nthat my first recorded vote on that committee was to confirm Mr. \nEstrada. I am now asking my colleagues to allow the full Senate to have \nthe opportunity to vote on this nominee. Let us stop the storytelling, \nget back to the real world, and have a fair up-or-down vote on the \nconfirmation of Miguel Estrada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Democratic leader was on the floor this \nmorning and spoke at some length about the problems facing this \ncountry. The problems facing this country are significant. It is \nuntoward, as the Democratic leader stated, that we are not dealing with \nissues the people we represent, who are in our home States, want to \ntalk about. They want us to do something about the health care delivery \nsystem in this country. That includes prescription drugs. It includes \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. It includes Medicare. It includes \nMedicaid.\n  The people at home want us to at least remember that we have \nenvironmental problems facing this country that we need to deal with. \nThe people at home understand education is a significant issue. The \npeople at home understand their State--there are only four States that \ndo not have a budget deficit. All other States are spending in the red. \nThey want some help. We, as a\n\n[[Page S2661]]\n\nSenate, deserve to deal with those and other issues that the people of \nour States believe we should be talking about.\n  There have been a number of requests made: Why do we not vote on this \nin 6 hours, 4 hours, 2 hours, 10 hours, 2 days, Friday by 9:30? And we \nhave said very simply--this is the ninth day of this debate covering a \nperiod of approximately 3 weeks--Miguel Estrada needs to be candid and \nforthright. And how is that going to be accomplished? It is going to be \naccomplished by his giving us information, answering questions, and \ngiving us the memos he wrote when he was at the Solicitor General's \nOffice.\n  We should be dealing with the issues I have outlined, and others, \nissues that people really care about at home. But, no, we are not going \nto take up S. 414 that Senator Daschle asked unanimous consent that we \nmove to, the economic stimulus package the Democrats prefer. What it \ndoes is give immediate tax relief to the middle class and has no long-\nterm impact on the deficit of this country.\n  If we brought that up and the majority did not like our bill, we \ncould have a debate on what is the best thing to do to deal with the \nfinancial woes of this country. That is what we should be dealing with.\n  As I have said earlier today, and I repeat, the reason we are not \ndealing with those issues of immense importance to this country is the \nmajority does not have a plan or a program.\n  The President's tax cut proposal, his own Republicans do not like it. \nThe chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the House does not like \nit. Individual Members of the Senate, who are Republicans, who do not \nlike his program, have written to him and talked to him. So that is why \nthey are not bringing that up.\n  Why are we not going to do something dealing with health care? \nBecause they do not have their act together. They do not know what they \nwant.\n  So without running through each issue we should be talking about, let \nme simply say Miguel Estrada needs to be resolved and can be resolved \nin three ways: The nomination be pulled and we can go to more important \nissues; No. 2, he can answer the questions people want to propound to \nhim and have propounded to him; and thirdly, he submit the memos he \nwrote when he was in the Solicitor General's Office and answer \nquestions.\n  There has been a lot said in righteous indignation: We cannot give \nthese memos because it would set a precedent that has never been set in \nthe history of this country. Senators Daschle and Leahy, the Democratic \nleader and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, wrote to the \nWhite House and said: Give us the memos. Let him answer the questions.\n\n  We get a 15-page letter back from Gonzales, the counsel to the \nPresident, saying: We are not going to do that.\n  My staff just showed me a letter--I guess he did not have time, as \ncounsel to the President did, to write a 15-page letter--in two or \nthree sentences saying that Gonzales, if he wanted to talk to Senator \nDaschle and I, they would have him come forward and he could sit down \nand talk to us.\n  We are not going to do that. The Democrats in the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously voted against Miguel Estrada because he did not answer the \nquestions and he did not submit the memos.\n  My case to the Senate, my case to the American people, is there is no \nprecedent set by his giving this information, and I say that for a \nnumber of reasons.\n  I have a detailed letter from the Department of Justice describing \ntheir efforts to respond to the Senate's request for Chief Justice \nRehnquist's Office of Legal Counsel memos during his nomination--he was \na Supreme Court Justice at the time, but now he is the Chief Justice--\nand a legal letter from the Department of Legislative and \nIntergovernmental Affairs, John Bolton, on August 7, 1986, which states \nand I quote:\n\n       We attach an index of those documents--\n\n  Rehnquist legal memorandum from when he was the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Office of Legal Counsel in the Solicitor's Office--\n\n     and will provide the Committee with access in accordance with \n     our existing agreement.\n\n  The letter also indicates that numerous other legal memoranda were \nprovided to the committee prior to that date. The letter also contains \nan attachment, ``Index to Supplemental Release to Senate Judiciary \nCommittee,'' which lists three additional memos relating to legal \nconstraints on possible use of troops to prevent movement of May Day \ndemonstrators, possible limitations posed by the Posse Comitatus Act on \nthe use of troops, authority of members of the Armed Forces on duty in \ncivil disturbances to make arrests.\n  These are internal memos, obviously, written by attorneys containing \nlegal analyses and deliberations about very sensitive issues. Again, it \nis obvious that legal memos similar to Mr. Estrada's were provided to \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, reviewed and returned to the \nDepartment. In fact, Senator Biden, still a member of this body, wrote \nto Attorney General Meese to thank him for his cooperation and then \nasked for additional memos that I assume were provided.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated July 23, 1986, written to \nthe Honorable Strom Thurmond, chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, from Joe Biden asking that the Department of Justice supply \ncertain information regarding the nomination of William B. Rehnquist to \nbe Chief Justice, I ask simply that that matter be forwarded to the \nSenate and be printed in the Record.\n  As well, we have a request back--I am sorry. We have a letter written \nto Joe Biden from Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Howard Metzenbaum, and \nPaul Simon, members of that Judiciary Committee, who asked for certain \ninformation dealing with memoranda that Rehnquist prepared. We have a \nletter written to Attorney General Meese from Joe Biden setting forth \nthe materials that were requested, together with Rehnquist documents \nthat are wanted. We have a letter dated August 7 to Chairman Thurmond \nfrom John Bolton that I referred to in more general terms. That lists \nin detail the material that was supplied.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1986.\n     Hon.

Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thurmond: This letter responds to Senator \n     Biden's August 6 request for certain additional materials \n     referred to in the documents from the Office of Legal Counsel \n     (OLC) that were made available for the Committee's review, \n     and for an explanation of the procedures followed by the \n     Office of Legal Counsel in locating and reviewing those \n     materials. Because OLC went to extraordinary lengths in \n     responding to the document requests in a very short time, I \n     think it would be useful to describe those efforts first.\n       The files of the Office of Legal Counsel for the years \n     1969-1971 are maintained in two, duplicative sets: one in \n     hard copy (on a chronological basis) and the other on a \n     computerized system (which can be searched by words or \n     phrases). The Office's normal procedure in response to any \n     request for documents--be it from the public, another \n     government agency, or from a member of Congress--is to \n     conduct a search through the computer system to locate the \n     potentially responsive document or documents. The documents \n     thus identified are then reviewed in hard copy to determine \n     whether they are responsive to the request and whether they \n     may be released, consistent with preserving the integrity of \n     the Office's role as confidential legal advisor to the \n     Attorney General and to the President. The computer search \n     and review is supervised directly by senior career personnel \n     of the Office.\n       In this case, the Office went far beyond its routine \n     process to ensure the comprehensiveness of its response. In \n     keeping with established procedures, members of the career \n     OLC staff, under the supervision of the senior career lawyer \n     who usually handles such matters, performed extensive subject \n     matter searches of the computer data base to identify all \n     documents in the files that were conceivably responsive to \n     the request. Those documents were then reviewed by a senior \n     career staff lawyer to determine their responsiveness. In \n     addition, OLC career staff performed an overlapping \n     review, from the hard copy files maintained by OLC for \n     1969-1971, of all documents prepared by or under the \n     direction and supervision of Mr. Rehnquist. Finally, a \n     staff lawyer worked with the Records Management Division \n     of the Department of Justice to try to identify and locate \n     any files stored in the federal records center that might \n     possibly contain responsive documents.\n       I note that review of the stored files in this manner is \n     extraordinary and to our knowledge unprecedented. The OLC \n     files from the relevant time period were consolidated with \n     other Departmental files by the Records Management Division, \n     and then processed and maintained by that Division based on a \n     complicated and incomplete filing system. It is virtually \n     impossible to determine whether documents from the Office of \n     Legal Counsel may be in a particular stored file, or indeed \n     to determine whether particular files were maintained.\n       Nonetheless, in an effort to be as complete as possible in \n     responding to the request, OLC undertook to try to identify \n     any stored files that could conceivably contain responsive \n     documents. Although an initial review of the index maintained \n     by the Records Management Division did not suggest that those \n     files contained responsive material that OLC had not \n     previously located, in an abundance of caution OLC requested \n     access to any possibly relevant files. Those files were \n     received from the records center in Suitland, Maryland, late \n     yesterday afternoon. Based on a review of those files by OLC \n     career staff, OLC located three additional memoranda relating \n     to the May Day arrests, each of which was prepared by OLC \n     staff. We attach an index of those documents, and will \n     provide the Committee with access in accordance with our \n     existing agreement.\n       In addition, the files received from the federal records \n     center included a copy of the December 2, 1970, letter from \n     Lt. Gen. Exton, which is requested as item A by Senator Biden \n     in his August 6 letter. We will also furnish this letter to \n     the Committee under the same terms. With the exception of \n     item M on Senator Biden's list, which has already been made \n     available to the Committee, OLC has been unable to locate any \n     of the other requested materials in its files or in the \n     stored files. Many of these documents may, in fact, no longer \n     exist. The various ``requests'' listed as items F, G, and K, \n     for example, were most likely oral requests that were never \n     memorialized in writing.\n       In sum, the staff of the Office of Legal Counsel went to \n     extraordinary lengths to ensure that all responsive materials \n     were located, putting literally hundreds of hours into this \n     project.\n       Please let me know if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John R. Bolton,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n      Index to Supplemental Release to Senate Judiciary Committee\n\n       1. 5/71 memo to file from Eric Fygi: ``Prevention by Use of \n     Troops of Departure of Mayday Demonstrators from West Potomac \n     Park for Demonstration Sites''\n       This memorandum discusses legal constraints on possible use \n     of troops to prevent movement of May Day demonstrators.\n       2. 4/26/71 memo to WHR from Eric Fygi and Mary C.

Gen. H.M. Exton to Attorney \n     General Mitchell (as requested by Senator Biden's letter of \n     August 6, 1986).\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my friend from Idaho, the distinguished \nsenior Senator--and he is my friend; I have the greatest respect for \nhim; he is a fine man; he represents his State very well--I \nrespectfully submit to this body my friend's statements regarding what \nthe Senate did not do last year is a statement made through a pair of \nglasses that obviously are very foggy.\n  I say that because there is a lot of talk here about things that were \nnot done. But the fact is the work that was left undone last year was \nleft undone as a result of the President of the United States and the \nRepublican-led House of Representatives not allowing us to move the \nappropriations bills. We\n\n[[Page S2663]]\n\npassed 2 bills, leaving 11 undone. The House of Representatives simply \nrefused to take votes on those very difficult bills. They knew if they \ntook votes on those bills as they wanted them in the House of \nRepresentatives, it would create chaos among the people in the country \nbecause the people would know then that the Republicans simply were not \nmeeting the demands of the American people.\n  As a result of that, even though we passed every bill out of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee--all 13--we were not allowed to take \nthem up. So we have to understand that is basically the way it is.\n  The senior Senator from Idaho has talked about the need to have a \nvote on Estrada. It is within the total power of the majority to have a \nvote. How do they have a vote? The rules in this body have been the \nsame for a long time: File a motion to invoke cloture. Why does the \nSenate have a rule such as this? The Senate of the United States, as \nour Founding Fathers said, is the saucer that cools the coffee. The \nConstitution of the United States is a document that is not to protect \nthe majority; this Constitution protects minorities. The majority can \nalways protect itself. The Constitution protects the minority. If the \nmajority wants to vote, it can invoke cloture--try to. It takes 60 \nvotes. No question about that. Then they can have the up-or-down vote \nthat they want.\n  All the crocodile tears are being shed for this man who is fully \nemployed downtown here with a big law firm, making hundreds of \nthousands of dollars a year. We are holding up the work of this country \nthat deals with problems that people who do not make that kind of money \nhave, people who are struggling to make sure they can pay their rent, \nmake their house payment, pay their car payment, that they can find \nenough money to get to work on public transportation, people who need a \nminimum wage increase, people who have no health care; they cannot take \ntheir children to the hospital when they are sick, and if they do, they \nknow they are going to be billed large sums. Some places do not have \nindigent hospital care. We know there are many people who are \nunderinsured, as Senator Kennedy and I talked about. There are 44 \nmillion who do not have health insurance. Those are the problems with \nwhich we should be dealing.\n  The Clark County School District in Las Vegas is the fifth or sixth \nlargest school district in America. A quarter of a million children \nneed help. The school district is in dire need of help. The Leave No \nChild Behind is leaving a lot of kids behind because there is no money \nto take care of the problems. We met with Governors today for lunch, \nand they were told when they met with the President yesterday for Leave \nNo Child Behind they are supposed to do the testing, and if that does \nnot work out, they are supposed to take care of the other problems. \nThat is not the deal we made. The States were desperate before that was \npassed. We do not fund the IDEA act, children with disabilities. These \nare the issues we should be dealing with--not spending 3 weeks of our \ntime on a man who is fully employed. Let's talk about some of the \npeople who have no jobs or are underemployed.\n\n  Having said that, my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from \nIdaho, cannot understand why there is not a vote on Estrada the way he \nbelieves a vote should occur. My friend, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Idaho, voted against 13 Clinton nominees on the floor, \nincluding Rosemary Barkett, born in Mexico, who emigrated to the United \nStates. She had a great rating from the ABA, before Fred Fielding was \non the committee, and he does not write her evaluation report.\n  By the way, the one thing on which I agree with the Republicans: They \nwere right in saying the ABA should be out of the process. I will join \nwith anyone in the future to get the ABA out of the process. It is \ncorrupt, unethical; there are absolute conflicts of interest. The \nRepublicans were right; it has been unfair.\n  I cannot imagine that body having thousands of----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. In one second, I will yield--thousands of lawyers, and they \ncannot get people who would be fair and reasonable and do not appear to \nhave conflicts of interest? It is ripe to get rid of it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would not deny the Senator the right to the floor. I am \ncurious, for the 8 years of the Clinton administration, this was the \ngold plate. The American Bar Association quality test was a gold plate. \nI said wait a moment here and voted against some of them.\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend, I said on the Senate floor today in \nthe presence of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, they were \nright. I acknowledge that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. A year makes a lot of difference, in the opinion of the \nSenator?\n  Mr. REID. Knowledge makes a difference. I am not a member of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. CRAIG. And I am a freshman there.\n  Mr. REID. I think the ABA should be ashamed of themselves.\n  I said this morning, I practiced law quite a few years before coming \nhere. I was not a member of the ABA for a number of reasons. Had I \nknown this, I would really not have been a member. Lawyers all over \nAmerica--we have, going back to biblical times, had problems with \nlawyers.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is why----\n  Mr. REID. The ABA, I cannot think of a better phrase than that they \nshould be ashamed of themselves for what they have done.\n  This is off the subject, but I will get back on the subject. I \nbelieve all Presidents, Democrat and Republican, have had trouble \ngetting nominees--whether it is Cabinet officers, sub-Cabinet officers, \nmembers of the military, whether it is judges--trying to get them \nbefore the Senate because of the length of time the FBI investigations \ntake and all the hoops people have to jump through now.\n  I say let's eliminate the ABA from the judges. I don't know how many \nof my colleagues here agree, but I agree, and I will join with the \nRepublicans anytime to get the ABA out of the process.\n  My friend, the distinguished Senator from Idaho, voted against Judge \nSonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic female appointed to the circuit, \nand Judge Richard Paez confirmed to the Ninth Circuit after 1,520 days \nfollowing his nomination. In fact, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Idaho not only voted against Judge Paez's confirmation, before \nthat vote on March 9, 2000, but also voted on that day to indefinitely \npostpone the nomination of Richard Paez.\n  I find it fascinating that someone who voted to indefinitely postpone \na vote on Paez would now say that Estrada is entitled to an immediate \nvote on his nomination.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield, although I do not lose my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, the Senator is absolutely right. I did \nvote against those judges, as I said on the floor a few moments ago. I \nvoted for some of the Clinton judges and against some of them based on \nphilosophy. The question I ask, though, is, Did I ever deny the Senate \nthe right to go to a vote? Did I ever filibuster as the Senator's party \nis now doing on this issue?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend that we had to vote cloture on Paez. \nThat is how we got a vote on Paez. That is how that came about. We had \nto invoke cloture, and we had enough people of goodwill on the other \nside of the aisle who joined with us to invoke cloture. So the debate \nstopped.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I see.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as I was saying before, the question was \nasked. Senator Craig voted against the motion to invoke cloture on the \ndebate on Paez who was pending for more than 1,500 days.\n  I want everyone within the sound of my voice to hear this. As Senator \nDaschle and I said, when the Democrats took over control of the Senate, \nwe said it is not payback time no matter how bad President Clinton was \ntreated. And we could go into a long harangue about how unfair it was. \nI will not even mention a few of the judges. The record is replete with \nexamples of how poorly they were treated and how unfairly they were \ntreated. We did not have payback time when we were in the majority, and \nit is not payback time when we are in the minority.\n  We approved, during the short time that we had control of the Senate, \n100\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\njudges--exactly. Three judges have come before this body for a vote. \nThey were approved unanimously.\n  The situation with Miguel Estrada is a little bit different. It is a \nlittle bit different. It is a lot different. It is tremendously \ndifferent because this is a man about whom speeches have been given all \nover town. He is so good that he is going to go to the Supreme Court.\n  It triggered something in the mind of the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee. If that is the case, maybe we should ask him some questions. \nMy dear friend from Utah, from our sister State and neighboring State, \nhad on his desk books--look at all the answers he has given. There are \nanswers, and then there are answers. He didn't answer the questions. \nThat was our concern. He responded to questions, but he didn't answer \nthem.\n  We believe that what has gone on in the past is not something we \nwant, so in this situation I am able to say here that 2 days ago \neverything has been said but not everyone has said it. We are in a new \nphase of this debate. Everything has been said and everybody has said \nit. So now it is just repeat time. I am going to do a little repeat \ntime.\n  I know my friend from New York wishes to speak. I will be as quick as \nI can, but I do want to respond to some of the questions that have been \nraised in the last bit by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  In 1996, Republicans allowed no--zero percent, absolute number zero--\ncircuit court nominees to be confirmed. In 1997, they allowed 7 of just \n21 of President Clinton's 21 circuit court nominees, one-third. Only 5 \nof President Clinton's first 11 circuit nominees that same year were \nconfirmed. In 1998, Republicans allowed 13 of the 23 pending circuit \ncourt nominees to be confirmed. That percentage was pretty good--the \nbest year for circuit court nominations and 6.5 years in control of the \nSenate. In 1999, Republicans backed down to 28 percent and allowed 7 of \nthe 25 circuit court nominees to be confirmed--about 1 of over 4.\n  Four of President Clinton's first 11 circuit court nominations that \nyear were not confirmed. In 2000, Republicans allowed only 8 of 26, 31 \npercent. All but one of the circuit court candidates were initially \nnominated that year without confirmation.\n  Republicans simply have no standing to complain that 100 percent of \nPresident George W. Bush's circuit court nominees have not be \nconfirmed. The recent issue makes it plain. Democrats have been far \nbetter to this President than they were to President Clinton.\n  Under Republicans, as a consequence, the number of vacancies on the \ncircuit courts more than doubled--from 16 in January 1995 to 33 by the \ntime the Senate was reorganized in the summer of 2001. Republicans \nallowed only 7 circuit court judges to be confirmed per year; on \naverage, we confirmed 17 in just 17 months.\n  The other thing that I find so interesting is the majority is \ncomplaining about the District of Columbia Circuit Court being so \nunderstaffed. What they are saying now is that this DC Circuit is so \nunderstaffed that we have to do something about this.\n  As my friend from Utah said to me, make a difference. As I indicated \nto him about the ABA, I didn't know as much then as I know now about \nthe ABA.\n  But what I wanted to talk about here is the DC Circuit Court \nproblems. They talked about double standards on that side of the aisle \ntoday. Let me give you a couple of examples.\n  DC Circuit Court nominees Elena Kagan, Allan Snyder, and Merrick \nGarland. Senator Cornyn remarked that Judge Garland was confirmed in \nonly a few months. Today the Senator repeated that claim using the \nchart that said Garland waited only 71 days from his nomination to \nconfirmation.\n  If only that were the case, but all you have to do is talk to Judge \nGarland and look at the real record. Judge Garland was first nominated \nin 1995--the year the Republicans took over the Senate--and not allowed \nto be confirmed until 1997, hardly a few months.\n  The prior two Republican administrations under President Reagan and \nGeorge W. Bush appointed 11 judges to the 12-member court. When \nPresident Reagan came to Washington, there was a concerted effort to \npack this court in particular with activist judges in the hopes of \nlimiting opportunity for citizens to challenge regulations and limiting \nconstitutional power to enforce hard-fought constitutional and \nstatutory rights to protect workers and to protect the environment.\n  President Reagan, with the help of the Senate, put activist Robert \nBork on the DC Circuit. Like Miguel Estrada, Bork was one of the first \njudges nominated by that President. Shortly after winning Bork's \nconfirmation to the circuit in 1982, President Reagan pushed through \nthe Scalia nomination to the DC Circuit, and Ken Starr the following \nyear.\n  That is a real lineup. Bork, Starr, Scalia--quite amazing. He named \nanother five conservatives after that for a total of eight appointments \nto the court alone in his 8 years as President.\n  The first President Bush took a similarly special interest in the DC \nCircuit and chose Clarence Thomas to be one of his first dozen \nnominees. Thomas, who I had the pleasure of voting against when he came \nbefore the Senate, was one of two other nominees of the first President \nBush. Four of the 11 judges put on the District of Columbia Circuit \nwere later nominated by the Republican Presidents to the Supreme Court.\n  During the period when Republicans had nominations to that court--\nwhen Scalia and Thomas served there--the court, clearly any legal \nscholar can tell you, began to limit opportunities for individual \ncitizens and judges to represent them. To have standing to challenge \nGovernment action.\n\n  At the same time, the DC Circuit became less deferential to agency \nregulations intended to protect consumers and workers. These decisions \nwere praised by Republican activists.\n  With a Democratic Senate, President Clinton was able to name two \nmoderate judges to this court in order to moderate this bench. However, \nonce Republicans took over, they tried to prevent any more Democratic \nappointees from getting on this court.\n  So it is simply incorrect--and I hope not intentionally--to claim \nthat Garland waited only 71 days between his nomination and his \nconfirmation. It was a matter of years, not days--almost 2 years.\n  Why did he have to wait so long? Once Republicans took over the \nSenate, they decided to try to prevent President Clinton from filling \ncircuit court vacancies, especially in the DC Circuit. In fact, during \ntheir time in the majority, vacancies on the appellate courts more than \ndoubled, to 33, during their 6\\1/2\\ years in control of the Senate.\n  I believe Republicans decided to prevent President Clinton from \nbringing any balance to the DC Circuit. As you know, the Republicans \nhad named 11 judges to this powerful 12-member court.\n  First, when Garland was nominated to the 12th seat, Republicans said \nthe DC Circuit did not need a 12th judge. For example, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, said that this \njudgeship cost $1 million a year and did not need to be filled due to \nthose costs.\n  Then Senator Grassley said he was relying on the view of a Republican \nappointee to this court, Judge Silberman. Judge Silberman--you can read \nabout him in a number of different places, including the book ``Blinded \nby the Right,'' written by Mr. David Brock, where this man, who was an \nactivist for the far right, would meet with this judge, while he was \nsitting on the bench, walking to his anteroom, and talk about political \nstrategy on how to embarrass Democrats, talk about political strategy, \nwhat to do to embarrass the President of the United States and the \nFirst Lady of the United States. That is Judge Silberman.\n  Judge Silberman recently told the Federalist Society that judicial \nnominees should say nothing in their confirmation hearings--the same \nadvice he gave Scalia when Silberman was in the Reagan White House. \nAnd, as you know with Scalia, a nominee's silence on an issue certainly \ndoes not guarantee that a nominee does not have deeply held views on an \nissue.\n  Yesterday, I went into some detail about my respect for the ability \nof Judge Scalia to reason. This is a logical man, a brilliant man. But \nwe, for various reasons, knew quite a lot about Scalia. He had written \nopinions before he went to the Supreme Court. And\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\neven though some of us may not have agreed with his judicial \nphilosophy, no one--no one--can dispute his legal attributes, his legal \nabilities, his ability to reason and think.\n  Scalia recently authored a majority opinion for the Supreme Court in \nfavor of the Republican Party of Minnesota that ABA-modeled ethics \nrules could not prevent a judicial candidate from sharing his views on \nlegal issues. That was Scalia, the person I just bragged about.\n  While there might have been some ambiguity about how much a judicial \ncandidate could say before that Supreme Court decision last summer, \nafter that decision there is none now, and Mr. Estrada has no ethical \nbasis for refusing to answer the questions that we say he has not \nanswered.\n\n  Let's talk about Silberman a little more.\n  He told Senator Grassley that the addition of another judge on that \ncourt would make it ``more difficult'' ``to maintain a coherent stream \nof decisions.'' Surely he did not mean that the addition of a Democrat \nappointee to that court filled with Republican appointees would make it \nmore difficult to have unanimous decisions by mostly Republican panels.\n  My friend Senator Grassley and other Republicans also relied on the \nviews of another Republican appointee, Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson of the \nFourth Circuit. I don't know much about Harvie Wilkinson. I don't know \nif he is giving advice about how to embarrass Democrats in his judicial \ncapacity, which is unethical and against the canons of judicial ethics. \nBut I don't know anything about Harvie Wilkinson, other than what I am \ngoing to tell you right now. He said:\n\n       [W]hen there are too many judges . . . there are too many \n     opportunities for Federal intervention.\n\n  So this makes me think that the opposition to Garland getting a vote \nwas pretty political.\n  Well, then look at what happened. Another Republican appointee to the \nDC Circuit retired, and then the Republicans said the DC Circuit did \nnot need an 11th judge on that court. Garland would have then been the \n11th judge instead of the 12th.\n  So the Republicans came to the floor stating that the declining \ncaseload of the DC Circuit did not warrant the appointment of a Clinton \nappointee. They argued that 10 judges could handle the 1,625 appeals \nfiled in the then-most-recent year for which statistics were available.\n  I can only imagine what the Republicans would be saying now if Gore--\nwho got more votes in the last election than did the President--if he \nhad won the Supreme Court case in that election recount. Now, the \nnumber of cases filed in the DC Circuit has fallen by another 200 per \nyear, down to 1,400 in 2001, the most recent year for which statistics \nare available. So under their analysis--that is, the analysis of \nSilberman and Wilkinson--the DC Circuit would need only 9 judges to \nhandle these cases, not 10 or 11 or 12.\n  In fact, under their analysis, 8 DC Circuit judges could probably \nhandle the 1,400 appeals if each judge took a few more cases on \naverage--175 rather than 162. In fact, the First Circuit had 1,463 \nappeals that year, more than the DC Circuit, but they only have 6 \njudges.\n  So let me be as clear as I can. I am not saying that the DC Circuit \nneeds only eight judges and that Estrada and Roberts are people for \nwhom they should not have submitted their names. I am simply saying \nthat these were the Republican arguments against confirming Merrick \nGarland and any other Clinton appointees to that court. Now they are \nstrangely silent on the plummeting caseload of the DC Circuit and \nwhether it is important we spend $1 million per year for each job.\n  These saviors of the budget--the majority--and they are responsible, \nalong with the President, for the largest deficit in the history of the \nworld, almost $500 billion this year--are not concerned, I guess, about \n$1 million per year. Because you are talking about four judges or so, \nand that is only $4 million. And when we have a deficit approaching \n$500 billion, I guess that is chump change.\n  After delaying Garland from 1995 to 1997, 23 Republicans still voted \nagainst the confirmation of this uncontroversial and well-liked \nnominee. I think it is important note that, despite Garland's \nunassailed reputation for fairness, Republicans forced him to wait on \nthe floor all this time--even after he was voted out of committee--11 \nmonths on the floor.\n\n  Clinton's two other nominees to the DC Circuit were not nearly as \nfortunate. Elana Kagan and Allen Snyder were never allowed a committee \nvote or a floor vote. They were held up by anonymous Republicans.\n  That is worse than what we are doing--absolutely, totally worse. What \nwe are doing is within the rules because you have rules that you can \nfollow. If it is not put out of committee, you have no recourse. If \nthey had brought it to the floor, we could have at least tried to \ninvoke cloture. And that is what the majority can do now.\n  They did not even give these two qualified people--both of whom \ngraduated first in their class, Harvard--they were never even allowed a \ncommittee vote, or certainly not a floor vote. They were held up by \nanonymous Republicans.\n  Now, we are not doing anything in the dark of the night. We do not \nhave anonymous holds on Miguel Estrada. We are out here on the floor \nsaying, we want information on him. Until we get it, we are going to \nvote against this man. And I assume these anonymous holds--I don't know \nhow many it was--one, or two, or three, or four, or five Republicans in \nthe dark of the night preventing a vote.\n  Now the Republicans want to say it is wrong and unconstitutional to \nneed 60 votes. It is not quite worth a hearty laugh, but it is sure \nkind of funny for them to say it is unconstitutional. Unconstitutional \nthat we are following the Constitution--article II, section 2, of the \nConstitution?\n  Now Republicans want to say it is wrong and unconstitutional to need \n60 votes--more than a majority--to end a debate under longstanding \nSenate rules, but it is not antidemocratic and unfair for Republicans \nto allow just one member of their own party--maybe two or three--to \nprevent a vote up or down on a judicial nominee, or at least allow us \nto file a motion to invoke cloture; that is, when a Democrat was \nPresident.\n  Madam President, I know the Senator from New York is here to speak. \nIs that true? I will have plenty of opportunity at a subsequent time to \nspeak. But there will be a time when I respond to the statement the \njunior Senator from Texas made yesterday regarding the Senate's role on \nconfirmations. I look forward to doing that.\n  I apologize to my friend from New York. She had duty here at 5 \no'clock, and I have taken far too much time.\n  I did want to respond to some statements made when the Senator from \nNew York was not on the floor. I felt it was important that the record \nbe made clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I understand that the Senator from New \nYork wishes to speak. I don't wish to delay her, but in the spirit of \ngoing back and forth, I have sought to be recognized. I will not take a \ngreat deal of time because I want to be sure the Senator from New York \nis given the proper opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, because of the graciousness of the Senator \nfrom Utah, I ask unanimous consent that following the statement of the \nSenator from New York, the Senator from Utah be recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I would object because I have the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. I thought you were going to let her speak.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I do intend to let her speak, but I would like to give \nmy statement first.\n  Mr. REID. I didn't understand that. Then I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senator from New York be recognized following the Senator from \nUtah. I would say to the Senator from Utah, the Senator from New York \nhas been waiting a long time, so in the matter of who has been here the \nlongest, it has been her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Nevada. I sit behind him. He may \nnot have noticed how long I was waiting.\n  I have been interested in this debate. It goes on. As the Senator \nfrom Nevada\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\nhas said, just about everything that can be said has been said. But at \nthe same time the country is beginning to discover this debate. While \neverything may have been said on the floor, it seems that not \neverything has been said out in the country. It is interesting to me \nthat we are getting more and more editorial comment throughout the \nNation on this issue.\n  One that came to my attention just this morning is in this morning's \nWashington Post. Those who get upset about what they believe is the \nliberal bias of the newspapers usually do not include the Washington \nPost among the list of those publications favorable to Republicans. \nThere are columnists in the Washington Post that are considered \nfavorable to Republicans. Mr. Novak comes to mind. But the Post itself \nis considered to be part of the leftwing media, according to those on \ntalk radio.\n  So when someone who is part of the establishment of the Washington \nPost editorial page speaks out on this issue and says something \ncontrary to that which is normally assumed to be the party line of the \nmainstream media, it is worth noting and commenting on.\n  In this morning's Washington Post, Benjamin Wittes, a member of the \neditorial page staff, has an op-ed piece entitled Silence is Honorable.\n  I would like to quote from it at some length. This is how Mr. Wittes \nbegins:\n\n       Asked whether the Constitution evolves over time, the \n     nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit told the Senate Judiciary Committee that, \n     while such debates were interesting, ``as an appellate judge, \n     my obligation is to apply precedent.'' Asked whether he \n     favored capital punishment, a nominee said only that the \n     death penalty's constitutionality was ``settled law now'' and \n     that he didn't ``see any way in which [his] views would be \n     inconsistent with the law in this area.''\n       Miguel Estrada, one of President Bush's nominees to the \n     D.C. Circuit, is facing a filibuster by Democratic senators \n     who claim that his refusal to address their questions at his \n     hearing--combined with the White House's refusal to release \n     his memos from his days at the solicitor general's office--\n     makes him an unreadable sphinx. Yet the careful answers \n     quoted above are not Estrada's. The first was given by Judge \n     Judith Rogers at her hearing in 1994, the second by Judge \n     Merrick Garland the following year. Both were named to the \n     bench by President Clinton. Neither was ever accused of \n     stonewalling the committee. And both were confirmed.\n       But the rules they are a-changin', and answers barely \n     distinguishable from these are no longer adequate. Asked \n     whether he thought the Constitution contained a right to \n     privacy, Estrada said that ``the Supreme Court has so held \n     and I have no view of any nature whatsoever . . . that would \n     keep me from apply[ing] that case law faithfully.'' Asked \n     whether he believed Roe v. Wade was correctly decided, he \n     declined to answer. While he has personal views on abortion, \n     he said, he had not done the work a judge would do before \n     pronouncing on the subject. Roe ``is there,'' he said. ``It \n     is the law . . . and I will follow it.''\n       The real difference between Estrada's questioning and that \n     of Garland and Rogers is not that Estrada held back. It is \n     that Garland and Rogers faced nothing like the inquest to \n     which Estrada was subjected. Both, along with Judge David \n     Tatel--the other Clinton appointee now on the court--faced \n     only a brief and friendly hearing.\n\n  I would note, outside of the article, that that brief and friendly \nhearing was under Republican auspices because Republicans controlled \nthe Senate. Back to the article:\n\n       And none was pushed to give personal views on those matters \n     on which his or her sense of propriety induced reticence. To \n     be sure, there was no controversy surrounding the fitness of \n     any of the Clinton nominees, so the situation is not quite \n     parallel. When Garland, a moderate former prosecutor who had \n     recommended the death penalty, said he could apply the law of \n     capital punishment, there was no reason to suspect he might \n     be shielding views that would make him difficult to confirm. \n     By contrast, many Democrats suspect that Estrada's refusal to \n     discuss Roe is intended to conceal his allegedly extremist \n     views. But that only begs the question of why Estrada is \n     controversial in the first place that Democrats think it \n     appropriate to demand that he bare his judicial soul as a \n     condition of even getting a vote.\n\n  This is the conclusion of this portion of the op-ed piece:\n\n       Nothing about his record warrants abandoning the respect \n     for a nominee's silence that has long governed lower court \n     nominations.\n       And silence is the only honorable response to certain \n     questions. It is quite improper for nominees to commit or \n     appear to commit themselves on cases that could come before \n     them.\n\n  That is the end of that quote. This is the standard we followed in \nthis body for many years. I will not pretend that members of the \nJudiciary Committee of both parties in Congress, controlled by both \nparties, would use the Judiciary Committee, the blue slip process and \nother patterns of senatorial courtesy to keep people from getting to \nthe bench. That is part of our history. That has always been done. But \nonce a hearing has been held and the committee has voted out a nominee, \nwe have always allowed that nominee to go to a vote. That is the \nstandard that has been established in this body. That is the standard \nthat has been followed by Democrats and Republicans alike. And that is \nthe standard that is being changed in this circumstance.\n  The Senator from Nevada talked a good bit about the Constitution and \nquestions that have been raised about constitutionality by the \nRepublicans. I would simply point out this obvious fact with respect to \nthe Constitution on this question: The Founding Fathers gave the power \nto advise and consent in certain executive decisions to the Senate. The \nFounding Fathers recognized that the power to advise and consent was a \nvery significant one, an unusual one held solely to the Senate. So they \noutlined those areas where the power to advise and consent would \nrequire a supermajority.\n  The Founding Fathers said: If you are advising and consenting on a \ntreaty, which becomes law when it is ratified, equal to the \nConstitution, then you have to have a two-thirds majority. If you are \namending the Constitution, you have to have a two-thirds majority. \nThese are serious enough matters, with long-term impact, that they must \nhave a two-thirds majority.\n  They could have said: The advise and consent power always requires a \nsupermajority, but they did not. The Founding Fathers made it very \nclear those specific areas where a supermajority would be required and \nthen left it to an ordinary majority on the advise and consent power \nwith respect to Presidential nominations. And throughout the entire \nhistory of the Republic, we have followed the pattern of a simple \nmajority for the advise and consent power to be exercised by the \nSenate.\n\n  Make no mistake, if the Senate sets the precedent in the Estrada case \nthat the advise and consent power from this time forward requires a \nsupermajority of 60 votes, they are changing forever the pattern of the \nSenate's relationship to the executive branch in this area. I am not \none who says that is unconstitutional. I think it is within the power \nof the Senate. I disagree with those who are saying it violates the \nConstitution. I think it violates the intent of the Framers of the \nConstitution. I think that is very clear. But it is within the power of \nthe Senate to do that if we want.\n  As I have said before, we on our side of the aisle discussed this \nwhen we were faced with those nominees from President Clinton whom we \nconsidered controversial. There were those in our conference who \ninsisted that we must do that--change the pattern and require President \nClinton's nominees to pass the 60 point bar. To his credit, my senior \ncolleague from Utah argued firmly against that. Even though he was \nagainst the nominees in some cases, he said we must not change the \nhistoric pattern that says once a nominee is voted out of the \ncommittee, he or she gets a clear up-or-down vote by a majority. To his \ncredit, the Republican leader at the time, the majority leader, Senator \nLott, said exactly the same thing: We must not go down that road. Those \nin our conference who said let's do it on that particular judge agreed \nand backed down, and no matter how strongly people on this side of the \naisle felt about a particular judge, there was never an attempt to use \nthe filibuster power to change what we considered to be the clear \nintent of the Founding Fathers and change the advise and consent \nsituation, where there was an additional supermajority required, an \nadditional supermajority added to that which the Founding Fathers \nthemselves wrote into the Constitution.\n  Now the Democrats have decided they are going to do that. It is their \nright. To me, it signals a determination on their part that they expect \nto be in the minority for a long time. One of the reasons Senator Hatch \ngave for us not to do it was, we will have an opportunity in the future \nto be voting on nominees offered by a President of our\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\nown party, and if we do this to the other party, they will then feel \ncomfortable in doing it to the nominees of our party; let's just not do \nthat.\n  I think by deciding to do this on this nominee, the Democrats have \nvirtually conceded the fact that they do not expect another Democratic \nPresident for long time. They believe they will be in the minority for \na long time and, therefore, they must establish this weapon as one of \nthe weapons they will use as part of the minority to obstruct the \nactivities in the Senate for a long time to come.\n  I hope they decide ultimately to bet on the future. I hope they \ndecide ultimately they do expect that there will be a Democratic \nPresident sometime in the future, that they do expect there will be a \nDemocratic Senate sometime in the future and they want to save for the \nfuture the right that every President, Democrat or Republican, and \nevery Senate, Democrat or Republican, has maintained since the founding \nof the Republic 2\\1/2\\ centuries ago.\n  Madam President, if I may go back to the article written by Benjamin \nWittes in this morning's Washington Post that summarizes the \nimplications of going in this direction and what it will do long term, \nhe says:\n\n       Not knowing what sort of judge someone will be is \n     frustrating, but that is the price of judicial independence. \n     While it would be nice to know how nominees think and what \n     they believe and feel, the price of asking is too high. The \n     question, rather, is whether a nominee will follow the law. \n     Estrada has said that he will. Those who don't believe him \n     are duty bound to vote against him, but they should not \n     oblige nominees to break the silence that independence \n     requires.\n\n  That is what our friends on the Democratic side are doing. They have \nnever demanded it before. We did not demand it of their nominees. They \nare changing the rules--``the rules they are a'changing,'' as Mr. \nWittes points out. I ask my friends on the Democratic side to think \nlong and hard about the long-term consequences of changing the rules--\nchanging the rules, as Mr. Wittes talks about it, in terms of what is \ndemanded of nominees; changing the rules as we are talking about it \nhere in terms of the supermajority that would be added to the existing \nconstitutional requirement of the Senate as it performs its role in \nadvising and consenting to executive nominations.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nkindness and consideration with respect to the order. I was happy to \nhave the opportunity to hear him, as I often am.\n  With respect to the arguments that have been made in the last hour or \nso, I think it is clear that there is a fundamental difference of \nopinion regarding the Senate's obligation and duty under the advise and \nconsent clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak following the \nspeech of the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I object. There is a Republican speaker coming. I would \namend the UC request to say that Senator Talent, if he is on the floor, \nbe recognized first, and then Senator Dorgan be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I have not followed the \norder on the floor of the Senate today. I don't know whether the \nSenator from Utah has. I was told I would be recognized at 5:30 and was \nprepared to do that. If there has been a process today in which \nRepublicans and Democrats follow each other precisely, then I will \nunderstand what the Senator from Utah is trying to do. If not, I am \nhere. The reason I am here is to present remarks following the Senator \nfrom New York. If others wish to be involved in the line-up, I will be \nhappy to entertain that. I guess I don't understand the circumstance \nunder which the Senator from Utah is opposing this.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am not sure what the circumstance was prior to my \ncoming to the floor either. I was told we were going back and forth. If \nI might inquire as to how much time the Senator would use, perhaps \nthere would be no problem.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It was my intention to consume an hour, but I will not do \nthat; it will be a half hour. I would certainly be accommodating to \nanybody else. I would like to speak, and others are not here. I don't \nintend to interrupt. If there is an order established, I do not want to \ninterrupt that. I don't know that to be the case.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I don't know that to be the case all day long. I do know \nthat was the case earlier. Reserving the right for my friend who is \nanticipating to be here at 6, and was told in advance he could be here \nat 6, I renew my unanimous consent request that following the Senator \nfrom New York, the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Talent, would be \nrecognized to speak, after which the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan, would be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object--and I will now object--if \nthe other side wishes to protect people who are not here in deference \nto those who are here, I expect the Senator from Utah would want us to \ndo the same thing on this side of the aisle. If a Republican is waiting \nto speak, and a Democrat is not yet on the floor, but someone here says \nit is really the opportunity for the Democrats to speak even if the \nRepublican is here, we will object. So I guess I understand the point \nthe Senator from Utah is making. I will not object to his request as \nlong as he understands that we will do that, I suppose. I don't think \nit is the most efficient way of handling things. Those who are on the \nfloor and prepared to speak, I expect that is the way we ought to \nrecognize people.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend for his consideration. I say to him he \ncaught me at somewhat of a disadvantage in that I am the only one on \nthe floor and didn't know what was going on. I am trying to accommodate \npeople on both sides, which is why I want to make sure the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized to speak.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, continuing to reserve the right to \nobject, if this is the process, I will simply at some appropriate point \nask for a time certain to speak tomorrow and will be here promptly at \nthat time. I am here now and those who the Senator from Utah is \nattempting to protect are not here. I will not object because I do not \nwant to interrupt an order apparently they think on that side exists. \nIf that, in fact, is the order, we will certainly make sure that is the \ncase for people on both sides of the aisle as we proceed.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would expect the Democratic leader to be sure of \nenforcing the same process on behalf of Senators on his side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I do not think that is the most \nefficient use of time in the Senate. It seems to me those who are here \nwant to be recognized to proceed. Recognizing it is not the most \nefficient use of time, I will not object to the request by the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I have been, as I \nsaid, listening with great interest to the debate on this issue. It is \na very significant and important debate. As I often do when I come to \nthe Chamber, I imagine, instead of being a Senator with the great honor \nof representing the State of New York and speaking in this Chamber, \nthat I am just another citizen, as I have been most of my life, \nwatching the debate on C-SPAN or one of the other television networks \nthat might cover parts of it, and I would be asking myself: What is \nthis all about? Why has so much time been consumed in the Senate over \nthis one nominee?\n  The bottom line answer is that this side of the aisle has a very deep \nconcern about any candidate seeking a lifetime position who refuses to \nanswer the most basic questions about his judicial philosophy. And \nthat, in fact, to permit such a candidate to be confirmed without being \nrequired to answer those questions is, in our view, a fundamental \ndenial and repudiation of our basic responsibilities under the advice \nand consent clause of article II, section 2, of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Earlier this afternoon, as I was waiting for my opportunity to speak, \nI heard the Senator from Idaho admit that he had, based on philosophy, \nvoted against certain nominees who had been sent to the Senate by \nPresident Clinton. I happen to think that is a totally\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\nlegitimate reason to vote for or against a nominee. I happened to agree \nwith the Senator from Idaho when he said he voted against nominees by \nPresident Clinton based on philosophy. That is an integral part of the \nadvise and consent obligation.\n  The problem that we have on this side of the aisle is we cannot \nexercise the advise and consent obligation because we do not get any \nanswers to make a determination for or against this nominee based on \nphilosophy. I could not have done a better job than the Senator from \nIdaho did in summing up what the problem is. I thank the Senator from \nIdaho for being candid, for saying he voted against President Clinton's \nnominees based on philosophy.\n\n  We could resolve this very easily if the nominee would actually \nanswer some questions, legitimate questions that would permit those of \nus who have to make this important decision and are not just saluting \nand following orders from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, by \nbeing able to look into the philosophy and then deciding: Are we for \nthis nominee or are we against this nominee?\n  This nomination would also be expedited if the President and his \nlegal counsel would respond to the letter of February 11 sent to the \nPresident by the minority leader and the distinguished ranking member \nof the Judiciary Committee asking for additional information on which \nto make a decision concerning this nominee, and, in fact, both Senators \nDaschle and Leahy are very explicit about what information is required. \nI will reiterate the request. Specifically, they asked the President to \ninstruct the Department of Justice to accommodate the request for \ndocuments immediately so that the hearing process can be completed and \nthe Senate can have a more complete record on which to consider this \nnomination and, second, that Mr. Estrada answer the questions he \nrefused to answer during the Judiciary Committee hearing to allow for a \ncredible review of his judicial philosophy and legal views.\n  I would argue, we are not changing the rules. In fact, we are \nfollowing the rules and the Constitution, and we are certainly doing \nwhat the Senator from Idaho said very candidly he did with respect to \nPresident Clinton's nominees. We are trying to determine the judicial \nphilosophy of this nominee in order to exercise our advise and consent \nobligation.\n  I have also been interested in my friends on the other side of the \naisle talking and reading from newspapers and asserting that we are \nsomehow requesting more information from this nominee than from other \nnominees and that, in fact, it is honorable not to answer relevant \nquestions from Judiciary Committee members. It may be honorable by \nsomeone's definition of honor, but it is not constitutional. It is \nfundamentally against the Constitution to refuse to answer the \nquestions posed by a Judiciary Committee member.\n  If there were any doubt about this standard, all doubt was removed \nlast year. How was it removed? It was removed in a Supreme Court \nopinion rendered by Justice Scalia arising out of a case brought by the \nRepublican Party concerning the views of judges.\n  For the record, I think it is important we understand this because \nperhaps some of my colleagues have not been informed or guided by the \nlatest Supreme Court decisions on this issue, but I think they are not \nonly relevant, they are controlling, to a certain extent, when we \nconsider how we are supposed to judge judges.\n  Republicans focus on the ABA model code that judicial candidates \nshould not make pledges on how they will rule or make statements that \nappear to commit them on controversies or issues before the court. They \nare, understandably, using this as some kind of new threshold set by \nMr. Estrada who refused to answer even the most basic questions about \njudicial philosophy or his view of legal decisions.\n  Some judicial candidates, it is true, go through with very little \ninquiry. They come before the Judiciary Committee. They are considered \nmainstream, noncontroversial judges. Frankly, the Senators do not have \nmuch to ask them. They go through the committee. They come to the \nfloor. That is as it should be. Were it possible, that is the kind of \njudge that should be nominated--people whose credentials, background, \nexperience, temperament, and philosophy is right smack in the center of \nwhere Americans are and where the Constitution is when it comes to \nimportant issues. When someone does not answer questions or when they \nare evasive, it takes longer and you keep asking and you ask again and \nagain. That was, unfortunately, the case with this particular nominee.\n  The Republican Party sued the State of Minnesota to ensure their \ncandidates for judicial office could give their views on legal issues \nwithout violating judicial ethics. Republicans took that case all the \nway to the Supreme Court. In an opinion by Justice Scalia, the Supreme \nCourt ruled that the ethics code did not prevent candidates for \njudicial office from expressing their views on cases or legal issues. \nIn fact, Justice Scalia said anyone coming to a judgeship is bound to \nhave opinions about legal issues and the law, and there is nothing \nimproper about expressing them.\n  Of course, we do not and should not expect a candidate to pledge that \nhe is always going to rule a certain way. We would not expect a \ncandidate, even if he agreed that the death penalty was constitutional, \nto say: I will always uphold it, no matter what. That would be an abuse \nof the judicial function and discretion.\n\n  Specifically, in Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, the Supreme \nCourt overruled ABA model restrictions against candidates for elective \njudicial office from indicating their views. I think the reasoning is \napplicable to those who are nominated and confirmed by this body for \nimportant judicial positions within the Federal judiciary.\n  Justice Scalia explained in the majority opinion, even if it were \npossible to select judges who do not have preconceived views on legal \nissues it would hardly be desirable to do so.\n  I want my friends on the other side to hear the words of one of the \ntwo favorite Justices of the current President, Justice Scalia: Even if \nit were possible, it would not be desirable.\n  Why? Because, clearly, we need to know what the judicial philosophy \nis. Judges owe that to the electorate, if they are elected; to the \nSenate if they are appointed.\n  Justice Scalia goes on: Proof that a justice's mind at the time he \njoined the court was a complete tabula rasa in the area of \nconstitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification, \nnot lack of bias. And since avoiding judicial preconceptions on legal \nissues is neither possible nor desirable, pretending otherwise by \nattempting to preserve the appearance of that type of impartiality can \nhardly be a compelling State interest, either. In fact, that is Justice \nScalia quoting Justice Rehnquist.\n  Before this decision, some judicial candidates may have thought--and \nsome of my colleagues may have thought--that judicial candidates could \nnot share their views on legal issues, and I think that might have been \na fair assessment of the state of the law at that time. But that is no \nlonger a fair assessment.\n  A judicial candidate cannot be compelled to share his views, but \nJustice Scalia tells us that a judicial candidate who does not share \nhis views refuses to do so at his own peril, and that is exactly what \nthis nominee has done. At his own peril, he has gotten his marching \norders from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, from all those who \nadvise judicial nominees, from the Federalist Society and all the rest \nof those organizations, not to answer any questions, to dodge all of \nthe issues, to pretend not to have an opinion about any Supreme Court \ncase going back to Marbury v. Madison.\n  Well, he does so, in Justice Scalia's words, at his peril. That is \nwhat has brought this nomination to this floor for all these days, \nbecause this nominee wants to be a stealth nominee. He wants to be a \nnominee who is not held accountable for his views so that we who are \ncharged under the Constitution to make this important judgment cannot \ndo so based on his judicial philosophy.\n  Justice Scalia has a lot to say to my friends on the other side. If \nit were possible to become a Federal judge, with lifetime tenure, on \nthe second highest court of the land, without ever saying\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\nanything about your judicial philosophy, I think that would be \nastonishing. It would be troubling. It would run counter to the \nConstitution and to this opinion written by one of the most \nconservative members of the current Court.\n  Mr. Estrada basically has come before this Senate and claimed he \ncannot give his view of any Supreme Court case without reading the \nbriefs, listening to the oral argument, conferring with colleagues, \ndoing independent legal research, and on and on. That is just a dressed \nup way of saying: I am not going to tell you my views, under any \ncircumstances.\n\n  One has to ask himself--and I do not want to be of a suspicious \nmindset--why will this nominee not share his views? Are they so \nradical, are they so outside the mainstream of American judicial \nthought, that if he were to share his views, even my friends on the \nother side would say wait a minute, that is a bridge too far; we cannot \nconfirm someone who believes that?\n  How can I go home and tell my constituents that I voted for somebody \nwho actually said what he said? I cannot think of any other \nexplanation. Why would a person, who clearly is intelligent--we have \nheard that constantly from the other side--who has practiced law, not \nbe familiar with the procedures of the Judiciary Committee, of the \nconstitutional obligation of advise and consent or even of Justice \nScalia and Justice Rehnquist's opinions about the importance of \nanswering such questions?\n  So I have to ask myself: What is it the White House knows about this \nnominee they do not want us to know? And if they do not want us to \nknow, they do not want the American people to know. I find that very \ntroubling.\n  I do not agree with the judicial philosophy of many of the nominees \nsent up by this White House. I voted against a couple of them. I voted \nfor the vast majority of them, somewhere up in the 90 percentile. At \nleast I felt I could fulfill my obligation so when I went back to New \nYork and saw my constituents and they asked why did I vote for X, I \ncould say to them it was based on the record. He may not be my cup of \njudicial tea, but he seems like a pretty straightforward person. Here \nis what he said and that is why I voted for him. Or to the contrary, I \ncould not vote for this nominee because of the record that was \npresented.\n  I cannot do that with this particular nominee. And you know what. The \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue that is calling the shots on this \nnomination does not want me to have that information.\n  I think that is a denial of the basic bargain that exists under the \nConstitution when it comes to nominating and confirming judges to the \nFederal courts.\n  It could have been different. The Founders could have said let's put \nall of this into the jurisdiction of the Executive; let him name \nwhoever he wants. Or they could have said: No, let's put it in the \njurisdiction of the legislature; let them name whoever they want. \nInstead, as is the genius of our Founders and of our Constitution, \nthere was a tremendous bargain that was struck, rooted in the balance \nof power that has kept this Nation going through all of our trials and \ntribulations, all of our progress, that balance of power which said we \ndo not want this power to rest in any one branch of Government; we want \nit shared. We want people to respect each other across the executive \nand legislative lines when it comes to the third branch of Government.\n  So, OK, Mr. President, you nominate. OK, Senators, you advise and \nconsent. That is what this is about.\n  Sometimes I wonder, as my friends on the other side talk about it, \nhow they can so cavalierly give up that constitutional obligation. The \nunfortunate aspect of this is we could resolve this very easily. All \nthe White House has to do is send up the information. Let Mr. Estrada \nanswer the questions. He may still have a majority of Senators who \nwould vote to put him on the DC Circuit. I do not know how it would \nturn out because I do not have the information.\n  While we are in this stalemate caused by the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue, which for reasons that escape me have dug in their \nheels and said, no, they will not tell us anything about this person, \nthere is a lot of other business that is not being done, business about \nthe economy, the environment, education and health care, business that \nreally does affect the lives of a lot of Americans.\n  On that list of business that I consider important is what is \nhappening in our foster care system. Tomorrow evening, I will have the \ngreat privilege of hosting the showing of a tremendous movie about the \nfoster care system, along with Congressman Tom DeLay. I invite all of \nmy colleagues from both Houses of Congress to come and see this movie \nthat vividly illustrates what happens in our foster care system.\n  I have worked in the past with Congressman DeLay to try to improve \nthe foster care system. I look forward to doing that in the future. He \nhas a great commitment to the foster care system and the foster \nchildren who are trapped within it. I use that word with great meaning \nbecause, indeed, that is often what happens to them. And the stories of \nabuse and neglect that first lead children to go into the foster care \nsystem are compounded by the stories of abuse and neglect once they are \nin that system.\n  Mr. Fisher will be joining Congressman DeLay and me at the Motion \nPicture Association screening room for this important movie. This is a \nscreening just for Members of Congress. I think it will illustrate \nbetter than certainly my words could why it is so important we join \nhands and work on this issue along with many others who affect the \nlives of children as well as men and women across America.\n  Occasionally, a movie comes to the screen that brings to life the \nstories that have become routine in the newspapers and that we too \noften ignore--the stories of children living with abuse and neglect, \nshuffled in and out of our foster care system, often with little \nguidance from or connection to any one adult. Too often these stories \nend in the most tragic way possible:\n  7-year-old Faheem Williams in Newark, NJ was recently found dead in a \nbasement with his two brothers where they were chained for weeks at a \ntime.\n  6-year-old Alma Manjarrez in Chicago was beaten by her mother's \nboyfriend and left to die outside in the snow and cold of the winter.\n  And despite 27 visits by law enforcement to investigate violence, 7-\nyear-old Ray Ferguson from Los Angeles was recently killed in the \ncrossfire of a gun battle in his neighborhood.\n  Antwone Fisher's story is different.\n  Mr. Fisher overcame tremendous odds: He was born in prison, handed \nover to the State, and lived to tell his story of heartbreaking abuse. \nAt the age of 18, he left foster care for the streets. With nowhere to \nturn, he found the support, education, and structure in the U.S. Navy. \nIn the Navy, Fisher received a mentor and professional counselor, which \nhelped him turn his life around.\n  Mr. Fisher survived his childhood and has lived to inspire us all and \nsend us a stern reminder that it is our duty to reform the foster care \nsystem so that no child languishes in the system, left to find his own \nsurvival or to die. Antwone's success story should be the rule not the \nexception.\n  Tomorrow night, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and I will be \ncohosting a screening of the movie ``Antwone Fisher'' for Members of \nCongress. We decided to host this together because we both feel that it \nis imperative that we raise national awareness about foster care--\nthrough one child's own experience--and encourage our colleagues to \ntackle this tough issue with us.\n  Congressman DeLay and I had received an award together in the year \n2000 from the Orphan Foundation of America for the work that we both \nhave done in this area. Earlier this year, I asked my staff to reach \nout to his staff to find ways we might work together to focus on this \nissue. This movie was a natural fit for both of us and I look forward \nto continuing to work with Representative DeLay as we take a hard look \nat reforming our foster care system. Congressman DeLay and his wife, \nChristine, are strong advocates for foster children and are foster \nparents themselves.\n  I hope that many of my colleagues in the Senate will take us up on \nthe invitation and join us for this important movie.\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\n  But, for those who can't join us, I wanted to share a little bit \nabout Antwone's story in his own words from his book, ``Finding \nFish''--\n\n       The first recorded mention of me and my life was [from the \n     Ohio State child welfare records]: Ward No. 13544.\n       Acceptance: Acceptance for the temporary care of Baby boy \n     Fisher was signed by Dr. Nesi of the Ohio Revised Code.\n       Cause: Referred by division of Child Welfare on 8-3-59. \n     Child is illegitimate; paternity not established. The mother, \n     a minor is unable to plan for the child. The report when on \n     to detail the otherwise uneventful matter of my birth in a \n     prison hospital facility and my first week of life in a \n     Cleveland orphanage before my placement in the foster care \n     home of Mrs. Nellie Strange.\n       According to the careful notes made by the second of what \n     would be a total of thirteen caseworkers to document my \n     childhood, the board rate for my feeding and care cost the \n     state $2.20 per day.\n\n  Antwone went on to document that the child welfare caseworker felt \nthat his first foster mother had become ``too attached'' to him and \ninsisted that he be given up to another foster home. The caseworker \ndocuments this change:\n\n       Foster mother's friend brought Antwone in from their car. \n     Also her little adopted son came into the agency lobby with \n     Antwone. . .  . They arrived at the door to the lobby and the \n     friend and the older child quickly slipped back out the door. \n     When Antwone realized that he was alone with the caseworker, \n     he let out a lust yell and attempted to follow them.\n       Caseworker picked him up and brought him in. Child cried \n     until completely exhausted and finally leaned back against \n     caseworkers, because he was completely unable to cry anymore.\n\n  Later he describes when the caseworker brought him to his next foster \nhome--she too slipped out the door when he was not looking. He says, \n``All through my case files, everybody always seemed to be slipping \naway in one sense or another.''\n  When Antwone arrived at the next foster home and as he grew, at first \nhe was not told of his troubled entry into the world:\n\n       But for all that I didn't know and wasn't told about who I \n     was, a feeling of being unwanted and not belonging had been \n     planted in me from a time that came before my memory.\n       And it wasn't long before I came to the absolute conclusion \n     that I was an uninvited quest. It was my hardest, earliest \n     truth that to be legitimate, you had to be invited to be on \n     this earth by two people--a man and a woman who loved each \n     other. Each had to agree to invite you. A mother and a \n     father.\n\n  Antwone Fisher never knew a permanent home--never knew a loving \nmother and father. Instead, he was left to fend for himself when he was \nexpelled from foster care at 18--a time when the state cuts off \npayments to foster parents. Antwone found himself on the streets and \nhomeless.\n  Thanks to the work of many on both sides of the aisle in Congress we \nhave begun important work to make sure that Antwone's story is not \nrepeated. No child should have to grow up in foster care from birth and \nnever be adopted and no child should ever have to leave the system at \n18, with absolutely no support.\n  There are approximately 542,000 children in our Nation's foster care \nsystem--16,000 of these young people leave the system every year having \nnever been adopted. They enter adulthood the way they lived their \nlives, alone.\n  In 1999, when I was First Lady, I advocated for and Congress took an \nimportant step to help these young adults by passing the Chafee Foster \nCare Independence Act. This program provides states with funds to give \nyoung people assistance with housing, health care, and education. It is \nfunded at $410 million annually, and should be increased. But it was an \nimportant start to addressing the population of children who ``age-\nout'' of our foster care system.\n  This bill came after the important bipartisan Adoption and Safe \nFamilies Act of 1997. As First Lady, it was an honor to work on what's \nconsidered to be one of the most sweeping changes in federal child \nwelfare law since 1980.\n  It ensured that a child's safety is paramount in all decisions about \na child's placements. For those children who cannot return home to \ntheir parents, they may be adopted or placed into another permanent \nhome quickly. Since the passage of this law, foster child adoptions \nhave increased by 78 percent.\n  The next major hurdle that I believe we need to tackle in reforming \nour child welfare system is the financing system.\n  Currently, we spend approximately $7 billion annually to protect \nchildren from abuse and neglect, to place children in foster care, and \nto provide adoption assistance. The bulk of this funding, which was \napproximately $5 billion in fiscal year 2001, flows to States as \nreimbursements for low-income children taken into foster care when \nthere is a judicial finding that continuation in their home is not \nsafe.\n  This funding provides for payments to foster families to care for \nfoster children, as well as training and administrative costs.\n  This funding provides a critical safety net for children, who through \ndifficult and tragic circumstances end up in the care of the state. It \nensures that children are placed in foster care only when it is \nnecessary for their safety, it ensures that efforts are made to reunify \nchildren with their families as soon as it safe, it works to make sure \nthat the foster care placement is close to their own home and school, \nand it requires that a permanency plan is put in place. All of these \nsafeguards are critical.\n  The financing, however, is focused on the time the child is in foster \ncare and it continues to provide funding for States the longer and \nlonger a child is in the system. The funding is not flexible enough to \nallow for prevention or to help children as they exit the system--\ncritical times when children fall through the cracks.\n  President Bush has put a proposal on the table to change the way \nfoster care is financed in order to provide greater flexibility so that \nstates can do more to prevent children form entering foster care, to \nshorten the time spent in care, and to provide more assistance to \nchildren and their families after leaving.\n  While I absolutely do not support block granting our child welfare \nsystem--I do think that it is important that President Bush has come to \nthe table with an alternative financing system and I believe that it \nprovides us with an opportunity to carefully consider how to \nrestructure our child welfare system.\n  We must ask critical questions:\n  Will States be required to maintain child safety protection that we \npassed as part of the Adoption and Safe Families Act?\n  Will States be required to target funds to prevention and post-foster \ncare services?\n  What happens if there is a crisis and more foster care children enter \nthe system? Will States receive additional funds?\n  While I believe all of these questions deserve answers, I applaud \nPresident Bush and Representative DeLay for being willing to tackle \nthis hard problem. I look forward to working with them to find \nsolutions so that we do not allow any child to fall through the cracks.\n  This is just one of the many issues that are basically left on the \nback burner while we engage in this constitutional debate that could be \nresolved if information were provided.\n  As I said, I have to question the reasons why that information is not \nforthcoming. It gives me pause. This administration is compiling quite \na record on secrecy. That bothers me. It concerns me. I think the \nAmerican people are smart enough and mature enough to take whatever \ninformation there is about whatever is happening in the world--whether \nit is threats we may face or the judicial philosophy of a nominee. That \nis how a democracy is supposed to work. If we lose our openness, if we \nturn over our rights to have information, we are on a slippery slope to \nlose our democracy. Now, of course, in times of national crisis and \nthreat like we face now, there are some things you cannot share with \neveryone. But you certainly can and should share them with the people's \nelected representatives. That is why we are here. I err on the side of \ntrying to make sure we share as much information as possible.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the White House will not \nshare information about this nominee. Until it does, until Mr. Estrada \nis willing to answer these questions, I have to stand with my colleague \nfrom Idaho--I cannot cast a vote until I know a little bit more about \nthe judicial philosophy. This is not a Republican or Democratic \nrequest. This is a senatorial request.\n\n[[Page S2671]]\n\nThis is what the Senate is supposed to be doing.\n  I urge our colleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle, do \nwhatever you can to persuade the White House and the Justice Department \nto level with the Senate, to level with the American people, to provide \nthe information that will enable us to make an informed decision and \nfulfill our constitutional responsibility.\n  It seems to me to be the very minimum we can ask. It certainly is \nwhat has been provided and asked for in the past. I hope it will be \nforthcoming, that the letter sent by Senators Daschle and Leahy will \nget a favorable response, we will be able to get the information the \nJudiciary Committee has requested, that many Members feel we need, and \nwe can move on. We can tend to the people's business, including the \nneed to reform our foster care system to try to save the lives of so \nmany children who would otherwise be left behind and left out of the \ngreat promise of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander.) The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. When I was growing up, there was a tradition in the \nSenate that I observed as an outsider, of course, about how the Senate \nhandled its constitutional function of giving advice and consent for \npresidential nominees. The Senate pretty much understood on the basis \nof a bipartisan consensus that its role was secondary, that its power \nwas a check rather than a primary power to appoint people, either to \nthe executive branch or to the judicial branch. I observed that \nSenators pretty much voted to confirm Presidential nominees if they \nbelieved those nominees were competent and if they believed those \nnominees were honest, and they did not inquire too greatly of the \nnominees' philosophy for the executive or into the nominees' \njurisprudence for the legislative. There would be flaps or personal \nproblems, but basically that was the role the Senate played and the \ntraditional understanding of its constitutional function.\n  Unfortunately, I think we will all agree, that consensus has broken \ndown over the last few years. We will all agree that both sides have \nsome responsibility for that consensus breaking down. What we are \nexperiencing now from the Senators who are opposing and filibustering \nthe Estrada nomination is so extreme given the past traditions of the \nSenate that it threatens the spirit and, I argue, even the letter of \nthe Constitution, and it threatens the ability of the Senate and the \nintegrity of the Senate to do the work of the people.\n  Let me go into that a little bit. First of all, I take it from my \nunderstanding of the debate that the Senators who are opposing Mr. \nEstrada are not questioning his abilities as a lawyer or his honesty or \nintegrity as an individual. I appreciate that. This is not a personal \nattack on Mr. Estrada. No one is saying he is unqualified as a lawyer. \nNo one is saying he is dishonest in terms of his professional dealings \nor dishonest as a man and, indeed, you could not say that based on his \nexperience which is clearly well known after the hours of debate we \nhave put into this nomination.\n  He arrived in this country knowing very little English. He worked his \nway up, if you will. He was a leader in his law school class. He was on \nthe Law Review. An achievement he was able to get, as not all of us \nwere able to get, he clerked for an outstanding judge, a Democratic \nappointee on the Second Circuit, and then on the Supreme Court, and did \nan outstanding job in the Solicitor General's Office, according to his \nsupervisors of both parties.\n  No one is questioning his abilities or honesty, as I understand it. \nAs I understand, no one is saying they think he is not competent or \nhonest in the sense of the standard that traditionally had been \napplied. What they are saying is this. They are saying, first of all, \nthey will vote against the nominee, even to an appellate court, because \nthey disagree with that nominee's jurisprudence, which is, itself, a \nstep beyond what the Senate ever did in the past. But they are going \nbeyond that. They are saying they will vote against the nominee, even \nto an appellate court, not just because they disagree with his \njurisprudence, but because they suspect they might disagree with his \njurisprudence.\n  And if he answered questions no other nominee who worked for the \nSolicitor General's Office has ever been expected to answer, and which \nthey should not have to answer, given the need for the integrity of the \nexecutive branch, but they are going beyond that.\n  The opponents on this floor of the Estrada nomination are not just \nsaying they will vote against nominees if they disagree with their \njurisprudence, or vote against them if they suspect they might disagree \nwith their jurisprudence; they are saying they are not even going to \nallow a vote on a nominee even to an appellate court if they suspect \nthey might disagree with that nominee's jurisprudence.\n  I ask my colleagues, I beg my colleagues who are opposing this \nnomination, to consider what this new standard, if it were to be \nadopted by the Senate as a whole, would mean for the Constitution, \nwould mean for the Senate, and would mean for Estrada, as well.\n  As I said, the Constitution assigned, we can all agree, the primary \npower of appointment to the President. Yet the Constitution shares some \nof that power with the Senate and that is not unusual. Even though we \nhave a separation of powers, there are a number of instances where the \nexecutive is given a little legislative power, or the legislative is \ngiven a little executive power. For example, when the President is \ngiven the power to negotiate treaties and conclude them with foreign \ncountries but subject to the requirement that two-thirds of the Senate \nratify those treaties. So the Senate is given, in effect, a little \nexecutive power.\n  The Framers of the Constitution knew how to provide for the Senate to \nexercise the executive power they gave it by a supermajority vote when \nthey wanted to provide that.\n  When the Framers said, we want to actually take a little bit more \npower away from the President, they said, we are not only going to \nrequire that the Senate ratify treaties but we are going to require \nthat they ratify them by a supermajority vote, a two-thirds vote. The \nFramers knew how do to that when they wanted to do it. The assumption \nis they didn't want to take that extra measure of power away from the \nexecutive. Yes, they wanted to share the power of appointments with the \nSenate, as several colleagues have said. They are correct in saying \nthat. The Senate is a partner in this process. But according to its \ntraditions, it has always been a junior partner. According to the \nspirit of the Constitution, it exercises this partnership by a majority \nvote and not a supermajority vote.\n  If we adopt the tradition in this body that we will filibuster \nnominees, if we suspect we might disagree with their jurisprudence, we \nare in effect saying it will require 60 votes for this body to confirm \na judicial nomination. That, I submit to you, is a usurpation of the \nexecutive authority as granted under the Constitution. It is a shift in \nconstitutional authority away from the executive and to the \nlegislature--and not even to the Congress as a whole but to the Senate.\n  As much as I stand up for the Senator from New York in saying as much \nas we have to stand up for the prerogatives and the authority of the \nSenate under the Constitution, our first responsibility is to the \nConstitution and to the distribution of powers, as the letter of the \nConstitution indicates and as the traditions of this Senate have always \nconfirmed.\n  I am deeply concerned. If we were to adopt the standards being \napplied here to Miguel Estrada across the board, we would be doing \nsomething which is unconstitutional and which violates the spirit and I \nbelieve the letter of the Constitution as well.\n  My second concern is that this kind of a filibuster under these \ncircumstances will poison the operation of the Senate on other matters. \nThe filibuster, whatever you think of it, is a power that should be \nreserved for issues of only the greatest seriousness. I am not saying \nan appellate court nomination isn't important, it is important, but it \nis an appellate court nomination. Mr. Estrada, if he is confirmed to \nthis post, whatever my colleagues may suspect his jurisprudence might \nlead him to do, is not going to change settled interpretations of the \nConstitution of the United States that can only occur on the Supreme \nCourt level. And to haul out the nuclear\n\n[[Page S2672]]\n\nweapon, if you will, of a filibuster on an issue that, while important, \nis not of the first letter of importance undermines the integrity and \nthe ability of this Senate to pull together on issues that are of the \nfirst importance.\n  I agree with the Senator from New York. We need to get on to issues \nof health care. We need to get on to issues of education. We need to \nget on to issues of defense and of tax relief to create jobs. All of \nthese things are very important. That is why we should not filibuster \nan appellate court nomination. Allow a vote at least, I ask my \ncolleagues.\n  Let me say finally that I am concerned about the effect of this on \nthe justice that we as a body and as Americans owe to the man whose \ninterests and whose career are at stake here. Miguel Estrada is, after \nall, a person. Sometimes the great forces of history, of cultural \ndivision, and focus on personal disputes involving broader issues come \nto focus on one man or one woman. We have seen that happen sometimes in \nour history. And it may be unavoidable. But we should always keep in \nmind that we are dealing with a human being, a person who has done his \nbest by his life to keep his obligations to his colleagues and to his \ncountry--a person who has excelled by any standard. None is questioning \nthat--a person who has conducted himself with integrity and has done so \nin a town where it is sometimes difficult to conduct yourself with \nintegrity. And his professional future is hanging, if you will, on a \nthread. We ought to consider what is just to him. He deserves this \npost. He has worked hard for it. His qualifications qualify him for the \npost. We should at least give him a vote.\n  That is why the newspapers and the opinion of this country for the \nlast week or so have been decidedly in favor, if not of Mr. Estrada and \nI think most of the opinion of the country has indeed be in favor of \nconfirming him for the reasons I have indicated--but at least in favor \nof giving him a vote.\n  I am not going to read all of the editorials, certainly. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial of \nFebruary 7, 2003, from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, one my hometown \nnewspapers, and also a letter--they may already be in the Record--and \none in the New York Daily News by Gov. George Pataki.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the New York Daily News, Feb. 17, 2003]\n\n                   The Senate Should Confirm Estrada\n\n                       (By Gov. George E. Pataki)\n\n       Miguel Estrada, President Bush's nominee for the District \n     of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, is a New York success \n     story--the embodiment of all that has made our state a beacon \n     of freedom and opportunity around the globe.\n       His life is an inspiration to us all, especially to the \n     children of new immigrants. Yet his nomination has gotten \n     caught up in the all-too-familiar Washington game of partisan \n     politics. That's wrong. When the Senate returns from its \n     break, it should act quickly to end this senseless bickering.\n       Born in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Estrada came to the U.S. in \n     1978. Just 17, he could barely speak English. He proved to be \n     a quick study. Just five years later, he graduated with \n     honors from Columbia University.\n       After a three-year stint at Harvard Law School, where he \n     served as editor of the prestigious Harvard Law Review, \n     Estrada came home to New York to clerk for a federal \n     appellate judge, Amalya Kearse, who was appointed by \n     Democratic President Jimmy Carter.\n       After a clerkship with the Supreme Court--one of the \n     highest honors a young lawyer can receive--Estrada spent \n     three years as a federal prosecutor in New York City. He \n     argued numerous cases before appellate courts and 15 cases \n     before the Supreme Court. No wonder the American Bar \n     Association gave him its highest rating: well-qualified.\n       Estrada's compelling life story and superlative \n     qualifications explain why his nomination has elicited such \n     broad support. No fewer than 18 Hispanic organizations and \n     countless individuals have called on the Senate to confirm \n     him. Herman Badillo, a former Democratic congressman from New \n     York, calls him ``a role model, not just for Hispanics, but \n     for all immigrants and their children.''\n       The League of United Latin American Citizens calls Estrada \n     ``one of the rising stars in the Hispanic community and a \n     role model for our youth.'' And the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of \n     Commerce calls his nomination a ``historic event.''\n       Estrada's nomination is equally popular among Democrats. \n     Former vice President Al Gore's chief of staff testifies that \n     he is ``a person of outstanding character and tremendous \n     intellect'' with an ``incredible record of achievement.'' \n     Former President Bill Clinton's solicitor general describes \n     Estrada as ``a model of professionalism and competence.''\n       The support for Estrada is as deep as it is wide. Yet some \n     Democrats in the Senate are filibustering his nomination--\n     talking it to death and refusing to let their colleagues \n     vote. That's just wrong. In fact, in the two centuries since \n     our nation was founded, that has never happened to a nominee \n     for the federal appellate courts.\n       Simply put, the Senate should do its job, put aside \n     partisan politics and vote on Estrada's nomination. It's just \n     common sense--but unfortunately, common sense all too often \n     gets shoved aside by party politics in Washington.\n       Here in New York, we know that now more than ever we must \n     put aside partisan differences and work together for the best \n     interests of all New Yorkers. We also know that the efforts \n     of new immigrants or their children who, through hard work, \n     achieved the American dream--New Yorkers like Badillo, \n     Secretary of State Powell and Estrada--must be rewarded and \n     emulated, not held hostage to party politics.\n       Estrada has reached the pinnacle of his profession and is a \n     credit to the people of New York. When the Senate finally \n     confirms him, I have every confidence he likewise will prove \n     a credit to America's judicial system.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 18, 2003]\n\n                               Just Vote\n\n       The Senate has recessed without voting on the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit. Because of a Democratic filibuster, it spent much of \n     the week debating Mr. Estrada, and, at least for now, enough \n     Democrats are holding together to prevent the full Senate \n     from acting. The arguments against Mr. Estrada's confirmation \n     range from the unpersuasive to the offensive. He lacks \n     judicial experience, his critics say--though only three \n     current members of the court had been judges before their \n     nominations. He is too young--though he is about the same age \n     as Judge Harry T. Edwards was when he was appointed and \n     several years older than Kenneth W. Starr was when he was \n     nominated. Mr. Estrada stonewalled the Judiciary Committee by \n     refusing to answer questions--though his answers were similar \n     in nature to those of previous nominees, including many \n     nominated by Democratic presidents. The administration \n     refused to turn over his Justice Department memos--though no \n     reasonable Congress ought to be seeking such materials, as a \n     letter from all living former solicitors general attests. He \n     is not a real Hispanic and, by the way, he was nominated only \n     because he is Hispanic--two arguments as repugnant as they \n     are incoherent. Underlying it all is the fact that Democrats \n     don't want to put a conservative on the court.\n       Laurence H. Silberman, a senior judge on the court to which \n     Mr. Estrada aspires to serve, recently observed that under \n     the current standards being applied by the Senate, not one of \n     his colleagues could predictably secure confirmation. He's \n     right. To be sure, Republicans missed few opportunities to \n     play politics with President Clinton's nominees. But the \n     Estrada filibuster is a step beyond even those deplorable \n     games. For Democrats demand, as a condition of a vote, \n     answers to questions that no nominee should be forced to \n     address--and that nominees have not previously been forced to \n     address. If Mr. Estrada cannot get a vote, there will be no \n     reason for Republicans to allow the next David S. Tatel--a \n     distinguished liberal member of the court--to get one when a \n     Democrat someday again picks judges. Yet the D.C. Circuit--\n     and all courts, for that matter--would be all the poorer were \n     it composed entirely of people whose views challenged nobody.\n       Nor is the problem just Mr. Estrada. John G. Roberts Jr., \n     Mr. Bush's other nominee to the D.C. Circuit, has been \n     waiting nearly two years for a Judiciary Committee vote. \n     Nobody has raised to substantial argument against him. \n     Indeed, Mr. Roberts is among the most highly regarded \n     appellate lawyers in the city. Yet on Thursday, Democrats \n     invoked a procedural rule to block a committee vote anyway-\n     just for good measure. It's long past time to stop these \n     games and vote.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Feb. 7, 2003]\n\n                       A Filibuster Is Not a Fix\n\n       The process for appointing federal judges is badly broken. \n     A filibuster won't fix it.\n       Democrats are trying to decide whether to filibuster the \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada to the powerful federal appeals \n     court for the District of Columbia. They consider Mr. Estrada \n     a stealth conservative who is being groomed for the U.S. \n     Supreme Court as a Hispanic Clarence Thomas.\n       The Democrats' fear may turn out to be valid. But the \n     filibuster is the parliamentary equivalent of declaring war. \n     Instead of declaring war, the Democrats should sue for peace \n     and try and to fix the process.\n       The Senate's confirmation process is not supposed to be a \n     rubber stamp. Judicial nominees have been defeated for \n     political reasons--often good political reasons. The Supreme \n     Court is a better place without Clement Haynsworth, Harrold \n     Carswell and Robert Bork. But ever since Mr. Bork, the \n     process of advise and consent has become attack and delay.\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\n       During Bill Clinton's presidency, the GOP-controlled Senate \n     held up highly qualified nominees for ideological reasons. \n     Then, during the two years of Democratic control, the Senate \n     held up highly qualified nominees from President George W. \n     Bush. Now the Republicans are ramming through judges as fast \n     as McDonald's sling burgers.\n       The only consistent principle in this recent Senate history \n     is that turnabout is fair play. That's a poor way to choose \n     judges.\n       Mr. Bush, like Ronald Reagan, considers conservative \n     ideology a key qualification for judgeship. Unfortunately, \n     Senate Democrats have set upon highly qualified nominees--\n     such as Michael McConnell, a brilliant law professor, who was \n     eventually confirmed--as wolfishly as they have upon weaker \n     nominees, such as Charles Pickering.\n       In an ideal world, Mr. Bush would realize that the \n     lackluster Mr. Pickering, a friend of Sen. Trent Lott, R-\n     Miss., raises divisive racial questions. In an ideal world, \n     the president would nominate the best-qualified legal minds, \n     not ideologies.\n       But in the real world, Mr. Pickering is acceptable and Mr. \n     Estrada is well-qualified. Mr. Estrada is an immigrant from \n     Honduras who went to Harvard Law School, clerked on the \n     Supreme Court and worked in the Solicitor General's office. \n     Democrats, frustrated by the absence of a paper trail, and \n     Mr. Estrada's sometimes-evasive answers on issues such as \n     abortion, tried to get legal memos that Mr. Estrada wrote \n     while in the Solicitor General's office. But both Democratic \n     and Republican solicitors general have urged that the memos \n     be kept private so that future solicitors general receive \n     candid views from their staff.\n       In short, the Democratic position doesn't justify a \n     filibuster. Instead, Democrats should reach out to \n     Republicans and try to develop a bipartisan truce that gives \n     judges prompt, but thorough, hearings that will speed the \n     important process of filling the many vacancies on the \n     federal bench.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I want to read an editorial from the \nFebruary 18 issue of the Washington Post. It sums up the case better \nthan or as well as I can:\n\n       The Senate has recessed without voting on the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit. Because of a Democratic filibuster, it spent much of \n     the week debating Mr. Estrada, and, at least for now, enough \n     Democrats are holding together to prevent the full senate \n     from acting.\n\n  We all know a filibuster is underway here, an obstruction tactic.\n  That is not from the editorial. That was my editorial comment.\n\n       The arguments against Mr. Estrada's confirmation range from \n     the unpersuasive to the offensive. He lacks judicial \n     experience, his critics say--though only three current \n     members of the court had been judges before their \n     nominations. He is too young--though he is about the same age \n     as Judge Harry T. Edwards was when he was appointed and \n     several years older than Kenneth W. Starr was when he was \n     nominated. Mr. Estrada stonewalled the Judiciary Committee by \n     refusing to answer questions--though his answers were similar \n     in nature to those of previous nominees, including many \n     nominated by Democratic presidents. The administration \n     refused to turn over his Justice Department memos--though no \n     reasonable Congress ought to be seeking such material, as a \n     letter from all living former solicitors general attests. He \n     is not a real Hispanic and, by the way, he was nominated only \n     because he is Hispanic--two arguments as repugnant as they \n     are incoherent. Underlying it all is the fact that Democrats \n     don't want to put a conservative on the court.\n       Laurence H. Silberman, a senior judge on the court to which \n     Mr. Estrada aspires to serve, recently observed that under \n     the current standards being applied by the Senate . . .\n\n  I ask you to listen carefully to this.\n\n     . . . being applied by the Senate, not one of his colleagues \n     could predictably secure confirmation. He's right. To be \n     sure, Republicans missed few opportunities to play politics \n     with President Clinton's nominees. But the Estrada filibuster \n     is a step beyond even those deplorable games. For Democrats \n     demand, as a condition of a vote, answers to questions that \n     no nominee should be forced to address--and that nominees \n     have not previously been forced to address. If Mr. Estrada \n     cannot get a vote, there will be no reason for Republicans to \n     allow the next David S. Tatel--a distinguished liberal member \n     of the court--to get one when a Democrat someday again picks \n     judges. Yet the D.C. Circuit--and all courts, for that \n     matter--would be all the poorer were it composed entirely of \n     people whose views challenged nobody.\n       Nor is the problem just Mr. Estrada. John G. Roberts Jr., \n     Mr. Bush's other nominee to the D.C. Circuit, has been \n     waiting nearly two years for a Judiciary Committee vote. \n     Nobody has raised a substantial argument against him. Indeed, \n     Mr. Roberts is among the most highly regarded appellate \n     lawyers in the city. Yet on Thursday, Democrats invoked a \n     procedural rule to block a committee vote anyway--just for \n     good measure. It's long past time to stop these games and \n     vote.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to consider carefully--and I know there have been \nabuses of this process on both sides of the aisle--but I ask my \ncolleagues to consider carefully whether, in the name of the \nConstitution, in the name of the obligation of this Senate to go on to \nother things and resolve them, in the name of comity and the traditions \nof this body, the Washington Post isn't right, and whether it isn't \nlong past time to stop these games and vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, let me respond to my colleague and \nfriend from the State of Missouri which adjoins my home State of \nIllinois.\n  I say to him, I do not disagree with many of the things he said. This \ndebate over Miguel Estrada should not be about the person. I have met \nhim. I sat down in my office with him. He has a very impressive life \nstory to tell having come to the United States as an immigrant when he \nwas about 17 years old, with a limited command of English. The man had \nsome extraordinary achievements. He went on to become the editor of the \nLaw Review at Harvard, served as a member of the Department of Justice, \nworked at the Supreme Court as a clerk. He is with a major, prestigious \nlaw firm. You would really be hard pressed to find anything in his \nbackground that is anything short of impressive. That is not the issue.\n  The fact that he is Hispanic, I say to my friend from Missouri, in my \nmind, is a plus in many respects. It certainly is not a minus. I was \nhonored to name a Hispanic to the district court in Chicago when I had \nthat opportunity a few years ago. I believe our judiciary should \nreflect the diversity of the United States. And if this is an example \nof affirmative action by the White House to put a Hispanic on the DC \nCircuit court, I say: Three cheers. I think it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  It has nothing to do with his Hispanic heritage. As I said, that is a \nplus. There is nothing negative about that in any respect. What is at \nissue, and the reason the Senate has been tied up with this nomination, \nis the fact that Mr. Estrada has not been forthright in explaining who \nhe is in terms of what he believes. And that is a fair question.\n  If we are going to give someone a lifetime appointment to the DC \nCircuit court--which is not just another court for the District of \nColumbia, but a major court in our Federal judicial system--I think it \nis not only reasonable, it is imperative that the Senate ask basic \nquestions of Mr. Estrada. And we did. Time and time again, he stopped \nshort of answering because that is now the drill at the Department of \nJustice.\n  The nominees go through this very rigorous training about how to \nhandle a Senate judicial hearing. I am told they have videotapes and \nplay them back and they ask them the questions most often asked of \nnominees. They school them in the answers to give to not reveal, at any \npoint, what they really think, trying to get away with saying as little \nas possible, trying to get through the hearing with a smile on their \nface and their family behind them, and trying to get through the Senate \nwithout any controversy.\n  There is nothing wrong with that if a person has a history that you \ncan turn to and say, well, this man or this woman has been on the bench \nfor so many years and has handed down so many opinions. And we have \nread them. We know what they believe. They have expressed themselves \nover and over again. Or if they have published law journal articles, \nfor example, that explain their point of view, that is all there for \nthe record. You could draw your own conclusions.\n  But in the case of Mr. Estrada, none of that is there. He has not \ndone that much in terms of publications nor involvement in cases. We \nsaid to him: Help us understand you. If you will not answer the \nquestion directly, let us at least look at the legal documents you \nprepared so we can see how you analyzed the law.\n  That has been done before. Other nominees have offered that \ninformation. Mr. Estrada said: I would be happy to share it with you as \nwell. But the Department of Justice stepped in and the White House \nstepped in and said: No, we will not let the Senate see what Mr. \nEstrada has written as an attorney.\n\n  Why? Why would they want to conceal this information, unless, in \nfact, there is something very controversial and worrisome.\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\n  So we come here today not with any personal animus against Miguel \nEstrada. To the contrary, on a personal basis, he is a very \nextraordinary individual personally, academically, and professionally. \nBut we have a right to ask these questions. Let me restate that. We \nhave a responsibility to ask those questions, to make certain that each \nman and woman headed for this awesome lifetime appointment, this \nawesome position of responsibility, really is the person we want in \nthat position.\n  Now, make no mistake, with President Bush in the White House, the \nnominees are more than likely to be Republican, more than likely to be \nconservative, more than likely to be members--proud members--of the \nFederalist Society. I know that. That is the nature of this process, \nthe nature of politics. Yet it is still our responsibility to make \ncertain they are just conservative and not extreme in their positions. \nWe cannot draw that conclusion on Miguel Estrada because he has \ncarefully concealed what he really believes. And that is why we are \nhere.\n  So as a result of focusing on this nomination for 3 straight weeks, \nwe have ignored so many other issues that should be brought to the \nSenate. We could resolve this issue tomorrow morning easily.\n  Senator Bennett, a Republican, of Utah has come to the floor and made \na suggestion that I think is eminently reasonable. Let Miguel Estrada \nturn over his legal writings so they can be reviewed by Senator Hatch \nand Senator Leahy. And if they find anything in there of moment, of \nconsequence, or of controversy, let them follow through with the \nquestions or, if necessary, a hearing, and let's be done with it, a \nvote up or down.\n  Senator Daschle came to the floor today, the Democratic leader, and \nsaid that would be perfectly acceptable. We would have the information, \nand then we could reach our conclusion. And in the process we could be \nprotecting our responsibility as Members of the Senate.\n  It has nothing to do with Miguel Estrada personally, but it does have \nsomething to do with our constitutional authority and responsibility to \nreview each nominee.\n\n\n                                Ephedra\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to address another issue that is \ntotally unrelated.\n  On February 14, a Friday, I stood in this spot and spoke about an \nissue, one that has been on my mind for almost 6 months, an issue which \nworries me, concerns me, because it relates to the health and safety of \nAmerican families.\n  On that day, I challenged the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nTommy Thompson, under his authority to protect American families, to \nprotect them against a nutritional supplement known as ephedra. You \nwill find this supplement in a lot of diet pills, pills that are being \nsold over the counter as a supplement or vitamin or food product. They \nare sold as a way to lose weight or increase your energy or \nperformance.\n  People come in and buy them, with no restriction on how old you have \nto be or what your health is or what might interact with these \nsupplements. And people buy those and find out, in many instances, that \nnot only don't they work, they are dangerous.\n\n  I have challenged Secretary Thompson for 6 months--6 months--to take \nthese dangerous products off the market, and he has not done so. That \nwas February 14.\n  On February 16, a pitcher from the Baltimore Orioles dropped dead \nduring training. He had cardiac arrest, and the coroner who examined \nhis body afterwards--those who did the autopsy--disclosed the fact that \nhe had used these supplements with ephedra. That was 2 days after I had \ngiven that speech.\n  Time has run out for Steve Bechler and for many like him when it \ncomes to protection from the harm of dangerous dietary supplements \ncontaining ephedra. We cannot bring Steve Bechler or my own constituent \nin Lincoln, IL, Sean Riggins, back. But we can fight to make sure this \ndangerous product is taken off the market immediately.\n  Sean Riggins was a 16-year-old boy. And about 4 weeks after I held a \nhearing in Washington, he went into a convenience store in Lincoln, IL, \na small town, and bought--off the counter, with no identification, no \ncheck--a pill that was supposed to help him to perform better as a \nfootball player. The pill had ephedra in it. As best we can determine, \nSean Riggins--this healthy football player, 16 years old--washed down \nthat pill with Mountain Dew or some other product with caffeine in it \nand went into cardiac arrest and died. This healthy young man died, \nafter taking a pill sold over the counter that contained ephedra.\n  I cannot think of another product that has generated so many adverse \nevents, so many bad results--some extremely serious, even fatal--and \nyet has failed to generate any response from this Government to protect \nfamilies and individuals buying these products.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has received over 18,000 reports of \nadverse events, serious health consequences, from those using ephedra \nand within those 18,000 over 100 deaths. Yet the Food and Drug \nAdministration and Secretary Thompson refuse to act. They want to study \nthe issue. And as they study, innocent people die.\n  Last August, I wrote to Secretary Thompson and urged him to ban these \nproducts. At that time, Lee Smith, an airline pilot from Nevada, had \nnot yet suffered the debilitating stroke that cost him his health and \nhis job due to ephedra.\n  I again wrote to Secretary Thompson on August 22. At that time, when \nI sent him a letter begging him to do something about these products, \nmy constituent, Sean Riggins--that healthy 16-year-old boy in Lincoln, \nIL, who played football and wrestled for his high school team--was \nstill alive. He died September 3, after consuming an ephedra product \ncalled yellow jacket. You will find those by cash registers at gas \nstations and convenience stores across America--kids popping them \nbecause they think they make them better performers when it comes to \nsports or, even worse, taking these pills and drinking beer, craziness \nthat leads to terrible health consequences. And those pills are sold \nover the counter, with no Government control.\n  I wrote again, and I spoke directly to Secretary Tommy Thompson in \nSeptember and October. My Governmental Affairs Subcommittee had \nhearings on the dangers of ephedra in July and October.\n  I again urged the Secretary, in a letter sent to him less than 1 \nmonth before Steve Bechler of the Baltimore Orioles died. Incidentally, \ndid you see the followup articles in the sports pages, as other \nathletes, professional baseball players such as David Wells came \nforward and told his story about how he wanted to lose some weight, and \nhe took an ephedra product and his heart was racing at 200 beats a \nminute. He flat-lined. He was almost in cardiac arrest before they \nfinally brought him back.\n  These are not sickly individuals. These are healthy athletes who are \ntaking these products sold over the counter and risking their lives in \nthe process.\n  Yet the most we can get from Secretary Thompson in response is a \nsuggestion that maybe we need a warning label. When the reporters asked \nhim this past weekend about Steve Bechler of the Baltimore Orioles, his \ndeath because of ephedra, the Secretary was quoted as saying: ``I \nwouldn't use it, would you?''\n  Well, I must say to the Secretary, this is not a matter of his \npersonal preference. It is not a matter of whether as a consumer he \nwould buy the product. It is a matter of his personal responsibility, \nhis responsibility as Secretary of Health and Human Services to get \nthis dangerous product off the shelves of American stores today and to \nprotect families.\n  I am not the only person calling for this ban on ephedra products. \nThe American Medical Association, representing over 200,000 doctors, \ncalled on Secretary Thompson to ban ephedra products. They didn't do it \nlast week after Steve Bechler died. No. They did it over a year ago \nafter Canada had banned this product for sale in their country. They \nwent to Secretary Thompson and said it is dangerous to sell in the \nUnited States. He has done nothing.\n  Let me tell you another thing you might not know. The U.S. Army has \nbanned the sale of ephedra in their commissaries worldwide after 33\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\nephedra-related deaths occurred among American servicemen. Does this \nmake any sense? We believe as a government that we need to protect the \nmen and women in uniform and so we ban the sale of these products at \ncommissaries across the world, and yet the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration \nwill not ban the sale of these products in convenience stores and \ndrugstores and gas stations across America.\n  When you ask him about it, the Secretary says: I am studying it. I \nhave a group called the RAND Commission that is going to study it.\n  With all due respect, we don't need another study. The Food and Drug \nAdministration has received over 18,000 adverse reports about ephedra. \nThe FDA could do followup on the most serious ones. In fact, the FDA \ndid commission a review of adverse reports several years ago. That \nreview by Drs. Haller and Benowitz established that 31 percent of the \nreports were definitely or probably related to ephedra and an \nadditional 31 were deemed to be possibly related.\n  We understand what we are up against. Ephedra is a danger. It is so \ndangerous that when it was used in its synthetic form with caffeine, \nthat was banned over 15 years ago. They said you couldn't sell a drug \nin America, nor could you sell an over-the-counter drug product in \nAmerica that contained ephedra and caffeine because, put together, it \nis a dangerous and sometimes lethal combination. But yet if you step \nback from the over-the-counter drugs and call it a nutrition \nsupplement, a vitamin, a food, you are totally exempt from that \nprohibition. You can combine those two lethal substances, ephedra and \ncaffeine, and sell them with impunity. Does that make any sense? Is \nthat protecting consumers across America? Is that what you expect from \nyour government?\n\n  Certainly it is not what I expect. Many of these companies say it is \na natural product. Ephedra is naturally occurring. That is no defense. \nArsenic is a natural product. Hemlock is a natural product. That \ndoesn't mean that they are safe. In fact, they are dangerous.\n  We have seen a lot of studies that have come out about ephedra. We \nknow what needs to be done. Many States have already taken action. \nBecause the Federal Government has failed to act, over 20 States have \nenacted restrictions on the sale of ephedra-containing products.\n  Incidentally, if you think these products are something you have \nnever heard of, the leading sales of ephedra products are under the \nbrand name Metabolife 365. You have seen them advertised on television \nand in magazines. Every time you walk into a drugstore and convenience \nstore, you find: Metabolife tablets help you lose weight. Look \ncarefully. Many of them contain ephedra, this lethal drug which has \nkilled so many people.\n  Suffolk County, a week or so ago in New York, decided to ban this \nproduct as well after a 20-year-old named Peter Schlendorf died in \n1996, and others suffered serious consequences. They understood, as the \nU.S. Army, Canada, Britain, Australia, and Germany, that action had to \nbe taken to protect the residents. The National Football League, the \nNCAA, and the International Olympic Commission have reached the same \nconclusion, banning the use of this product by athletes.\n  I wrote to the Baseball Commissioner, Bud Selig, last week and to the \nBaseball Players' Association urging them to follow suit. The question \nisn't whether these individual organizations will show responsibility. \nThe question is whether this Government will accept its responsibility.\n  I don't know Secretary Thompson that well. I have met him a few \ntimes. He is a very likable person. He certainly has had a \ndistinguished public career in the State of Wisconsin, serving as a \nlegislator and Governor of the State for many years, one of the most \npopular elected officials in its history. Everyone tells me this man \nreally understands public service. I believe it.\n  This really seems to be a blind spot. When I talked to Secretary \nThompson on the phone about these products, he said: How are we going \nto stop these fellows from selling these products and endangering \npeople? I said: Mr. Secretary, you can stop them. You have the \nauthority to stop them.\n  Time passes and nothing happens. I understand this industry is \npowerful. I have heard from them. I have heard from my colleagues in \nthe Senate and House who have said: Don't take on these folks in the \nvitamin and nutritional supplement industry. They really have a lot of \npolitical clout. They do. But for goodness' sakes, if you can't stand \nup to an industry that is selling a lethal product to protect American \nfamilies, why in the world would you take the oath of office to serve \nin the Senate? I think every Member understands that responsibility. It \ngoes beyond political fear. It goes right to the heart of your \npolitical responsibility, the oath of office we all take and one we all \nvalue so much.\n  In closing, I say to Secretary Thompson, you have another chance now. \nIt is a chance which I pray you will take. The last time I made a \nspeech on the floor of the Senate about this issue, Steve Bechler of \nthe Baltimore Orioles, a man in his early twenties, a promising athlete \nwith a great future ahead of him, was still alive. Sadly, he is not \nalive today. He took this product and he died as a result. Others will, \ntoo.\n  That story, that tragic story of Steve Bechler, Sean Riggins, and so \nmany others will be repeated over and over again. This industry may \nhave political clout, but it does not have a conscience. It is up to \nthe Secretary, as head of the Health and Human Services Department, to \naccept his responsibility to protect American families. A warning label \nis not enough. You cannot get by with putting a label on this product, \nsaying: Caution, use of this product may cause stroke, a coronary \nevent, or death. Why in the world would you allow such a product to be \nsold over the counter, unregulated in terms of the age of the buyer, \nunregulated in terms of the dosage? How in the world can you justify \nthat kind of a thing?\n  The Secretary needs to accept his responsibility, and if he does, I \nwill be the first to applaud him. But until he does, stay tuned. You \nwill continue to hear these speeches on the floor from me and others \nwhile helpless victims across America fall because of their consumption \nof this deadly product.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. As the Senator knows, the Senate has been tied up in the \nmatter of Miguel Estrada for 9 or 10 days. From what the Senator said, \nI don't know much about the product, but he has made a very persuasive \nargument. It seems to me if the administration and the Secretary, as \npart of the administration, refuses to do anything administratively, \nmaybe we could well use some Senate time debating this issue. Maybe \nthere should be a moratorium put on the sale of this until further \ninformation is obtained on it. I make that suggestion.\n  My direct question, if the Secretary refuses to do something \nforthwith, wouldn't we well use the time that is now being spent on \nthis nomination talking about this product that has killed people as \nthe Senator has related?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is absolutely right. In fact, we not only \ncould, we should. We should accept that responsibility. We do have this \nGovernment which has three coequal branches. If the executive branch \nand Secretary Thompson refuses to use the authority he has under the \nlaw, frankly, I think we should ban the sale of this product in the \nU.S.\n\n  As the Senator knows, we have been tied up for 3 weeks because Miguel \nEstrada refuses to disclose legal writings he has made. Even Republican \nSenators have suggested that he should.\n  We have waited for Republicans to understand that with more \ninformation, we can put this behind us and move on to other important \nbusiness--not just questions about health and safety, but questions \nabout the economy of this Nation, issues on which we ought to be \ndebating and acting.\n  In closing, I am just going to ask Secretary Thompson again to take \nthis very seriously. I hope we don't have to read about more athletes \nand other unsuspecting individuals and children who lose their lives as \na result of these dangerous products. I say to any citizens following \nthis debate, please think twice before you use a product containing \nephedra. There are too many\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\ncases of death and serious health consequences for people who thought \nthey were taking an innocent little pill that can be sold over the \ncounter at a convenience store. In fact, many have turned out to be \nlethal doses that have killed or caused a great deal of harm.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the courts provide the \nfoundation upon which the institutions of government in our free \nsociety are built. Their strength and legitimacy are derived from a \nlong tradition of Federal judges whose knowledge, integrity and \nimpartiality are beyond reproach.\n  The Senate is obligated by the Constitution--and the public \ninterest--to protect this legacy and to ensure that the public's \nconfidence in the court system is justified and continues for many \nyears to come.\n  As guardians of this trust we must carefully scrutinize the \ncredentials and qualifications of every man and woman nominated by the \nPresident to serve on the Federal bench.\n  The men and women we approve for these lifetime appointments make \nimportant decisions each and every day, which impact the American \npeople. Once on the bench they may be called upon to consider the \nextent of our right to personal privacy, our right to free speech, or \neven a criminal defendant's right to counsel. The importance of these \npositions and their influence must not be dismissed.\n  We all have benefitted from listening to the debate about Miguel \nEstrada's qualifications to serve on the D.C. Circuit.\n  I very much respect those Senators who desire to have additional \ninformation about Mr. Estrada's personal beliefs. Their efforts reflect \na sound commitment to the Senate's constitutional obligation to advise \nand consent.\n  At the same time, I am troubled by those who have suggested that some \nSenators are anti-Hispanic because they seek additional information \nabout this nominee. Poisoning the debate with baseless accusations \ndemeans the nomination process.\n  After reviewing Mr. Estrada's personal and professional credentials--\nincluding personally interviewing the nominee--I believe he is \nqualified to serve on the D.C. Circuit Court--and, I will vote in favor \nof his nomination.\n  A Federal appellate judge's power to decide and pronounce judgment \nand carry it into effect is immense and comes with a moral and legal \nobligation to conform to the highest standards of conduct.\n  Federal judges must possess a high degree of knowledge of established \nlegal principles and procedures and must also be impartial, even \ntempered and have a well-defined sense of justice, compassion and fair \nplay.\n  In addition, a judge must have the integrity to leave legislating to \nlawmakers. Judges must have the self-restraint to avoid injecting their \nown personal views or ideas that may be inconsistent with existing \ndecisional or statutory law.\n  I believe Mr. Estrada possesses the knowledge and skills needed to be \na successful court of appeals judge. Few would argue with his academic \ncredentials, litigation experience or intelligence.\n  And based on my conversation with him, and those who know him well, I \nbelieve he respects--and will honor--his moral and legal obligation to \nuphold the law impartially.\n  However, should Mr. Estrada someday be considered for a position on \nthe Supreme Court--as some have suggested he could be--I believe \nfurther inquiry not only will be justified, but necessary.\n  While appellate judges are constrained to a great degree by \nprecedent, and by a check on their power by the Supreme Court, justices \non the High Court have greater latitude to insert their own ideological \nviewpoints.\n  Mr. Estrada agreed wholeheartedly with this point when we discussed \nhis nomination.\n  Make no mistake; I believe all judicial nominees should be completely \nforthcoming during the confirmation process.\n  Mr. Estrada has argued that he's satisfied a minimum threshold of \ndisclosure, and that revealing additional information about his \npersonal ideological beliefs may compromise his image of impartiality--\nif he eventually is seated on the federal bench.\n  I disagree with his approach, because it leads to the suspicion and \nmistrust--like that which now engulfs us.\n  Furthermore, I do not believe a similar argument reasonably can be \nmade by a nominee to the Supreme Court. Ideology can be central to the \nHigh Court's decisions. As a result, absolute disclosure by Supreme \nCourt nominees is necessary to protect the public interest.\n  In sum, while I believe Mr. Estrada could have been more forthcoming \nin order to avoid this controversy, my conclusion is that he is \nqualified to serve on the D.C. Circuit.\n  Should he come before the Senate as a nominee to the Supreme Court, \nhe must be willing to provide additional information about his personal \nbeliefs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2676-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. TALENT.

KILLEY FOR 40 YEARS OF SERVICE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I salute a great American and South \nDakotan, Major General Philip G. Killey.\n  General Killey, currently the Adjutant General of the South Dakota \nNational Guard, retires at the end of this week, after 40 years of \nservice. His service includes nearly a quarter-century with the South \nDakota National Guard, including two separate appointments as Adjutant \nGeneral covering more than 6 years.\n  Since September 11, 2001, General Killey's job has become more \ndemanding and complex, but, as ever through his career, he has proven \nworthy of the challenge. Since September 11, his troops have been \nperforming a broad variety of missions, from bolstering security at our \nState's airports to enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq, from fighting \nforest fires to keeping the peace in Bosnia. All this, while also \nstaying trained and ready for their next assignment.\n  Now, that next assignment is here. About 1,200 South Dakota Guard \npersonnel have been called to active duty as part of our Nation's \nbuildup on the borders of Iraq. Given the small population of our \nState, this is a major contribution. In fact, on a per capita basis, \nSouth Dakota is contributing more Guard personnel than all but five \nother States. This is a much larger commitment than the South Dakota \nGuard was asked to provide during Desert Storm, its other major call-up \nof the post-Cold War period, and it has come at a time when General \nKilley is already managing other high-priority commitments.\n  Managing these tasks and the Iraq call-up turns out to be the \ncapstone event of General Killey's long military career, and it stands \nas a real testament to his skill and leadership. It is at critical \nmoments like this, when your resources are stretched thin and you are \nasked to do even more, that gaps in training, leadership or equipment \nwill reveal themselves. But in South Dakota, General Killey's troops \nhave met the test. They are ready, and it shows.\n  Over the years, General Killey and I have worked together on many \nfronts to improve the equipment and facilities of the Guard. In the \npast 2 years, we have been able to secure nearly $35 million in \nconstruction funds to improve 7 Guard facilities at Camp Rapid, Fort \nMeade, Pierre, Watertown, Mitchell, and Sioux Falls. We were able to\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\nsecure $97 million to upgrade 2 battalions of the multiple launch \nrocket system, one in South Dakota and one in Arkansas, making our \nartillery system one of the most modern and battle-ready in the \nNational Guard.\n  In these and other endeavors, I have come to appreciate and respect \nGeneral Killey for his vision, his energy and initiative, and his \nsophistication in dealing with both military and civilian authorities. \nIt's been a valuable and productive partnership.\n  We clearly owe a debt of gratitude to General Killey for 40 years of \npatriotic service to our State and our Nation. I am proud to call him a \nfellow South Dakotan and wish all the best for him and his wife, Ellen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2677-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2677-S2688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Res. 338, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964)\n\n       Resolved, That (a) there is hereby established a permanent \n     select committee of the Senate to be known as the Select \n     Committee on Ethics (referred to hereinafter as the ``Select \n     Committee'') consisting of six Members of the Senate, of whom \n     three shall be selected from members of the majority party \n     and three shall be selected from members of the minority \n     party. Members thereof shall be appointed by the Senate in \n     accordance with the provisions of Paragraph I of Rule XXIV of \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate at the beginning of each \n     Congress.

During the transaction of routine business any member \n     of the Select Committee constituting the quorum shall have \n     the right to postpone further discussion of a pending matter \n     until such time as a majority of the members of the Select \n     Committee are present.\n       (3) The Select Committee may fix a lesser number as a \n     quorum for the purpose of taking sworn testimony.\n       (d)(1) A member of the Select Committee shall be ineligible \n     to participate in--\n       (A) any preliminary inquiry, or adjudicatory review \n     relating to--\n       (i) the conduct of--\n       (I) such member;\n       (II) any officer or employee the member supervises; or\n       (III) any employee of any officer the member supervises; or\n       (ii) any complaint filed by the member; and\n       (B) the determinations and recommendations of the Select \n     Committee with respect to any preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review described in subparagraph (A).\n       For purposes of this paragraph, a member of the Select \n     Committee and an officer of the Senate shall be deemed to \n     supervise any officer or employee consistent with the \n     provision of paragraph 12 of Rule XXXVII of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate.\n       (2) A member of the Select Committee may, at the discretion \n     of the member, disqualify himself or herself from \n     participating in any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory \n     review pending before the Select Committee and the \n     determinations and recommendations of the Select Committee \n     with respect to any such preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory \n     review. Notice of such disqualification shall be given in \n     writing to the President of the Senate.\n       (3) Whenever any member of the Select Committee is \n     ineligible under paragraph (1) to participate in any \n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review or disqualifies \n     himself or herself under paragraph (2) from participating in \n     any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review, another \n     Senator shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (d), \n     be appointed to serve as a member of the Select Committee \n     solely for purposes of such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review and the determinations and \n     recommendations of the Select Committee with respect to such \n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. Any Member of the \n     Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the same party \n     as the Member who is ineligible or disqualifies himself or \n     herself.\n       Sec. 2. (a) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee \n     to--\n       (1) receive complaints and investigate allegations of \n     improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate, \n     violations of law, violations of the Senate Code of Official \n     Conduct and violations of rules and regulations of the \n     Senate, relating to the conduct of individuals in the \n     performance of their duties as Members of the Senate, or as \n     officers or employees of the Senate, and to make appropriate \n     findings of fact and conclusions with respect thereto;\n       (2)(A) recommend to the Senate by report or resolution by a \n     majority vote of the full committee disciplinary action to be \n     taken with respect to such violations which the Select \n     Committee shall determine, after according to the individual \n     concerned due notice and opportunity for a hearing, to have \n     occurred;\n       (B) pursuant to subparagraph (A) recommend discipline, \n     including--\n       (i) in the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these; and\n       (ii) in the case of an officer or employee, dismissal, \n     suspension, payment of restitution, or a combination of \n     these;\n       (3) subject to the provisions of subsection (e), by a \n     unanimous vote of 6 members, order that a Member, officer, or \n     employee be reprimanded or pay restitution, or both, if the \n     Select Committee determines, after according to the Member, \n     officer, or employee due notice and opportunity for a \n     hearing, that misconduct occurred warranting discipline less \n     serious than discipline by the full Senate;\n       (4) in the circumstances described in subsection (d)(3), \n     issue a public or private letter of admonition to a Member, \n     officer, or employee, which shall not be subject to appeal to \n     the Senate;\n       (5) recommend to the Senate, by report or resolution, such \n     additional rules or regulations as the Select Committee shall \n     determine to be necessary or desirable to insure proper \n     standards of conduct by Members of the Senate, and by \n     officers or employees of the Senate, in the performance of \n     their duties and the discharge of their responsibilities;\n       (6) by a majority vote of the full committee, report \n     violations of any law, including the provision of false \n     information to the Select Committee, to the proper Federal \n     and State authorities; and\n       (7) develop and implement programs and materials designed \n     to educate Members, officers, and employees about the laws, \n     rules, regulations, and standards of conduct applicable to \n     such individuals in the performance of their duties.\n       (b) For the purposes of this resolution--\n       (1) the term ``sworn compliant'' means a written statement \n     of facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the \n     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of \n     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule \n     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     individuals in the performance of their duties as Members, \n     officers, or employees of the Senate;\n       (2) the term ``preliminary inquiry'' means a proceeding \n     undertaken by the Select Committee following the receipt of a \n     complaint or allegation of, or information about, misconduct \n     by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate to determine \n     whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides \n     substantial case for the Select Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has \n     occurred; and\n       (3) the term ``adjudicatory review'' means a proceeding \n     undertaken by the Select Committee after a finding, on the \n     basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Select Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred.\n       (c)(1) No--\n       (A) adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member or officer \n     of the Senate may be conducted;\n       (B) report, resolution, or recommendation relating to such \n     an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made; and\n       (C) letter of admonition pursuant to subsection (d)(3) may \n     be issued, unless approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than 4 members of the Select Committee.\n       (2) No other resolution, report, recommendation, \n     interpretative ruling, or advisory opinion may be made \n     without an affirmative vote of a majority of the Members of \n     the Select Committee voting.\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\n       (d)(1) When the Select Committee receives a sworn complaint \n     or other allegation or information about a Member, officer, \n     or employee of the Senate, it shall promptly conduct a \n     preliminary inquiry into matters raised by that complaint, \n     allegation, or information. The preliminary inquiry shall be \n     of duration and scope necessary to determine whether that is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a violation \n     within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred. \n     The Select Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice \n     chairman the discretion to determine the appropriate \n     duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry.\n       (2) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under \n     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines by a recorded \n     vote that there is not such substantial credible evidence, \n     the Select Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Select \n     Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice chairman the \n     authority, on behalf of the Select Committee, to dismiss any \n     matter that they determine, after a preliminary inquiry, \n     lacks substantial merit. The Select Committee shall inform \n     the individual who provided to the Select Committee the \n     complaint, allegation, or information, and the individual who \n     is the subject of the complaint, allegation, or information, \n     of the dismissal, together with an explanation of the basis \n     for the dismissal.\n       (3) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under \n     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that a \n     violation is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, the Select Committee may dispose of the \n     matter by issuing a public or private letter of \n     admonition, which shall not be considered discipline. The \n     Select Committee may issue a public letter of admonition \n     upon a similar determination at the conclusion of an \n     adjudicatory review.\n       (4) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under \n     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that there is \n     such substantial credible evidence and the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (3), the Select \n     Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review. \n     Upon the conclusion of such adjudicatory review, the Select \n     Committee shall report to the Senate, as soon as practicable, \n     the results of such adjudicatory review, together with its \n     recommendations (if any) pursuant to subsection (a)(2).\n       (e)(1) Any individual who is the subject to a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection (a)(3) \n     may, within 30 days of the Select Committee's report to the \n     Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or orter of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the basis for the appeal to the Select \n     Committee and the presiding officer of the Senate. The \n     presiding officer of the Senate shall cause the notice of the \n     appeal to be printed in the Congressional Record and the \n     Senate Journal.\n       (2) A motion to proceed to consideration of an appeal \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be highly privileged and not \n     debatable. If the motion to proceed to consideration of the \n     appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall be decided on the basis \n     of the Select Committee's report to the Senate. Debate on the \n     appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided \n     equally between, and controlled by, those favoring and those \n     opposing the appeal.\n       (f) The Select Committee may, in its discretion, employ \n     hearing examiners to hear testimony and make findings of fact \n     and/or recommendations to the Select Committee concerning the \n     disposition of complaints.\n       (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no \n     adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged \n     violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, \n     rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the \n     alleged violation occurred.

Each member of the Committee shall be \n     given a reasonable opportunity to have separate views \n     included as part of any Committee report. (See Rule 8 on \n     Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive and Classified \n     Materials.)\n       (k) Ineligibility or Disqualified of Members and Staff:\n       (1) A member of the Committee shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that relates \n     specifically to any of the following:\n       (A) a preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review relating \n     to (i) the conduct of (I) such member; (II) any officer or \n     employee the member supervises; or (ii) any complaint filed \n     by the member; and\n       (B) the determinations and recommendations of the Committee \n     with respect to any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory \n     review described in subparagraph (A).\n       For purposes of this paragraph, a member of the committee \n     and an officer of the Senate shall be deemed to supervise any \n     officer or employee consistent with the provision of \n     paragraph 12 of Rule XXXVII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.\n       (2) If any Committee proceeding appears to relate to a \n     member of the Committee in a manner described in subparagraph \n     (1) of this paragraph, the staff shall prepare a report to \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If either the Chairman or the \n     Vice Chairman concludes from the report that it appears that \n     the member may be ineligible, the member shall be notified in \n     writing of the nature of the particular proceeding and the \n     reason that it appears that the member may be ineligible to \n     participate in it. If the member agrees that he or she is \n     ineligible, the member shall so notify the Chairman or Vice \n     Chairman. If the member believes that he or she is not \n     ineligible, he or she may explain the reasons to the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, and if they both agree that the member is \n     not ineligible, the member shall continue to serve. But if \n     either the Chairman or Vice Chairman continues to believe \n     that the member is ineligible, while the member believes that \n     he or she is not ineligible, the matter shall be promptly \n     referred to the Committee. The member shall present his or \n     her arguments to the Committee in executive session. Any \n     contested questions concerning a member's eligibility shall \n     be decided by a majority vote of the Committee, meeting in \n     executive session, with the member in question not \n     participating.\n       (3) A member of the Committee may, at the discretion of the \n     member, disqualify himself or herself from participating in \n     any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review pending before \n     the Committee and the determination and recommendations of \n     the Committee with respect to any such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review.\n       (4) Whenever any member of the Committee is ineligible \n     under paragraph (1) to participate in any preliminary inquiry \n     or adjudicatory review, or disqualifies himself or herself \n     under paragraph (3) from participating in any preliminary \n     inquiry or adjudicatory review, another Senator shall be \n     appointed by the Senate to serve as a member of the Committee \n     solely for purposes of such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review and the determinations and \n     recommendations of the Committee with respect to such \n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. Any member of the \n     Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the same party \n     as the member who is ineligible or disqualifies himself or \n     herself.\n       (5) The President of the Senate shall be given written \n     notice of the ineligibility or disqualification of any member \n     from any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding requiring the appointment of another member in \n     accordance with subparagraph (k)(4).\n       (6) A member of the Committee staff shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that the staff \n     director or outside counsel determines relates specifically \n     to any of the following:\n       (A) the staff member's own conduct;\n       (B) the conduct of any employee that the staff member \n     supervises;\n       (C) the conduct of any member, officer or employee for whom \n     the staff member has worked for any substantial period; or\n       (D) a complaint, sworn or unsworn, that was filed by the \n     staff member. At the direction or with the consent of the \n     staff director or outside counsel, a staff member may also be \n     disqualified from participating in a Committee proceeding in \n     other circumstances not listed above.\n       (1) Recorded Votes: Any member may require a recorded vote \n     on any matter.\n       (m) Proxies; Recording Votes of Absent Members:\n       (1) Proxy voting shall not be allowed when the question \n     before the Committee is the initiation or continuation of a \n     preliminary inquiry or an adjudicatory review, or the \n     issuance or recommendation related thereto concerning a \n     Member or officer of the Senate. In any such case an absent \n     member's vote may be announced solely for the purpose of \n     recording the member's position and such announced votes \n     shall not be counted for or against the motion.\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee member has been informed of the matter on \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested of the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) Approval of Blind Trusts and Foreign Travel Requests \n     Between Sessions and During Extended Recesses: During any \n     period in which the Senate stands in adjournment between \n     sessions of the Congress or stands in a recess scheduled to \n     extend beyond fourteen days, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     or their designees, acting jointly, are authorized to approve \n     or disapprove blind trusts under the provision of Rule XXXIV.\n       (o) Committee Use of Services or Employees of Other \n     Agencies and Departments:\n       With the prior consent of the department or agency \n     involved, the Committee may (1) utilize the services, \n     information, or facilities of any such department or agency \n     of the Government, and (2) employ on a reimbursable basis or \n     otherwise the services of such personnel of any such \n     department or agency as it deems advisable. With the consent \n     of any other committee of the Senate, or any subcommittee, \n     the Committee may utilize the facilities and the services of \n     the staff of such other committee or subcommittee whenever \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, acting \n     jointly, determine that such action is necessary and \n     appropriate.\n\n\n     rule 2: procedures for complaints, allegations, or information\n\n       (a) Complaint, Allegation, or Information: Any member or \n     staff member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, \n     and any other person may report to the Committee, a sworn \n     complaint or other allegation or information, alleging that \n     any Senator, or officer, or employee of the Senate has \n     violated a law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any \n     rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     any individual in the performance of his or her duty as a \n     Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, or has engaged in \n     improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate. Such \n     complaints or allegations or information may be reported to \n     the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a Committee member, or a \n     Committee staff member.\n       (b) Source of Complaint, Allegation, or Information: \n     Complaint, allegations, and information to be reported to the \n     Committee may be obtained from a variety of sources, \n     including but not limited to the following:\n       (1) sworn complaints, defined as a written statement of \n     facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the \n     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of \n     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule \n     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     individuals in the performance of their duties as members, \n     officers, or employees of the Senate;\n       (2) anonymous or informal complaints;\n       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the \n     Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate, \n     including information obtained in connection with legislative \n     or general oversight hearings;\n       (4) information reported by the news media; or\n       (5) information obtained from any individual, agency or \n     department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.\n       (c) Form and Content of Complaints: A complaint need not be \n     sworn nor must it be in any particular form to receive \n     Committee consideration, but the preferred complaint will:\n       (1) state, whenever possible, the name, address, and \n     telephone number of the party filing the complaint;\n       (2) provide the name of each member, officer or employee of \n     the Senate who is specifically alleged to have engaged in \n     improper conduct or committed a violation;\n       (3) state the nature of the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation;\n       (4) supply all documents in the possession of the party \n     filing the complaint relevant to or in support of his or her \n     allegations as an attachment to the complaint.\n\n\n        rule 3: procedures for conducting a preliminary inquiry\n\n       (a) Definition of Preliminary Inquiry: A ``preliminary \n     inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee \n     following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or \n     information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.\n       (b) Basis for Preliminary Inquiry: The Committee shall \n     promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has \n     received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or \n     information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant \n     to Rule 2.\n       (c) Scope of Preliminary Inquiry:\n       (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and \n     scope as is necessary to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee \n     may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, \n     and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a \n     preliminary inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day \n     to day supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas \n     deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make \n     any determination provided for by this Rule.\n       (d) Opportunity for Response: A preliminary inquiry may \n     include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her \n     designated representative to present either a written or oral \n     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the \n     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be \n     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement \n     or answers.\n       (e) Status Reports: The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (f) Final Report: When the preliminary inquiry is \n     completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a \n     confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on \n     findings and recommendations, as appropriate.\n       (g) Committee Action: As soon as practicable following \n     submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the \n     Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the \n     Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the \n     Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary \n     inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The \n     Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis \n     nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter \n     by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which \n     shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be \n     subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of \n     admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, \n     the Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review \n     in accordance with Rule 4. No adjudicatory review of conduct \n     of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may be \n     initiated except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less \n     than four members of the Committee.\n\n\n        RULE 4: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING AN ADJUDICATORY REVIEW\n\n       (a) Definition of Adjudicatory Review: An ``adjudicatory \n     review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a \n     finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is \n     substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has \n     occurred.\n       (b) Scope of Adjudicatory Review: When the Committee \n     decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of \n     such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to \n     determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has \n     occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by \n     outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate \n     Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use \n     outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, \n     designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines \n     not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may \n     conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, \n     use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any \n     other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure \n     the evidence necessary to make a determination.\n       (c) Notice to Respondent: The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an \n     adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the \n     respondent no later than five working days after the \n     Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The \n     notice shall include a statement of the nature of the \n     possible violation, and description of the evidence \n     indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee \n     may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a \n     statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions \n     from members of the Committee, the Committee Staff, or \n     outside counsel.\n       (d) Right to a Hearing: The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not \n     requiring discipline by the full Senate).\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\n       (e) Progress Reports to Committee: The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such \n     reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and \n     shall be confidential.\n       (f) Final Report of Adjudicatory Review to Committee: Upon \n     completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings \n     held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff \n     shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, \n     which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory \n     review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review \n     shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary \n     action is recommended.\n       (g) Committee Action:\n       (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the \n     report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to \n     the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution \n     to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. \n     A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's \n     findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is \n     recommended. The report shall also explain fully the \n     reasons underlying the Committee's recommendation \n     concerning disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory \n     review of conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the \n     Senate may be conducted, or report or resolution or \n     recommendation relating to such an adjudicatory review of \n     conduct may be made, except by the affirmative recorded \n     vote of not less than four members of the Committee.\n       (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2(a), \n     subsections (2), (3), and (4), after receipt of the report \n     prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may \n     make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary \n     action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as \n     follows:\n       (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment or restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these;\n       (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a \n     recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, \n     payment of restitution, or a combination of these;\n       (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after \n     according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and \n     opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred \n     warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the \n     full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) \n     of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six \n     members order that a Member, officer or employee be \n     reprimanded or pay restitution or both;\n       (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that \n     misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of \n     admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not \n     be subject to appeal to the Senate.\n       (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon \n     consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not \n     warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence \n     which provides substantial cause for the Committee to \n     conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter.\n       (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, \n     shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy \n     shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The \n     full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and \n     made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded \n     vote of not less than four months of the Committee that it \n     should remain confidential.\n       (h) Right of Appeal: \n       (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection \n     (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to \n     the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the \n     presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall \n     cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the \n     Congressional Record and the Senate Journal.\n       (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to \n     consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be \n     highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed \n     to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall \n     be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the \n     Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, \n     which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, \n     those favoring and those opposing the appeal.\n\n\n                    rule 5: procedures for hearings\n\n       (a) Right to Hearing: The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory \n     review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand. (See \n     Rule 4(d).)\n       (b) Non-Public Hearings: The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall \n     so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she \n     is scheduled to testify.\n       (c) Adjudicatory Hearings: The Committee may, be the \n     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee, \n     designate any public or executive hearing as an adjudicatory \n     hearing; and any hearing which is concerned with possible \n     disciplinary action against a respondent or respondents \n     designated by the Committee shall be an adjudicatory hearing. \n     In any adjudicatory hearing, the procedures described in \n     paragraph (j) shall apply.\n       (d) Subpoena Power: The Committee may require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     6.)\n       (e) Notice of Hearings: The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) Presiding Officer: The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     member.\n       (g) Witnesses: \n       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served \n     on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled \n     appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time, \n     as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing \n     and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by recorded vote of not less than \n     four members of the Committee, rule that no matter of \n     the Committee or staff or outside counsel shall make \n     public the name of any witness subpoenaed by the Committee \n     before the date of that witness's scheduled appearance, \n     except as specifically authorized by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least two working \n     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to \n     be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine \n     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record \n     of the hearing.\n       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted \n     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she \n     desires to do so.\n       (h) Right to Testify: Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in \n     testimony or in statements made by a Committee member, staff \n     member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably \n     believes that the statement tends to adversely affect his or \n     her reputation may--\n       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf; or\n       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she \n     complained. Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) Conduct of Witnesses and Other Attendees: the Presiding \n     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by \n     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by \n     majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender \n     be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) Adjudicatory Hearing Procedures:\n       (1) Notice of Hearings: A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all \n     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise \n     summoned to testify.\n       (2) Preparation for Adjudicatory Hearings:\n       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     to be given by each witness to be called at the hearing.\n       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall \n     provide the information and documents described in divisions \n     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of this \n     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote,\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\n     may recommend to the Senate that the offender be cited for \n     contempt of Congress.\n       (3) Swearing of witnesses: All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) Right to counsel: Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his \n     or her legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) Right to cross-examine and call witnesses:\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent and any other \n     person who obtains the permission of the Committee, may \n     personally or through counsel cross-examine witnesses called \n     by the Committee and may call witnesses in his or her own \n     behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An application \n     shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent \n     that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and \n     appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by that party's counsel.\n       (D) At least one working day before a witness's scheduled \n     appearance, a witness or a witness's counsel may submit to \n     the Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that \n     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, \n     such questions may be asked by any member of the Committee, \n     or by any Committee staff member if directed by a Committee \n     member. The witness or witness's counsel may also submit \n     additional sworn testimony for the record within twenty-four \n     hours after the last day that the witness has testified. The \n     insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject \n     to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting \n     jointly within five days after testimony is received.\n       (6) Admissibility of evidence:\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, \n     but the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a recorded vote of not less than four members of \n     the Committee before the recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual \n     misconduct, b a Member, officer, or employee within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided \n     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit \n     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only \n     upon a determination of not less than four members of the \n     full Committee that the interests of justice require that \n     such evidence be admitted.\n       (7) Supplementary hearing procedures: The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any member of the public.\n       (k) Transcripts:\n       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of \n     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own \n     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the member, staff \n     member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any member or \n     witness shall return the transcript with suggested \n     corrections to the committee offices within five working days \n     after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as is \n     practicable. If the testimony was given in executive session, \n     the member or witness may only inspect the transcript at a \n     location determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly. Any questions arising with respect to the processing \n     and correction of transcripts shall be decided by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is \n     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections \n     of a member or witness if they determine that such member or \n     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such \n     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within \n     such time.\n       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness's testimony given at a \n     public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive \n     session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon \n     request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions \n     prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. if any \n     individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the \n     Committee may recommend by majority vote that he or she be \n     cited for contempt of Congress.\n\n\n                   rule 6: subpoenas and depositions\n\n       (a) Subpoenas:\n       (1) Authorization for issuance: Subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or \n     hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and \n     tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and \n     places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by \n     either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time \n     during a preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding.\n       (2) Signature and Service: All subpoenas shall be signed by \n     the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any \n     person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served \n     with a copy of the Rules of the Committee and a brief \n     statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.\n       (3) Withdrawal of subpoena: The Committee, by recorded vote \n     of not less than four members of the Committee, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by it or authorized for \n     issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. \n     The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by them.\n       (b) Depositions:\n       (1) Persons authorized to take depositions: Depositions may \n     be taken by any member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other \n     person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other \n     employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to \n     the Committee.\n       (2) Deposition notices: Notices for the taking of \n     depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff member or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any time during a \n     preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or other proceeding. \n     Deposition notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall \n     be in private, and the testimony taken and documents produced \n     shall be deemed for the purpose of these rules to have been \n     received in a closed or executive session of the Committee. \n     The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading to \n     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness's \n     failure to appear, or to testify, or to produce documents, \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a subpoena \n     authorized for issuance by the Committee, or the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) Counsel at Depositions: Witnesses may be accompanied at \n     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n       (4) Deposition procedure: Witnesses at depositions shall be \n     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized \n     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any member of \n     the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded \n     by any person or persons who are authorized to take \n     depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any member of the Committee who is present may \n     rule on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, \n     direct the witness to answer the question or produce the \n     document. If no member of the Committee is present, the \n     individual who has been designated by the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly, to take the deposition may \n     proceed with the deposition, or may, at that time or at a \n     subsequent time, seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise \n     on the objection from the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the \n     Committee, who may refer the matter to the Committee or \n     rule on the objection. If the Chairman or Vice Chairman, \n     or the Committee upon referral, overrules the objection, \n     the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the Committee as the case \n     may be, may direct the witness to answer the question or \n     produce the document. The Committee shall not initiate \n     procedures leading to civil or criminal enforcement unless \n     the witness refuses to testify or produce documents after \n     having been directed to do so.\n       (5) Filing of depositions: Deposition testimony shall be \n     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is \n     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall \n     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in \n     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that \n     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The \n     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be \n     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices \n     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, with a time limit \n     set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, a \n     witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to \n     correct errors in transcription. The witness may\n\n[[Page S2685]]\n\n     also bring to the attention of the Committee errors of fact \n     in the witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement \n     about those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     may rule on the witness's request, and the changes or \n     attachments allowed shall be certified by the Committee's \n     chief clerk. If the witness fails to make any request under \n     this paragraph within the time limit set, this fact shall be \n     noted by the Committee's chief clerk. Any person authorized \n     by the Committee may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure.\n\n\n   RULE 7: VIOLATIONS OF LAW; PERJURY; LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS; \n   EDUCATIONAL MANDATE; AND APPLICABLE RULES AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\n       (a) Violations of Law: Whenever the Committee determines by \n     the recorded vote of not less than four members of the full \n     Committee that there is reason to believe that a violation of \n     law, including the provision of false information to the \n     Committee, may have occurred, it shall report such possible \n     violation to the proper Federal and state authorities.\n       (b) Perjury: Any person who knowingly and willfully swears \n     falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to \n     the Committee does so under penalty of perjury. The Committee \n     may refer any such case to the Attorney General for \n     prosecution.\n       (c) Legislative Recommendations: The Committee shall \n     recommend to the Senate by report or resolution such \n     additional rules, regulations, or other legislative measures \n     as it determines to be necessary or desirable to ensure \n     proper standards of conduct by Members, officers, or \n     employees of the Senate.

The select committee shall formulate and carry out \n     such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent \n     the disclosure, without the consent of the person or persons \n     concerned, of information in the possession of such committee \n     which unduly infringes upon the privacy or which violates the \n     constitutional rights of such person or persons. Nothing \n     herein shall be construed to prevent such committee from \n     publicly disclosing any such information in any case in \n     which such committee determines the national interest in \n     the disclosure of such information clearly outweighs any \n     infringement on the privacy of any person or persons.\n       Sec. 8. (a) The select committee may, subject to the \n     provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information \n     in the possession of such committee after a determination by \n     such committee that the public interest would be served by \n     such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to \n     disclose any information under this section, the committee \n     shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any \n     member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of \n     the select committee shall disclose any information, the \n     disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a \n     vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of \n     such information or after such vote except in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to \n     disclose publicly any information which has been classified \n     under established security procedures, which has been \n     submitted to it by the executive branch, and which the \n     executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee \n     shall notify the President of such vote.\n       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such \n     information after the expiration of a five-day period \n     following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted \n     to the President, unless, prior to the expiration of such \n     five-day period, the President, personally in writing, \n     notifies the committee that he objects to the disclosure of \n     such information, provides his reasons therefor, and \n     certifies that the threat to national interest of the United \n     States posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it \n     outweighs any public interest in the disclosure.\n       (3) If the President, personally in writing, notifies the \n     select committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), such committee may, \n     by majority vote, refer the question of the disclosure of \n     such information to the Senate for consideration. The \n     committee shall not publicly disclose such information \n     without leave of the Senate.\n       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the \n     question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under \n     paragraph (3), the chairman shall not later than the first \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for \n     its consideration.\n       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on \n     which the Senate is in session following the day on which any \n     such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier \n     time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the \n     Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of \n     rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate \n     shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the \n     pending business. In considering the matter in closed session \n     the Senate may--\n       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of \n     the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered to be \n     disclosed.\n       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion \n     of the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not public disclose the information ordered not to be \n     disclosed, or\n       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the \n     committee, in which case the committee shall make the final \n     determination with respect to the public disclosure of the \n     information in question.\n\n     Upon conclusion of the information of such matter in closed \n     session, which may not extend beyond the close of the ninth \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close of \n     the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the \n     majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5 \n     of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever \n     the case\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\n     may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the disposition \n     of such matter in open session, without debate, and without \n     divulging the information with respect to which the vote is \n     being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of such matter \n     by one or more of the means specified in clauses (A), (B), \n     and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph. Any vote of \n     the Senate to disclose any information pursuant to this \n     paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member of the \n     Senate to move for reconsideration of the vote within the \n     time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule XIII of \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure of such \n     information shall be made consistent with that right.\n       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select \n     committee relating the lawful intelligence activities of any \n     department or agency of the United States which has been \n     classified under established security procedures and which \n     the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section, has determined should not be disclosed shall be \n     made available to any person by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate except in a closed session of the \n     Senate or as provided in paragraph (2).\n       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the \n     committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of \n     such information, make any information described in paragraph \n     (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of \n     the Senate. Whenever the select committee makes such \n     information available, the committee shall keep a written \n     record showing, in the case of any particular information, \n     which the committee or which Members of the Senate received \n     such information under this subsection, shall disclose such \n     information except in a closed session of the Senate.\n       (d) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee on \n     Standards and Conduct \\1\\ to investigate any unauthorized \n     disclosure of intelligence information by a Member, officer \n     or employee of the Senate in violation of subsection (c) and \n     to report to the Senate concerning any allegation which it \n     finds to be substantiated.\n       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any \n     such investigation, the Select Committee on Standards and \n     Conduct \\1\\ shall release to such individual at the \n     conclusion of its investigation a summary of its \n     investigation together with its findings. If, at the \n     conclusion of its investigation, the Select Committee on \n     Standards and Conduct \\1\\ determines that there has been a \n     significant breach of confidentiality or unauthorized \n     disclosure by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, \n     it shall report its findings to the Senate and recommend \n     appropriate action such as censure, removal from committee \n     membership, or expulsion from the Senate, in the case of a \n     Member, or removal from office-or employment or punishment \n     for contempt, in the case of an officer or employee.\n       Sec. 9. The select committee is authorized to permit any \n     personal representative of the President, designated by the \n     President to serve as a liaison to such committee, to attend \n     any closed meeting of such committee.\n       Sec. 10.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of Democratic \nLeader Daschle's request to bring before the Senate the Economic \nRecovery Act of 2003, S. 414, which includes legislation I introduced \nlast month: the First Responders Partnership Grant Act of 2003.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for authoring this important economic \nstimulus package. In seeking to improve homeland security, I am proud \nthat he saw fit to include the First Responders Partnership Grant Act--\non which he, Democratic Whip Reid and Senator Breaux join me as \ncosponsors. This legislation will supply our Nation's first responders \nwith the support they so desperately need to protect homeland security \nand prevent and respond to acts of terrorism.\n  I want to begin by thanking each of our Nation's brave firefighters, \nemergency rescuers, law enforcement officers, and other first responder \npersonnel for the jobs they do for the American public day in and day \nout. Our public safety officers are often the first to respond to any \ncrime or emergency situation. On September 11, the Nation saw that the \nfirst on the scene at the World Trade Center were the heroic \nfirefighters, police officers, and emergency personnel of New York \nCity. These real-life heroes, many of whom gave the ultimate sacrifice, \nremind us of how important it is to support our State and local public \nsafety partners.\n  But while we ask our Nation's first responders to defend us as never \nbefore on the front lines against the dark menace of domestic \nterrorism, we have failed to supply them with the Federal support they \nneed and deserve to protect us, as we expect and need them to protect \nus.\n  Since February 7, 2003, the Federal Homeland Security Advisory System \nhas kept State and local first responders on Orange Alert, a ``high'' \ncondition indicating a high probability of a terrorist attack and when \nadditional precautions by first responders are necessary at public \nevents.\n  Since then, counterterrorism officials have warned that the threat of \nterrorist attacks on U.S. soil is at a higher level than in previous \nmonths due to the possibility of impending military action against \nIraq. This is the second time since September 11, 2001, that the \nnational warning level has been at Orange Alert--from September 10 to \nSeptember 24 last year, Attorney General Ashcroft declared our country \nat Orange Threat level.\n  From March 12, 2002, until this month, we were at Yellow Alert, an \n``elevated'' threat level declared when there is a significant risk of \nterrorist attacks, requiring increased surveillance of critical \nlocations.\n  Counties, cities, and towns in my home State of Vermont and across \nthe United States find themselves overwhelmed by increasing homeland \nsecurity costs required by the Federal Government. Indeed, the National \nGovernors' Association estimates that States incurred around $7 billion \nin security costs over the past year alone.\n  As a result, the national threat alerts and other Federal homeland \nsecurity requirements have become unfunded Federal mandates on our \nState and local governments. Rutland County Sheriff R.J. Elrick, \npresident of the Vermont Sheriffs' Association, recently wrote to me:\n\n       We are in dire need of financial support to keep our \n     personnel trained and equipped to meet the challenges here at \n     home as we continue our vigilant commitment to fight \n     terrorism.\n\n  When terrorists strike, first responders are and will always be the \nfirst people we turn to for help. We place our lives and the lives of \nour families and friends in the hands of these officers, trusting that \nwhen called upon they will protect and save us.\n  Just how, without supplying them with the necessary resources, do we \nexpect our Nation's first responders to realistically carry out their \nduties?\n  Our State and local law enforcement officers, firefighters and \nemergency personnel are full partners in preventing, investigating, and \nresponding to terrorist acts. They need and deserve the full \ncollaboration of the Federal Government to meet these new national \nresponsibilities.\n  Washington is buzzing about the literally hundreds of billions of \nadditional dollars the President plans to ask Congress to provide for \nour military services to fight the war on terrorism abroad. The same \ncannot be said for helping security here at home, which is shamefully \noverlooked.\n  For a year and a half I have been working hard to remedy that, with \nallies like our distinguished Democratic leader and assistant \nDemocratic leader, and New York Senators Schumer and Clinton. As former \nchair and now ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have made it \na high priority to evaluate and meet the needs of our first responders.\n  For these reasons, I commend the Democratic leader for including in \nthe homeland security section of his economic stimulus package the \nFirst Responders Partnership Grant Act, which will give our Nation's \nlaw enforcement officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel the \nresources they need to do their jobs. This legislation will establish a \ngrant program at the Department of Homeland Security to provide $5 \nbillion nationwide for current fiscal year to support State and local \npublic safety officers in their efforts to protect homeland security \nand prevent and respond to acts of terrorism.\n\n[[Page S2695]]\n\n  Similar to the highly successful Department of Justice Community \nOriented Policing Services--COPS--and the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Programs, the First Responder Grants will be made directly to \nState and local government units for overtime, equipment, training, and \nfacility expenses to support our law enforcement officers, \nfirefighters, and emergency personnel.\n  The First Responder Grants may be used to pay up to 90 percent of the \ncost of the overtime, equipment, training, or facility. In cases of \nfiscal leadership, the Department of Homeland Security may waive the \nlocal match requirement of 10 percent to provide Federal funds for \ncommunities that cannot afford the local match.\n  In a world shaped by the violent events of September 11, day after \nday we call upon our public safety officers to remain vigilant. We not \nonly ask them to put their lives at risk in the line of duty, but also, \nif need be, give their lives to protect us.\n  If we take time to listen to our Nation's State and local public \nsafety partners, they will tell us that they welcome the challenge to \njoin in our national mission to protect our homeland security. But we \ncannot ask our firefighters, emergency personnel, and law enforcement \nofficers to assume these new national responsibilities without also \nproviding new Federal support.\n  The First Responders Partnership Grant Act will provide the necessary \nFederal support for our State and public safety officers to serve as \nfull partners in the fight to protect our homeland security. We need \nour first responders for the security and the life-saving help they \nbring to our communities. All they ask is for the tools they need to do \ntheir jobs for us. And for the sake of our own security, that is not \ntoo much to ask.\n  I commend Senator Daschle for his leadership, and hope that the \nSenate will soon consider this desperately needed economic stimulus \npackage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2695-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 22, 2001 \nin Pleasanton, CA. Two men assaulted an Afghani cab driver in an \nincident that police labeled a hate crime. The two attackers, Kenny \nLoveless and Travis Gossage, both 21, yelled racial epithets at the cab \ndriver during their ride. Upon getting out of the cab they struck the \noutside of the cab. When the driver got out to inspect the cab the two \nmen attacked the driver and continued to yell racial slurs.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2695-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2695-S2696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE MEASURE OF SUCCESS: CELEBRATING A LEGACY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN \n                              ACHIEVEMENT\n\n  Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, ``Success is to be measured not so much \nby the position one has reached in life, as by the obstacles which he \nhas overcome while trying to succeed.'' This statement, made over 100 \nyears ago by Booker T. Washington, rings true today.\n  Twenty-seven years ago, February was designated ``Black History \nMonth.'' Today, I am pleased to join in the celebration of the many \nachievements and contributions African Americans have made to our \nhistory. I encourage all of you to celebrate this rich history of \nachievement year-round.\n  America's history has been shaped by the courage, talent, and \ningenuity of African-Americans. Each February we rediscover familiar \nstories of those who triumphed over bigotry and hatred to help move our \nNation closer to living up to its greatest potential. In the lives of \nFrederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Rosa Parks, and \nThurgood Marshall we find heroes who dedicated their lives to liberty, \nfreedom, and equality. During this month we also celebrate the \nachievements and vision of civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. and Medgar Evers and are reminded that we must continue the \nimportant work they started.\n  A look through our own State's history reveals a rich portrait of \nAfrican American achievement in California.\n  In science, George Edward Alcorn, Jr. is a brilliant physicist and \ninventor who has made considerable contributions to semiconductor \ntechnology and other scientific fields. He graduated from Occidental \nCollege in Los Angeles with a B.A. in Physics, and received an M.S. and \nPh.D. in Nuclear, Atomic and Molecular Physics from Howard University. \nHe has been issued more than 25 patents for his groundbreaking work and \nis most well-known for inventing the Imaging X-ray Spectrometer used \nfor detecting life on other planets.\n  Dr. Alcorn has also been extensively involved in community service. \nHe was awarded a NASA-EEO medal for his contributions in recruiting \nminority and women scientists and engineers and for his assistance to \nminority businesses in establishing research programs. He is a founder \nof Saturday Academy, which is a weekend honors program designed to \nsupplement and extend math-science training for inner-city students in \ngrades 6 to 8.\n  Mae Jemison, an African American physician, scientist and engineer, \nwas the first woman of color to go into space more than 10 years ago. \nDr. Jemison was only 16 when she entered Stanford University; she \ngraduated in 1977 at age 20 with degrees in both chemical engineering \nand African American studies. A few years later, she received a medical \ndegree from Cornell University. Dr. Jemison was selected by NASA in \n1988 for Astronaut training and in 1992 became a mission specialist \naboard the space shuttle Endeavor.\n  Throughout her career, Dr. Jemison remained undaunted by the lack of \nrole models in her area of expertise and instead paved the way as a \nhero for women and minorities interested in the science and technology \nfields. She once said, ``I saw a world that was changing and I wanted \nto be a part of that.''\n  Last year, she was honored by the Mentoring Center in Oakland during \na ceremony where she stressed the need for caring adults to reach out \nfor young people in these troubled times. Just recently, Dr. Jemison \nencouraged a young audience at the Modesto Community College to shoot \nfor the stars and realize their capacity to dream. She said, ``We have \nto have a vision of what we want the world to be in the future. We must \ncombine lessons from the past with our responsibility for the present. \nIt's the only way to have hope for the future.''\n  Politics: African Americans in the political arena have worked \ntirelessly to advance the civil rights of all people in California. \nLargely as a result of their efforts, African Americans are well \nrepresented in California local, State and Federal Governments.\n  Below is a short list of other African-American Californians who have \nmade similar contributions to our State and communities across the \nNation:\n  Yvonne Brathwaite Burke was the first black woman to be elected to \nthe California General Assembly and the first to be elected to \nrepresent California in the United States Congress.\n  Congressman Ronald V. Dellums was elected to Congress in 1970. He was \nthe first African-American to serve on the Armed Services Committee and \nwas its first black chairman.\n  Herb J. Wesson, Jr. is only the second African American in California \nhistory to be elected the 65th Speaker of the California State \nAssembly, one of the most powerful positions in the State. As a student \nat Lincoln University, a historically black college, Mr. Wesson was \ninspired to pursue a political career while listening to a speech by \nthen Congressman Ron Dellums of California.\n  During his career, Mr. Wesson has introduced bills that protected \nlabor rights for immigrant workers, ensured pay equity across gender \nlines, increased funding for low performing schools, and promoted job \ntraining for at-risk teens. He has earned a reputation as a natural \nborn leader, mediator\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\nand bridge-builder, someone other Assembly members turned to when \nseeking to resolve a conflict.\n  Sports: African Americans have played an extremely influential role \nin the development of professional sports. Among the most prominent, \nTony Gwynn has demonstrated excellence on and off the field. A native \nof Long Beach, Gwynn played baseball for the San Diego Padres for 20 \nyears.\n  In addition to his incredible skill on the diamond, Gwynn became a \nsports hero for youth across the nation. Demonstrating sportsmanship, \ncommunity service, and athleticism, Gwynn has won numerous community \nawards for his dedication and activism. He was inducted into the World \nSports Humanitarian Hall of Fame in 1999.\n  California can also be very proud of its local African American \nheroes--those who often go unrecognized by the national community.\n  Improving the community relations in her native neighborhood of \nWatts, in Los Angeles, has been a lifelong commitment for ``Sweet'' \nAlice Harris. ``Sweet Alice,'' as she is affectionately called, is the \nfounder of Parents of Watts, a program designed to encourage children \nto stay in school and away from drugs.\n  Today, Parents of Watts has grown into numerous organizations that \nprovide emergency food and shelter for the homeless, offer health \nseminars, provide legal and drug counseling, and operate a program for \nunwed mothers.\n  Sweet Alice is truly one of the best known and most influential \ncommunity leaders of her generation. Her lifetime of service and \ncommitment to disadvantaged youth stems from her early years as a \nhomeless teenage parent at age 16. In March of 2002, Lt.

Mr. President, I rise today to \ncommemorate and honor the achievements of African-Americans as the \ncelebration of Black History Month draws to a close. I know my \ncolleagues join me in remembering the sacrifices and contributions \nAfrican-Americans have made to our country. From laying the foundation \nof the United States Capitol, to creating the design of the Nation's \ncapital, a feat accomplished by noted scientist Benjamin Banneker, \ncomposing great music and writing classic literature, African-\nAmericans' influence on our society and culture is immeasurable.\n  So many of our modern conveniences are due to the innovation and \nimagination of great African-American inventors like Garrett A. Morgan, \ncreator of the modern stop light and the gas mask, which our Nation's \nforces may be utilizing in combat in Iraq. The great scientist, George \nWashington Carver, took tiny peanuts and engineered myriad uses for \nthem. Pioneering astronauts like Guion Bluford, and most recently, \nLieutenant Colonel Michael Anderson, whom we lost in the Columbia \ntragedy, undertook experiments in space that will advance our \ntechnological and scientific knowledge, expanding our horizons to space \nand beyond.\n  It is only fitting that we take time to remember these and other \nnumerous accomplishments. Our Nation, and indeed the world, have \nbenefited from the selfless sacrifices African-Americans have made in \nservice to our country. We must continue to work to ensure that all \nAfrican-Americans are afforded the opportunity to participate in, and \nrealize, the American Dream. In the words, of Reverend Doctor Martin \nLuther King, Jr.: ``We are not makers of history. We are made by \nhistory.'' Indeed, the history and experiences of African-Americans \nhave helped shape America and will continue to do so for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2696-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE CELEBRATES ITS 150TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Concord, \nthe Capital City of New Hampshire. As the United States prepares this \nyear to observe the 227th anniversary of our independence, the citizens \nof Concord will be celebrating the City's 150th birthday. It is \ntherefore timely and appropriate that we recognize this great American \ncommunity.\n  Concord runs eight miles from north to south and covers almost 39,000 \nacres. However, this geographic description fails to illustrate its \nunique position in New Hampshire and U.S. history. First settled in the \nearly 1700's as the Plantation of Penacook, an Indian word describing \nthe serpentine but beautiful meanderings of the Merrimack River, the \ntown was later renamed Rumford in 1734 and then Concord in 1765. In \n1853, 150 years ago, the people living there incorporated Concord as a \ncity. In 1788, the leaders of New Hampshire approved the new federal \nconstitution in the Old North Meeting House in Concord and, thus, New \nHampshire became the ninth and ratifying state of the original \nthirteen. Since 1809, Concord has served as the Capital of New \nHampshire and, naturally, has been the heart of political life in our \nstate. However, the City has a proud record for being the center of \ncommerce and transportation as well. One of its best known industries \nwas the Abbott-Downing Company which shipped thousands of its famous \nstagecoaches and wagons all over the world. In addition, the granite \nfrom Concord became the cornerstone for buildings throughout the United \nStates. Furthermore, the City was the northern hub for the railroad \nindustry in the first half of the 20th century.\n  Of course, we cannot talk about this city without praising its most \ndistinctive feature: the people of Concord. In this community, the \ncitizens value the importance of helping one's neighbor and, thus, have \nlong been responsible for strengthening the New Hampshire way of life. \nThey have never been restrained in lending their talents and energy to \nany noble cause. The experiences of two Concord residents in the Civil \nWar exemplifies this ethical code. On April 15, 1861, President Lincoln \nissued a proclamation calling for 75,000 troops to fight to preserve \nthe Union. Within hours of learning of this announcement, Concord \nPolice Officer Edward Sturtevant enlisted in the Army. Because he was \nsuch a natural leader, he was eventually promoted to major and later \ngave his life at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Harriet Patience Dame \nalso greatly contributed during this time. At the age of 46, she \noffered her services as an Army Nurse. From the time of her enlistment \nuntil well after the war ended, she cared for the injured, the sick and \nthe dying without taking one day's furlough or one day's sick leave. An \nexhausting schedule to be sure but one that fits the character of \nConcord.\n  This spirit continues into modern times and may be best expressed by \nConcord school teacher Christa McAuliffe as she was preparing to become \nthe first teacher in space: Her message ``I touch the future, I teach'' \nperfectly captures the dedication which characterizes the people of \nthis community. With that, I am proud to honor and salute them as they \ncelebrate the 150th birthday of Concord, New Hampshire, the Capital \nCity of the Granite State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2696-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2696-S2697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DOROTHY GONZALEZ\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the late \nDorothy Gonzalez, of Rapid City, SD. On February 17, Oglala Lakota \nCollege's East Wakpamni District College Center in Batesland, SD, was \nrenamed in Dorothy Gonzalez's honor. This is an honor she richly \ndeserves.\n  Dorothy had a distinguished 28 year career as an educator and \nadministrator at Oglala Lakota College. In 1975, she became East \nWakpamni District College Center's first director. She served as East \nWakpamni District\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\nCollege's director until 1990, before becoming He Sapa College Center's \ndirector. She was named Center Director of the Year in 1985 and 1987.\n  East Wakpamni District College Center being renamed in honor of \nDorothy Gonzalez is wonderfully appropriate. Dorothy immensely enriched \nthe life of countless young people in South Dakota. She was an \nextraordinary educator, mentor, and leader. It is an honor for me to \nshare her accomplishments with my colleagues and to publicly commend \nthe talent and commitment to education she always exhibited throughout \nher life. She was a woman of great scholarship and knowledge, and her \npositive influence will be felt for years to come.\n  Dorothy's dedication to high quality Native American education serves \nas her greatest legacy. Her work continues to inspire all those who \nknew her. Our Nation and South Dakota are far better places because of \nDorothy Gonzalez's life, and while we miss her very much, the best way \nto honor her is to emulate the love and support she shared with \nothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2697-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RABBI MICHAEL BARENBAUM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Rabbi Michael \nBarenbaum on the occasion of his retirement after 27 years as senior \nrabbi at Congregation Rodef Sholom in San Rafael, California.\n  Rabbi Barenbaum is a man of great kindness and integrity who carries \nthe Jewish values of caring and compassion with him in everything he \ndoes. With his wisdom and intelligence, he has changed thousands of \nlives for the better.\n  Under his leadership, Congregation Rodef Sholom has more than tripled \nin size, and its religious school has become one of the largest in \nNorthern California. Rabbi Barenbaum has attracted thousands of \nworshipers, including members of other congregations and faiths, \nthrough the thoughtfulness of his sermons and the lively, informal \nspirit of his services.\n  At the same time, Rabbi Barenbaum has fostered a strong tradition of \nsocial action among his congregation. In the 1970s and 80s, he led \nlocal efforts to welcome and help settle Jewish emigres from the Soviet \nUnion. He established a Mitzvah Day program that put nearly a thousand \ncongregants to work on dozens of community-service programs throughout \nMarin County. He has been a leader in ecumenical housing, in aiding the \nhomeless, and in bringing together clergy of all faiths to create \nservices for people in need.\n  As he heads into a well-deserved retirement, Rabbi Barenbaum has said \nthat he plans to work on establishing a Jewish hospice in the San \nFrancisco Bay Area. After years of moving others to action, he is eager \nto serve as a volunteer.\n  Mr. President, here is a man--a real mensch. I am sure that even in \nretirement, Rabbi Barenbaum will continue to do wonders and inspire \nothers for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2697-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to our Nations's winningest college basketball program of all \ntime, the University of Kentucky Wildcats. Earlier this month, on \nFebruary 6, the UK Basketball Program celebrated its 100th anniversary.\n  One century later, Kentucky basketball fans in our great Commonwealth \nand across the country have celebrated 7 National Championships, 41 \nSoutheastern Conference Championships, 36 All-Americans, 5 Hall of \nFamers, and more than 1,835 victories. UK Basketball has more wins and \nmore NCAA Tournament appearances than any other university in the \nNation. Since 1927, the UK Basketball team has had only one losing \nseason.\n  To most UK Basketball fans, cheering for a Wildcat win in Rupp Arena \nis about much more than just basketball. The UK Basketball tradition is \nsomething all Kentuckians can be proud of. Over the past six years, \nKentucky has led the Nation in average attendance even though some \nother schools with nationally-ranked teams have larger buildings. Many \nfans wait in lines for days in order to get the chance to see a game in \nlegendary Rupp Arena.\n  The women and men of Kentucky are proud of the tradition of Kentucky \nBasketball. I am proud to represent our great Commonwealth and \nespecially the University of Kentucky as it celebrates its basketball \nprogram's 100th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2697-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING KLAUS WUST\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I recognize Klaus Wust of \nShenandoah County, VA, and the contribution he has made to the \npreservation of American history.\n  Mr. Wust was born in Bielefeld, Westphalia in Germany in 1925. In \n1949, he received a scholarship to spend a year at Bridgewater College \nin Bridgewater, VA. Here he learned a great deal about the contribution \nGerman immigrants had made to the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. He was \nso impressed by these achievements that he permanently settled in the \nShenandoah Valley and devoted the rest of his life to researching and \nwriting about the contributions German immigrants have made in this \nregion of the Commonwealth.\n  Mr. Wust's extensive body of work serves as a primer for anyone \nfocusing on the revolutionary period of the 1700s and early 1800s \ncolonial era. He made a significant contribution in helping to restore \nAmerican/German relations following World War II through his research \nand writings. He is the author of eight books, coauthor of seventeen \nbooks and dozens of articles on the history of German-Americans in the \nUnited States.\n  In 2002, Klaus Wust was recognized with the highest civic award \nauthorized by the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Cross of \nMerit. The served as the Founding Director of the Museum of American \nFrontier Culture in Staunton, VA, and the Strasburg Museum in \nStrasburg, VA.\n  From 1957 until 1967, he served as Editor of the German language \nWashington Journal. Mr. Wust also served for seven years with the \nLeader Program of the U.S. Department of State and served as the \npersonal interpreter for German governmental delegations visiting the \nUnited States, including the last four Chancellors.\n  I congratulate Mr. Wust on his impressive body of work and his \ncommitment to preserving the history of our Nation for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2697-4", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2697-S2698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DETROIT RANGER DISTRICT\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the \nresidents of the City of Detroit, OR, to pay tribute and express by \ngratitude to the dedicated staff of the Detroit Ranger District of the \nUnited States Forest Service located in Detroit, OR--in particular the \nformer District Ranger, Stephanie Phillips.\n  The City of Detroit is a small community located on one of Oregon's \nmost popular recreational lakes, nestled in the Santiam Canyon. \nSurrounded on all sides by federally managed lands, Detroit is a \ncommunity whose residents rely a great deal on the cooperation and \neffectiveness of the Forest Service for any type of economic success.\n  Despite a combination of natural and man-made disasters, the \ndetermined residents of Detroit and the dedicated public servants of \nthe Detroit Ranger District, led by Ranger Phillips, mixed steely \nresolution with true grit to begin a process that will ensure the long-\nterm sustainability of this small community.\n  The level of appreciation for the staff of Forest Service can be best \ncharacterized by a certificate recently presented to the Detroit Ranger \nDistrict which read: ``In appreciation and recognition of the Detroit \nRanger District Staff for your contributions as a team of dedicated \nprofessionals in service to the general public, but especially to the \nlocal communities of Detroit and Idanha. We applaud your participation \nwith the technical support for Detroit Lake area. We thank you for your \nadvocacy in all of the Federal Lakes Recreation local projects.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to add my words of appreciation for those \nin the Detroit Ranger District for their dedication to the public good. \nThe City of Detroit still faces many challenges. But I am confident \nthat they will succeed. While the public servants of our Federal \nagencies are often faceless and nameless to us in Congress, many are\n\n[[Page S2698]]\n\nconsidered friends and partners in the communities they serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2698-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2698-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2698-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT REQUIRED BY THE INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ACT ON \n THE EMERGENCY REGARDING PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION--\n                                 PM 17\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), and section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report prepared by my Administration on the national emergency \nwith respect to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that \nwas declared in Executive Order 12938 of November 14, 1994.\n                                                      George W.

Conditions.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     to the ratification of the Moscow Treaty is subject to the \n     following conditions, which shall be binding on the \n     President:\n       (1) Report on the role of cooperative threat reduction and \n     nonproliferation assistance.--Recognizing that implementation \n     of the Moscow Treaty is the sole responsibility of each \n     party, not later than 60 days after the exchange of \n     instruments of ratification of the Treaty, and annually \n     thereafter on February 15, the President shall submit to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate a report and recommendations on how \n     United States Cooperative Threat Reduction assistance to the \n     Russian Federation can best contribute to enabling the \n     Russian Federation to implement the Treaty efficiently and \n     maintain the security and accurate accounting of its nuclear \n     weapons and weapons-usable components and material in the \n     current year. The report shall be submitted in both \n     unclassified and, as necessary, classified form.\n       (2) Annual implementation report.--Not later than 60 days \n     after exchange of instruments of ratification of the Treaty, \n     and annually thereafter on April 15, the President shall \n     submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate a report on \n     implementation of the Treaty by the United States and the \n     Russian Federation. This report shall be submitted in both \n     unclassified and, as necessary, classified form and shall \n     include--\n       (A) a listing of strategic nuclear weapons force levels of \n     the United States, and a best estimate of the strategic \n     nuclear weapons force levels of the Russian Federation, as of \n     December 31 of the preceding calendar year;\n       (B) a detailed description, to the extent possible, of \n     strategic offensive reductions planned by each party for the \n     current calendar year;\n       (C) to the extent possible, the plans of each party for \n     achieving by December 31, 2012, the strategic offensive \n     reductions required by Article I of the Treaty;\n       (D) measures, including any verification or transparency \n     measures, that have been taken or have been proposed by a \n     party to assure each party of the other party's continued \n     intent and ability to achieve by December 31, 2012, the \n     strategic offensive reductions required by Article I of the \n     Treaty;\n       (E) information relevant to implementation of this Treaty \n     that has been learned as a result of Strategic Arms Reduction \n     Treaty (START) verification measures, and the status of \n     consideration of extending the START verification regime \n     beyond December 2009;\n       (F) any information, insufficiency of information, or other \n     situation that may call into question the intent or the \n     ability of either party to achieve by December 31, 2012, the \n     strategic offensive reductions required by Article I of the \n     Treaty; and\n       (G) any actions that have been taken or have been proposed \n     by a party to address concerns listed pursuant to \n     subparagraph (F) or to improve the implementation and \n     effectiveness of the Treaty.\n       Sec. 3. Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     to the ratification of the Moscow Treaty is subject to the \n     following declarations, which express the intent of the \n     Senate:\n       (1) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate reaffirms condition \n     (8) of the resolution of ratification of the Document Agreed \n     Among the States Parties to the Treaty on Conventional Armed \n     Forces in Europe (CFE) of November 19, 1990 (adopted at \n     Vienna on May 31, 1996), approved by the Senate on May 14, \n     1997, relating to condition (1) of the resolution of \n     ratification of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) \n     Treaty, approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988.\n       (2) Further strategic arms reductions.--The Senate \n     encourages the President to continue strategic offensive \n     reductions to the lowest possible levels consistent with \n     national security requirements and alliance obligations of \n     the United States.\n       (3) Bilateral implementation issues.--The Senate expects \n     the executive branch of the Government to offer regular \n     briefings, including consultations before meetings of the \n     Bilateral Implementation Commission, to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations and the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on any implementation issues related to the Moscow \n     Treaty. Such briefings shall include a description of all \n     efforts by the United States in bilateral forums and through \n     diplomatic channels with the Russian Federation to resolve \n     any such issues and shall include a description of--\n       (A) the issues raised at the Bilateral Implementation \n     Commission, within 30 days after such meetings;\n       (B) any issues related to implementation of this Treaty \n     that the United States is pursuing in other channels, \n     including the Consultative Group for Strategic Security \n     established pursuant to the Joint Declaration of May 24, \n     2002, by the Presidents of the United States and the Russian \n     Federation; and\n       (C) any Presidential determination with respect to issues \n     described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).\n       (4) Nonstrategic nuclear weapons.--Recognizing the \n     difficulty the United States has faced in ascertaining with \n     confidence the number of nonstrategic nuclear weapons \n     maintained by the Russian Federation and the security of \n     those weapons, the Senate urges the President to engage the \n     Russian Federation with the objectives of--\n       (A) establishing cooperative measures to give each party to \n     the Treaty improved confidence regarding the accurate \n     accounting and security of nonstrategic nuclear weapons \n     maintained by the other party; and\n       (B) providing United States or other international \n     assistance to help the Russian Federation ensure the accurate \n     accounting and security of its nonstrategic nuclear weapons.\n       (5) Achieving reductions.--Recognizing the transformed \n     relationship between the United States and the Russian \n     Federation and the significantly decreased threat posed to \n     the United States by the Russian Federation's strategic \n     nuclear arsenal, the Senate encourages the President to \n     accelerate United States strategic force reductions, to the \n     extent feasible and consistent with United States national \n     security requirements and alliance obligations, in order that \n     the reductions required by Article I of the Treaty may be \n     achieved prior to December 31, 2012.\n       (6) Consultations.--Given the Senate's continuing interest \n     in this Treaty and in continuing strategic offensive \n     reductions to the lowest possible levels consistent with \n     national security requirements and alliance obligations of \n     the United States, the Senate urges the President to consult \n     with the Senate prior to taking actions relevant to \n     paragraphs 2 or 3 of Article IV of the Treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/25/senate-section/article/S2700-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2700-S2701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. WARNER for the Committee on Armed Services.\n       Army nomination of Col.

The proceeds from these \nsales will be used to improve or replace the Forest Service's Ranger \nStation in Idaho's Silver Valley.\n  The Forest Service administrative parcels identified for disposal \ninclude the land permitted by the Granite/Reeder Sewer District on \nPriest Lake, Shoshone Camp in Shoshone County, and the North-South Ski \nBowl, south of St. Maries.\n  The bill also directs the Forest Service to improve or construct a \nnew ranger station in the Silver Valley. The current ranger station is \nin dire need of repair or replacement, and this will ensure my \ncommitment to a continued and increased presence of the Forest Service \nin the Silver Valley.\n  This is a win-win situation for the taxpayers, the Forest Service, \nthe residents of the Silver Valley, and the permittees on the parcels \nof land to be disposed of.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 435. A bill to provide for the conveyance by the Secretary of \nAgriculture of the Sandpoint Federal Building and adjacent land in \nSandpoint, Idaho, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the, ``Sandpoint \nLand and Facilities Act of 2003''. This bill is a unique opportunity to \nmeet the facility needs of the Forest Service in Sandpoint, ID and to \nprovide facilities for the local county government. This bill will \ntransfer ownership of the local General Service Administration building \ncurrently housing the Forest Service to that agency. The bill also \nprovides authority for the Forest Service to work with Bonner County, \nID to exchange the existing building to Bonner County in exchange for a \nnew and more functional building to the Forest Service. This transfer \nof ownership will not only provide the opportunity for the local Forest \nService office to obtain a facility that best meets their needs but \nalso will meet the facility needs of Bonner County.\n  The transfer of this facility will allow the Forest Service to \nimprove service to the public, improve public and employee safety, make \nthe Idaho Panhandle National Forest more financially competitive, and \nallow increased spending on resource programs that contribute to \nhealthier ecosystems. In turn, Bonner County will benefit by providing \nto them a building that consolidates county offices so that better \nservices can be provided to the local public, including ADA compliant \naccess to the county courtrooms.\n  Additionally, the GSA will dispose of a building that is only \npartially occupied and is remotely located from other GSA facilities.\n  This is a win-win situation for the Forest Service, Bonner County, \nGSA, and the taxpayers and an outstanding example of the Federal \nGovernment at the local level working with the county government to \ncreate common sense solutions that result in more efficient operations \nand better service to the public.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 436. A bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n1978 to improve the administration and oversight of foreign \nintelligence surveillance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my good friends, \nSenators Grassley and Specter, to introduce the Domestic Surveillance \nOversight Act of 2003. This bill does not change or diminish any power \navailable to the government in the pursuit of homeland security, but it \ndoes create important mechanisms to allow the Congress and the public \nto assess how effectively and appropriately the government is using its \ndomestic surveillance powers.\n  I also rise to speak about an important bipartisan report being \nreleased today by myself, Senator Specter, and Senator Grassley \nentitled ``FBI Oversight in the 107th Congress by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee: FISA Implementation Failures,'' ``FIF Report''. The report \nsummarizes our joint conclusions based upon our bipartisan oversight of \nthe FBI and DOJ's performance in using the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, ``FISA'', an important tool in conducting domestic \nsurveillance. The report distills our mutual findings and conclusions \nfrom numerous bipartisan hearings, classified briefings and other \noversight activities. It concludes that the FBI continues to be in need \nof serious reform. The report also sets forth our bipartisan \ndisappointment with the DOJ and FBI's non-responsiveness to our \noversight efforts and the resulting necessity for better oversight \ntools, such as the bill we introduce today.\n  Our committee worked with the FBI and the Justice Department to \nachieve initial reforms both through administrative steps and also \nthrough legislation. Most notably, last fall we enacted a new \nDepartment of Justice charter that included some provisions of the FBI \nReform Act. We need to enact the rest of that bipartisan bill.\n  Taken together, this bill and report represent a bipartisan statement \nabout the importance of oversight and, where possible, sunshine on the \ngovernment's domestic surveillance efforts. Only by fulfilling our \nconstitutional responsibility to conduct such oversight, can we in \nCongress help to protect both the security and the liberty of the \nAmerican people.\n  In times of national stress there is an understandable impulse for \nthe government to ask for more power. Sometimes more power is needed, \nbut many times it is not. After the September 11 attacks, we worked \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion and with unprecedented speed to craft \nand enact the USA PATRIOT Act which enhanced the government's powers.\n  Now, as word continues to circulate about a possible sequel to the \nUSA PATRIOT Act that the Department of Justice is considering in secret \nand that supposedly would give government even more power, it is \nconstructive for us to first examine and understand how Federal \nagencies are using the power they already have. We must answer two \nquestions.\n  First, is that power being used effectively, so that our citizens not \nonly feel safer, but are in fact safer?\n  Second, is that power being used appropriately, so that our liberties \nare not sacrificed?\n  In short, before we can craft and enact new laws, we must first make \nsure that the Department of Justice and FBI are properly using the laws \nthat are already on the books. That is the purpose of enhanced \nCongressional oversight.\n  Domestic Surveillance Oversight Act:\n  Today, with the Senior Senator from Iowa and the Senior Senator from\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\nPennsylvania, I am introducing the bipartisan Domestic Surveillance \nOversight Act of 2003. This bill provides basic information to Congress \nand the American people about the FBI's use of FISA to conduct \nsurveillance on Americans. Such domestic surveillance is certainly \nappropriate in some cases, and the bill does not intrude in any way \nupon law enforcement or diminish its ability to conduct FISA \nsurveillance when necessary and appropriate. Nor does it require the \nDepartment of Justice to publicly release any sensitive or classified \ninformation. Rather, it seeks reporting only on the aggregate number of \nFISA wiretaps and other surveillance measures directed specifically \nagainst Americans each year. In this way, the public and Congress can \nassess over time whether the government has turned more of its powerful \nsurveillance techniques on its own citizens, as opposed to non-U.S. \npersons. If necessary, we can ask it to explain its actions.\n  The amendment also clarifies that the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, FISC, and FISA Court of Review have the authority \nto adopt rules and procedures, and it requires that those rules be \nshared with the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives as well as the Supreme Court. In the last \nyear, and only after requests from Senators Grassley, Specter and \nmyself, the FISC shared its rules with Congress for the first time. One \nof those rules and one which was eventually rejected by the FISA Review \nCourt embodied a controversial legal interpretation of a provision we \ncrafted in the USA PATRIOT Act. The Congress ought to have been \nimmediately informed of that court rule either by the FISC or the DOJ, \nbut it was not. It is entirely appropriate that a court be enabled to \npromulgate its own rules. It is entirely inappropriate that those rules \nbe kept secret from Congress.\n  Consistent with national security, the bill directs the Attorney \nGeneral to include in an annual public report the portions of \napplications to and opinions of the FISC and FISA Court of Review that \ncontain significant legal interpretations of FISA or the Constitution. \nThese disclosures will not include the facts of any particular case, \nwhich this provision requires to be redacted in order to preserve \nnational security. This type of disclosure, however, will prevent \nsecret case law from developing which interprets both FISA and the \nConstitution in ways unknown to the Congress and the public.\n  The first annual report required under this provision is also to \ninclude the same type of legal information for the four years before \nthe year of the first report.\n  Finally, the bill would require a report to appropriate committees of \nCongress on the use of National Security Letters to request information \nfrom public libraries or libraries affiliated with high schools or \nuniversities. Such letters are functionally equivalent to an \nadministrative subpoena and require no court approval. We have heard \nfrom members of the library community that the FBI may be returning to \na discredited practice from the Hoover days of monitoring public and \ncollege libraries to ascertain what books people are reading. In fact, \na media report from Vermont, which I ask consent to place in the \nRecord, indicates that bookstore owners there are scared to keep \nrecords for just this reason. Again, this provision would not in any \nway limit the use of National Security Letters, but would merely \nrequire an annual report of such activities to Congress, so that we can \nascertain whether or not these administrative subpoenas are being used \nfor improper purposes. This section would also ensure that reports on \nthe use of such letters are provided to all appropriate oversight \ncommittees.\n  This enhanced reporting is exactly what was called for by the \nAmerican Bar Association in a resolution adopted on February 10, and \nechoed in a Washington Post editorial on February 12, 2003. As the Post \neditorialized, the Department of Justice ``needs to disclose how it is \nusing the [powers] it already has. Yet the Justice Department has \nbalked at reasonable oversight and public information requests . . . \nCongress should insist on a full understanding of what the [D]epartment \nis doing.'' I ask unanimous consent to print a copy both of the ABA \nresolution as well as the Washington Post editorial in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Adopted February 10, 2003:\n       Section of Individual Rights and Responsibilities (lead \n     sponsor); Section of Litigation; Section of Criminal Justice, \n     Section of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice; \n     Section of International Law and Practice; Section of Science \n     and Technology Law; Young Lawyers Division.\n       Resolved, That the American Bar Association urges the \n     Congress to conduct regular and timely oversight, including \n     public hearings (except when Congress determines that the \n     requirements of national security make open proceedings \n     inappropriate), to ensure that government investigations \n     undertaken pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act, 50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. (``FISA'' or ``the Act'') do not \n     violate the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments to the \n     Constitution and adhere to the Act's purposes of \n     accommodating and advancing both the government's interest in \n     pursuing legitimate intelligence activity and the \n     individual's interest in being free from improper government \n     intrusion.\n       Further resolved, That the American Bar Association urges \n     the Congress to consider amendments to the Act to\n       (1) Clarify that the procedures adopted by the Attorney \n     General to protect United States persons, as required by the \n     Act, should ensure that FISA is used when the government has \n     a significant (i.e. not insubstantial) foreign intelligence \n     purpose, as contemplated by the Act, and not to circumvent \n     the Fourth Amendment; and\n       (2) Make available to the public an annual statistical \n     report on FISA investigations, comparable to the reports \n     prepared by the Administrative Office of the United States \n     Courts, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. sec. 2519, regarding the use of \n     Federal wiretap authority.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 12, 2003]\n\n                        Patriot Act: The Sequel\n\n       The Justice Department's draft of a second round of law \n     enforcement and domestic security authorities--a kind of \n     sequel to the USA Patriot Act of 2001--offers an unintended \n     glimpse of additional powers that the Bush administration if \n     coveting. The draft, labeled ``CONFIDENTIAL--NOT FOR \n     DISTRIBUTION'' and dated Jan. 9, was obtained last week by \n     the Center for Public Integrity, Washington-based nonprofit. \n     Department officials quickly stressed that it is not a final \n     version. But the document's proposals may become the next \n     battlefield in the struggle to preserve American liberties \n     while enabling the domestic war on terrorism. The proposals \n     range from constructive to dangerous.\n       A government DNA database for terrorists and suspected \n     terrorists could be useful, though it would need refinement \n     to protect suspects who are proved innocent. Another useful \n     proposal would allow the special appeals court that reviews \n     government surveillance requests in national security cases \n     to appoint lawyers to argue against the government. Under \n     current law, it hears only from one side. The draft would \n     create a federal crime for terrorist hoaxes, which now must \n     be prosecuted under provisions designed for other purposes.\n       But the draft contains many troubling provisions. It would \n     further expand intelligence surveillance powers into the \n     traditional realm of law enforcement. Like a Senate bill soon \n     to be taken up by the Judiciary Committee, it would allow \n     foreigners suspected of terrorism to be watched as \n     intelligence targets--rather than subjects of law \n     enforcement--even if they could not be linked to any foreign \n     group or state. But it would go further. It would allow \n     intelligence surveillance in certain circumstances even when \n     the government could not produce any evidence of a crime. It \n     also would allow certain snooping with no court \n     authorization, not only--as now--when Congress declared war \n     but when it authorized force or when the country was \n     attacked. The result of such changes would be to magnify the \n     government's discretion to pick the legal regime under which \n     it investigates and prosecutes national security cases and to \n     give it more power unilaterally to exempt people from the \n     protections of the justice system and place them in a kind of \n     alternative legal world. Congress should be pushing in the \n     opposite direction.\n       Before the department asks Congress for more powers, it \n     needs to disclose how it is using the ones it already has. \n     Yet the Justice Department has balked at reasonable oversight \n     and public information requests. In fact, the draft \n     legislation would allow the department to withhold \n     information concerning the identity of Sept. 11 detainees--a \n     matter now before the courts. At the very least, Congress \n     should insist on a full understanding of what the department \n     is doing before granting the executive branch still more \n     authority.\n  This bill does not in any way diminish the government's powers, but \nit does allow Congress and the public to monitor their use. We cannot \nfight terrorism effectively or safely with the lights turned out and \nwith little or no accountability. It is time to harness the power of \nthe sun to enable us to better win this fight.\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\n  FIF Report: The wisdom of this bill is also supported by our \nbipartisan report, which Senators Specter, Grassley, and I also release \ntoday, based on a year of bipartisan effort.\n  Today's FBI oversight report focuses on the use of the immense powers \ngranted under FISA. We expanded the government's FISA powers after \nSeptember 11 in the USA PATRIOT Act, a law that all three of us had a \nhand in crafting.\n  Unfortunately our hearings, briefings and other oversight revealed \nthat the FBI is ill-equipped to implement FISA. Nor are its problems \namenable to legal ``quick fixes.'' In fact, many of these problems are \nnot unique to the FISA context, but echo broader and more systemic \nproblems that have plagued the FBI for years.\n  Here are a few of the report's basic conclusions: Poor training: Key \nFBI agents and officials were inadequately trained in important aspects \nof not only FISA, but also in fundamental aspects of criminal law. \nExcessive secrecy: Secrecy regarding the most basic legal and \nprocedural aspects of the FISA have hurt, not helped, implementation of \nFISA. Headquarters Bureaucracy: FBI headquarters often not only fails \nto support the work of many of its best street agents, but it actually \nsometimes hinders them in doing their important jobs. Culture of \nQuashing Criticism: The FBI has a deep rooted culture of punishing \nthose who point out problems. Just yesterday, in fact, a DOJ Inspector \nGeneral's Report was released substantiating claims of retaliation \nagainst FBI United Chief John Roberts for his approved appearance on 60 \nMinutes. More troubling, these allegations involved senior officials at \nthe FBI, including the head of the division official charged with \ninvestigating claims of misconduct in the FBI. This culture has \nmaterially hurt the FBI's intelligence operations.\n  Unfortunately, as our report describes in detail, we have run into \nmany roadblocks in conducting FBI oversight. Some obstacles were due to \na lack of cooperation by the Department of Justice and FBI. The FIF \nReport outlines many prime examples supporting the necessity of the \nincreased reporting called for in the bill that I introduce with \nSenators Grassley and Specter today. For instance, the FIF Report \ndescribes how the FISC issued an unclassified opinion last May strongly \ncriticizing the DOJ and FBI and containing important legal \ninterpretations of FISA and the USA PATRIOT Act amendments to it. Even \nafter repeated requests by myself, Senator Specter and Senator Grassley \nfor a copy of this unclassified legal opinion, the DOJ refused to \nprovide us one. Eventually, the FISC, not DOJ, provided us with a copy \nof this unclassified document and, again only at our request, copies of \nthe FISA Court of Review's argument and opinion were made public. I \nhope that this resistance towards legitimate oversight will not be \nshown in the future.\n  Sunlight is the best solvent for the sticky and ineffective machinery \nof government, and it is the best disinfectant to discourage the abuse \nof power. Our comprehensive FBI oversight has revealed that there is \nmuch work to be done.\n  Effective oversight of the powers given to the government for \nhomeland security means fewer blank checks, and more checks and \nbalances.\n  I ask unanimous consent, that the text of the bill I am introducing, \na sectional analysis, and a letter of support be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the additional materials were ordered to \nbe printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 436\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Short title. The short title of the bill is the \n     ``Domestic Surveillance Oversight Act of 2003.''\n       Sec. 2. Additional Improvements to Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA). This section amends FISA to \n     clarify the authority of the Intelligence Surveillance Court \n     (FISC) and FISA Court of Review to establish such rules and \n     procedures as are reasonably necessary for their operation.\n       In addition, the bill requires the FISC and FISA Court of \n     Review to transmit such rules and procedures to the judges on \n     the FISC and Court of Review, the Chief Justice of the U.S., \n     and the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees of the Senate \n     and House. Previously, these rules have not been provided to \n     Congress as a matter of course.\n       This section also adds to the public reporting requirements \n     in FISA. It directs the Attorney General (AG) to include in \n     the annual public report the aggregate number of U.S. persons \n     targeted for any type of order under the act.\n       The report will also include information about the \n     aggregate number of times FISA is being used for criminal \n     cases, to enhance oversight regarding the changes enacted in \n     the USA PATRIOT Act.

Arlen Specter,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Hart Senate Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy, Grassley and Specter: Wewrite in \n     support of the Domestic Surveillance Oversight Act of 2003. \n     The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorizes \n     secret wiretaps and secret searches of the homes and offices \n     of Americans and other forms of data gathering for national \n     security reasons. While the initial enactment of FISA was an \n     appropriate accommodation of national security interests and \n     individual rights to privacy and due process, since its \n     initial enactment FISA has been expanded in ways that pose an \n     increased threat to individual rights. Moreover, FISA \n     surveillance authorities are now being used more and more; \n     indeed, it appears that the federal government carries out \n     more electronic surveillance under the authority of FISA than \n     under criminal rules.\n       Given the absolute secrecy of FISA searches and seizures, \n     mechanisms for public accountability are crucial to protect \n     rights of privacy--as well as to insure effective and \n     efficient use of this extraordinary authority. Your bill to \n     require public accounting of the number of US persons \n     subjected to surveillance under FISA, the number of times \n     FISA information is used for law enforcement purposes, and to \n     require disclosure of other information would be an important \n     step in providing for oversight and public scrutiny of these \n     extraordinary powers.\n       Disclosure of such information is important to informing \n     the American public and will not be harmful to the national \n     security, as it will not give any greater clues as to who is \n     being targeted, or the scope of the anti-terrorism efforts \n     than is already known from the Justice Department's own \n     extensive public descriptions of those efforts.\n       We commend you on your leadership on this issue and look \n     forward to working with you and your colleagues to achieve \n     appropriate policies for responding to terrorism and other \n     national security threats.\n     Laura W.

Then it dawned on her. Records of \n     online purchases stay in the system for a year. Authorities \n     could demand those records under a provision of the USA \n     Patriot Act passed in the wake of Sept. 11 to aid in tracking \n     down possible terrorists.\n       ``I guess I'm going to need to do something about that,'' \n     Kettler said of the online records. She doesn't want that \n     information to go to the federal government. ``It just seems \n     like a violation of privacy.''\n       Efforts to prevent police from obtaining blueprints of \n     their customers' reading habits are on other bookstore \n     owners' minds. Michael Katzenberg, co-owner of Bear Pond \n     Books in Montpelier, has purged lists of the books its \n     customers buy.\n       Other local bookstores cheer Katzenberg's decision. They \n     cite customer privacy and the First Amendment protecting \n     citizens' rights to free speech. The government is over-\n     stepping its bounds, and bookstore owners will go to lengths \n     to protect the very law that allows authors to publish \n     without censor.\n       ``I support what he did, and I'm right there with him,'' \n     said Mike DeSanto, co-owner of the Book Rack and \n     Children's Pages in Winooski, who declined to disclose \n     whether he has a list of his customers' reading \n     preferences. If he did have a list, he says, he would be \n     considering getting rid of it.\n       ``This is wrong what they're doing,'' DeSanto said of the \n     USA Patriot Act.\n       Customers at Flying Pig Books in Charlotte participate in a \n     readers' club--after buying $100 of books patrons receive $10 \n     off their next purchase, co-owner Josie Leavitt said. It is \n     unlikely the bookstore would purge that record, which has the \n     titles of customers' past purchases, because of its \n     usefulness, Leavitt said. Customers like to have a reminder \n     of what they have bought in the past, she said.\n       Faced with a request from law enforcement, Leavitt said the \n     bookstore would refuse to turn over the information. She \n     belongs to the American Booksellers Foundation for Free \n     Expression, the group that helped defend a Colorado bookstore \n     last year against just such an intrusion by law enforcement.\n       ``That's what books are all about. Books represent freedom \n     and if people can't read they're not free,'' Leavitt said.\n       The Vermont Library Association agrees. The group sent a \n     letter to Vermont's congressional delegation describing the \n     provisions of the USA Patriot Act pertaining to libraries and \n     book stores as unconstitutional.\n       ``They are dangerous steps toward the erosion of our most \n     fundamental civil liberties,'' the October letter reads in \n     part.\n       Peter Hall, U.S. attorney for Vermont, said the measure \n     would be used only in ``very rare and limited and supervised \n     circumstances,'' Hall said. Bookstore owners can do what they \n     want with records of their customers' purchases, he said.\n       Borders Books & Music would review requests from \n     authorities on a case-by-case basis, said Tod Gross, manager \n     of the Burlington store. The national chain keeps no records \n     of customer purchases, except for special orders, and those \n     files are purged monthly, Gross said.\n       Two recent court cases have shown law enforcement's \n     willingness to seek records from bookstores.\n       Independent counsel Kenneth Starr attempted to obtain a \n     list of the books Monica Lewinsky had bought from a \n     Washington, D.C. bookstore while investigating former \n     President Bill Clinton. Law enforcement in Colorado \n     subpoenaed a bookstore customers' purchases during a drug \n     investigation. A Colorado Supreme Court blocked the subpoena.\n       Kettler, in St. Albans, said her first thoughts are for her \n     customers' privacy. A woman seeking a book on ovarian cancer\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\n     should not have to worry her illness might be disclosed by \n     the shopkeeper, Kettler said.\n       ``I guess I'm going to stop keeping such meticulous \n     records,'' she said.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 437. A bill to provide for adjustments to the Central Arizona \nProject in Arizona, to authorize the Gila River indian Community water \nrights settlement, to reauthorize and amend the Southern Arizona Water \nRights Settlement Act of 1982, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain and myself I am \nintroducing legislation today that would codify the largest water \nclaims settlement in the history of Arizona. This bill represents the \ntremendous efforts of literally hundreds of people in Arizona and here \nin Washington over a period of five years. Looking ahead, this bill \ncould ultimately be nearly as important to Arizona's future as was the \nauthorization of the Central Arizona Project, CAP, itself.\n  Since Arizona began receiving CAP water from the Colorado River, \nlitigation has divided water users over how the CAP water should be \nallocated and exactly how much Arizona was required to repay the \nfederal government. This bill will, among other things, codify the \nsettlement reached between the United States and the Central Arizona \nWater Conservation District over the state's repayment obligation for \ncosts incurred by the United States in constructing the Central Arizona \nProject. It will also resolve, once and for all, the allocation of all \nremaining CAP water. This final allocation will provide the stability \nnecessary for State water authorities to plan for Arizona's future \nwater needs. In addition, approximately 200,000 acre-feet of CAP water \nwill be made available to settle various Indian water claims in the \nState. The bill would also authorize the use of the Lower Colorado \nRiver Basin Development Fund, which is funded solely from revenues paid \nby Arizona entities, to construct irrigation works necessary for tribes \nwith congressionally approved water settlements to use CAP water.\n  Title II of this bill settles the water rights claims of the Gila \nRiver Indian Community. It allocates nearly 100,000 acre-feet of CAP \nwater to the Community, and provides funds to subsidize the costs of \ndelivering CAP water and to construct the facilities necessary to allow \nthe Community to fully utilize the water allocated to it in this \nsettlement. Title III provides for long-needed amendments to the 1982 \nSouthern Arizona Water Settlement Act for the Tohono O'odham Nation, \nwhich has never been fully implemented.\n  This bill will allow Arizona cities to plan for the future, knowing \nhow much water they can count on. The Indian tribes will finally get \n``wet'' water, as opposed to the paper rights to water they have now, \nand projects to use the water. In addition, mining companies, farmers, \nand irrigation delivery districts can continue to receive water without \nthe fear that they will be stopped by Indian litigation.\n  While some minor issues remain, we have every confidence that these \nissues will be resolved as the legislation progresses. In addition, we \nhope that negotiations with the San Carlos Apache Tribe, the only party \nnot yet included in the settlement, will move forward so that all \nclaims can be resolved by this bill.\n  In summary, this bill is vital to the citizens of Arizona and will \nprovide the certainty needed to move forward with water use decisions. \nFurthermore, the United States can avoid litigating water rights and \ndamage claims and satisfy its trust responsibilities to the Tribes. The \nparties have worked many years to reach consensus rather than litigate, \nand I believe this bill represents the best opportunity to achieve a \nfair result for all the people of Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nKyl, as a co-sponsor of this important legislation, the Arizona Water \nSettlements Act of 2003, which would ratify negotiated settlements for \nCentral Arizona Project, CAP, water allocations to municipalities, \nagricultural districts and Indian tribes, state CAP repayment \nobligations, and final adjudication of long-standing Indian water \nrights claims.\n  These settlements reflect more than 5 years of intensive negotiations \nby state, Federal, tribal, municipal, and private parties. I commend \nall those involved in these negotiations for their extraordinary \ncommitment and diligence to reach this final stage in the settlement \nprocess. I also praise my colleague, Senator Jon Kyl, and Interior \nSecretary Gail Norton, for their leadership in facilitating these \nsettlements. From my experience in legislating past agreements, I \nrecognize the enormous challenge of these negotiations, and I \nappreciate their personal dedication to this settlement process.\n  This legislation is vitally important to Arizona's future because \nthese settlements will bring greater certainty and stability to \nArizona's water supply by completing the allocation of CAP water \nsupplies. Pending water rights claims by various Indian tribes and non-\nIndian users will be permanently settled as well as the repayment \nobligations of the State of Arizona for construction of the CAP.\n  I join with Senator Kyl today to express support for the agreements \nembodied in this bill and to encourage conclusion of this settlement \nprocess in the near future. Significant progress has been made in \nresolving key issues since we last sponsored a bill to facilitate this \nagreement in the 107th Congress. Some of these key issues pertain to \nthe final apportionment of CAP water supplies, cost-sharing of CAP \nconstruction and water delivery systems, amendment of the 1982 \nsettlement agreement with the Tohono O'odham Nation, mitigation \nmeasures necessitated by sustained drought conditions, and equitable \napportionment of drought shortages.\n  While this bill reflects agreements reached on a host of issues after \nan intensive and extended effort by the numerous parties involved, it \nis important to emphasize that this bill does not represent the final \nsettlement. All parties recognize that a very limited number of the \nprovisions of this bill may be modified as the negotiations continue. \nWe fully expect that the legislative process will culminate with a \nfinal agreement early in the next congressional session.\n  Mr. President, we introduce this bill today as an expression of our \nstrong support of the various parties to successfully achieve \nconclusion to this process. The Arizona Water Settlements Act will be a \nhistoric accomplishment that will benefit all citizens of Arizona, the \ntribal communities, and the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING:\n  S. 439. A bill to amend the Social Security Act and the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to provide additional safeguards for Social \nSecurity and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries with \nrepresentative payees, to enhance program protections, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, the Social Security system is one of this \ncountry's most important programs. Millions of older and disabled \nAmericans rely on their Social Security checks each month as a reliable \nsource of income.\n  We all know the long-term financial problems the Social Security \nsystem faces, and it is critical that Congress enact legislation to \noverhaul the system as soon as possible to ensure that our children and \ngrandchildren can rely on a robust and healthy Social Security program.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill, the Social Security Protection Act, \nthat will immediately begin protecting the integrity and finances of \nthe Social Security system by combating fraud and abuse.\n  Fraud and abuse in the Social Security system not only threatens its \nlong-term viability, but it also robs money from the millions of \nAmericans who are contributing a portion of their hard-earned paychecks \neach month to the program.\n  The Social Security Protection Act makes several common-sense and \nmuch-needed changes, including denying Social Security benefits to \nindividuals who are fugitive felons and parole violators, creating new \ncivil monetary penalties to combat fraud, and providing additional \nprotections to Social Security employees while on the job.\n  The bill also provides additional oversight of representative payees \nwho are appointed by the Social Security\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\nAdministration to manage the finances of beneficiaries who are unable \nto do so by themselves. Aside from additional oversight, the bill also \nimposes harsher penalties on representative payees who have misused \ntheir clients' funds, and even allows the Social Security \nAdministration in certain circumstances to reissue misused funds to \nbeneficiaries.\n  Finally, the bill makes some changes to Social Security's attorney-\nfee withholding process, and expands it to Supplemental Security Income \nclaims, as well. The bill also makes some other minor and non-\ncontroversial changes to Social Security law and the Ticket to Work and \nWork Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.\n  Last year, a similar version of this legislation came close to \npassing Congress. I hope that we can work in a bipartisan fashion with \nthe House of Representatives to get this legislation passed so that our \nSocial Security system can be better protected against fraud and abuse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 440. A bill to designate a United States courthouse to be \nconstructed in Fresno, California, as the ``Robert E. Coyle United \nStates Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nname the Federal courthouse building now under construction at Tulare \nand ``O'' Streets in downtown Fresno, CA the ``Robert E. Coyle United \nStates Courthouse.''\n  It is fitting that the Federal courthouse in Fresno be named for \nSenior U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle, who is greatly respected \nand admired for his work as a judge and for his foresight and \npersistence which contributed so much to the Fresno Courthouse project. \nJudge Coyle has been a leader in the effort to build a new courthouse \nin Fresno for more than a decade.\n  In the course of his work, Judge Coyle, working with the Clerk of the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District, conceived and \nfounded a program called ``Managing a Capitol Construction Program'' to \nhelp others understand the process of having a courthouse built. This \nEastern District program was so well received by national court \nadministrators that is now a nationwide program run by Judge Coyle.\n  In addition to meeting the needs of the court for additional space, \nthe courthouse project has become a key element in the downtown \nrevitalization of Fresno. Judge Coyle's efforts, and those in the \ncommunity with whom he worked, produced a major milestone when the \ngroundbreaking for the new courthouse took place.\n  Judge Coyle has had a distinguished career as an attorney and on the \nbench. Appointed to California's Eastern District bench by President \nRonald Reagan in 1982, Judge Coyle has served as a judge for the \nEastern District for 20 years, including 6 years as senior judge. Judge \nCoyle earned his law degree from University of California, Hastings \nCollege of the Law in 1956. He then worked for Fresno County as a \nDeputy District Attorney before going into private practice in 1958 \nwith McCormick, Barstow, Sheppard, Coyle & Wayte, where he remained \nuntil his appointment by President Reagan.\n  Judge Coyle is very active in the community and has served in many \njudicial leadership positions, including: Chair of the Space and \nSecurity Committee; Chair of the Conference of the Chief District \nJudges of the Ninth Circuit; President of the Ninth Circuit District \nJudges Association; Member of the Board of Governors of the State Bar \nof California; and President of the Fresno County Bar.\n  My hope is that, in addition to serving the people of the Eastern \nDistrict as a courthouse, this building will stand as a reminder to the \ncommunity and people of California of the dedicated work of Judge \nRobert E. Coyle.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 441. A bill to direct the Administrator of General Services to \nconvey to Fresno County, California, the existing Federal courthouses \nin that county; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ntransfer the B.F. Sisk Federal Courthouse in Fresno, CA to the County \nof Fresno, when the new Federal courthouse is completed.\n  Fresno County is rapidly growing county in the heart of California's \nGreat Central Valley. The County of Fresno's Superior Court has a \nserious need for new court space that will grow in the years ahead. The \nSisk Building contains courthouses and related space that will help the \npeople of Fresno County meet those needs. The Sisk Building's existing \nsecurity measures are a perfect fit for Fresno County's justice system.\n  This legislation is a common sense measure that will allow \nappropriate utilization of the Sisk Building, while contributing to the \nongoing revitalization of downtown Fresno. I am proud that it is yet \nanother opportunity for the Federal Government to improve the lives of \nFresno County's people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 442. A bill to provide pay protection for member of the Reserve \nand the National Guard, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that \nwill help our Nation's reservists and members of the National Guard who \nhave been called to active duty.\n  Since 1991, the U.S. military has significantly scaled down its troop \nlevels to reflect the end of the Cold War. With the reduction of active \nduty troops, the military has become increasingly dependent on the \nReserves and National Guard to supplement troops who have been sent to \ndeal with crises all over the world.\n  In addition to this, we have had to rely on an increasingly diverse \ngroup of people to fight our wars. The conflict in Afghanistan was \nheavily reliant on new technologies in the air and personnel intensive \ntechniques on the ground. In order to properly execute the war on \nterror, we have relied on highly skilled individuals such as linguists \nand Civil Affairs personnel who have worked closely with the population \nof Afghanistan. We will have to rely on them again in Iraq. Many of \nthese men and women have been reservists.\n  These two trends reflect a dramatic shift in the structure of our \narmed forces. Gone are the Cold War days when we had a massive military \npositioned all over the globe. We are now reliant on a much leaner \nforce, which views the Reserves and National Guard as necessary \ncomponents to any conflict, and not forces of last resort.\n  Between 1945 and 1989, a period which encompassed most of the Cold \nWar, reservists and Guardsmen were called up four times: during the \nKorean War, the Berlin Crisis of 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and \nthe Vietnam War. A majority of those mobilized during this period were \ncalled up during the Korean War, when over 800,000 troops were \nactivated to supplement the 900,000 active duty forces fighting in \nKorea.\n  Between 1990 and today, reservists and Guardsmen have been called up \nsix separate times. Over 230,000 reservists and Guardsmen were \nmobilized for the Gulf War, forming nearly half of the force that drove \nIraqi forces from Kuwait. Since then, reservists and Guardsmen have \nbeen activated for the Haiti Intervention, the ongoing Bosnian \nPeacekeeping mission, the ongoing patrol of the No Fly Zones in Iraq, \nthe Kosovo conflict, and the War on Terrorism which has seen 151,348 \nreservists and Guardsmen activated in support of Operations Enduring \nFreedom and Noble Eagle. Many of them are in the Persian Gulf Region \ntoday.\n  Over the past ten years, the OPTEMPO of the Reserves has increased by \nfifty percent.\n  This OPTEMPO has had a significant strain on reservists and their \nfamilies. In almost every instance, when a reservist or Guardsman is \nactivated, their military salary is significantly smaller then their \ncivilian salary. In many cases, service member's income is cut in half. \nThis places a particular strain to reservists and Guardsmen as their \nhousehold budget is structured by their civilian salary. The decrease \nin income that activation brings makes it increasingly difficult to pay \nthe bills. Whether or not the Nation is at war, mortgages, rent, credit \ncard debt, student loans, and other household expenses must be paid.\n  When we send our fighting men and women into harm's way, it is \nimportant that they concentrate on one\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\nthing: their mission. When Guardsmen and reservists are worried about \nhaving enough money for rent of the mortgage or whether their children \nhave enough to see a doctor, they cannot concentrate on the mission, \nand this becomes a readiness issue.\n  Many corporations volunteer to make up the difference between the \nmilitary and civilian salaries of their Guardsmen and reservists. Not \nonly do these employers sacrifice important members of their companies \nfor national defense, they hold their jobs for them and they \nvoluntarily choose to continue paying them. In some instances, \nemployers have continued to provide health insurance and other \nbenefits. This represents a significant burden that the employer has \nundertaken, in order to ensure that their employees and their families \nare taken care of during times of national emergency.\n  In order to alleviate the burden that these employers face and to \nencourage more employers to pay the difference to Reserve and Guard \nemployees, I have drafted legislation that would provide an incentive \nfor employers to make up the difference between the military and \ncivilian pay of activated reservists. The Reservists and Guardsmen Pay \nProtection Act of 2003 provides a tax credit to employers who continue \npaying their service members after they are activated. It also requires \nthe Federal Government to make up the difference between civilian and \nmilitary pay for Federal employees who are activated.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out a \nproject for flood damage reduction and ecosystem restoration for the \nAmerican River, Sacramento, California, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to improve \nflood protection for Sacramento, CA. The flood control project \nauthorized by this bill has been evaluated by the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers and will be conducted in accordance with the Report of the \nChief of Engineers dated November 5, 2002. This is a companion bill to \none that Representative Matsui is introducing today in the House.\n  Currently, Sacramento has woefully inadequate flood protection. This \nbill would raise the existing walls of Folsom Dam by seven feet, which \nwould substantially increase flood protection for the Sacramento \nregion. Without this improvement, $40 billion of property, including \nthe California State Capitol, 6 major hospitals, 26 nursing home \nfacilities, over 100 schools, three major freeway systems, and \napproximately 160,000 homes and apartments, are at risk if there is a \ndevastating flood.\n  For a city of its size, Sacramento falls shockingly below the flood \nprotection that it deserves. The Folsom Mini-Raise is the critical next \nstep in providing Sacramento necessary flood protection, enabling the \nsystem to handle storms far larger than any recorded event in the \nAmerican River Watershed.\n  Previous plans to raise the level of the Folsom Dam called for the \nbuilding of a temporary bridge to handle the traffic that would be \ndisrupted while the Folsom Dam Road was closed during the construction \nproject. Security concerns now warrant an indefinite closure of the \nFolsom Dam Road.\n  So, in addition to authorizing the Mini-Raise, this bill authorizes \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation to work with the State of \nCalifornia to design and construct a permanent bridge west of and \nadjacent to Folsom Dam over the American River to replace the current \ntwo-lane road over the dam. It will alleviate security concerns by \nmoving traffic away from the dam while still providing the thousands of \narea commuters with a reliable means of transportation across the \nriver.\n  This bill would provide important safeguards to the people of one of \nthe fastest growing areas in the Nation. By raising Folsom Dam and \nreplacing the road across the dam, we can greatly increase public \nsafety in the Sacramento area. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 444\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sacramento Public Safety Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FLOOD DAMAGE REDUCTION AND ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION, \n                   AMERICAN RIVER, CALIFORNIA.\n\n       The Secretary of the Army is authorized to carry out the \n     project for flood damage reduction and ecosystem restoration, \n     American River, Sacramento, California, substantially in \n     accordance with the plans, and subject to the conditions, \n     described in the Report of the Chief of Engineers for the \n     project dated November 5, 2002.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONSTRUCTION OF PERMANENT BRIDGE ADJACENT TO FOLSOM \n                   DAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--As part of the project authorized by \n     section 2, the Secretary of Transportation shall carry out a \n     project to design and construct a bridge west of and adjacent \n     to Folsom Dam, California. In carrying out the project, the \n     Secretary shall also construct necessary linkages from the \n     bridge to existing roadways.\n       (b) Design and Construction.--In designing and constructing \n     the bridge, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) coordinate with the Secretary of the Army regarding the \n     project authorized by section 2; and\n       (2) provide appropriate sizing and linkages to support \n     present and future traffic flow requirements for the city of \n     Folsom, California.\n       (c) Grant Assistance.--The Secretary of Transportation \n     shall make a grant to the State of California in an amount \n     sufficient to pay not less than 80 percent of the cost of the \n     project authorized by this section.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation \nbeing introduced by my colleague from California the Sacramento Public \nSafety Act.\n  This Bill would authorize flood control protection and ecosystem \nrestoration through a Mini-Raise of the Folsom Dam as well as authorize \nthe design and construction of a permanent bridge to replace the road \nthat currently runs on top of the Dam.\n  Providing Sacramento with flood protection is a critical public \nsafety need. Further delays only serve to expand opportunities for a \ncatastrophic flood.\n  No urban area in the United States is at higher risk of flooding than \nSacramento, CA.\n  Located at the confluence of two major rivers, the American and \nSacramento, the floodplain is home to half-a-million residents, $40 \nbillion in property, 5,000 businesses and the necessary supporting \ninfrastructure, all of which has less than 100-year flood protection.\n  With more than $30 billion in damageable property in the floodplain, \nthe Corps of Engineers has estimated the damage from a flood would \nrange from a minimum of $7 billion to as much as $15 billion.\n  As one of the largest economic engines in the world, a flood in \nCalifornia's capital city would effectively shut down the State's \ngovernment and seriously disrupt regional commerce and transportation.\n  The Mini-Raise will provide Sacramento with a 213-year level of \nprotection. It will allow the system to safely handle a storm 50 \npercent larger than anything ever recorded in the 3,000-year history of \nthe American River Watershed; it will add 95,000 acre-feet of new \nemergency flood storage capacity to allow operators to control dam \noutflows in accordance to what the downstream levees can safely carry; \nit will bring Folsom Dam into compliance with Federal Dam safety \nstandards; it will restore wildlife habitat along the Lower American \nRiver; and it will improve conditions for naturally spawning Steelhead \nand Salmon by mechanizing temperature control shutters.\n  The project has wide support at Federal, State, and local level. It \nis supported by the Army Corp of Engineers and funded in the Bush \nadministration's budget request.\n  The project has bi-partisan support in Congress including Republican \nCongressman Pombo, as well as Democrats: Robert Matsui, George Miller, \nMike Thompson, and Ellen Tauscher.\n  It has the local support of Heather Fargo, Mayor of Sacramento; \nDeborah Ortiz, California State Senator; Darrell Steinberg, California \nAssemblyman; Illa Collin, Chairman of the Sacramento County Board of \nSupervisors; Butch Hodkins, Executive Director of the Sacramento Area \nFlood Control Agency; Karolyn W. Simon, President of American River \nFlood Control Alliance; Donald Gerth, California State University, \nSacramento; and Vicki Lee, Conservation Chair of the Sierra Club.\n  The bill also calls for a permanent bridge to replace the road that \ncurrently runs atop Folsom Dam. Given the recent announcement by the \nBureau of Reclamation and the Department of the Interior to close the \nroad over the Dam, the need for such a bridge has become doubly \nimportant. This bridge will serve the needs of nearly 20,000 commuters \nwho use the Folsom Dam Road every day.\n  I want to thank my colleague from California for introducing this \ncritical piece of legislation and I ask for support from the rest of \nthe Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 445. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to revise the \nage and service requirements for eligibility to receive retired pay for \nnon-regular service; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, many bills were introduced in the last \nCongress that would lower the age at\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\nwhich Reservists can receive retirement benefits. Most of these bills \nwere met with resistance from the Department of Defense, due to cost \nestimates over a 10-year period. It is my hope that his Bill, the \nReserve Retirement and Retention Act of 2003, will serve as a \ncompromise measure and deliver retirement benefits to Reservists and \nGuardsmen at an earlier age. This legislation would lower the \nretirement age of a Reservist by one year for every 2-year period that \nhe or she serves past the requisite 20 years for retirement. For \nexample, if a Reservist should serve for 22 years, he or she could \nreceive retirement benefits at age 59. This legislation will serve as a \ncritical tool in encouraging the most experienced Reservists and \nGuardsmen to stay past the 20-year mark. It is my hope that this \nmeasure will encourage our Reservists and Guardsmen to stay in their \nunits longer, while making their retirement benefits more generous for \nthem and their families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 445\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require \ninstitutions of higher education to preserve the educational status and \nfinancial resources of military personnel called to active duty; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, When the President give the order to \nactivate reservists and National Guardsmen, the lives of those men and \nwomen are put on hold. Businesses, careers, and families are left \nbehind so that America's interests may be served. Students make up a \nsubstantial part of our National Guard and Reserve forces. When these \nstudents are activated, it jeopardizes their academic standing, as well \nas their scholarships and grants. This bill would preserve their \nacademic standing for the duration of their service as well as a one \nyear period that follows that service. It would also preserve their \nscholarships and grants, as well as entitle them to a refund of unused \ntuition and fees. Federal law already safeguards the employment status \nof activated reservists and Guardsmen. It is time that we extend the \nsame guarantee to students.\n  This legislation would require colleges, universities, and community \ncolleges to grant National Guardsmen and reservists a leave of military \nabsence when they are called to active duty. This leave of absence \nwould last while the student is serving on active duty and a one year \nperiod at the conclusion of active service. This bill would preserve \nthe academic credits that the student had earned before being \nactivated. It would also preserve the scholarships and grants awarded \nto the student before being activated. Under this legislation, students \nwould be entitled to receive a refund of tuition and fees or credit the \ntuition and fees to the next period of enrollment after the student \nreturns from military leave. If a student elects to receive a refund, \nit would allow them to receive a full refund, minus the percentage of \ntime the student spent enrolled in classes.\n  The protections that are already afforded our reservists and \nGuardsmen are appropriate considering the hardships they endure on the \nnation's behalf. We need to acknowledge the many college students who \nare in the ranks of the Guard and Reserve and extend to them the \nprotections they deserve. In this day of uncertainty on the world \nstage, our reservists must be prepared to be called up at a moments \nnotice. Thousands have already been activated for Operations Enduring \nFreedom, and many thousands more are either in Kuwait or on their way \nthere. Once they get to their duty station, they need to focus all of \ntheir attention on the mission. This legislation provides our student \nreservists with the proper safeguards on their academic career which \nwill allow them to accomplish their mission.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold, in submitting a resolution to \nestablish an annual National Visiting Nurse Associations Week in honor \nof these health care heroes who are dedicated to service in the \nultimate caring profession.\n  The Visiting Nurse Associations, VNAs, of today are founded on the \nprinciple that people who are sick, disabled and elderly benefit most \nfrom health care when it is offered in their own homes. Home care is an \nincreasingly important part of our health care system today. The kinds \nof highly skilled--and often technically complex--services that the \nVNAs provide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable \npatients to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they \nwant to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes.\n  Visiting Nurse Associations are non-profit home health agencies that \nprovide cost-effective and compassionate home and community-based \nhealth care to individuals, regardless of their condition or ability to \npay for services. VNAs literally created the profession and practice of \nhome health care more than one hundred years ago, at a time when there \nwere no hospitals in many communities and patients were cared for at \nhome by families who did the best they could. VNAs made a critical \ndifference to these families, bringing professional skills into the \nhome to care for the patient and support the family. They made a \ncritical difference in the late 19th century, and are making a critical \ndifference now as we embark upon the 21st.\n  VNAs were pioneers in the public health movement, and, in the late \n1800s, VNA responsiveness meant running milk banks, combating \ninfectious diseases, and providing care for the poor during massive \ninfluenza epidemics. Today, that same responsiveness means caring for \nthe dependent elderly, the chronically disabled, and the terminally \nill--some of our most vulnerable citizens--and providing high-tech \nservices previously provided in hospitals, such as ventilator care, \nblood transfusions, pain management and home chemotherapy.\n  Health care has gone full circle. Patients are spending less time in \nthe hospital. More and more procedures are being done on an outpatient \nbasis, and recovery and care for patients with chronic diseases and \nconditions has increasingly been taking place in the home. Moreover, \nthe number of Americans who are chronically ill or disabled in some way \ncontinues to grow each year. Once again, VNAs are making a critical \ndifference, providing comprehensive home health services and caring \nsupport to patients and their families across the country\n  There currently are approximately 500 VNAs nationwide. Through these \nexceptional organizations, 90,000 clinicians dedicate their lives to \nbringing health care into the homes of an estimated three million \nAmericans every year. VNAs are truly the heart of home care in this \ncountry today, and it is time for Congress to recognize the vital \nservices that visiting nurses provide to their patients and their \nfamilies. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Feingold and me in \ncosponsoring this resolution establishing an annual National Visiting \nNurse Associations' Week.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 9--RECOGNIZING AND CONGRATULATING THE \nSTATE OF OHIO AND ITS RESIDENTS ON THE OCCASION OF THE BICENTENNIAL OF \n                              ITS FOUNDING\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. DeWine) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                             S.
