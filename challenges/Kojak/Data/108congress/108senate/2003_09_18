Res. 68 reflects upon the recent \nloss of Johnny Cash. Tennessee and the world, indeed, lost one of its \ngreat heroes. His influence simply cannot be understated in any way. It \nis felt today, and it will be felt for many years to come.\n  A country music legend, and one of Rock 'n Roll's founding fathers, \nCash's work transcended both generation and genre. But what so many \nwill remember is that he was a man of the people across this great \nNation--indeed, across the world, giving a voice to so many people who \nreally did not have a voice before. He captured that not just over one \ngeneration but several generations. And that voice will carry on over \nmany generations in the future.\n  I extend my condolences to the Cash family. I know I speak for many \nin saying that Johnny Cash is a legend, and his imprint on American \nmusic and culture is and will continue to be profound.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           HIV/AIDS In Africa\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, last month I had the privilege of traveling \nto the southern African nations of South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, \nand Namibia, along with five of our colleagues in the Senate. I try to \nvisit the continent of Africa at least once a year. Part of the trip is \ngenerally spent doing medical mission work and part of it doing more \nofficial business. Over the next several minutes I will reflect a bit \nupon what we learned as a group with my colleagues on the official part \nof the recent trip.\n  As in previous trips, I was again struck by the optimism, the \nperseverance, the courage of the people I met on the African continent, \nimpressed by their openness, impressed by their warmth, impressed by \ntheir generosity and by their hospitality.\n  The purpose of our mission was very focused and straightforward. It \nwas not just going and looking at the countries and getting a feel for \ntheir governments and overall approach to ruling and to the people \nthere but to determine how best the United States, with others, can \ncoordinate efforts to fight the global HIV/AIDS pandemic which, as I \nhave said many times before, I believe is the greatest humanitarian, \nmoral, and public health challenge of the last 100 years.\n  Several of my colleagues have already come to the floor and offered \nsome of their reflections and impressions on our recent visit to the \ncontinent. I thank Senators Warner, DeWine, Enzi, Alexander, and \nColeman for their comments and for joining our delegation to study HIV/\nAIDS in Africa, as well as Dr. Joe O'Neill, who is Director of the \nOffice of National AIDS Policy, who accompanied us as well. \nDr. O'Neill, who has vast experience as both a physician and someone \nwho has focused on HIV/AIDS, both in the clinic delivering care and in \nterms of education and research, and now public policy, was a \ntremendous resource for us. In addition, it allowed us to integrate our \nideas on an ongoing basis on this particular trip.\n\n  I thank all of them for their thoughts, their remarks, their \nquestions, and comments as we traveled through the southern aspect of \nAfrica, as well as their remarks on the floor since.\n  In sum, our team had a very productive trip. We met with patients, \ndoctors, nurses. We met with community leaders, activists. We met with \nthe presidents of the countries and other government officials who have \nbeen trying to fight and are continuing to fight on the front line this \ndeadly epidemic--this group of people all working together from \ndifferent vantage points to bring hope and relief to millions and \nmillions of people who are HIV positive, have the manifestations of \nthat infection, which is AIDS, a disease today for which we have no \ncure.\n  No part of the world has been more affected by HIV/AIDS than southern \nAfrica, although we all know that the rate of growth was tremendous in \nRussia and throughout the Caribbean. There are probably more people in \nIndia than any other country in the world with HIV/AIDS. But in Africa, \nwhere this disease had its impact initially, we see what indeed can \nhappen and is happening to countries throughout the world.\n  The story of the impact in Africa needs to be told in a way that \npeople understand in order to encourage support of the global community \nin reversing this epidemic. Graca Machel, who is a truly remarkable \nformer first lady of Mozambique, told us that because of HIV/AIDS:\n\n       We are facing extinction. We still face the worst of the \n     epidemic.\n\n\n[[Page S11713]]\n\n\n  Let me repeat:\n\n       We are facing extinction.\n\n  When you hear those words from leaders, from people who are \nintimately involved, and you think of extinction caused by this little \ntiny virus of a people, of a population, of a nation, you realize the \nsignificance of this huge challenge before us.\n  We learned several things. First and foremost, we learned that \nleadership and political will are absolutely critical. It must come \nfrom the top, but it must occur at every level--vertically, down to the \nmost grassroots level. We saw effective, comprehensive responses to \nHIV/AIDS in many parts of Africa. In those areas where it has been most \nsuccessful, there has been a strong political will and leadership. We \nhave to start at the very top, with the president or the leader of an \naffected country. And you need to extend down to that local tribal \nleader, the person in a local community or a local village or at the \ntribal level, that person to whom people turn, that person whom people \ntrust, that person who, if they articulate the realities, can cut \nthrough the stigma, which I will come to here shortly.\n  In the country of South Africa, we met with community leaders who \nwere struggling with the political leaders for years over the \ndevelopment of specific response and treatment plans that would save \nthousands of lives with new treatment approaches and mechanisms and \ndrugs. A lot of this has come to a head over the last year or 2 years.\n  Indeed, until just several weeks ago, the political leadership there, \nI believe, had failed to address much of the reality that this little \nvirus causes HIV/AIDS, for which we have no cure. In South Africa, the \ncountry itself, more than 5 million people are infected with the \ndisease, for which there is no cure. In contrast to a political will \nthat seems slow to come to the surface, you go to Botswana, in \nGaborone, where we met with President Festus Mogae, who, in an effort \nto reduce the stigma surrounding the virus in the United States and \naround the world, and in Africa as well, publicly had himself tested. \nThat was part of an effort to show the importance of testing \nnationwide, to send a strong signal across the country.\n  This sort of unambiguous leadership sends a strong message to the \npeople. It focuses attention, and indeed it works. As a result of that, \nBotswana is making notable progress in fighting this pandemic and \nbringing understanding, security, and hope to its people. Prevention \nand care must be linked to treatment, and treatment must be preceded by \ntesting because you have to make the diagnosis.\n  All that sounds straightforward--making the diagnosis so that you can \nhave care and treatment. But what is interesting is that 90 percent of \nthe people in the world who have the virus don't know they are HIV \npositive, and until you can identify who is positive and who is not, it \nis hard to engage in the specific treatment aspect for that virus.\n  What is not quite so intuitive, but absolutely fact, I believe, is \nthat testing for the virus can become the cornerstone of prevention of \nthe virus. Why? Because testing, because of the great technology today, \ntakes us 15 minutes to do--when I was in Africa before, it took about 3 \nweeks. In technology there has been great progress. After testing--15 \nminutes--the counselor or the person doing the test, at that same \nsetting, can have what is called a teachable moment when one can learn \nabout HIV and learn how to prevent HIV. If one is HIV positive, they \ncan learn how to stop and reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n  It is critical. For example, there are 100 people in this body, and \nif they were all HIV positive, only 10 would know. You see, we have a \nlot we need to do in order to at least identify it so that we can \neducate those people who may have HIV/AIDS.\n  In Kasane, Botswana, we saw how, using two simple tests, a person can \nbe tested in 15 minutes while receiving that counseling in an effort \ncalled voluntary counseling and testing, VCT. I mention those three \nletters because, as people in this body and our colleagues know more \nand more about the virus and what we can do, you will hear about VCT, \nvoluntary counseling and testing. If the individual tested negative at \nthat sitting--they don't have HIV--he or she can be counseled as to how \nto avoid that infection. Then that person is encouraged to go home and \ntalk to their family about the particular virus and about prevention, \nhow to avoid this virus. If the individual tests positive on that \nencounter, they can immediately be exposed to the options for care and \ntreatment, if available, as well as contact with peer support groups.\n  Botswana is one of the countries we visited where the overall \nsophistication is high. There have been a lot of resources devoted, \nthrough partnerships to Botswana, and the impact right now is beginning \nto be felt.\n  There are no easy answers. This will not be addressed in 1, or 5, or \n10 years. It is going to take 15, 20 years to fully address HIV/AIDS.\n\n  Another important lesson we learned is that we must take steps to \nmake treatment widely available. This is something that was, for me, \nreally brought out on this particular trip. Even on the trip I took a \nlittle over a year ago, it wasn't quite as dramatic. But it is critical \nthat treatment be made available as widely as possible.\n  President Bush's emergency plan for global AIDS calls for 2 million \npeople to be on treatment by 2006. That is an ambitious goal. We can \nmeet that goal if we focus and make sure that taxpayer dollars we spend \nare directed to proven, robust prevention care and treatment programs. \nThere is an unlimited amount of money and resources you can devote. \nPeople talk $5 billion, or $10 billion, or $15 billion. You can spend \n$100 billion on trying to fight HIV/AIDS.\n  I think it is important that we spend our taxpayer dollars wisely, in \nsuch a way that we know they will have an impact--not just over 6 \nmonths or a year but 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20 years. This is a long-term \ncommitment and one at which we need to stay in a determined fashion.\n  Perhaps the single largest challenge to the HIV/AIDS crisis in \nAfrica, through prevention, care, and treatment, is the need to help \ndevelop the medical infrastructure to deliver health care safely and \neffectively. It is not just in South Africa, it is in the United States \nand every country. It comes down to the fact that it is not just a \ndiagnostic kit. You don't just give diagnostic kits to everybody in the \nworld and expect everything to fall into place. It means you don't just \nhave the drugs, the little vial of drugs, and send it, just as you \nwould not send it anywhere in this country or to other countries; you \nwould not send it to Africa without making sure it could be \nappropriately stored and appropriately transported, that it could be \nactually delivered to the patient in a secure and safe way. It is \ncomplicated and frustrating, in many ways, in the United States as \nwell. This takes an overall system that we have to continue to develop \nand partner with and contribute to in terms of resources to make sure \nit is fully developed.\n  A message we heard again and again was the request for the United \nStates to help provide expertise and training. This shortage of trained \nmedical and health personnel at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, which \nis the largest hospital I have ever been in or practiced in, in the \nUnited States or in England--it may be the largest hospital in the \nworld. It is in Soweto, South Africa. We had the opportunity to visit \nthe wards there and visit with the staff.\n  When I close my eyes, I can see the exhausted faces of those nurses, \nthe nurse practitioners, and the physicians, as we listened to them \ndescribe the desperate need for more trained staff--staff who have an \nunderstanding of HIV-related diseases, the infectious diseases that \nappear when one has this virus, which suppresses or holds down one's \nimmune system and thus makes an individual more likely to get different \ninfections. They told us about the need for nurses to help do the \ntesting and administer the tests and the need for social workers \nbecause it is not just giving the medicine, the antiretroviral therapy, \nif somebody has HIV/AIDS; it is the care, the nutrition, carrying out \ndaily activities of living in South Africa, and thus you need a whole \ncadre of social workers to address the care, as well as the treatment \naspects of responding to this virus.\n  They talked about the need for counselors to teach them how to avoid \nand cope with HIV infection. They talked\n\n[[Page S11714]]\n\nabout the need for administrative staff. They look to the United States \nto help partner to provide this trained expertise.\n  We learned, in addition, that we must build partnerships. It cannot \nbe done by one country, or one organization, or one company; it is \ngoing to require huge partnerships. That is going to take partnerships \nof government and of the NGOs--nongovernment organizations--religious \norganizations, social organizations, pharmaceutical companies, \nuniversities, all of which can come together to build these so-called \ncapacity needs, to build the effective partnerships to address the \nchallenges we have.\n  In Botswana, we visited the appropriately named Masa--that means \n``new dawn''--Masa Clinic. Masa is funded by the African Comprehensive \nHIV/AIDS Program, called ACHAP, which also supports the Coping Centres \nfor People Living with HIV/AIDS, COCEPWA, and the Botswana Christian \nAIDS Intervention Programme. That sort of partnership, that cross-\nfertilization is working.\n  The African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Program is a unique partnership \nthat is sponsored in part by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the \nMerck pharmaceutical company, and the Government of Botswana. It is a \nremarkable program that was launched 3 years ago in July 2000. It is \nproviding free antiretroviral treatment, counseling, and care for now \nover 6,000 Africans.\n  Patients in the Masa program--it has been fascinating to me--have a \n92- to 100-percent rate of compliance following this prescribed \ntreatment/drug program, and that is very high. I think compliance with \ntheir population in Botswana is equally high to compliance of a similar \nregimen in any western country--in the United States or in Europe. \nPeople are adhering to that regimen that is laid before them day after \nday. It is truly remarkable.\n  The highest compliance rates among western countries is 15 to 20 \npercent lower than that particular figure. So when people say, in \nAfrica it is hard to pull off these complicated treatment programs, \nthat is absolutely wrong. That is just absolutely wrong.\n  While we were in South Africa, we visited something I have never seen \nbefore. We visited the huge gold mining facilities. The one we visited \nwas called Anglo Gold, or part of Anglo Gold. They have their own \nhospital to treat their miners. There are about 25,000 employees and \nmaybe--they don't really know yet--as many as a third of all those \nemployees are HIV/AIDS infected. Again, that is sort of typical. It may \nbe less than that; it may be a little bit more, but it is a huge \nnumber. Therefore, in terms of not just care and compassion but just \nproductivity, because you need a healthy workforce, they have a \nwonderful program, a comprehensive program that is involved in \nprevention, care, and treatment at Anglo Gold. They are bringing \nantiretroviral treatment to HIV-infected employees directly.\n  We had the opportunity to talk to the employees and the impact that \nis making on their lives and the lives of their families and the lives \nof their extended families in their villages.\n  We had the real pleasure of visiting St. Mary's Hospital in Rehoboth, \nNamibia, which is preventing new infections through President Bush's \nPrevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission Program. We have talked on \nthe floor a lot about the importance of treating the mother with one \ndose of a drug called Nevirapine--a very inexpensive drug--and then \ntreating the baby within the first 24 hours with one dose of \nNevirapine. It cuts that transmission down at least by 50 percent. That \nparticular program is having great success.\n  In Windhoek, Namibia, we visited the Bernard Noordkamp Camp Center \nrun by the Catholic Church which provides care and nutritional support \nand counseling to hundreds of orphaned children. All of my colleagues \nare familiar with the thousands and thousands of orphans as a result of \nHIV/AIDS, children who have lost their parents to HIV/AIDS. That figure \nwill go to 10 million to 14 million over the next 10 years.\n\n  Another point we learned is we must reach people where they live. You \ncannot have a program designed for even one country and have it apply \nto every village in another country. You really need to be able to \nreach people in their own communities.\n  Most Africans don't live in the big urban areas and, thus, the \nimportance of mobile clinics, going out to the villages, is absolutely \ncritical. We saw a lot of creative responses to the problem. It could \nbe very resource intensive.\n  In Carletonville, South Africa, we saw the mobile clinics, the mobile \nvans with trained personnel and medical gear. These vans drive out into \nthe bush to bring that voluntary counseling, treatment, and basic care \nto people who otherwise simply would not have access to the care. There \nis no hospital or the nearest hospital or clinic might be 100 miles \naway, and with most of the people walking, it takes days to reach a \nclinic. It is impractical. These units would be able to identify people \nwith serious illness and have them come to the local village clinic or \nthe closest village clinic.\n  In Kasane, Botswana, we saw a mobile rapid-testing lab that travels \nthrough that whole Kasane region. By closing the gap between people and \nhealth care providers in these innovative ways, we strengthen the \noverall capacity to deliver health care to those people to cope with \nHIV/AIDS. That provides a structure which can be replicated throughout \nnot just South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, or Mozambique but in other \nareas throughout the continent and, indeed, throughout the world.\n  I mentioned this earlier, and this will be one of my final points, we \nlearned we absolutely have to address the stigma and discrimination \nthat is associated with HIV/AIDS. We have had to address it in the \nUnited States of America. We continue to address it throughout Africa. \nIt is very similar.\n  This stigma is a universal barrier. Every African nation we mentioned \nsaid it is a major challenge. Because of fear and discrimination, \nAfrican women told us again and again they are afraid to get tested out \nof fear of retribution by their husbands. When we talked with African \nmen, they said they are afraid to be tested because of their fear of \ndiscrimination in their workforce or being shunned in their local \ncommunities or being shunned by their family.\n  If you have the stigma, people don't ever make it to the VCT--\nvoluntary counseling and testing. They want to stay at home even if \nthey are sick. They say: I don't want to get tested because if someone \nfinds me HIV positive, then I will be discriminated against. So there \nis a huge disincentive to be tested. It makes people reluctant to be \neducated about the virus or even talk about the virus.\n  One of the most powerful ways of cutting through this stigma is to \nhave the political leaders, the well-recognized leaders of the village \ncome forward and say: We have to address it. Why? Because the \npossibility of extinction is actually there.\n  To effectively fight AIDS, it is important that people know what \nsteps to take. Therefore, we have to reach that teachable moment, but \nto reach that teachable moment, we have to destigmatize. One of the \nreal advances that has been made--and most people have been watching \nBono, who has been here this week and talked to a number of people, and \nwho is a very effective voice. He talks passionately about this \nsubject. I have had the opportunity to spend a lot of time working with \nhim on this terribly important issue. He points out the importance of \nthe moral cause and the moral drive in terms of our responsibility, not \njust the United States but as the global community. I think he is right \non target with that particular message as a global community.\n  In our discussions yesterday, we were commenting on the tremendous \npositive change in the believers of the world, in the faith-based \ncommunities, in the churches, in the mosques, in the temples--in the \nchurches broadly. There has been a huge sea change over the last 2 or 3 \nyears because of the moral necessity, the moral correctness of \naddressing this particular issue.\n  That is very important for lots of different reasons. It is important \nfor the offering of hope and compassion and caring and treatment and \nsupport, and it is equally important because, to have the church \nleaders and faith-based leaders stand up repeatedly and say this is an \nimportant issue, then people\n\n[[Page S11715]]\n\nlisten and people understand. If they hear it from their political \nleaders and they hear it from the church leaders, all of a sudden you \ncan start tearing apart this stigma, which is the barrier to reversing \nthis pandemic that is upon us.\n  Prevention messages must resonate locally. I mentioned Graca Machel, \nthe former first lady in Mozambique. She told us of the difficulty of \ndiscussing HIV/AIDS. She told us of how her Foundation for Community \nDevelopment works with faith-based organizations to reduce that stigma \nof HIV/AIDS. We asked her how specifically they do it, and they do it \nby using well-understood Bible verses and Bible messages that connect \nwith people. All of a sudden, through that connection, they take away \nthe shame that so often is attached to this stigma and discrimination.\n  She reminded us also of the importance of creating practical messages \nthat appeal specifically to men. Right now in the world there are more \nwomen with HIV/AIDS than there are men, which is interesting. Most \npeople would think initially there are a lot more men. The challenge in \nmany ways is to reach the men. She is very directly developing specific \nmessages that help educate them on the dangers of sexual promiscuity as \nthe vehicle of spreading AIDS.\n  She also shared her thoughts on the way to use multiple media \nsources--telephone lines, billboards, television, radio--to get the \nmessage out. She understands that all the knowledge in the world about \nHIV/AIDS is not worth very much unless it reaches the individual \nperson.\n  In Mozambique, we met the traditional healers from 10 villages. It \nwas wonderful for me as a physician to be able to go out in a remote \npart of Mozambique and to have the traditional healers, for whom \nWestern medicine is not something they have been exposed to much, and \nwho use the traditional healing methods, interested in HIV/AIDS, asking \nthe right questions, putting them forward, and then educating people. \nThese traditional healers are the ones who give health care today. They \nhave relationships like the doctor/patient relationship already with \ntheir villagers. They help destigmatize and encourage education about \nHIV/AIDS. They are the community leaders.\n  We have to prepare for a future without AIDS. The devastation caused \nby AIDS is overwhelming. But we must continue to envision a world \nwithout HIV/AIDS, especially in countries that have been overtaken and \nare feeling the effects at the individual level, in families, and on \nthe economies. Even if we get the disease under some sort of control, \nwe need to think ahead and plan for the future.\n  In all the countries in Africa that we visited we were met with hope \nfor the future, hope for new trade agreements, which we need to work \non, I believe, aggressively in this country. We heard about the hope \nthat trade barriers will fall so economies will improve and jobs will \nopen up. We listened and heard and were struck by the hope that they \nhave for a prosperous life for their families.\n\n  You have this devastating pandemic, terrible disease affecting the \ncontinent and individual countries. Yet it always comes back at the end \nof the conversation with a smile and optimism and hope. I think that is \none of the aspects that attracts me back to that continent again and \nagain. We should stand by them, partner with them, and maximize their \nopportunity for growth.\n  In closing, I do thank the Ambassadors and staff of each of the \nnations that we visited: Ambassador Cameron Hume in South Africa, \nDeputy Chief of Mission Dennis Hankins in Mozambique, Ambassador Joe \nHuggins in Botswana, Ambassador Kevin McGuire in Namibia, for all of \ntheir outstanding work, their outstanding support. They opened their \nworld to us in a way that we very much appreciate and that we will act \nupon over the coming weeks and months and years. They literally opened \ntheir homes to our delegation and worked overtime to make our trip a \nsuccess. For that we are grateful. They are a great credit to the State \nDepartment and to the United States and to the people they represent. \nThose people are the people of the United States of America.\n  I have gone on too long. Again, it was a dramatic, important trip for \nMembers of the Senate as we look ahead to how best and most wisely \ninvest our taxpayers' money, to this huge, bold, initiative, the \nboldest initiative taken in public health by any leader of any country \never, the initiative President Bush put forward to fight global HIV/\nAIDS with $15 billion over 5 years.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as we move into the debate on the Interior \nappropriations bill, there are still some important amendments that \nhave yet to be offered. I understand the minority leader will be here. \nHe has a couple amendments. We will lay those down today and talk about \nthose. If Members are in town and watching, I suggest they bring their \namendments down so we can get the list down to where it is manageable \nin the first place so we can complete this appropriations as early on \nTuesday as we possibly can.\n  In the meantime, we will be talking about a lot of very emotional \nissues. When you talk about public lands, everybody becomes a land \nmanager. As we debate this, it never ceases to amaze me that we forget \nthat there is a lot of knowledge on how to manage lands and the \nresources that we haven't tapped.\n  This Saturday, September 20, volunteers across the United States will \nparticipate in the 10th annual National Public Lands Day.\n  This day is coordinated by the congressionally chartered National \nEnvironmental Education and Training Foundation, in conjunction with \nthe Take Pride in America Program.\n  By the way, the Take Pride in America Program goes all the way back \nto one of the first programs the Interior Department put in when I \nfirst came to the Senate.\n  These two fine organizations team up in an effort to enhance and \nimprove our public lands while promoting awareness of citizen \nstewardship and increasing volunteer opportunities for the public. This \nis an excellent idea. I would like to commend them, as well as the \n70,000 folks across the United States who volunteered last year, for \ntheir hard work in participating in this task.\n  One-third of the total amount of the U.S. land mass is considered \npublic lands. Recreational activities on these lands are enjoyed by \nmillions of Americans and their families. Glacier National Park alone \nin my State provides recreational opportunity for snowshoeing, boating, \nand horseback riding for nearly 580,000 visitors each year.\n  By the way, we got good news last night. Maybe some of us are \nwatching Isabel. One fellow walked into the office this morning and \nasked, ``Isabel who?'' We will proceed with keeping everything \noperating. But, also, good news is that in Glacier National Park we got \n4 inches of snow last night, and they closed the Going to the Sun \nHighway Road. There are some back here who may not think that is good \nnews, but it is awfully good news to us because that means the end of \nthe fires.\n  Another national park in my neck of the woods is Yellowstone, which \nhappens to be the oldest national park in the world, and it is \nsometimes considered the crown jewel of the park system. It is \nimplementing a fee-free day in honor of National Public Lands Day.\n  As chairman of the subcommittee on Interior appropriations, I would \nlike to extend a premature thank you to at least a dozen members of my \nown staff and their friends who are participating in Public Lands Day. \nThis wasn't something which I asked them to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       National Public Lands Day\n\n       1.

Mr. President, in the East it is a good idea to work on \npublic\n\n[[Page S11716]]\n\nlands, particularly if this storm hits us and we sustain a little \ndamage from it. It may be a good time to not only take care of our own \nproperty but also to volunteer to help clean up those areas of public \nlands that we enjoy.\n  This is something we are asking Americans to do, and 70,000 responded \nlast year.\n  We have a fine group in this area that is going to work along the \nPotomac River shoreline where they will undertake the task of painting \ntrash cans, railings, and benches on Hains Point Park early Saturday \nmorning. Many in my office are going to participate.\n  As we look forward to Public Lands Day and Saturday, I encourage \ncitizens of this great country to think about Take Pride in America's \nslogan: ``It's your land, lend a hand.''\n  I think that is an important message.\n  I notice that my good friend from South Dakota, the minority leader, \nis on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana who has \ndone a great job of working with this legislation once again this year. \nI commend him for his efforts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1739\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and that amendment No. 1739 be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The legislative clerk will report.\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1739.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike funding for implementation of the Department of the \nInterior's reorganization plan for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the \n  Office of Special Trustee and to transfer the savings to the Indian \n                            Health Service)\n\n       On page 46, line 7, strike ``: Provided, That'' and insert \n     the following: ``, and of which $79,282,000 (composed of \n     $20,000,000 from administrative accounts for operation and \n     support, $6,346,000 from the trust accountability account, \n     $15,168,000 from the field operations account, and \n     $37,768,000 from the historical accounting account) shall be \n     transferred to the Indian Health Service and shall be \n     available for clinical services: Provided, That none of the \n     funds made available by this Act may be used for the proposed \n     trust reform reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     or the Office of Special Trustee: Provided further, That''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for over 100 years, the Department of \nInterior has managed for the benefit of Indian people a trust fund \ncontaining the proceeds from the leasing of oil, gas, land and mineral \nrights on Indian land. Today, far from enjoying a sense of security \nabout the investment of these assets, tribal and individual Indian \naccount holders cannot even be assured of the accuracy of the balances \nthat the Department of Interior claims are in their accounts, and the \nInterior Department's discharge of its trust responsibility is being \nlitigated in Federal court.\n  There is little disagreement that the Department of Interior's \nstewardship of Indian trust funds has been a colossal and longstanding \nfailure. But rather than get directly at the underlying problem, the \ndepartment continues to focus on reorganization of the bureaucracy. \nAdding insult to injury, department officials refuse to collaborate \nwith the tribes on a government-to-government basis as the department \npromised.\n  It is my strong belief that Congress should not appropriate any \nadditional funds for reorganization of the BIA until tribal leaders are \nfully consulted on, and can fully participate in, the design of the \nreorganization plan.\n  Many of us received a letter yesterday from the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians suggesting that Congress not fund the department's \nill-considered reorganization.\n  According to NCAI, ``The reorganization, because it is being executed \nin advance of the reengineering of the trust accounting systems, is \npremature, expensive, and will not improve trust management.'' NCAI \ngoes on to say that: ``Instead the funding should be directed back to \nbasic Indian programs from which the money has been reallocated.''\n  I agree with NCAI and the tribal leaders of my State, who are saying \nthe same thing. I am, therefore, proposing that we transfer $79 million \nfrom accounts that would fund a reorganization of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs to the Indian Health Service.\n  We are all painfully aware of the acute human need that exists on the \nNation's Indian reservations. Education, unemployment programs and \ninfrastructure are all underfunded by the Federal Government. But no \nhuman need cries out more than health care.\n  The health care statistics on the reservations of South Dakota, and \nthroughout the country, are closer to the statistics of the developing \nthird world than they are to the national statistics for the United \nStates. Infant mortality rates, diabetes rates, fetal alcohol syndrome \nrates and SIDS rates on the reservations far exceed that of the rest of \nthe Nation. Every health barometer calls out for prompt intervention \nand assistance.\n  We must increase Federal funding for health care on the reservations. \nIt is the key to a better education, which is the key to a more \nproductive life.\n  Yesterday on the Senate floor I showed my colleagues a chart that \nshowed the per capita commitment to health care on the reservations. It \nis exactly one-half the per capita commitment to Federal prisoners in \nthe United States today. One-half, about 1,900 versus 3,800. Restoring \naccountability and efficiency to trust management and paying account \nholders what they are owed is a matter of fundamental justice and \nshould be a national priority. Nowhere do the principles of self-\ndetermination and tribal sovereignty come more into play than in the \nmanagement and distribution of trust funds and assets clearly owed to \nIndian tribes and their people.\n  However, the successful resolution of this challenge, which has \neluded the reach of administrations of both political parties for \nyears, depends on meaningful dialogue and true partnership between the \nFederal Government and Indian people and their representatives. That \nstandard is not reflected in the Interior Department's current \nreorganization plan.\n  Therefore, when I contrast the relative merits of more funding for \nthis reorganization with more funding for health care, it is not a \nclose call.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment transferring $79 million \nfrom BIA and the Office of the Special Trustee reorganization to Indian \nhealth care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians and the Native American Rights Fund be printed in the \nRecord along with a resolution regarding this issue passed by the \nNational Congress of American Indians.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 National Congress\n\n\n                                          of American Indians,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2003.\n     Re: DOI Interior Appropriations Request for Historical Trust \n         Accounting and Trust Reorganization.\n\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman, Committee on Indian Affairs.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Vice Chairman, Committee on Indian Affairs.\n       Dear Senators: It has been over a decade since Congress \n     first ordered the Department of Interior to conduct an \n     accounting for Indian trust funds. Since that time, the \n     Department has spent over 600 million dollars on trust \n     reform, but has yet to produce even one accounting. In the \n     FY2004 Interior Appropriations bill, the Department has \n     requested yet another enormous increase in funding to product \n     a historical accounting and reorganize Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs functions to the Office of Special Trustee, shifting \n     significant amounts of funding away from basic Indian \n     programs.\n       The recent U.S. Civil Rights Commission Report, ``A Quiet \n     Crisis: Federal Funding and Unmet Needs in Indian Country'' \n     evaluates the budgets and expenditures of the six major \n     federal agencies responsible for Native\n\n[[Page S11717]]\n\n     American programs. The Commission concludes that significant \n     disparities exist between federal funding of programs serving \n     Native Americans and those serving other Americans. The \n     report finds that when inflation is factored in, funding for \n     many individual programs has decreased.\n       In these days of tight federal budgets and dire needs in \n     American Indian communities, we have to make sure that every \n     federal dollar spent in Indian country is money well spent. \n     We do not believe that the increases requested for historical \n     trust accounting and BIA reorganization meet that criteria.\n       The bottom line on historical accounting is that the \n     Department simply has not maintained the records to enable an \n     accurate accounting to occur--it has been demonstrated time \n     and again that a more comprehensive forensic accounting \n     approach is needed. The reorganization, because it is being \n     executed in advance of the reengineering of the trust \n     accounting systems, is premature, expensive, and will not \n     improve trust management. NCAI believes that any trust reform \n     reorganization at the Department should only occur after \n     interested parties--including tribal leadership--collaborate \n     to identify new trust business processes and the \n     organizational structure that should accompany those new \n     processes.\n       FY2004 Interior Appropriations should not fund the ill-\n     considered historical accounting effort and reorganization. \n     Instead, the funding should be directed back to basic Indian \n     programs from which the money has been reallocated. I have \n     attached NCAI Resolution #PHX-03-040, opposing the \n     Department of Interior's trust reorganization plan and \n     related FY2004 budget request.\n       Tribal leaders understand better than anyone that the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs needs to change, that it has \n     significant difficulty in fulfilling its responsibilities in \n     management of trust funds, and that some of the problems \n     relate to the way that the Bureau is organized. We want to \n     see successful change and improvement in the way the BIA does \n     business. We are not opposed to reorganization per se; we \n     simply want to see it done right. In our view, effective \n     organizational change to effectuate trust reform must contain \n     three essential elements:\n       (1) Systems, Standards, and Accountability--a clear \n     definition of core business processes accompanied by \n     meaningful standards for performance and mechanisms to ensure \n     accountability;\n       (2) Locally Responsive Systems--implementation details that \n     fit specific contexts of service delivery at the regional and \n     local levels where tribal governments interact with the \n     Department; and\n       (3) Continuing Consultation--an effective and efficient \n     means for on-going tribal involvement in establishing the \n     direction, substance, and form of organizational structures \n     and processes involving trust administration.\n       These elements are lacking in the current DOI \n     reorganization proposal.\n       We are extremely concerned that the lack of definition of \n     the responsibilities and authorities of new OST offices will \n     cause serious conflicts with the functions performed by the \n     BIA Agency Superintendent and/or Indian tribes. The OST was \n     designed by Congress to play an oversight role, but the \n     reorganization would now give the Office both oversight and \n     management responsibilities, a clear conflict. Moreover, we \n     believe that the funding and staff needs to flow directly to \n     the agency and regional levels--not just to new Trust \n     Officers--to address long-standing personnel shortages needed \n     to fully carry out the trust responsibility of the United \n     States. Before DOI begins the process of establishing an \n     entire new mini-bureaucracy, the financial and management \n     impact of such an action must be thoroughly examined by the \n     Congress and by affected tribal governments.\n       We fear that the DOI is on the verge of repeating the \n     classic mistake that has ruined the majority of its efforts \n     to reform trust administration in the past. The preoccupation \n     with moving or creating boxes on a chart is the antithesis of \n     how effective organizational change can and should be brought \n     about.\n       The Department is headed in the right direction with its \n     reengineering efforts, but the new business processes should \n     be devised through a collaborative process involving both BIA \n     employees and tribal leadership. We must include the input of \n     tribes and BIA employees so that the great numbers of people \n     who must implement changes in trust administration understand \n     and support necessary reforms. Only then, as a final step, \n     can we design an organizational chart to carry out the \n     functions of trust management without creating conflicting \n     lines of authority throughout Indian country. The history of \n     trust reform is filled with failed efforts that did not go to \n     the heart of the problem and do the detailed work necessary \n     to fix a large and often dysfunctional system.\n       At this time, Congress should prevent DOI from proceeding \n     with its proposed reorganization plan and focus instead on \n     funding core Indian programs where the need is greatest, and \n     programs such as land consolidation, title and accounting \n     that will in time reduce the cost of trust administration. We \n     believe that this could be accomplished with simple \n     appropriations language such as, ``None of these funds shall \n     be used for the proposed historical accounting and trust \n     reform reorganization of the Bureau of Indian affairs and \n     Office of Special Trustee until the Secretary has completed \n     the ongoing reengineering processes through consultation with \n     the tribes.'' Thank you very much for your interest in our \n     concerns, and for your continued commitment to American \n     Indian communities.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tex G.

No. 96-1285 (RCL), a case was filed on June 10, \n     1996 on behalf of a more than 500,000 individual Indian trust \n     beneficiaries in the Federal District Court for the District \n     of Columbia. I write to clarify the position of the Cobell \n     plaintiffs regarding the use of current appropriations for \n     the historical accounting and reform of the IIM Trust. \n     Specifically, under current circumstances, we have no \n     objection to the use of such appropriations to address the \n     many other pressing needs of Indian Country--including, \n     without limitation, Indian education and health services.\n       We do not believe Interior can render a complete and \n     accurate accounting. Nor do we believe Interior can reform \n     the trust without Court intervention. Our view on this matter \n     is reinforced with the knowledge that Interior has wasted \n     nearly $1 billion over the last decade on trust reform and \n     there has been no material improvement of the IIM Trust. In \n     short, until the Court has approved a methodology for the \n     historical accounting and plan for meaningful trust reform--\n     issues which have been tried and for which a decision is \n     pending--Interior's record conclusively demonstrates that \n     such funds will be wasted and will certainly not benefit \n     Indian Country.\n           Sincerely,\n     Keith Harper.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the National Congress of American Indians]\n\n                         Resolution #PHX-03-040\n\n\n   title: supporting tribal leaders' involvement in a congressional \n  process to settle trust claims; strongly opposing the department of \ninterior's Indian trust reform reorganization plan and related fy 2004 \n  budget report; creating a tribal leaders workgroup to address both \n                                 issues\n\n       Whereas, we, the members of the National Congress of \n     American Indians of the United States, invoking the divine \n     blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in \n     order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the \n     inherent sovereign rights of our Indian nations, rights \n     secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United \n     States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are \n     entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United \n     States, to enlighten the public toward a better understanding \n     of the Indian people and their way of life, to preserve \n     Indian cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, \n     safety and welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish \n     and submit the following resolution; and\n       Whereas, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) \n     was established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest \n     national organization of American Indian and Alaska Native \n     Tribal governments; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has a longstanding \n     comprehensive trust responsibility to Indian tribes based on \n     treaties, the United States Constitution, federal statutes, \n     executive orders, and judicial decisions; and\n       Whereas, the issue of whether the federal government has \n     violated its trust responsibility to Individual Indian Money \n     account holders has been in litigation since 1996, under what \n     is now named the Cobell v. Norton case; and\n       Whereas, as one means of dealing with the issues in Cobell \n     v. Norton, the Department of the Interior (DOI) has developed \n     and is implementing a reorganization plan which attempts to \n     diminish and limit the nature of the federal government's \n     trust responsibility; and\n       Whereas, the DOI reorganization plan creates a top-heavy \n     bureaucracy which will divert desperately needed funding and \n     resources from regional offices and local agencies, strip \n     important decision-making authority from those offices and \n     agencies, and negatively impact trust fund and trust resource \n     management programs at the local level; and\n       Whereas, the DOI has incorrectly asserted that segments of \n     its reorganization plan have the approval of Tribal Leaders; \n     and\n       Whereas, the DOI plan in fact ignores and rejects Tribal \n     leaders' core consensus positions, developed at great expense \n     of Tribal time and resources, that trust reform must not \n     negatively affect BIA programs, that it must recognize the \n     comprehensive trust responsibility of the DOI/BIA with \n     enforceable standards for meeting that responsibility, that \n     the BIA must not be arbitrarily split between ``trust'' and \n     so-called ``non-trust'' programs, as every BIA function is \n     a trust function; and that decision-making must take place \n     at the ``lowest'' (agency/region) level possible rather \n     than in Washington, DC; and\n       Whereas, the DOI reorganization plan lacks substance and \n     details in the areas of management and delivery of trust \n     services;\n\n[[Page S11718]]\n\n     does not describe the new or improved business processes that \n     will be implemented, lacks any recognition of enforceable \n     standards that will guide the implementation of such \n     processes; does not provide accountability to Congress, the \n     courts, Indian tribes and their members; does not provide for \n     a trust oversight mechanism; and fails to provide any details \n     on how service delivery will be improved at the regional and \n     local levels; and\n       Whereas, DOI's FY 2004 budget makes improper requests, and \n     in likely violation of federal law, consolidates authority \n     and funding in OST at the expense of Tribal programs: DOI \n     seeks a $123 million increase for OST, nearly doubling its \n     funding, while, at the same time, seeking a $63 million cut \n     to BIA construction, including a $32 million cut for school \n     construction, as well as an $8 million cut to Indian Water \n     and Claims Settlement funding. Equally disturbing, DOI is \n     seeking a less than one percent (0.3%) increase for Tribal \n     Priority Allocations, funding that flows directly to Tribes \n     for trust programs; and\n       Whereas, this attempted reorganization is premature because \n     the ``To-Be'' reengineering study on how to fix the trust \n     management apparatus has not been completed; and\n       Whereas, Tribal leaders strongly oppose the reorganization \n     for the reasons herein described; and\n       Whereas, Senators Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Daniel K. \n     Inouye, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Senate Committee on \n     Indian Affairs, have written to all Tribal leaders asking for \n     their participation in helping to settle the Cobell v. Norton \n     case and ``reforming the Federal trust management \n     apparatus''; and\n       Whereas, the continued litigation will cost many more \n     millions of dollars and take many more years to reach \n     completion, further impeding the ability of the Bureau of \n     Indian Affairs and the Department of Interior to carry out \n     their trust responsibilities to Indian tribes; and\n       Whereas, it is in the best interests of Tribes that Tribal \n     leaders participate in the resolution of trust related claims \n     and the development of a workable and effective BIA \n     reorganization plan which incorporates the core consensus \n     positions earlier articulated by Tribal leaders; and\n       Whereas, Tribal leaders are willing to discuss the \n     Senators' proposal to achieve a settlement of trust claims \n     and related issues because it focuses on land consolidation, \n     development of settlement legislation, continuation of the \n     effort to reengineer trust management processes, and the \n     reorganization of the BIA in true and meaningful consultation \n     with Tribal leadership;\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the NCAI does hereby \n     strongly oppose the DOI's Indian Trust Reform Reorganization \n     Plan and its related FY 2004 Budget Request; and\n       Be it further Resolved, That the NCAI calls upon Congress \n     to immediately halt the reorganization of the Bureau of \n     Indian Affairs until the concerns of Tribal Leaders are fully \n     addressed by a workable and effective reorganization plan, \n     and until the ``To Be'' process, developed through true and \n     meaningful consultation with Indian Tribes, is completed; and\n       Be it further Resolved, That the NCAI hereby (1) opposes \n     the FY 2004 proposed $123 million budget increase to OST, (2) \n     supports the restoration of funding for BIA Construction and \n     Indian Water and Claims Settlements, and (3) supports a \n     substantial increase, of at least 4%, for TPA funding; and\n       Be it further Resolved, That the NCAI requests a series of \n     hearings before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and \n     the House Resources Committee on the BIA reorganization and \n     the DOI's FY 2004 budget request, and that the Tribal Leader \n     witnesses represent direct service, contracting and \n     compacting tribes, all regions, and Tribes with diverse trust \n     holdings; and\n       Be it further Resolved, That the NCAI supports the efforts \n     of Senators Campbell and Inouye to help reach a settlement of \n     trust claims and to effectively reform the federal trust \n     apparatus, and encourages the participation of Tribal \n     leaders, individually and through a Tribal Leaders Workgroup, \n     in both these crucial processes; and\n       Be it further ResoLved, That the President of the NCAI is \n     hereby authorized to take all actions necessary to fulfill \n     this Resolution; and\n       Be it finally Resolved, That this resolution shall be the \n     policy of NCAI until it is withdrawn or modified by \n     subsequent resolution.\n\n\n                             certification\n\n       The foregoing resolution was adopted at the 2003 Mid-Year \n     Session of the National Congress of American Indians, held at \n     the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Gila River Indian Community, in \n     Phoenix, Arizona on June 18, 2003 with a quorum present.\n                                                         Tex Hall,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, there will be quite a spirited debate on \nthis issue. There is no question that we have shortcomings in the \nIndian Health Service. We could use more dollars there. In fact, we \nadded dollars this year to that particular item. Was it enough? \nProbably not. But who knows how much is enough, whenever we start \nallotting dollars and we take a look at the challenge we have, \nespecially in Indian health care. We know diabetes is one great \nchallenge we have on our reservations across this country.\n  We should also talk about the merits of the trust reform, too. Number \none, the administration is talking veto if this amendment is allowed to \nbe successful. Number two, it is tied up in court. There are actions \nand proceedings underway. The Senator from South Dakota is exactly \nright. This has spanned the years through all administrations, through \nall Secretaries. They have all been sued and held in contempt of court \nbecause they did not live up to their responsibilities of managing this \ntrust.\n  We also have to be concerned about those in Indian country, of the \nthousands and thousands of Native Americans who are denied payment from \nthis trust because it is in such a mess. Some reform or some system has \nto be set in place before anything can happen. The plaintiffs now in \nthe court action are saying the total payment in the country could be \nas high as $176 billion if we do not fix this system and make it work \nfor those who have money due them.\n  I imagine that to take the dollars from reform and normal accounting \nprocedures and let the new organization proceed with reform so we know \nwhere we are, what kind of ground we are standing on, and how best to \nget that money to the people to whom it is owed--I don't think this is \nthe time to take dollars from that process of reform. We will have a \nspirited debate on this subject.\n  The Senator from South Dakota also points out we have two \nshortfalls--that and Indian health. So wherever your priorities are, do \nwe take care of the trust so we take care of the financial conditions \nof those folks who have money coming to them or do we put basically a \npittance of what really the IHS, the Indian Health Service needs. We \nhave always covered those needs in the past with more dollars. We have \nadded dollars this year. But we will monitor that very closely. I am \naware of the needs in health care because I have seven reservations in \nthe State of Montana and it becomes an issue there.\n  I thank the Senator from South Dakota for offering this amendment \nbecause it points up that we have two places we should be doing better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I don't disagree with most of what my \nfriend and colleague from Montana has said. He is trying to do the best \nhe can given the allocation he has. I don't deny his responsibility to \nmake the decisions as best he can, given the allocation. I didn't vote \nfor the budget so I don't feel constrained by those budgetary \nallocation decisions that have been made within the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Let me talk briefly about the two issues the Senator addressed. \nFirst, with regard to the trust fund. The $79 million is for \nreorganization of the BIA to adapt itself to the policy once the policy \nis implemented. The question I have is, how can you reorganize a \nbureaucracy before you know what that policy is going to be? How can \nyou say we are going to put it in this agency or in that department or \nin that bureau or that desk without knowing what the policy is going to \nbe? And the policy is being contested. It seems to me we are putting \nthe cart before the horse. We need to decide on the policy and then do \nthe reorganization. That is what I am saying. Yet there is $79 million \nfor the reorganization before we even have a clue what the policy is \ngoing to be.\n\n  With regard to the Indian Health Service, the President requested \nabout $1.9 billion for IHS. The analysis done by independent sources \nhas indicated if we are going to do it right, if we are going to \nprovide coverage anywhere near the coverage provided to others in the \nrest of the country, we would have to put another $2.9 billion into the \nIndian Health Service budget to reach a per-capita equivalency, that \nparity. But we are not going to do that. We obviously cannot do that. \nWe had that debate on the budget resolution. I don't recall what the \nexact number was. We offered an amendment to add about $2.9 billion, \nand that was defeated.\n  What the Senate budget resolution included, and I believe it was the \namendment of the Senator from Montana, but it could have been someone \nelse's, was another $292 million, not the $2.9 billion. We passed that, \nbut it was not in the final bill, so that was the\n\n[[Page S11719]]\n\nsubject of the amendment I offered last night, an amendment to put that \nagreed-upon $292 million in the appropriations bill. We will have that \nvote, as well.\n  We are simply saying we ought to try to begin addressing this \nextraordinary deficiency we have. To say to a Native American, on a \nper-capita basis you are only going to get one-half of what we give our \nFederal prisoners is to defend a disparity that I cannot imagine we can \ndefend. I hope first we can commit to the $292 million. But since we \nare not ready to move forward on this BIA-OST reorganization plan that \nreally isn't a plan, or to spend the $79 million wisely, I am arguing \nthat we are certainly ready to spend it through the provision of Indian \nHealth Service clinical services. That is where it ought to go right \nnow until we know about trust land policy and how it will be \nimplemented and how we reorganize to implement that policy once it is \ndecided.\n  I thank my colleague. I know there are concerns about the weather. To \naccommodate staff and others I will not belabor this. I appreciate the \nopportunity to offer the amendment and look forward to the debate on \nMonday and the vote on Monday evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. I think the minority leader brings up a good number. How \ndo you reorganize a bureaucracy? That is always a great challenge in \nthis town, especially if you work in Washington, what I refer to as 17 \nsquare miles of logic-free environment.\n  There are some folks who want to catch some transportation out of \ntown. I will remark what the schedule will be. We will be talking quite \na lot about wildfires. We have good news: Four inches of snow this \nmorning at Glacier National Park and the temperature is dropping down \nnow to where we can get our arms around these fires. Nonetheless, it \ndid not take away from the devastation those fires brought to the west \nthis year and how we manage the dollars it takes to fight those fires. \nAnd it is every State's responsibility in this Union to respond to a \nnational problem.\n\n  If you look just at this year--this did not make great headlines--27 \nfirefighters died this year in wildfires on national lands--27. And \n789--at last count--homes and other structures were destroyed, and 2.8 \nmillion acres have burned.\n  During the recent Labor Day weekend, 25,000 firefighters were still \nworking on fires in the West. Now that is subsiding, that is over. Of \nthe 2.8 million acres, 600,000 acres are in my home State of Montana.\n  What does that mean? That means lives are disrupted and resources \nlost. Tourism was curtailed almost to nothing this year in those \nparticular areas that always see high summer tourism activity--Glacier \nNational Park, Yellowstone National Park.\n  We are going to hear in this debate: Well, maybe we should study it. \nWe have enough institutional memory already and data that tell us what \nwe are doing wrong. The Forest Service and private foresters were not \njust hired 10 years ago. They have been around a long time. And our \ninstitutional knowledge of fires goes back to the fires of 1988. That \nwas the fire, of course, that destroyed the better part of Yellowstone \nPark.\n  So we will have some visuals, and we will try to make the case that \nthis is a national problem and it must be solved by national leaders \nrepresenting every State in the Union. Every State in the Union has a \nstake in this because what the Forest Service has done, what the Bureau \nof Land Management has done, is they have raided other accounts to pay \nfor their firefighting activities. Now we must replace those dollars. \nIf we do not, that affects the Forest Service, BLM, Park Service, and \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in every State.\n  So as we move on this issue, I hope the Nation will draw its \nattention to what is the right thing to do because we have an $850 \nmillion problem we must take care of.\n  Mr. President, not seeing anyone else on the floor, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1739\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \noffered by my colleague, Senator Daschle, to increase clinical services \nin the Indian Health Service. I wish to speak just for a moment about \nthe issue I raised yesterday, that there is, in my judgment, a full-\nblown crisis on Indian reservations in this country dealing with health \ncare, education, and housing, and we are not addressing that crisis the \nway we should.\n  I have been pleased to work with my colleague from Montana, Senator \nBurns, who I think does a remarkable job. We have not gotten the \nallocation we really need in order to meet all the obligations we have. \nIncluded in those obligations, in my judgment, is the obligation to \nfund the Indian Health Service in order to provide the kind of medical \ntreatment that is necessary for those who are showing up at the Indian \nhealth treatment centers.\n  I must say, I just recently toured a clinic on the Fort Berthold \nReservation and talked to doctors, nurses, and health care delivery \npersonnel. They are wonderful people, but it is dramatically \nunderfunded. The fact is, if you have a heart attack at that Indian \nreservation at 5 o'clock, you are in some trouble because the clinic is \nclosed. They do not have the resources to keep it open. If you have a \nheart attack on a Saturday, you are in trouble because you won't have \naccess to the health care you need at that point.\n  So we need to work on these issues. We need to resolve these issues. \nSome say: Well, why special issues dealing with American Indians? The \nfact is, they were here before we were, first of all. But, second, \nNative Americans in this country have served this country in so many \nways, so many wonderful ways.\n  One Sunday morning, some years ago, I traveled to the veterans \nhospital in Fargo, ND, to present medals that were earned by an \nAmerican Indian. His name was Edmund Young Eagle. I have told my \ncolleagues about this, I believe, on one other occasion.\n  Edmund Young Eagle was an American Indian, living on the Fort Yates \nReservation. He was called to serve his country during the Second World \nWar. He left and went to serve. He served in Africa and in Europe, \nNormandy. He served this country with great distinction in World War \nII. Then he came back to live on the Indian reservation.\n  He never had very much, never married, never earned much income. He \ndid not, perhaps, have as much joy in his life as he would have liked. \nThen he developed lung cancer. In his mid seventies, when I met Edmund \nYoung Eagle, he was lying in a veterans hospital bed in his pajamas. I \ndidn't know it that Sunday morning, but he was about a week from dying. \nHe died a week later.\n  His sisters had asked me if I could achieve for him the medals he \nearned during World War II that he had never received. And I did. I \ntook them to the VA hospital on that Sunday morning. Edmund Young Eagle \nwas sick with, as I said, lung cancer. His sisters and the doctors and \nnurses came into the room. We cranked his bed up to a seated position, \nand I pinned those medals on Young Eagle's pajama top.\n  He earned those medals fighting for this country in the Second World \nWar. He had a very distinguished record. This very sick man, an \nAmerican Indian, said to me that Sunday morning in the hospital that it \nwas one of the proudest days of his life, as he sat there in his \nhospital bed wearing his military medals that he had earned serving \nthis country.\n  If you look at the service given this country by American Indians, \nNative Americans, who have been drafted and then enlisted in massive \nnumbers across this country, they have served in virtually every \nconflict, every war with great distinction.\n  Go to a pow-wow someday and watch those Native Americans wear their \nuniforms, being part of the American Legion or part of the group in \nthat reservation or with that particular tribe that is celebrating \ntheir service to our country, and you can't help but be enormously \nproud. But when you take a look at other things that are part of the \nculture of their lives, and you see service to their country was one \npart that was very important to them--and\n\n[[Page S11720]]\n\nthey served in higher numbers as a percentage of their population than \nalmost anyone in this country--most of them, many of them came back to \ntheir reservations to find there was a crisis in health care, housing, \nand education.\n\n  My colleague, Senator Daschle, offers an amendment dealing with \nhealth care. This is not just about veterans. It is about children. It \nis about retired folks. If you tour these Indian reservations and take \na look at what the Indian Health Service is doing, what the public \nhealth system is doing, we have some wonderful men and women working \nvery hard, long hours, doing the best they can, but the resources don't \nexist to provide the kind of health care for these children and these \ncitizens as exists in the rest of the country. It is just plain fact.\n  The Indian Health Service has a budget of about $2.5 billion. The \nanalysis is they need about $12 billion more. Of course, that is not \ngoing to happen. This is not some academic debate. This is not about \ntheory. This is about people living and dying. This is about life or \ndeath decisions for a lot of people, especially the more vulnerable in \nthat population. I am talking about children.\n  You want to hear stories about children who die because of chicken \npox. We can talk about that on some of these reservations. You don't \nhear that much anymore, people dying of chicken pox.\n  The primary health services that are available to American Indians on \nreservations are inadequate. I mentioned yesterday 5,000 people getting \ntheir dental care from one dentist in a small trailer. That is not \nhealth care. It doesn't meet the needs of those people on that \nreservation.\n  My colleague, Senator Daschle, offers an amendment to try to find \nsome additional resources for clinical services. I support that.\n  Senator Burns missed what I said about this bill. I said, Senator \nBurns has Indian reservations in Montana and cares a lot about these \nissues. We have done as well as we could given the allocation in this \nbill. I wish we could do more.\n  I support this amendment because it will do more. I recognize the \noffset comes from outside the bill, and there is some difficulty with \nthat. I think when you are talking about issues of life and death, we \nneed to make fit the solution that is necessary to provide the health \ncare needed, particularly by these children but also people who are \nmore vulnerable.\n  Go to an Indian reservation, for example, and talk to people about \ndiabetes. You will discover the rate of diabetes on, for example, the \nFort Berthold Reservation is not double or triple or quadruple the rate \nof diabetes in this country. It is 12 times the rate of diabetes, 12 \ntimes the rate of the American population.\n  One day I flew into New Town, ND, with the late Congressman Mickey \nLeland and former Congressman Tim Penny. We held a hearing on the Fort \nBerthold Reservation. We had a range of people talk to us about the \ndiabetes epidemic. Go to that reservation today and see the rows of \npeople doing renal dialysis to stay alive, go to the diabetes clinic--\nwhich I got funding for--and see what they are doing to try to deal \nwith this scourge called the diabetes epidemic.\n  There are so many challenges that need to be met and so few \nresources. That is why I fully support this amendment.\n  When I walked in the Chamber, my colleague from Montana was speaking \nof forest fires. North Dakota is a State that is ranked 50th among the \n50 States in native forest lands. We are a wonderful State. We cherish \nthe trees we have. But we rank 50th among the 50 States. We are not \naffected much by forest fires. We do have some range fires on the \ngrasslands. The forest fires, of the type my colleague and his \nconstituents face, or the forest fires we have read about in Colorado \nand Arizona and other areas, are devastating events. The fact is, we \nknow these events occur. This is not some tsunami or typhoon that \noccurs once every 5 or 10 years. We know these events occur.\n\n  As my colleague said, we ought to provide for the payment for fire \nsuppression and firefighting in the budgets that we put together. The \nPresident ought to do it. He ought to request it, and we ought to fund \nit. It doesn't make sense for us to pretend we are surprised when there \nis a forest fire. We must be the only people surprised. Forest fires \nhappen. There is no reason to continue having budgets come down from \nthe President that say, let's not adequately fund this so that we can \nborrow money from this, that, and the other place. Then we pretend we \nare shocked when a fire comes around and we have to pay for it. Then we \ntry to do some emergency fix someplace. That doesn't make sense to me.\n  Forest fires are devastating events. We know they are going to \nhappen. We should provide funding for fire suppression activities. \nHundreds of millions of dollars ought to be in these budgets. My \ncolleague from Montana and I are determined to try to make sense of \nthis and work with the White House and others to do the right thing. I \necho his comments about the urgency of doing that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, we vote to confirm 5 district court \nnominees, including 4 nominees to the U.S. district courts in New York.\n  With today's confirmations, the Senate will now have confirmed 151 \njudicial nominees for this President. This stands in stark contrast to \nwhat occurred with judicial nominees during the Clinton administration. \nMore than 3 years passed during President Clinton's second term, when \nRepublicans controlled the Senate, before the 150th judicial nominee \nwas confirmed. It also took more than three years from when the \nRepublicans gained control of the Senate majority in 1995 to confirm \n150 judges for President Clinton.\n  Moreover, this President's nominees have been considered more \nexpeditiously than were his father's or President Reagan's. It took \nPresident Reagan, during his first term, almost to the end of his \nfourth year to get 150 of his judicial nominees confirmed, and that was \nwith a Senate that was controlled by the same party. President Reagan's \n150th judicial nominee was not confirmed until September 17, 1984. It \nalso took President George H.W. Bush well into his fourth year to get \n150 of his judicial nominees confirmed. His 150th judicial nominee was \nnot confirmed until April 8, 1992.\n  In contrast with the shifts in Senate control, it has effectively \ntaken just 2 years of rapid Senate action to confirm 150 judicial \nnominees for this President. The fast and fair pace at which this \nSenate has considered this President's nominees is also demonstrated by \nhow many circuit court nominees have been confirmed. We have now \nconfirmed 28 circuit court nominees for President Bush since July of \n2001, which is more than were confirmed at this time in the third year \nof President Reagan's first term, President George H.W. Bush's term, or \neither of President Clinton's terms.\n  In contrast to how President Clinton's nominees were treated, the \nconfirmation process for these 5 district court nominees has been \nexpeditious and smooth. The 4 New York nominees come to us with broad \nbipartisan support, including the support of their two home-state \nSenators. Their confirmations today show how cooperation can work to \nfill vacancies on the Federal bench with qualified, experienced and \ndiverse candidates.\n  All four New York nominees were given hearings at the end of July \nunder an agreement that allowed them to be on a hearing on an expedited \nbasis. This was an example of how the Democratic members of the \nJudiciary Committee cooperated with the President and with the \nCommittee's Republican\n\n[[Page S11721]]\n\nmajority. Given the nominees' bipartisan support, I expect them to be \nunanimously confirmed today.\n  New York is an example of how a bipartisan process can work right to \nequip the Federal bench with excellent and moderate judges. All 4 of \nthese nominees have impressive legal careers, and received the highest \nrating from the American Bar Association.\n  Justice Feuerstein, nominated to the Eastern District of New York, \ncurrently serves as a justice in the New York State Appellate Division \nand has served as a judge in the New York State court system for \napproximately 15 years. Justice Feuerstein also has a distinguished \nrecord of service as a judge beyond her work on the bench, including \nserving as director of the Nassau County Bar Association and as \npresident of the Women's Bar Association of the State of New York.\n  Mr. Castel, Mr. Holwell, and Mr. Robinson, nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York, all have \nsignificant litigation experience as well as commendable records of \nproviding legal services to disadvantaged persons. Peter Castel is \ncurrently a partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel and has litigated there \nfor over 20 years. Among other civic activities, Mr. Castel has served \non the board of directors for the Legal Aid Society.\n  Richard Holwell has been practicing for over 31 years as a litigation \nattorney with White and Case in New York, where he has served as \nexecutive partner of the global litigation practice and a member of the \nfirm's management board. He has dedicated hundreds of hours to pro bono \nactivities every year, and received a Pro Bono Award from the NAACP \nLegal Defense and Education Fund for his services.\n  Stephen Robinson has significant experience in litigation and \ninvestigations. He served as the first African-American U.S. Attorney \nfor Connecticut, appointed by former President Clinton, from 1998 to \n2001. Prior to that, he had served as a litigator in private practice, \nas an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, and \nas a counsel and special assistant to the Director of the FBI. Mr. \nRobinson has also served as secretary and a member of the board of \ndirectors of MFY Legal Services, an organization that provides legal \nservices to the poor.\n  David Proctor is nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of Alabama, and comes to us with experience as a \nprivate practice attorney and the support of both of his home-state \nSenators. Mr. Proctor is filling a new position that was just created \non July 15, 2003.\n  Finally, I would like to point out that there are now more active \nGeorge W. Bush appointees on the bench than there are active George \nHerbert Walker Bush appointees. The President's father served 4 full \nyears. This President has served less than 3 and already has made as \nmuch impact on the Federal courts across the country.\n  We are glad that the Republican leadership has now agreed to confirm \nthese consensus nominees. We have and will continue to work with the \nRepublican leadership and Administration. We would like to be more \nhelpful in the President's identification of nominees and advising him \non the selection of consensus nominees so that we can join together in \nadding those confirmations to the 151 achieved as of today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/18/senate-section/article/S11721-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     LITTLE COUNTRY THEATER TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 90 years ago students at a small \nschool then known as the North Dakota Agricultural College created a \ndrama facility called the Little Country Theater. This was surprising--\nthe school was, after all, largely focused on agricultural science and \nprofessional training for specialities like pharmacy and chemistry. But \nthe college had one of those rare phenomena that every institution \nlusts after--a dynamic, driven professor who was both dreamer and doer.\n  For the next four decades, Alfred Arvold was the guiding force of the \nLittle Country Theater and the theater itself was the school's \nintellectual and artistic heart. Arvold and his students took an unused \nchapel and turned it into a home for drama; rebuilt an attic garret \ninto a faux log cabin that became the college's premier meeting spot, \none which hosted luminaries like Marian Anderson, Charles Laughton, \nYehudi Menuhin, Ethel Barrymore, Eugene Ormandy, Charles Lindberg, Paul \nRobeson and Carl Sandburg; and produced a flurry of productions, many \nwritten by the students themselves.\n  The focus of Arvold's philosophy was to bring theater to the public \nand he provided instructions and guidance for rural communities on how \nto produce plays at low cost and in the most modest of facilities, in \ncow pastures and haylofts, lit by lanterns and with planks for seating. \nDrama was to be used, he said, ``as a force in getting people together \nand acquainted. Instead of making the drama a luxury for the classes, \nits aim was to make it an instrument for the enlightenment and \nenjoyment of the masses.''\n  To do that, the Little Country Theater toured regularly, sometimes \ntraveling by special train and often producing sweeping outdoor epics--\none pageant mobilized 1,500 performers--that attracted huge crowds, \nincluding one of 30,000 spectators.\n  After Arvold retired, Dr. Frederick Walsh and then Dr. Tal Russell \ntook the reins and the theater moved in 1968 from its old quarters into \na few facility built with significant help by friends of the school, \nReuben and Hilda Askanase. By that time, the college had switched its \nname to North Dakota State University.\n  Despite those changes, the legacy of the Little Country Theater \ncontinued. There was still the outreach. For a number of summers a \ntroupe of actors known as the Prairie Stage toured the state, moving by \nsemi-truck and performing in a circus-like tent. An outdoor drama, \n``Old Four Eyes,'' a saga of Teddy Roosevelt's adventures in the North \nDakota Badlands, was written by Walsh and performed right in the \nBadlands. ``Trails West,'' the story of Custer's last days, was also \nperformed at Fort Lincoln, his last post.\n  During its 90 years, the Little Country Theater has produced 600 \nplays, turned out a number of performers who went on to professional \ncareers, entertained audiences, and, most critically of all, educated \ngenerations of students. It's a proud, vital, and continuing legacy \nthat I'm proud to acknowledge and, more importantly, honor today in the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/18/senate-section/article/S11721-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/18/senate-section/article/S11721-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/18/senate-section/article/S11721-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11721-S11722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n     RESPECT TO PERSONS WHO COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT \n                            TERRORISM--PM 49\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to extend eligibility for certain Federal benefits to \ncitizens of the Freely Associated States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy friend and colleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, to provide certain \nFederal public benefits for citizens of the Freely Associated States \n(FAS) who are residing in the United States. The bill would provide \neligibility for non-emergency Medicaid, Food Stamps, Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families, and Supplemental Security Income to FAS \ncitizens residing in the United States.\n  Citizens from the FAS are citizens from the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands (RMI), Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), and Palau. The \nUnited States has a very unique relationship with the FSM, RMI, and \nPalau. The Compact of Free Association established these Nations as \nsovereign States responsible for their own foreign policies. However, \nthe Freely Associated States remain dependent upon the United States \nfor military protection and economic assistance.\n  The Compact provides that the United States has the prerogative to \nreject the strategic use of, or military access to, the FAS by other \ncountries, which is often referred to as the ``right of strategic \ndenial.'' The Compact also provides that the United States may block \nFAS government policies that it deems inconsistent with its duty to \ndefend the FAS, which is referred to as the ``defense veto.'' Under the \nCompact, the United States has exclusive military base rights in the \nFAS. In exchange, the United States is required to support the FAS \neconomically, with the goal of producing self-sufficiency, and FAS \ncitizens are allowed entry into the United States as non-immigrants for \nthe purposes of education, medical treatment, and employment.\n  The Senate is considering S.J. Res. 16, the Compact of Free \nAssociation Amendments Act of 2003, which was favorably reported by the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources this morning. S.J. \nRes. 16 is the codification of title II of the Compact pertaining to \neconomic relations.\n  As FAS citizens are allowed free entry into the United States as part \nof the Compact, many FAS citizens reside in the State of Hawaii. Since \n1997, when Hawaii began reporting its impact costs, the State has \nidentified over $140 million in costs associated with FAS citizens. In \n2002, the State of Hawaii expended over $32 million in assistance to \nFAS citizens. S.J. Res. 16 provides $30 million in annual funding for \nCompact impact assistance to be shared between the State of Hawaii, \nGuam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American \nSamoa. While this funding is a positive step forward, it does not begin \nto reimburse the affected jurisdictions for the costs associated with \nFAS citizens living in Hawaii.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would provide assistance to \nStates and territories who have continued to shoulder the majority of \nthe costs associated with the Compact. The Federal Government must \nprovide appropriate resources to help States meet the needs of the FAS \ncitizens--an obligation based on a Federal commitment. It is \nunconscionable for a State or territory to shoulder the entire \nfinancial burden of providing necessary education, medical, and social \nservices to individuals who are residing in that State or territory \nwhen the obligation is that of the Federal Government. For that reason, \nI am seeking to provide reimbursement of these costs. It is time for \nthe Federal Government to take up some of the financial responsibility \nthat until now has been carried by the State of Hawaii, CNMI, and Guam, \nby restoring public benefits to FAS citizens.\n\n  This bill would restore eligibility of FAS citizens for non-emergency \nMedicaid. FAS citizens lost many of their public benefits as a result \nof the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity (PRWORA) Act of \n1996, including Medicaid coverage. FAS citizens were previously \neligible for Medicaid as aliens permanently residing under color of law \nin the United States.\n  After the enactment of welfare reform, the State of Hawaii could no \nlonger claim Federal matching funds for services rendered to FAS \ncitizens. Since then, the State of Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and \nthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have continued to meet \nthe health care needs of FAS citizens. The State of Hawaii has used \nState resources to provide Medicaid services to FAS citizens.\n\n[[Page S11724]]\n\nIn 2002 alone, the State spent approximately $6.75 million to provide \nMedicaid services without receiving any Federal matching funds.\n  There has been an increasing trend in the need for health care \nservices among FAS citizens. During the current fiscal year, the number \nof individuals served in the State of Hawaii's Medicaid Program has \ngrown from 3,291 to 4,818 people based on the average monthly \nenrollment. This is an increase of 46 percent. For only the first half \nof the fiscal year, the State of Hawaii has spent $4.66 million for the \nMedicaid costs incurred for FAS citizens. These Medicaid costs do not \nreflect additional State expenditures on medical care contracts to care \nfor the uninsured, for community health care services, and for the \nactivities of the Department of Health's Communicable Disease Branch.\n  This bill would also provide eligibility for FAS citizens residing in \nthe United States to participate in the Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies and Supplemental Security Income programs. According to \nHawaii's Attorney General, financial assistance in the form of the \nTemporary Assistance to Other Needy Families (TAONF) program, a State \nprogram, provided $4.5 million to FAS citizens in State Fiscal Year \n2002. Of this total, $390,000 was provided through the General \nAssistance program, which supports individuals and couples with little \nor no income and who have a temporary, incapacitating medical \ncondition; $532,000 supported aged, blind, and disabled FAS citizens \nwith little or no income who are not eligible for Federally funded \nSupplemental Security Income; and $3.6 million was spent on the State's \nTAONF program that assists other needy families who are not eligible \nfor Federal funding under the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families \nprogram. The number of FAS citizens served by the Hawaii Department of \nHuman Services has increased by almost 20 percent in the span of one \nyear alone. The financial assistance that the State of Hawaii provides \nto FAS citizens in the form of TAONF is a great support to those \nfamilies attempting to achieve economic stability, but it has a \nsignificant financial impact on the State's budget.\n  The bill would also provide eligibility for the Food Stamp Program. \nThe Food Stamp Program serves as the first line of defense against \nhunger. It is the cornerstone of the Federal food assistance program \nand provides crucial support to needy households and those making the \ntransition for welfare to work. We have partially addressed the \ncomplicated issue of alien eligibility for public benefits such as food \nstamps, but again, I must say it is just partial. Not only should all \nlegal immigrants receive these benefits, but so too citizens of the \nFAS. Exclusion of FAS citizens from Federal, State, or local public \nbenefits or programs is an unintended and misguided consequence of the \nwelfare reform law.\n  We allow certain legal immigrants eligibility in the program. Yet FAS \ncitizens, who are not considered immigrants, but who are required to \nsign up for the Selective Service if they are residing in the United \nStates, are ineligible to receive food stamps. This bill corrects this \ninequity.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this measure \nwhich is of critical importance to my State of Hawaii, which has borne \nthe costs of these benefits for FAS citizens living in Hawaii for the \npast 17 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1632\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require financial institutions and financial \nservices providers to notify customers of the unauthorized use of \npersonal information, to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require \nfraud alerts to be included in consumer credit files in such cases, and \nto provide customers with enhanced access to credit reports in such \ncases; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Identity Theft Notification and Credit Restoration Act, to help \nprevent Americans from being victimized by the growing problem of \nidentity theft. The bill would require financial institutions to notify \nconsumers, credit reporting agencies and law enforcement entities when \ntheir security information systems have been breached in a manner that \ncompromises the protection of their customers' personal financial \ninformation. By increasing awareness of identity theft and empowering \nconsumers, early on, about potential threats, the legislation can help \nclose the window of opportunity that criminals now exploit to abuse, \nand wreak financial devastation, on unsuspecting individuals.\n  There is no doubt that we should be doing all we can to reduce the \nthreat of identity theft to consumers, and the harm it brings to our \neconomy. Today, identity theft is the single most frequent consumer-\nrelated crime in the United States and it is growing at an alarming \nrate.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), reported instances \nof identity theft rose 88 percent in 2002, to 380,000 from 220,000 in \n2001. And that does not even come close to reflecting the bigger threat \nposed by identity theft. A recent FTC survey suggests that the actual \nnumber of identity theft occurrences probably was in the ten million \nrange--and that was last year alone. Over the past five years, over one \nin ten Americans has been a victim of identity theft. And I do not know \nanyone who does not have a close friend or family member who has been a \nvictim of identity theft. It truly can happen to anyone, anywhere, at \nany time.\n  The cost of this crime also is astounding. In situations in which \noffenders use stolen information to open new credit accounts, identity \nthieves abuse victims' credit to purchase an average of more than \n$10,000 in goods and services. And those costs grow as identity thieves \nbecome savvier and\n\n[[Page S11725]]\n\nmore brazen. From a macro-economic perspective, the damage is equally \nastounding. Last year, consumers spent an estimated five billion \ndollars in out-of-pocket expenses to cover losses attributed to \nidentity theft.\n  This data underscores the magnitude of the growing problem. But it is \none that can be mitigated, when detected early on. The FTC has reported \nthat early discovery, and disclosure, of identity theft directly \nreduces the time and money victims must invest to undo the damage \nwreaked upon them. When identity theft is uncovered in less than 6 \nmonths, most consumers do not incur any costs. But, when this fraud is \nunnoticed for more than 6 months, an astounding 60 percent of victims \nmust make payments out of their own pocket to cover the costs--and \nthose numbers are often in the thousands of dollars.\n  Consumers' experiences and the FTC's data demonstrate that awareness \nand notification are critical to reducing the harm that identity theft \ninflicts upon consumers. My bill, the Identity Theft Notification and \nCredit Restoration Act is based on three key principles--disclosure, \nprevention and credit restoration.\n  First, the bill would require financial institutions to promptly \ndisclose to affected customers, credit reporting agencies, and law \nenforcement when their information systems, either computerized or \npaper records, have been breached in a manner that compromises the \nsecurity, confidentiality, or integrity of the ``personal financial \ninformation'' of that institution's customers.\n  Second, the bill requires credit reporting agencies, upon \nnotification of the breach, to place ``fraud alerts'' in the credit \nfiles of the affected individuals. This red flag will alert issuers of \ncredit to undertake enhanced preauthorization procedures prior to \nissuing credit in the name of an individual who has this alert on their \ncredit file, an important step that should prevent the fraudulent \nissuance of credit in the name of an identity theft victim.\n  Finally, the bill provides victims of identity theft with access to \nfour credit reports the year following the theft of their identity, to \nensure that inaccurate and credit damaging information resulting from \nthe identity theft does not end up on their credit file.\n  The bill also improves the ability of all consumers to monitor the \ncontent, and accuracy, of the information contained in their individual \ncredit file by providing them with access to one free credit report, \nand their credit score, per year.\n  Congress has taken important steps towards minimizing the threat of \nidentity theft. The most important was recognizing the problem and \nmaking identity theft a Federal crime in 1998. Since then, other steps \nhave been taken. Industry groups are proactively combating identity \ntheft--by using cutting-edge data encryption and truncating credit card \nnumbers. And later this week, the Senate Banking Committee will mark up \nreauthorization of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which will include an \nentire section dedicated to identity theft protection.\n  But we can do more, and we must do more.\n  Empowering consumers and increasing awareness of identity theft will \nminimize the risk, and impact, of this particularly harmful crime. This \nbill does just that. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the Identity Theft \nNotification and Credit Restoration Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1633\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Identity Theft Notification \n     and Credit Restoration Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the privacy and financial security of individuals is \n     increasingly at risk due to the ever more widespread \n     collection of personal information by both the private and \n     public sector;\n       (2) credit card transactions, real estate records, consumer \n     surveys, credit reports, and Internet websites are all \n     sources of personal information and form the source material \n     for identity thieves;\n       (3) identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes \n     committed in the United States, and identity theft has become \n     one of the major law enforcement challenges of the new \n     economy, as vast quantities of sensitive personal information \n     are now vulnerable to criminal interception and misuse;\n       (4) criminals who steal personal information use the \n     information to open fraudulent credit card accounts, write \n     bad checks, buy products, and commit other financial crimes \n     with assumed financial identities;\n       (5) in 2002, more than 160,000 people notified the Federal \n     Trade Commission that they had been victims of identity \n     theft, more than 3 times the number reported in 2000;\n       (6) identity theft is costly to consumers and to the United \n     States marketplace;\n       (7) victims of identity theft are often required to contact \n     numerous Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, \n     consumer credit reporting agencies, and creditors over many \n     years, as each event of fraud arises;\n       (8) the Government, financial institutions, financial \n     service providers, and credit reporting agencies that handle \n     sensitive personal information of consumers have a shared \n     responsibility to protect the information from identity \n     thieves, to assist identity theft victims, and to mitigate \n     the harm that results from fraud perpetrated in the name of \n     the victim; and\n       (9) the private sector can better protect consumers by \n     improving customer notification, implementing effective fraud \n     alerts, affording greater consumer access to credit reports, \n     and establishing other financial identity theft prevention \n     measures.\n\n     SEC. 3. TIMELY NOTIFICATION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO \n                   PERSONAL INFORMATION.\n\n       Subtitle B of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 6821 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating sections 526 and 527 as sections 528 \n     and 529, respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after section 525 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 526.
