Under the previous order, the hour of 9 a.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will resume the consideration of S. 504, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 504) to establish academies for teachers and \n     students of American history and civics and a national \n     alliance of teachers of American history and civics, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 951\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the substitute \namendment to S. 504, which is at the desk, be agreed to, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 951) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on March 4, I made the maiden speech \nthe majority leader has encouraged each of us new Senators to make. I \nchose two urgent issues I care most about: The education of our \nchildren, No. 1; and the principles that unite us as Americans, No. 2. \nI then introduced S. 504, the American History and Civics Education Act \nof 2003.\n  In a few minutes, we will vote on that bill. Its purpose is to help \nput the teaching of American history and civics in its rightful place \nin our schools so our children can grow up learning what it means to be \nan American. Its purpose is to inspire better teaching and more \nlearning of the key events, key documents, key persons,\n\n[[Page S8262]]\n\nand key ideas that shaped the institutions and democratic heritage of \nthe United States of America.\n  This legislation would do that by creating summer academies for \nstudents and teachers of American history and civics. There will be up \nto 12 Presidential Academies for teachers. These might last 2 weeks and \nbe sponsored by an educational institution or a nonprofit organization. \nAnd there will be up to 12 4-week Congressional Academies for students.\n  It also creates a State-by-State national alliance of history and \ncivics teachers, and authorizes $25 million for these purposes.\n  We need this legislation because our children are not learning what \nit means to be an American. In his testimony before our committee, \nauthor David McCullough spoke of Ivy League college students who think \nAbraham Lincoln was President before the Civil War and that Germany and \nItaly were our Allies during World War II. One-third of fourth, eighth, \nand twelfth graders do not even have basic knowledge about American \nhistory and civics, making them what one might call civic illiterates. \nThey are not learning it because, in too many instances, it is not \nbeing taught.\n  Civics too often is dropped from school curricula. More than half the \nStates have no requirements for a course in American government and \nAmerican history. When it is taught, it is too often watered down. The \ntextbooks are too dull, the pages too often feature victims and \ndiminish heroes. Because of politically correct attitudes from the \nright and from the left, teachers are afraid to teach the great \ncontroversies, the great conflicts, the great struggles, the great \nstories that are the heritage, the essence of American history.\n  This effort has overwhelming support in the Congress--36 U.S. \nSenators of both parties. An identical bill has been introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and 160 \nMembers of the House, of both parties, support it.\n\n  I want especially to reiterate my thanks to the majority leader who, \nduring a busy time, has found time for this small but important piece \nof legislation, and to the Democratic whip, Mr. Reid, who has also made \nit possible for there to be time for this in the midst of this debate \nand who is the prime cosponsor of this legislation. I thank Chairman \nGregg of our committee for reporting it promptly and for cosponsoring \nit, and Senator Kennedy, the ranking member, who did not just cosponsor \nit but was busy gathering other cosponsors.\n  I want to acknowledge, too, the support of Conrad Burns, the Senator \nfrom Montana, a historian who is chairman of the relevant \nappropriations subcommittee, and especially Senator Byrd of West \nVirginia, who has been a leader in other legislation that has passed \nthis body on American history, and who took the time to come to the \nhearing on this legislation, in person, and to testify.\n  I yield the floor and reserve whatever time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent Senator Lautenberg be added as a \ncosponsor to S. 504.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Alexander said, ``It's time to put the teaching of \nhistory and civics back in its rightful place in our schools so our \nchildren grow up learning what it means to be an American.''\n  That is really what this is all about. It is about having history and \ncivics as a part of what our schools are about and should be about. I \nacknowledge, as I did last night on the Senate floor, the leadership of \nthe Senator from Tennessee, the former Secretary of Education, in \npushing this legislation to the point where it is.\n  I hope this is the first of many such measures that we work on here. \nI believe in local control of schools. But I also believe the Federal \nGovernment must recognize national problems in education and address \nthose problems and help local school districts meet what I believe are \nnational imperatives. Certainly, this is one.\n  It is so easy to shortchange these courses. As I look back at some of \nthe great teachers I had, they taught history and government on the \nhigh school level. A man by the name of Michael Callahan taught basic \nhistory and government in high school in Henderson, NV, where I went to \nschool. But for him I am not sure I would have the interest in \ngovernment and history that I have today. He allowed us to participate \nin government. He allowed us to understand history. He was a dynamic \nteacher.\n\n  I believe that is what we are trying to do here--give teachers the \ntools they need to become better teachers. Obviously, teachers have \nchosen their profession in the effort to improve the lives of children \nthey teach. This legislation deals with courses K through 12. But even \nthough these teachers have chosen teaching as their profession, it \ndoesn't mean they don't need help. That is what this is all about--to \nhelp them through this academy and become better teachers who are \nbetter equipped to do the things they need to do to teach.\n  This legislation is not going to be based just in the South or the \nNortheast or just in the Midwest. The legislation calls for 12 regional \nacademies to be determined by the Chairman of the National Endowment \nfor the Humanities. He will choose the academies on a regional basis. \nThis program will be effective all over the United States. I am \nconfident that the Presidential Academies for teaching American history \nand civics will be important. There will be 12 of them. There will be \nup to 12 Congressional Academies for students of American history and \ncivics.\n  I am convinced that if we show we are concerned about education here \nin Washington, the schools at home will become better schools and \nteachers will become better teachers. I hope this will receive \nunanimous support.\n  This is only the first step. It is easy for us here in Washington to \npass legislation where we authorize things to happen, but the next step \nis appropriating the money to make sure that the authorization we have \nmade is effective. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee and I have \nhad the assurance of members of the Appropriations Committee that they \nwill allow us to go this next step and have money appropriated.\n  As I indicated last night, Senator Byrd having participated in the \npublic hearing is a step in the right direction. Senator Conrad Burns  \nhas indicated he will be helpful. I look forward to working in the \nappropriations process to make sure we carry forward on the promise of \nSenator Lamar Alexander, a Senator who authored this legislation, \nindicating it is important to put the teaching of American history and \ncivics in its right place in our schools so children can grow and learn \nwhat it means to be an American.\n  Mr. Kennedy. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the American \nHistory and Civics Education Act to create academies for teachers and \nhigh school students of American history. The bill will expand the \nprograms of the National Endowment for the Humanities to improve the \neducational experience of young Americans and broaden their \nunderstanding of our unique heritage.\n  The American national experience is a comparatively short one, but \nits early struggles, revolutionary roots, and democratic ideals have \nshaped our national character. Early American history includes eras of \nprosperity and progress, dark years of war, and racial struggles. Each \nof these defining moments has called forth great leaders and national \nheroes, in all walks of life, who unhesitatingly offered their \nresources, their efforts and, sometimes, their lives on behalf of their \nbelief in the principles of tolerance, religious freedom, and equality. \nEach generation of Americans has defended those principles and, in the \nprocess, strengthened our national purpose and resolve.\n  To prepare the next generation of American leaders, we must ensure \nthat they understand not only these historic challenges and \nachievements but also the key documents that are our enduring \nguideposts, especially the Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n  This legislation, introduced by my colleague from Tennessee, will \nauthorize a competitive grant program for institutions of higher \neducation and nonprofit educational research centers to conduct summer \nseminars for history teachers to strengthen their skills in\n\n[[Page S8263]]\n\ntheir subject area. These seminars will enable teachers to develop a \nbroader understanding of history and also new skills and enthusiasm to \npresent this material to their students.\n  The legislation also authorizes a competitive grant program for \nacademies for outstanding high school juniors and seniors who have \nexcelled in their study of history. These academies will enable these \npromising young students to learn from especially talented teachers and \nprovide a special opportunity for them to advance their understanding \nof the great achievements of our proud Nation.\n  The HELP Committee conducted an impressive hearing on this \nlegislation earlier this year. Among the several distinguished \nwitnesses who appeared before the committee was the Pulitzer Prize-\nwinning historian, David McCullough. He spoke eloquently of the urgent \nneed to improve the educational experience of history students.\n  He reminded us that passion for learning is ``caught not taught,'' \nand that the better prepared our teachers are, the more likely we are \nto stimulate a new generation of historians, history lovers, and \nnational leaders.\n  Mr. McCullough also suggested that those institutions that ultimately \nconduct these academies should reach out to their local Park Service \nhistoric sites, which offer incredible resources and a birds-eye view \nof history to enthusiastic visitors. He has been an ongoing presence at \nboth the Longfellow House and the Adams Historic Park sites in \nMassachusetts during his research on his impressive biography of John \nAdams. Those same artifacts are accessible to all aspiring history \nlovers and can ignite a passion for visitors to these sites as they \nvisualize John Adams at his desk writing his friend, Thomas Jefferson, \ndebating the goals and dreams of a young Nation.\n  John Adams wrote, ``I must study politics and war that my sons may \nhave the liberty to study mathematics and philosophy . . .  in order to \ngive their children the right to study painting, poetry and music.'' \nOur second President was a great leader in his time and his words \ninspire all Americans to learn more about our past in order to better \nprepare for the future. If we neglect study in the arts and humanities, \nwe will know considerably less about ourselves, our Nation, our allies \nand our adversaries--and we will be considerably less prepared for the \nchallenges which loom on the horizon.\n  The new academies will be under the jurisdiction of the National \nEndowment for the Humanities whose Chairman, Bruce Cole, is doing an \nimpressive job at the Endowment. As an historian himself, he knows the \nimportance of our goal.\n  The bill is a timely and important initiative which will make \nAmerican history come alive for students, and serve our communities and \nour country well in the years ahead. I commend Senator Alexander for \nhis leadership in developing this bipartisan legislation that is based \non the model which he implemented earlier as Governor of Tennessee. I \nam confident that these summer academies will enrich the learning \nexperience of thousands of young students who want to know more about \ntheir heritage as Americans.\n  It is a visionary effort and I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin supporting it today.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada, the \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader, for his comments late last \nevening when we discussed this bill and for his support. I look forward \nto working with him on other education legislation in a bipartisan way. \nI am glad he talked about appropriations. Senator Stevens also is a \ncosponsor of the bill, for which we are pleased.\n  People from potential sponsoring institutions have asked me how this \nmight work.\n  First, the legislation has to be passed. But given the strong \nbipartisan support it has in both Houses, if it were to be passed and \nthe money were to be appropriated in a reasonable period of time, the \nfirst of these academies might open in the summer of 2004. For that to \nhappen, the National Endowment for the Humanities would need to receive \napplications beginning this fall. I hope the universities, the \nnonprofit organizations, and the State educational institutions will \nbegin to prepare for that. They might look at the Governors' Schools \nacross this country in many States as models.\n  At a time when the United States of America is under attack because \nof who we are, it is crucial that our children learn the values and \nprinciples that make this the United States of America. When you move \nto France or Japan, you don't become French or Japanese. When you move \nto the United States and seek to become an American citizen, you become \nan American, because of what we believe in, a few principles--liberty, \nequal opportunity, individualism, laissez-faire, the rule of law, \nfederalism, e pluribus unum, the free exercise of religion, the \nseparation of church and state, and a belief in progress. We almost all \nagree on those principles. Our politics is about applying them. That is \nwhat we debate every day here. We need to be teaching our children, as \nthe Senator from Nevada said, these principles so they will grow up \nknowing what it means to be an American.\n  I urge all Senators to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on passage of the bill, as \namended. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), \nthe Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell), the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Hagel), the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Lugar), and the Senator from \nOhio (Mr. Voinovich) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to amend Title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act to make improvements in the Medicare Program, to provide \n     prescription drug coverage under the Medicare Program, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Bingaman Amendment No. 933, to eliminate the application of \n     an asset test for purposes of eligibility for premium and \n     cost-sharing subsidies for low-income beneficiaries.\n       Dorgan Amendment No. 946, as amended, to provide greater \n     access to affordable pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 946, as amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes of debate equally divided \non the Dorgan amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, who controls time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls 2 \nminutes. The manager will control 2 minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment deals with reimportation of \nprescription drugs. It is designed to try to put downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices in this country. It is not my intention or \ndesire that Americans go elsewhere to acquire prescription drugs. But \nthe fact is that U.S. consumers pay the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs. In North Dakota, for example, there is a pharmacy \nin the town of Pembina, and if you buy a prescription drug in that one-\nroom pharmacy--\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 5 miles north of that North Dakota one-\nroom drugstore, in Emerson, Canada, you will find, if you have breast \ncancer and have to buy Tamoxifen, that the drug that you pay $10 for in \nthe U.S. can be purchased for $1 5 miles north.\n  The question is, why should that happen? It should not happen. Let \nthe market system deal with this. These are FDA-approved drugs. It is \nthe same pill put in the same bottle by the same company. We ought to \nhave fair pricing for Americans, and if not fair pricing here, then \nallow them to access those prescription drugs from a chain of custody \nin Canada that is safe. We are only talking about licensed pharmacists \nand distributors being able to access that FDA-approved drug from a \nlicensed pharmacist or distributor in Canada. We have accepted the \nCochran language. We don't think that injures this because, in the \ncircumstance, we have changed the reimportation amendment to deal only \nwith Canada, which has nearly an identical chain of supply and would \ntherefore represent a safe drug supply for our pharmacists and \ndistributors to access and to be able to pass the savings along to the \nAmerican consumer. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \naddressing a major oversight in S. 1, the Prescription Drug and \nMedicare Improvement Act of 2003. The bill has absolutely no provisions \nto control the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs, and, as \ncurrently written, is really just a blank check for big drug companies.\n  If one looks at the costs of prescription drugs, the numbers are just \nastounding. Seniors in the U.S. who lack drug coverage must pay twice \nas much for the five most popular drugs as purchasers in many foreign \ncountries. All Americans who need prescription drugs could benefit from \nimproved access to lower-priced drugs from Canada. Brand-name drugs \ncost an average of 38 percent less in Canada than in the United States. \nThis could mean literally hundreds of dollars less a year for U.S. \npurchasers.\n  For several years now, many of my colleagues have been fighting to \nprovide access to lower prescription drug\n\n[[Page S8266]]\n\nprices for seniors and all Americans by sponsoring a reimportation plan \nthat is safe, effective and keeps savings in the pockets of seniors. I \nam happy to join several of my colleagues here today to cosponsor and \nsupport this amendment to the prescription drug bill. I want to \nespecially thank Senator Dorgan for his leadership on this issue. He \nhas worked hard to try to bring a solution to the skyrocketing prices \nseniors and all Americans must now pay for their prescription drugs.\n  As costs continue to rise for consumers, and pharmacies' profit \nmargins continue to shrink, a quick look at net profits of drug firms \npaint the real story. While Fortune 500 companies have experienced \nclose to only a 1-percent increase in net profits over the last 30 \nyears, and pharmacies have experienced a net loss of about that amount, \ndrug firms have experienced an over 1-percent increase in such profits. \nBut still, we seem to ignore the manufacturers exorbitant U.S. prices \nover and over.\n  The Dorgan amendment would improve access to lower priced drugs by \nallowing wholesalers and pharmacists to import prescription drugs from \nCanada, which has a similar drug approval and distribution system as \nthe United States. The amendment also would enable individuals to \nimport prescription drugs from Canada as long as the drugs are for \ntheir personal use and they do not exceed a 90-day supply.\n  This amendment finally says to the drug companies, enough is enough. \nI think if we work together we get a handle on the unrestrained costs \nof drugs in this country. Efforts such as those in the Dorgan amendment \nand those just embraced by many of my colleagues who joined me in \ncosponsoring and supporting the generics amendment yesterday will make \nsuch an important difference in the true value of what a drug benefit \ncan really do to help seniors. I sincerely hope that all of my \ncolleagues, on both sides of the aisle, will commit to adopting the \nprovisions in the reimportation amendment in order to enhance the value \nof this legislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Dorgan amendment on \ndrug importation.\n  Frankly, given the history of this amendment, I feel a little like we \nare in the movie, Groundhog Day. We have been there and done that. And \nlike the Bill Murray movie, we appeared to have gone there and done \nthat again last night. When I woke this morning, I had the feeling of \ndeja vu all over again.\n  Each time the same thing happens. First we consider a flawed drug \nreimportation amendment. Then we adopt a second degree amendment that \nvirtually guarantees the amendment can never be implemented. We did it \nin the 106th Congress, and Secretary Shalala--the Clinton \nadministration's Secretary of Health and Human Services--could not \ncertify the safety of reimported drugs. We did it in the 107th Congress \nagain last year when the Senate adopted a reimportation amendment \nduring the debate on the ill-fated vehicle, S. 812. And now last night \nwe did it in the 108th Congress. The same dynamic played out yet again \nwith the Dorgan amendment and the second degree amendment thereto.\n  Let me remind my colleagues. Here is what the Bush Administration's \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, said about this \nidea last year: ``Opening our borders to reimported drugs potentially \ncould increase the flow of counterfeit drugs, cheap foreign copies of \nFDA-approved drugs, expired and contaminated drugs, and drugs stored \nunder inappropriate and unsafe conditions. In light of the anthrax \nattacks of last fall, that's a risk we simply cannot take.''\n  I agree with Secretary Thompson that reimportation was not ever a \ngood idea. But, it could be even more deadly after September 11th. \nAlthough I am not a betting man, I can guess what Secretary Thompson \nwill say if this unfortunate amendment survives the conference \ncommittee.\n  This year's version of the Dorgan amendment contains a new section \nrelating to the effective date of the amendment. This modification \nattempts to make the proposal effective prior to the Secretary \ndetermining that the benefits of this law outweigh the risk.\n  Fortunately, the Cochran amendment we adopted last night by voice \nvote makes it clear that nothing in the Dorgan amendment can take \neffect unless the Secretary finds that the provision: first, poses no \nadditional risk to the public health and safety; or, second, will \nresult in a significant reduction in the drug costs.\n  My preference is for no Dorgan amendment at all. But if his language \nis adopted, it is essential that we have the Cochran correcting proviso \nso that the American public can be protected against unsafe drugs.\n  I agree with my friend, John Dingell, the Dean of the House of \nRepresentatives, and author of the 1988 Prescription Drug Marketing \nAct, PDMA, that helped put rigorous safety controls in the U.S. drug \ndistribution system. Mr. Dingell said, ``the very existence of a market \nfor reimported goods provides the perfect cover for foreign \ncounterfeits.''\n  Representative Dingell's Energy and Commerce Committee produced a \nreport that succinctly explained why the PDMA was needed: \n``[R]eimported pharmaceuticals threaten the public health in two ways. \nFirst, foreign counterfeits, falsely described as reimported U.S. \nproduced drugs, have entered the distribution system. Second, proper \nstorage and handling of legitimate pharmaceuticals cannot be guaranteed \nby U.S. law once the drugs have left the boundaries of the United \nStates.''\n  This view is consistent with the testimony that the experts at FDA \nhave given before Congress numerous times.\n  As the FDA's senior associate commissioner for policy, planning, and \nlegislation, Bill Hubbard, has warned: ``Even if the Canadian system is \nevery bit as good as ours . . . the Canadian system is every bit as \ngood as ours . . . the Canadian system is open to vulnerabilities by \npeople who will try to enter the U.S. market . . . because that is \nwhere the money is.''\n  A bipartisan group of some 10 former FDA Commissioners have voiced \ntheir concern about the safety of reimported pharmaceuticals. So has \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration.\n  We are told by the experts that the number of counterfeit cases is on \nthe rise. FDA has opened more than 70 counterfeit drug cases since \nOctober 1998, including 26 arrests and 20 convictions through last \nJune. In the last two months, FDA has issued alerts on counterfeit \nLipitor. In March, the FDA found that doctored EPO--a product vital to \npatients fighting cancer and other deadly diseases--has been the target \nof counterfeiters in previous instances.\n  Let us remember the sage counsel we were all taught in elementary \nschool--safety first. Unfortunately, the Dorgan amendment conflicts \nwith this important lesson.\n\n  To summarize, my primary reason for opposing this amendment is a \nconcern expressed by many public health and safety experts: Opening up \nthe current closed U.S. drug distribution system to products of unknown \npedigree will result in disaster down the road.\n  I know that Senator Dorgan and the other cosponsors of the amendment \nare motivated only by their desire to do right by their constituents \nand other Americans trying to obtain affordable pharmaceuticals. We all \nshare in that goal. This is why we are working in a bipartisan fashion \nto craft a $400 billion Medicare drug benefit program. Let us focus on \nthe Medicare drug benefit during this debate and not get sidetracked on \nill-conceived measures like the Dorgan reimportation amendment.\n  Let me close by saying this to my friend from North Dakota, with whom \nI serve on the Finance Committee: We have worked together on several \ntrade issues involving Canada. We have struggled with how to respond \neffectively to the problems associated by the influx of protected \nCanadian softwood lumber and the actions of the less-than transparent \nCanadian Wheat Board.\n  My friend from North Dakota does not like it when the actions of the \nCanadian government unfairly benefit Canadian producers of wood and \nwheat relative to American loggers and farmers. This is so even if the \npreferentially-treated Canadian products can undercut the prices \noffered by American producers to American consumers.\n  In this debate on drugs, we often hear heart-wrenching stories of \nseniors being forced to choose between paying for drugs or paying for \nfood or paying the rent. When it comes to weighing\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\nthe interests of loggers and farmers versus the lowest cost goods, my \nfriend from North Dakota carefully, and appropriately, factors in the \nlong term interests of preserving vital U.S. industries. He does not \nautomatically support policies that result in U.S. consumers, \nparticularly our seniors, paying the lowest possible prices for such \nessential products as bread and wood.\n  Not so with price-controlled Canadian drugs. First, the Canadian \ngovernment ratchets down the prices of drugs for its citizens. Comes \nnow the Dorgan amendment that acts to pass on these controlled prices \nto U.S. consumers. If passing on Canadian government-controlled prices \nis such a good policy for drugs, then I ask why it is so bad when the \nCanadian government acts to artificially hold down the price of wheat \nand lumber and pass these savings along to the American consumer?\n  Let us face facts. Money is fungible. If the proper response to \neasing the choice among food, medicine and shelter is always to end up \nwith the lowest prices then why should we not applaud equally the \nCanadian Wheat Board and the Canadian drug price control agency?\n  My answer is that government price controls, subsidy programs, and \npreferential treatment are never the preferred policy option--whether \nwe are talking about food, medicine or the mortgage.\n  Let me close by saying that my fundamental objection to the Dorgan \namendment is the safety risks it would engender. In addition, I have \nconcerns over embarking on a policy that has the effect of imposing \ngovernment price controls on a product highly dependent on investment \ncapital, and let the Canadian government do the price controlling to \nboot.\n  I only hope that we can some day break the cycle of passing a piece \nof legislation with a circuit breaker provision that will always be \ntripped and ensure the underlying language, thankfully, will never take \neffect. Enough of Groundhog Day.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Dorgan amendment on \nimportation of foreign drugs. It is essential that my colleagues \nunderstand the gravity of what we are about to vote on today. My \ncolleagues yesterday passed the Cochran second degree amendment by \nvoice vote, ensuring that none of the provisions in the Dorgan \namendment would become effective unless the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services certifies to Congress that the implementation of the \nDorgan amendment would (1) pose no additional risk to public health and \nsafety, and (2) result in a significant cost savings for Americans.\n  While this safety and cost savings certification threshold determines \nwhether the Dorgan importation language would ever become effective in \nthe first place, I believe that in this era of increasing bioterrorist \nthreats, now more than ever, we should not pass new drug importation \nlegislation at all. Allowing the importation of drugs from Canada by \npharmacists and wholesalers would simply encourage further \nproliferation of schemes to use Canada as a transshipment point for \nsending unapproved, expired, counterfeit or otherwise dangerous drugs \nto American consumers. The Assistant Deputy Minister of Health Canada \nclearly stated in a May 9 letter this year that, ``The Government of \nCanada has never stated that it would be responsible for the safety and \nquality of prescription drugs exported from Canada into the United \nStates, or any other country for that matter.''\n  Allowing pharmacists and wholesalers to import drugs directly from \nsources outside the U.S. will further encourage the proliferation of \npurportedly ``Canadian'' Internet Pharmacies that are not from Canada. \nA 2003 Global Options report stated that 33 percent of so-called \n``Canadian'' internet pharmacies are not from Canada. One was \n``Canadarxfree.com'' and the actual country of origin was Mexico. \nAnother, ``Trustedcanadianpharmacy.com'' had Barbados as the actual \ncountry of origin.\n  Another troubling real-life example cited by Bill Hubbard, the Senior \nAssociate Commissioner for Policy, Planning and Legislation at FDA \nduring a June 12, 2003 hearing before the house Government Reform \nSubcommittee was, ``. . . we have an example of an 82-year-old \ngentleman who bought two drugs from a website.--[H]e was told on that \nwebsite and when he made the phone call that he was getting a U.S. \nproduced drug, sold in Canada and sold back to him. He got Indian drugs \nthat are not approved, have no labeling, no information and he called \nthe FDA and was outraged why are we letting this stuff in.'' The FDA \ndetermined the drugs were counterfeit.\n  The so-called documentation requirements in the Dorgan amendment \ncould easily be circumvented, forged and lack verification standards. \nIn July 2002, the Department of HHS sent a letter to Senator Cochran \nthat described the problems with allowing pharmacists and wholesalers \nand even individuals to import drugs from Canada, ``Since counterfeits \ncan easily be commingled with authentic product, either by the case, by \nthe bottle or by the pill, there is no sampling or testing protocol \nsufficient to protect against the grave public harm they pose.''\n  All of my concerns about importation and risks to the health and \nsafety of Americans that I have expressed do not even include the \nreasons I believe this Dorgan amendment is truly unnecessary. We are in \nthe midst of debating and passing a landmark Medicare prescription drug \nbill. Through this historic legislation we will provide our seniors \nwith affordable access to medicines, without exposing them to the very \nreal risks of counterfeit, subpotent, unapproved, adulterated, or \nmisbranded drugs from importation. We have also gone a step further in \naddressing the affordability of medicines by overwhelmingly supporting \nthe Gregg-Schumer amendment yesterday, which will allow generics to \nenter the market faster. Together with the President's recently issued \nfinal rule, this amended bill will save Americans money by improving \naccess to more affordable generic drugs. I commend the President for \nproposing in this 2004 budget request, an unprecedented increase of $13 \nmillion in spending for FDA's generic drug programs. By increasing the \nprogram's size by almost one-third of its current size, FDA will be \nable to hire more generic drug application reviewers and approve \ngenerics faster.\n  With all of the new information we now have about the dangers of \nimportation and fraudulent websites, we owe it to our seniors to pass a \nmeaningful, comprehensive Medicare drug benefit without exposing them \nto the very real risk of obtaining counterfeit imported medicines.\n  I again urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Dorgan amendment, \neven as modified by my second degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, even though we adopted the Cochran \namendment by voice vote, which requires certification that drugs \nimported through Canada are safe, and that they significantly reduce \ncosts to American consumers, if the Dorgan amendment passes, it creates \na new opportunity, a new source for importation of drugs into our \ncountry from other countries besides Canada. There are manufacturing \nfacilities right now in India, in France, and in China, where drugs are \nbeing manufactured to look like American drugs that have been approved \nin this market but are counterfeit drugs. Some are truly unsafe because \nof the unsanitary conditions under which they are manufactured. Some do \nnot contain anything like the ingredients the labels say they contain.\n  Mr. President, this is a new threat to the security and safety of \nAmerican citizens. We don't have the Food and Drug Administration \ninspectors, U.S. Postal Service inspectors, or the U.S. Customs Service \nagents to monitor the new importation that will flood into this country \nfrom Canada--but not necessarily manufactured in Canada, not \nnecessarily manufactured in the U.S. and sold in Canada and reimported, \nwhich is the purpose of this amendment. But it opens a new door, a new \nopportunity, and it is a new threat to the security of the people of \nthis country. I urge that we vote no on the Dorgan amendment.\n  I yield time to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I love this idea that we are going to \nlet markets work and have free trade.\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\nWhat the Senator doesn't tell you is the reason the price is $1 instead \nof $10 is that Canada sets the price. Canada says: If you want to sell \ndrugs here, fine, here is what we will pay. If you don't agree, you \ncannot sell the drug. If we really want to sell your drug, we will \nsteal your patent and we will make the drug up here and sell it for the \nprice we want.\n  That is the law in Canada. So if you want free trade, great, we will \nhave them set the price for all the agricultural products up there and \nbe able to set that and send it back here and call that free trade.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have price controls on prescription \ndrugs in this country. It is just that the prescription drug \nmanufacturers control the price. My friends want to have a debate we \nare not having. The only access to prescription drugs we are talking \nabout is from licensed pharmacies or distributors--accessing \nprescription drugs from a licensed pharmacist or distributor in Canada \nand that would be FDA-approved. We are not talking about counterfeit \ndrugs.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on my leader time, I rise to speak in \nopposition to the Dorgan amendment on the importation of foreign drugs. \nBefore the vote, I want to let my colleagues know that I do believe \nthis amendment has the potential for opening doors that would be \ndangerous in this day and time. I say this in spite of us passing by \nvoice vote the Cochran amendment yesterday, which does two things. It \nsays none of the provisions of the underlying Dorgan amendment would \nbecome effective unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services says \nit poses no additional risk to public health and safety and, two, \nresults in significant cost savings for Americans.\n  I supported that amendment. We all did; it was a voice vote. That is \nvery important. It does change the threshold a bit, but I will vote \nagainst the Dorgan amendment because I believe in this era of increased \nbioterrorist threats, we, now more than ever, should not open the door \nand pass new drug importation legislation at all. The reason I say \nthat, very quickly, is the Canadian Government has stated:\n\n       The government of Canada has never stated that it would be \n     responsible for the safety and quality of prescription drugs \n     exported from Canada into the United States, or from any \n     other country.\n\n  If we open this door, Canada has the potential for--first of all, \nthey cannot certify safety but, secondly, become a transshipment port \nfor other countries if we open this door to Canada. There are a number \nof statements that have been made. The other concern I have is on the \ndocumentation requirements. I am afraid, in the Dorgan amendment, they \ncould be forged or circumvented, and there is a lack of verification \nstandards, I believe.\n  Lastly, it is important we understand our underlying bill to which \nthe Dorgan amendment is being applied has as its purpose to make drugs \nmore affordable and lower that burden overall. I am hopeful we will \naccomplish that with the vote at the end of next week--drugs that are \ncertified to be safe, that have gone through the FDA approval. I will \nbe voting against the Dorgan amendment. I encourage my colleagues to do \nlikewise.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 3 additional minutes of my leader \ntime to Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, to respond, we had 2 minutes equally \ndivided and I think it is important, perhaps, to have the time truly \nequally divided. Let me respond by saying, if you think the U.S. \nconsumer ought to pay the highest prices in the world for prescription \ndrugs, then you ought to vote against my amendment. If you believe it \nis unfair that we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription \ndrugs and we ought to have downward pressure on drug prices, vote for \nmy amendment.\n  Don't believe this nonsense about counterfeit drugs and \ntransshipments. It is not the case. Let me describe why. Let me do it \nin just the circumstance of one transaction.\n\n  A pharmacist from Grand Forks, ND, under this new law, would be able \nto go to Winnipeg, Canada, and buy FDA-approved prescription drugs only \nfrom a licensed pharmacist or a licensed distributor in Canada. The \nCongressional Research Service has researched both chains of supply and \nsaid they are almost identical in the United States and Canada.\n  We do not hear questions about drug safety in Canada. Why? Because \nthey have exactly the same system we have from the pharmaceutical \nmanufacturer to the distributor to the pharmacist. The control chain of \nsupply of the same pill put in the same bottle by the same manufacturer \nassures safety in Canada and safety in the United States.\n  A licensed pharmacist in the United States can and should be able to \nacquire a lower priced supply of exactly the same drug in Canada and \npass that savings along to the American consumer. Yes, in fact, it is \nthe market at work.\n  If my colleagues do not believe in the market and they believe our \ncountry ought to pay the highest prices in the world for prescription \ndrugs, then vote against this. Just vote against this. I understand. \nBut if my colleagues believe we ought to put downward pressure on \nprescription drugs and we ought to have a free trade agreement with \nCanada and they believe in markets and free trade, then they should \nsupport this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Dorgan amendment has been amended to \nfurther enhance the safety precautions included in the bill. The \namendment now gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the \nauthority to certify that reimportation would be both safe and would \nsave the hard-earned money of U.S. consumers. The HHS Secretary would \nalso have the authority to terminate the program if for some reason it \nis not working.\n  The fact is, pharmaceutical manufacturers here in the United States \nare reimporting these very same drugs that seniors are forced across \nthe border to obtain. But if it's safe enough for the manufacturers to \ndo, then it should be safe enough for local pharmacies as well.\n  After all, these drugs are manufactured in factories that meet FDA \nstandards. And it shouldn't matter whether these drugs come from New \nJersey, Alberta, or Atlanta. In fact, a Congressional Research Service \nstudy found United States and Canadian drug development, manufacturing, \nand distribution systems have the same high level of integrity.\n  If this amendment is accepted and the bill is enacted, Americans will \nno longer have to drive through an international checkpoint to check \nout their prescription drugs. Instead, they will have the potential to \nsave an estimated $38 billion out of the $100 billion Americans spend \nevery year on their prescription drugs.\n  Consider the savings: A month's supply of Coumadin, a blood-thinning \ndrug, costs $40 here in the United States and just $7 in Canada.\n  The emphysema drugs, upon which some seniors rely to breathe, can \ncost $1,700 for a 6-month supply in the United States and just $800 in \nCanada.\n  Again, let me say that, while the Dorgan amendment provides a step we \ncan take right now to help seniors afford their medication, it is only \na stop-gap--not a solution. For the long-term, there is no substitute \nfor passing a comprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit. We need \nto accomplish this goal so that every senior in America has access to \naffordable prescription drugs.\n  With that, I want to again thank the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan, for his leadership on this issue, and call on the Senate to \naccept this amendment and move forward to pass S. 1 to create a \ncomprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit without delay.\n  Mr. FIRST. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 946, as amended. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), \nthe Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell), the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Hager), the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Lugar), and the Senator from \nOhio (Mr. Voinovich) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 62, nays 28, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 232 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--62\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham (FL)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--28\n\n     Alexander\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Bunning\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n\n                             NOT VOTING--10\n\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Campbell\n     Edwards\n     Hagel\n     Inouye\n     Kerry\n     Leahy\n     Lugar\n     Voinovich\n  The amendment (No. 946), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I rise today to address the matter we are debating in \nthe Senate. I believe this legislation to provide a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit holds tremendous promise and also tremendous \nperil.\n  I applaud the leaders of this effort, Chairman Grassley and ranking \nmember Baucus, for bringing this bill to the floor and working in a \ncollegial, bipartisan manner to present it to the Senate and to the \nAmerican people. It is absolutely essential we finally deliver on the \npromise many have made for years that we will pass a prescription drug \nbenefit and make it available and absolutely secure to our seniors.\n  However, 3 weeks ago this Chamber learned a very important lesson. We \nlearned about the importance of details and how a very small change in \na very large piece of legislation in a conference report can mean 12 \nmillion children would be left out of a child tax credit. Therefore, I \nthink it is imperative we spend the time to ask the hard questions \nabout this legislation and that we exercise caution. So much is at \nstake for the people we represent.\n  For example, right now this bill excludes the lowest income seniors \nwho are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. In my own State, \n219,000 seniors and New Yorkers with disabilities fall into that \ncategory. We leave them at risk of a State's decision to curtail or \nlimit or even eliminate certain Medicaid drug coverage and long-term \ncare coverage.\n  Now we are all in a rush to try to do this to help our seniors, but \nwe do not want to rush through this legislation at the expense of \ngetting it tragically wrong. We have to go over this bill line by line \nand word by word. The details are changing every minute.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says one thing, committee staff say \nanother thing. We do not know how much it is going to cost. We do not \nknow exactly what all of the elements will end up being, particularly \nwhen we look at what the House has passed. Speaking for New York, that \nis totally unacceptable. Then we read today in the newspaper the \nPresident has a very different idea about two central features of this \nSenate proposal.\n  Let's address the real problems and not gloss over them and not rush \nto some judgment because we are going out on recess in a week. My \nconstituents, from the 80-year-old widow in Utica to the 85-year-old \nman living in a nursing home in the Bronx, are counting on me to go \nover this process with care and to cast my vote in a way that will help \nthem, not hurt them.\n  As I have been talking with my colleagues and certainly as I have \nbeen reading the commentary in the press, there is a lot of confusion \nabout this bill. The question is, what exactly does this bill do? How \ndoes it work for our seniors? I bet we would get many different answers \nif I were to ask that on the floor of the Senate.\n  My constituents and people all over America are trusting us to \nexamine this bill carefully and to gauge the consequences. If we do not \ntake the time to do it, how will we know we are doing what is right?\n  I am deeply concerned in this case that old saying about haste making \nwaste could certainly come true. For starters, why is this plan so \ncomplicated? Why would we purposefully create what I call a new \nMedicare maze instead of establishing a solid, straightforward \nfoundation for generations to come? We have to look at how this would \nactually work for the people we say we are trying to help.\n\n  I have tried to map it out. Here is the question: How do you get \nprescription drugs under this plan? I have tried to put myself in the \nposition of a senior, a person with a disability. It quickly became \nclear this will be a very confusing and in some instances a \ndiscouraging process for the vast majority of our seniors.\n  Here is where we should start in looking at how to answer this \nquestion. How do you get your prescription drug benefits under this \nplan? Let's start with the fact that if you are a senior or a person \nwith disabilities, you are out of this process--no Medicare benefit for \nnursing home residents, for seniors. Who needs a Medicare benefit more \nthan people in our nursing homes? They are the ones frailest, most at \nrisk; they need more help in order to keep alive and have some quality \nof life, but they are gone. They are not in this program. If you are in \na nursing home and you are getting support through Medicaid right now, \nyou are not eligible. Instead, they would have to rely on what they do \nnow, which is Medicaid. But they would be in an entirely different \nsystem, totally at the mercy of the individual States.\n  I don't know about other States, but in New York we have certainly \nmade an effort to keep faith with these frailest people, seniors in \nnursing homes, people with chronic and life-threatening and \ndebilitating disabilities, but we are not taking care of them in this \nplan. They drop out of the Medicaid maze before they even get started.\n  This plan is really for a senior who has to choose between \ntraditional fee for service with a private drug plan or Medicare \nAdvantage, the private PPOs.\n  We have created a new Government agency. I don't think a lot of \npeople recognize that. This new Medicare Advantage will be administered \nby a new agency, the Center for what is called Medicare Choices, \ncreated under this bill. So we have ourselves a new bureaucracy. We are \ngoing to be spending money on bureaucrats and administrators, instead \nof on drugs, instead of taking care of our poorest seniors in nursing \nhomes. Even before any benefit is available, this new bureaucracy gets \nbuilt up and drains scarce resources out of what we can spend for our \nseniors.\n  To go back to our seniors here, our seniors have to choose between \nmultiple plans. As you can see, they might have a PPO, with a $45-a-\nmonth premium, or an HMO, with a $32-a-month premium. They may have \nprivate plans that are available to them. They have to make these \nchoices. Certainly I am all for choice, but we know, from what drug \ncompanies themselves have said, there will be many regions of our \ncountry where there will not be a lot of choice. So before seniors make \nthat choice, they will need to register how the prescription drug \nbenefits differ under each of these various proposals and whether the \ndrug they need--this is a very personal consideration--whether the drug \nthey need will be covered under the plan they are analyzing.\n  If a senior looked for the lowest premium--and I can guarantee most \nseniors will look for the lowest premium because most of our seniors \nare hard pressed, on fixed incomes, and they are going to be trying to \nsave their dollars, so they will look for the lowest premium--the \nsenior would choose the HMO at $32 a month.\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\n  But suppose this HMO doesn't cover the senior's doctor, someone the \nsenior has relied on and trusted for years, but that doctor is not in \nthe HMO? So the senior turns to the plan with the next lowest premium. \nOn here, that would be private plan 2, where the premium is $37. But \nsuppose the formulary used in this private plan doesn't cover the drug \nthe senior needs. Let's assume the senior is on a drug for high \ncholesterol, and assuming the senior read the fine print, assuming the \nsenior has informed help--which I think is a leap of faith in many \nparts of our country--the senior may sign up for this plan and not \nreally know it does not cover the drug that has been prescribed for his \nor her condition.\n  So what does the senior do? She is in the plan. She finds out it \ndoesn't provide the drug. She has a grievance procedure she can go to. \nImagine, we have an 80- or 85-year-old widow. She is trying to \nunderstand this. She is in the plan. She gets to keep her doctor, but \nshe doesn't get the drug the doctor wants her to take. The doctor says: \nIn my professional judgment, this is the best drug for you, but I am \nsorry, the plan you are in doesn't include it on the formulary--the \nlist of drugs that are permitted.\n  So what can the senior do? The senior can take a drug off the \nformulary, whether or not the doctor thinks that is the right thing, or \nthe senior can file a grievance and can go through this grievance \nprocess, with a hearing, to try to get the drug that the senior's \ndoctor tells her she should be taking for her high cholesterol.\n  If we do that, we know we have consumed valuable time. We have \ncreated yet another bureaucracy. Not only have we created this new \nGovernment agency to run this program, now we have created a whole \ngrievance process, putting lawyers to work, putting advocates to work, \nto try to figure out how to get the drug the woman wants or get the \ndoctor the senior wants. So we have used up a lot of paper, used up a \nlot of time, and unfortunately taken hard-to-have, scarce resources out \nof doing what we all want them to do; namely, get the drugs paid for \nthat our seniors require.\n\n  Let's suppose we go from year 1--because this doesn't go into effect \nuntil 2006, so we are not quite sure how it is all going to work, but \nsuppose we go from year 1 to year 3. I could not get everything on the \nchart, so we will skip 2007; we will go to 2008. These private plans \nare new. They have not refined all their business models. We know when \nthe State of Nevada tried something similar, drug companies said: Wait \na minute, there is no money in this for me. I don't want to provide \ndrugs to the sickest, oldest people in America. I can't make anything \non that. So they dropped out.\n  I think it is fair to assume that at the end of those first 2 years \nwhen a plan's contract expires, it may decide to drop out, just as \nMedicare HMOs have dropped out. As I am sure all of us have heard from \nour constituents, the number of Medicare+Choice plans has decreased by \nover half in the last 5 years, leaving thousands of seniors in the \nlurch when they pull out of the markets where the seniors live.\n  Those who did not pull out, they stayed but at a huge increase in \nprice. They cut back benefits and raised premiums--15.5 percent last \nyear alone. So all of a sudden, now, we have what used to be a $32 plan \nbeing a $47 plan. This is a monthly premium.\n  Let's say our senior waited it out, finally got the prescription drug \nshe needed through a grievance hearing, but then after 2 years the plan \nshe was in with the drug she needed did not find the market profitable \nand chose to pull out. The Government would have to be sure there was a \nFederal fallback in place, so our senior might then go into the Federal \nfallback. The Federal fallback would guarantee, for a limited period of \ntime, that the senior would get the drug and the doctor of her choice. \nBut this would only be for a limited time, only until this new \nGovernment agency could negotiate with private plans--and they can \npotentially subsidize up to 99.9 percent of their risks--in order to \nget two plans back into the marketplace.\n  Our senior would then have a plan at a higher price, with the \nGovernment basically subsidizing--some might argue, bribing--the \nprivate plan to come back into the marketplace. But by year 4, our \nsenior might again have to change plans for the very same reasons, \nabout coverage, including doctors, including drugs, and as you can \ntell, this is the most streamlined version I could put on one chart of \nwhat it is we are debating.\n  I think it is important to recognize that this new Government agency \nis giving a huge gift in a subsidy to these private plans, but it is \ngiving another very large gift because it is basically saying you come \ninto our plan and we will waive all State insurance regulation.\n  I don't know about you, but people who have dealt with insurance \ncompanies of all kinds sometimes have problems with them, and they go \nto their State insurance commissioner who is close to the problem, and \nthey try to get it worked out and get some support. That will be gone. \nYou will not have the right to go to your State insurance commissioner \nbecause this new Government agency up here will have said: All bets are \noff. We beg you to come into the market. We will pay you to come into \nthe market. And guess what the sweetener is. We are not going to hold \nyou to any of the regulations with which you would otherwise have to \ncomply.\n  Last year, we passed in this body a prescription drug benefit known \nas Graham-Miller. It was simple, had the same premiums, deductibles, \nand copays, and there were no dropoffs. It was over 50 percent more \ngenerous than the bill before us today.\n  I know many of my colleagues prefer this Medicaid maze because they \nare such strong supporters of competition. So am I. Goodness gracious, \ncompetition, the free market, we all know that is one of the pillars of \nAmerican success.\n  But I don't champion competition for the sake of championing it when \nit comes to health care and when it comes to the elderly and the frail \nand people who use the bulk of prescription drugs in our country. I \nchampion it when it actually produces a good result.\n  Competition on a skewed playing field that excludes certain plans \nfrom staying in the market and creates inefficient administrative and \ntransaction costs could actually leave customers less informed, less \nwell off, and spend these scarce health care dollars on creating a new \nbureaucracy whose primary purpose is to somehow subsidize insurance \ncompanies.\n  I think drug plans should not compete for profits by attracting only \nthe healthiest of people and dumping seniors they consider bad risks. \nThey should not compete by cutting corners in quality. They should \ncompete with each other on quality and price. Of course, the way to do \nthat is to set some uniform benefit package to try to have a uniform \npremium so you can compare apples to apples and not apples to oranges \nto kumquats or bananas or whatever else is in the fruit basket. The \nSenate bill has taken some steps to try to rationalize its system. The \nHouse of Representatives' bill lacks even the basic protection for \nseniors. It lacks what we call a Federal fallback; that is, when your \nHMOs or PPOs or drug insurance programs pull out on you and don't give \nyou the drug you need or won't let you see your doctors, then you can \ngo into what is called the Federal fallback. The House doesn't even \nhave that. They somehow magically assume--although we have seen no \nevidence of it and it defies common sense--that there are going to be \nall of these drug companies and all of these insurance plans competing \nto take care of that elderly woman or that elderly man with all of \nthese drug costs.\n  As I mentioned, New York State has 219,000 low-income seniors who \nqualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. They are excluded. I fear they \nare being put at risk because they are going to have to rely on State \nprograms in these times of big budget problems.\n  There are also some other people I worry about when I look at this \nMedicaid maze. For example, retirees who bargain for and obtain health \ncare benefits for their retirement. The Congressional Budget Office \nsays a third of Medicare retirees with drug benefits would lose \ncoverage under this bill. In our State, that is 365,000 people.\n  Then we have another. New York has put into place its own \nprescription drug plan to help people who have incomes up to $50,000. \nIf you go to New\n\n[[Page S8271]]\n\nYork and you have friends or families in New York, you know we have a \nhigher cost of living. In our State, middle-class people with big drug \ncosts pay for those costs. There are 317,000 who are enrolled in the \nState's EPIC prescription drug program, and nearly 900,000 are excluded \nbecause they are in nursing homes or they have disabilities and under \nthe calculations may have their retiree benefits put at risk, or who \nare going to have their State prescription guarantee also put at risk--\none in three Medicare recipients in New York. Never in the history of \nthe Medicare program has a Medicare beneficiary been denied access to a \ncovered benefit. I am just so troubled that we are excluding our lowest \nincome seniors. I don't know how we justify that.\n  I have a letter from our Republican Governor which I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                            State of New York,\n\n                                                    June 12, 2003.\n       Dear New York Congressional Delegation Members: \n     Prescription drug costs continue to strain the budgets of the \n     nation's senior citizens. I applaud your efforts this year to \n     address this important issue. As you begin consideration of \n     legislation to provide prescription drug coverage to all \n     senior citizens, please consider two issues vitally important \n     to New York State.\n       First, New York taxpayers continue to support a significant \n     cost for prescription drug coverage for its dual eligible \n     population. The dual eligibles are elderly and disabled \n     individuals who qualify for both the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs. Medicaid is required to provide medical services \n     not covered by Medicare--including prescription drugs.\n       More than 600,000 New Yorkers are considered dual eligibles \n     and each year New York's Meidcaid program spends nearly $1.5 \n     billion on prescription drugs for the dual eligible \n     population alone. We have always believed that these costs \n     should be borne by the federal government and strongly \n     support efforts to federalize prescription drug costs for the \n     dual eligible population.\n       In addition, New York administers the nation's largest \n     prescription drug program for seniors, EPIC. Today, more than \n     300,000 seniors are enjoying the significant benefits EPIC \n     offers and saving thousands of dollars each on vitally \n     important medicines. Costs for this program exceed $600 \n     million annually in State only dollars. Currently eighteen \n     states have programs similar to New York's to provide \n     prescription drug benefits to senior citizens.\n       Any federal program created this year to provide \n     prescription drug coverage should recognize state efforts and \n     allow seniors to choose their benefit plan (in New York, that \n     choice would be between EPIC and the federal plan) while \n     providing a direct Medicare subsidy to the state program for \n     individuals that choose that option.\n       The Federal government has accepted responsibility of \n     providing health care to senior citizens and I strongly urge \n     an expansion to include prescription drug coverage. I applaud \n     President Bush for his leadership on this issue and our \n     congressional delegation for its commitment to our seniors.\n       Your efforts on this important legislation could \n     dramatically improve the health of a segment of our \n     population that has given so much to New York's and America's \n     safety and prosperity. We urge you to work with us to ensure \n     that our seniors get the prescription drug coverage they \n     deserve, and that the federal government assumes its rightful \n     role in supporting services for our dual-eligible population.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 George E. Pataki,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, Governor Pataki has written to ask that \nin this plan Medicare cover the drug costs of these seniors and New \nYorkers with disabilities. The Governor's record explains the \nimportance of including these people who are called, in the jargon, \n``low-income dual eligibles.''\n  Furthermore, I believe we should eliminate the penalty against \nretirees. By refusing to count retiree benefits as out-of-pocket \nexpenses, this bill assures that 365,000 New Yorkers will never make it \nthrough the coverage gap. We should also try to support States such as \nNew York that are putting their own money into programs to provide for \ncontinuing coverage.\n  The gap in coverage is very disconcerting. I don't even really get to \nthat on this Medicaid maze.\n  I think it is important to recognize there is on average a $275 \ndeductible and at least a $35 monthly premium that could certainly vary \nwidely. As we have seen in these examples, depending upon where you \nlive, and depending upon who is available, there is a 50-percent \nsubsidy until your costs are $4,500. And then you go cold turkey. Some \npeople call that a doughnut hole. That is not my image. There is a \nbrick wall which you run into. Spend your money, and after that you get \nno help--none at all--until you get to what is called the catastrophic \nthreshold of $5,813 in drug costs.\n  Many of us have heard from our constituents. In fact, we are deluged \nin my office with phone calls, e-mails, and other contacts from people \nasking, How is this going to affect me? What does this mean in my life? \nI think that is the real question. How do I get prescription drugs \nunder this plan?\n  I want to talk about this one story, a woman named Arlene Francis. \nShe lives in the Buffalo area. She was married to a Bethlehem Steel \nretiree who passed away. At one time, she had the retiree drug coverage \nthat was part of her husband's contract with Bethlehem Steel. As we \nknow, Bethlehem Steel went into bankruptcy and was bought by another \ncompany. All retirees and spouses of retirees lost their coverage.\n  Arlene takes Fosamax, a drug for osteoarthritis, which costs $68 a \nmonth. She has a hormone replacement patch. She takes antibiotics as \nneeded. She is pretty healthy, when you think about it. That is not a \nlot for someone to be paying for prescription drugs and getting the \ncoverage she needed. But it is a stretch for her because she has a very \nlimited fixed income. Her drug costs total $998 a year. She relies on \nour New York program called EPIC, which covers seniors on a sliding \nscale up to $35,000 for singles, such as Arlene, who is a widow, and \n$50,000 for a couple. Under EPIC, her annual fee is $36 a year. Her \ncopays are $3. Her share of her yearly $998 drug expense totals $336--\nroughly a third of what the cost would be.\n  But what happens under this proposal is very troubling to me. She \nwould pay monthly premiums every month. Let us say we get it at the \nlowest level of $35 a month. That is $420 a year. She would pay a $276 \ndeductible and a 50-percent copay. How much would she pay to get $998 \nin drugs? She would pay $1,157.\n  Arlene and many of my constituents aren't going to get anything from \nthis bill. It is voluntary. You argue they don't have to go into it. \nBut we are changing the incentive and the structure of delivering drug \ncoverage for many people in a State such as ours which already tries to \nhelp people, which I believe will lead to the limitation or \nthe elimination of the program we already have. Under this program, the \nFederal Government isn't lifting the States' costly burden of \nprescription drugs. It even adds some administrative costs on the State \nMedicaid offices that have to do all of these calculations.\n\n  Because a State will not receive reimbursement from the Medicare \nprogram for the benefits it provides up to the Medicare level, it very \nwell could make a rational decision that it is just not going to \ncontinue doing that, and either cut back or end the program, which will \nbe very bad news for the 360,000 seniors in our State, like Arlene, who \nrely on this very cost-effective way of getting their drugs covered.\n  When we have the Congressional Budget Office stating that seniors \nwith prescription drug costs of $1,115 or less would end up paying more \nthrough premiums, deductibles, and cost sharing, they are not getting \nanything from this bill.\n  On the other end of the income and expenditure level, the bill falls \nshort for patients with high drug costs as well. Even seniors who spend \n$5,000 will get only $1,700 in benefits. They have to manage 66 percent \nof the costs on their own.\n  I think we could do more to eliminate the gaps in coverage and to \ntear down the brick wall that stops people from getting help while they \nstill pay for it until they reach the catastrophic level.\n  I will be introducing a series of amendments. But I think it is \nimportant to recognize the fundamental issues I am raising today about \nthe Medicare maze are going to require all of us to work on it.\n  I am very pleased that one of the most important ways we can assure \nthat competition is helpful instead of harmful is to ensure the plans \nactually do compete on quality.\n  So I appreciate that the bill includes a measure I have supported, \nalong with Senator Hatch and others, to commission the Institute of \nMedicine to develop ways to think about paying for\n\n[[Page S8272]]\n\nquality outcomes. I have also filed an amendment to encourage the \ndevelopment of quality standards so that our seniors have some basis of \ncomparison to choose among different plans.\n  I believe it is important to provide information about the efficacy \nof drugs and their cost-effectiveness so that seniors and others can \nsee for themselves whether we are getting our money's worth for this \n$400 billion investment. I would like that information on the Internet. \nI would like it made available through the long-term ombudsmen, the \nMedicare and Medicaid representatives in every State.\n  I started by saying I think this legislation does hold tremendous \npromise. But I have tried to outline some--not all but some--of the \nquestions I am having to answer from my constituents who come to me \nwith very specific issues, who ask me how this will affect their lives, \nwhether this will make them better off or worse off financially.\n  I believe it is important for us to be able to really scrub this, \nunderstand what it does and what it does not do, and also recognize \nthat on the other end of this Capitol the House has a very different \napproach. I applaud the work Senators Grassley and Baucus have done. \nBut let's not forget, this body tried to protect lower income working \nfamilies by giving them the child tax credit--people who pay a higher \nproportion of their income in taxes than I do, but who were told, at \nthe other end of this building, that because they may not pay income \ntax, they should not get help for their children.\n  I have to ask, if that is the attitude on the other end of this \nbuilding, if they have already passed a bill that is not going to help \nmany seniors but provides even more of a giveaway to drug companies to \ntry to get them to offer these plans, how can we trust, at the end of \nthe day, that the more thoughtful debate and version we are working on \nhere in the Senate will be what comes out of this process?\n  I was very disappointed when it was reported in the papers today that \nthe President has weighed in on the side of giving subsidies, \nincreasing benefits to insurance companies--not in the Senate version, \nbut in the House version--and that the President does not want a \nFederal fallback. This is a huge difference in philosophy, in ideology, \nand, I believe, in life experience.\n  Medicare has worked. Since 1965, it has removed not only so much of \nthe concern and worry and anxiety about growing older, of facing acute \nand chronic health care problems, it has removed a lot of burden from \nthe American family.\n  My mother just recently turned 84, and I feel very fortunate that I \nam in a position to be able to help her. But I know, very well, that a \nlot of other families trying to save for tuition, for college for their \nkids, trying to make ends meet, when it comes to mortgages and car \npayments, they may not be in that position. Therefore, they look to \nMedicare to really help spread the burden of taking care of our elderly \nfrom one generation to the next. It is part of our social contract in \nAmerica. We have a basic bargain: If you work hard, if you are \nresponsible, we are going to help, through our Government, to make sure \nyou do not fall into poverty, that you are not left without health \ncare. We are going to do that because that is the kind of people we \nare. Those are the values we have. This could be a giant step back from \nthat commitment.\n\n  Let's not also forget that this $400 billion, which we are trying to \nset aside, comes at a time when we are looking at deficits and \nincreasing debt, which will impose even more burdens in the future on \nmiddle-class Americans and their families. So I hope we are able to \nanswer the questions and, most fundamentally, explain clearly and \nunequivocally how someone gets their prescription drug benefits.\n  I do not know that I could take this chart to a senior center, to a \nnursing home, and explain this. I do not understand why it has to be so \ncomplicated, why we have to create a new Government agency, why we have \nto waive insurance regulations, why we have to cause this level of \nconfusion and uncertainty among people who should have the peace of \nmind in their later years that they do not have to worry about filing \ngrievances, fighting for their drugs and their doctors. Why are we \ndoing this? Why are we creating these obstacles, this Rube Goldberg \nsystem that is going to be extremely hard to explain and very hard to \nunderstand?\n  Finally, I do not understand, either, why we are waiting until 2006. \nMedicare went into effect within a year--a totally new system, with no \nnew agency to administer it. We were able to do it in a year. President \nJohnson went to Independence, MO, and signed that bill with former \nPresident Harry Truman, who had been one of the first of our leaders to \nsay: We need to take care of our seniors.\n  That bill was signed, it has worked well, and it has a very low \nadministrative cost. Two to three cents out of your tax dollars, your \ncontributions that go into Medicare, go into administration, go into \nany kind of costs that can be compared to the high percentage that \nthese private insurance companies spend. Some of them spend 30 to 40 \ncents out of your dollar, not on taking care of you but on taking care \nof themselves.\n  So at the end of the day, Medicare has worked. I am very proud of our \ncountry for making that commitment. Yet I worry that what we are about \nto do is not only difficult to understand, difficult to administer, and \nconfusing but may very well be the beginning of undoing traditional \nMedicare.\n  The report of the President's letter today certainly gives me pause \nthat we would not even have a Federal fallback. Our people who live in \nrural States, live in poor urban areas--who are not the most attractive \nclients for insurance companies because--guess what--they get sicker, \nthey are poorer--where will they get their care if our Government does \nnot have that fallback to provide the safety net?\n  And what do we do as States are making these budget cuts to take care \nof the hundreds of thousands of our poor residents in nursing homes, \nour people with disabilities, who depend upon this program?\n  We cannot forget about the larger issue at hand. Our fundamental \nresponsibility and our goal must be, as a nation, to help our seniors \nby providing a prescription drug benefit that is reliable and \ncomprehensive. And if we are to go down the route of introducing \ncompetition, then let's make sure it is competition on cost and \nquality, not competition to eliminate more and more of the sickest of \nour elderly or the people with disabilities whom we are trying so hard \nto take care of.\n  Our goal is not just choice or competition, it is compassion; it is \ncoverage for those who need it. We have a rare bipartisan opportunity \nto do this. Let's get it right in the Senate, and then let's fight with \nall of our energy to make sure it is not changed in a conference \ncommittee with the House, so that we can, in good conscience, tell our \nseniors we have done the best we can to make sure they get the benefit \nwe promised.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, certainly we are dealing with an issue and \na proposal where there are huge differences. And there have been huge \ndifferences for some time. The Senator from New York represents quite a \ndifferent point of view from several years past.\n  What we are trying to do is to provide better service, provide some \noptions, provide some modernization of a program that is 40 years old, \nthat has never been changed. So the question really is, How do we best \nserve all of the people who are in need of service? The question is \nnot, How do we maintain and grow a Federal program, and keep it all \nFederal? That is not really what most of us have in mind.\n  We want to look at some alternatives. We want to look for choice, \nwhere people who wish to stay in the program as it now exists may do \nthat. And that is what this bill provides. But it also provides an \nopportunity to move to something that could be different, have some \nchoices, could even in fact be more efficient, more effective. I am \nafraid it is hard for me to accept the idea that Government programs \nare more efficient than the private sector. I don't think there is much \nevidence of that. Certainly what we are talking about here is having \nsome opportunities for a change, some opportunities for some \nalternatives. I understand\n\n[[Page S8273]]\n\nthere will be those who will be resisting those changes, but \nnevertheless we do have a bipartisan bill before us that incorporates \nthat opportunity. We want to do it.\n  We are concerned, of course, about having services that reach out to \neveryone in rural areas. I think I am about as concerned about rural \nareas as anyone in this body. I come from one of the most rural States. \nI have to tell you how pleased I am that we have in this bill a \nsubstantial program for rural health care, one, by the way, that was \nturned down by many of the folks who are now worried about the rural \nareas in the tax bill. But it is here, and it will respond to the needs \nof rural constituents and rural beneficiaries. And that, of course, is \nof vital importance to all of us.\n  With respect to dual eligibles, the Senator, the speaker just \nrecently, has raised a concern about how S. 1 treats seniors who are \neligible for both Medicare and Medicaid programs. Those are known as \ndual eligibles. Under S. 1, these seniors will continue to receive \ntheir prescription drug benefit through the Medicaid program.\n  It is alleged that by having dual eligibles remain in the Medicaid \nprogram, Congress is treating them as second-class citizens and \nsubjecting them to lower quality benefits. I don't believe this to be \nthe case, nor is there evidence that it is the case. We worked \ndiligently on the development of this package and reflected these \nconcerns that were raised all the time during last year's debate. \nLearning from these lessons, we decided it was most beneficial to \nseniors to continue to build off existing Medicare and Medicaid low-\nincome assistance programs as far as to offer a seamless benefit.\n  We do not want to divert scarce resources available for this benefit \ntoward the development of a new government bureaucracy. I am confident \nS. 1 establishes this new benefit in a manner that will provide high \nquality, accessible care through a system that is familiar to seniors \nand easy to navigate.\n  It is also important to note that the Medicaid program is considered \nby most advocates and beneficiaries to be quite generous and far \nsuperior to the current Medicare program. Recognizing that this is a \nprogram for persons with low income, the Federal Government only allows \nStates to charge nominal copayments to receive the drug benefit. \nFurther dual eligibles have been and should continue to remain the \njoint responsibility of State and Federal Governments. However, in \nrecognizing that the Federal Government should play a dominant role in \ndelivering this vitally important benefit, we provide in this bill $14 \nbillion in additional Federal dollars to help pay for increased costs \nassociated with the new prescription drug standards included in the \nbill.\n  This is because the bill provides minimum standards to ensure that \nbenefits provided through Medicaid are the same high quality as those \nprovided through Part B of the Medicare program. For these reasons I am \nconfident and I think our committee was confident that dual eligibles \nwill continue to have access to prescription drugs that they deserve.\n\n  Some argue we should do more, perhaps even serve this population \ndifferently, but this bill was developed in a manner that we believe \nutilizes scarce dollars efficiently and helps to deliver care that is \nconsistent with the current law and easy for seniors to navigate.\n  This is a discussion that has already been held to a great extent, \nhow you deal with low income and to do it in a way that is consistent \nwith what we have had in the past and was equal in benefits to what we \nhave had in the past. That is the process that is designed here.\n  So as we move on, I hope we can continue to provide the things that \nare really the purpose of this whole bill. And there are two at least. \nOne is to provide, of course, drugs, pharmaceuticals to seniors and do \nit in several different ways so that it meets the needs of those \nseniors somewhat dependent on income. The other is to provide some \nopportunities to improve the distribution system for Medicare, again, a \nprogram that has been in place for 40 years, has had relatively little, \nif any, change. And now we have an opportunity to give some choices to \nthe beneficiaries and develop programs that are more efficient than \nwhat we have had in the past.\n  So it is kind of discouraging to have people stand and want not to \nchange whatever we have had going on for 40 years. We are not talking \nabout changing the benefits. We are not talking about the quality. We \nare talking about making a distribution system that meets the needs of \nthe changes that have taken place in our society and be able to do that \nin a way that people would like to and will want to have choices.\n  So as we talk about these various amendments that will be raised, I \nhope we will continue to take a look at what it is we have as a goal \nhere, to be able to do these things that have been described and focus \non getting the kind of results we really have in mind when we put \ntogether this proposal and continue to have bipartisan support for the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will take a moment to review the \nschedule under the previous order. Under the previous order, the \nfollowing Senators are to be recognized to offer the following \namendments:\n  Senator Grassley on rural provisions; Senator Harkin on mammography; \nSenator Conrad on fallbacks; Senator Kerry on a grant program; Senator \nClinton on a study; and Senator Graham has one with respect to \npremiums.\n  Republican Senators could offer amendments in an alternating fashion \nbetween Democratic amendments. A number of these Senators have chosen \nto offer amendments at a later time.\n  Thus, I ask unanimous consent that this order remain the order under \nwhich Senators would be recognized to offer amendments, except that the \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Graham, now be recognized to offer his \namendment, and immediately following Senator Graham, the Democratic \nleader be recognized for whatever amount of time he wishes to speak, \nand that the pending amendments be temporarily laid aside so the \nSenator from Florida may offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I agree with what the Senator just said. I \nask unanimous consent that the order of amendments provide that when a \nRepublican amendment is offered, it be considered in an alternating \nfashion with the Democrat amendments; provided further, that it be in \norder for the amendment to be offered in any Republican slot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 956\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I am here this morning to offer \nan amendment to the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of \n2003. This amendment has as its goal to repeal the ``sick tax,'' which \nis part of the pending legislation.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have many concerns with this \nlegislation. Probably at its core is the fact that we are about to \nadopt a prescription drug benefit for 39 million older and disabled \nAmericans, of which there is no current model. Virtually every question \nabout this legislation has to be answered at a theoretical level \nbecause we cannot say the Federal health insurance plan that covers \nFederal employees, or a Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan, or any other plan \nhas provisions to dispense prescription drugs through a prescription \ndrug-only insurance policy.\n  In my judgment, that is a very fundamental concern that we should \nshare. Understand that we are about to conduct a gigantic social \nexperiment on 39 million Americans, many of whom are the sickest, most \nfrail, most vulnerable of our citizens.\n  I am here today to talk about a specific troubling aspect of this \nlegislation, and that is what has been referred to as the ``sick tax.'' \nWhat do we mean by that? This bill includes what has come to be known \nas either the donut hole or the benefit shutdown.\n  I think it is more like a black hole. Here is how that hole would \ndevelop. Seniors who sign up for this new benefit will face a gap in \nthose benefits. Once a senior has reached $4,500 in drug spending, the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit evaporates, the senior falls into \nthe black hole and gets no help with his or her prescriptions for the \nnext $1,312.50.\n  I know of no insurance plan that has such a gap in coverage. The \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan, which has often been touted as \nthe model we should use for Medicare, does not have such a gap in its \nbenefit structure. If it is not bad enough that Medicare beneficiaries \nwill get no help from Medicare during this gap, any contributions from \nthe senior's former employer would not count to closing that gap. In \nmany instances, individuals were members of unions and they negotiated \na collective bargaining agreement under which they understood they were \ngoing to reduce their current income in order to get other benefits \nthat would be paid at the point of their retirement.\n  Frequently, one of those benefits was some assistance in the payment \nof their prescription drugs. So they have already paid once for that \nbenefit by not getting that raise that they had anticipated or not \ngetting as much of a raise as they anticipated, and now they are going \nto be penalized a second time by not allowing those employer payments \nthat contribute to covering the cost of prescription drugs to count \ntoward narrowing the hole; that is, if a senior has a retiree \nprescription benefit, that benefit cannot be used to reach the \ncatastrophic limit.\n  The final insult is that during this gap--when the senior is paying \n100 percent of the cost--every penny of prescription drugs purchased \nduring this period in the black hole will be paid by the senior \nbeneficiary. But the senior will still have to keep paying the monthly \npremium.\n  This legislation suggests that is going to be $35 a month. Most \npeople believe that number is likely to be exceeded in 2006. It \ncertainly will be exceeded as medical and particularly prescription \ndrug inflation takes hold in future years. The senior will have to \ncontinue to write that check every month, although they get absolutely \nno benefit.\n  Let me be perfectly clear. During months in which seniors are not \ngetting any assistance whatsoever, they will continue to pay the \nmonthly premium. Collecting monthly premiums, while a senior has fallen \ninto this black hole, is the equivalent of levying a tax on the sick. \nThey are asked to pay into the program without receiving any benefit.\n  The average Medicare beneficiary today spends a little over $2,000 a \nyear on prescription drugs. We are talking about people who have \nalready spent well over twice that to get to the $4,500 level. So we \nare talking about seniors who have significantly poorer health and, \ntherefore, higher prescription drug costs, and that is a group of \nseniors we are going to discontinue from benefits until they have paid \nout of their pocket another $1,300-plus of prescription drug costs.\n  Why would there be this gap in prescription drug coverage? Why do we \ndo what no other insurance policy in America does today? Surely, none \nof\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n\nmy colleagues can believe this gap is a good insurance policy or good \nmedicine for seniors. So let's call this gap what it is: a gimmick that \nis designed to lower the cost of this legislation at the expense of \nseniors who are most in need of the drugs.\n  What does the gap in coverage mean for a senior? I would like to take \na few minutes to spell it out so that we will know exactly what we are \nvoting for if we approve this legislation.\n  The gap with the black hole begins at $4,500 in total drug spending. \nBeneficiaries have to reach a point where their total spending--the \nspending of the beneficiary, the Federal Government, and any other \nsource--reaches a level of $4,500, over twice the average Medicare \nbeneficiary's annual prescription drug cost.\n  Once you reach that point, you receive no assistance for your \nprescription drugs until you have spent out of your own pocket--not \ncounting any contribution made by your former employer--until you have \nspent $3,700.\n  How does the math work? To get to the $4,500 level, the out-of-pocket \nexpenditures by the beneficiary will be, first, a $275 deductible. You \nhave to pay that before you get any assistance. Incidentally, you are \nalso paying the monthly premium during the time you are meeting that \ndeductible requirement. Then between $275 and $4,500, you pay half, the \nFederal Government pays half. You would pay $2,112.50, and the Federal \nGovernment would pay $2,112.50. By the time the combined expenditures \nreached $4,500, you would have paid $2,387.50 out of your pocket. That \nis the deductible plus your coshare of prescriptions purchased. At this \npoint, you would fall into the gap. You would receive no assistance.\n  In order to get out of this black hole, you have to have total \nexpenditures out of your pocket of an additional $1,312.50 beyond the \n$2,387.50 you have already paid. So you will have to pay a total of \n$3,700 before you can escape. While you are in the black hole, you are \ncontinuing every month to pay the premium for a policy for which you \nare getting no benefit.\n  The sponsors of this legislation say the monthly premium is $35. \nHowever, look through the hundreds of pages of this legislation and you \nwill not find a $35 number. It is going to be up to the private drug-\nonly insurers to actually decide whether the premium will be $35. It \ncould certainly be higher.\n\n  Again, we have no example of this type of prescription-drug-only \ninsurance we can point to and say: Here is how we as Federal employees \nhave been treated, or here is how a group of public or private \nemployees under another standard plan have been treated. The reason is \nthat there is no example of what we are about to impose on America's \nolder citizens.\n  All of this talk of math and gaps may sound theoretical, but the gap \nwill affect the lives of real human beings. Let me give one real \nexample.\n  There are nearly 3 million Medicare beneficiaries in my State of \nFlorida. One of those is an 89-year-old woman by the name of Virginia. \nVirginia, a widow of 11 years, is nearly blind. She lives in an \nassisted living facility. Her income is significantly below the median \nincome. Her monthly income is $1,535, or $18,420 on an annual basis.\n  Virginia recently moved in with a roommate because she could no \nlonger afford her own apartment. She could not afford last Christmas to \nbuy her grandchildren presents. During her working years, Virginia was \nan editor and columnist for a smalltown newspaper. She was also a poet.\n  Virginia is one of the many Medicare beneficiaries in dire need of a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. She suffers from high blood \npressure, stomach irritation, pains in her joints, anxiety disorder, \nosteoporosis, hypothyroidism, trouble sleeping, and difficulty with her \nvision.\n  This chart lists her conditions. These are the medications that have \nbeen prescribed. This is the cost per month based on today's cost \ninflated by 3.6 percent per year to reach an estimated cost in the year \n2006 when this plan will commence.\n  She is spending $489.22 a month, or $5,870.64 a year, to get the \ndrugs she needs. Each day, she needs three medicines for her blood \npressure and seven others to treat her other conditions. These \nmedicines are necessary to reduce her pain and to prevent further \nhealth complications.\n  I would like to be able to tell Virginia the Senate is considering a \nbill that will give her a comprehensive, affordable Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. But I cannot do that. No Member of this \nSenate can tell its citizens, such as Virginia, that we are providing \nthem with a comprehensive, affordable Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. Why? Because if this bill is approved, I will have to tell \nVirginia that after she has spent $275 before she gets any help to meet \nthe deductible, then beginning on January 18, when her deductible has \nbeen met, until October 7, 2006, Virginia would expect to pay 50 \npercent of the cost of each prescription.\n  This chart shows the $35 estimated monthly premium and the out-of-\npocket costs Virginia would have to pay. After spending $275, she will \nspend another $2,112.50 for her 10 medications. Those are the blue bars \non this graph. Then what happens? If this bill is approved, I would \nhave to tell Virginia that after October 7, while the $35 premium \ncontinues at the same level, she would receive no benefit. All of these \nblack bars are what Virginia would have to pay, 100 percent out of her \npocket. She still needs all the medications on October 8 and 9, \nthroughout the rest of the year. Her needs have not diminished.\n  On October 7, she falls into the black hole. She would stay there \nuntil December 27. I am guessing she will not be sending any Christmas \npresents to her grandchildren in 2006, either.\n  To make matters worse, I would have to tell Virginia that in addition \nto paying 100 percent of the cost of her prescriptions, she would still \nhave to pay the $35 every month and get nothing in return. How do I \nexplain to this senior in my State that she would be getting no help \nfrom the drug benefit but would still be paying the premium? She would \nget no help for nearly 3 months but would pay the premium anyway.\n  Between the premiums, which are getting her nothing, and the full \ncost of her medicines, Virginia would have to spend 34 percent of her \nincome to get the medications that she needs. Let me repeat that. \nBetween the $35 a month premiums and the full cost of medicines that \nshe would have to pay while she is in the black hole, Virginia would be \nspending 34 percent of her annual income on prescription drugs.\n  I do not think Virginia will believe this is a very adequate \nprescription drug benefit. It is neither comprehensive nor affordable.\n  At an absolute minimum, Virginia should not be asked to pay a monthly \npremium during the time that she is getting no benefit.\n  This gap is bad medicine. The gap is a gimmick that lowers the cost \nof the plan but at the expense of our seniors. One of the many pieces \nof information we need from the Congressional Budget Office in order to \nmake an informed judgment on this bill is the number of Medicare \nbeneficiaries who would fall into this gap. However, like so many other \naspects of this legislation, we not only do not have any practical \nexperience, we do not have the theoretical estimates of the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  According to the administrator of the Medicare Program, CMS, 12 \npercent of the almost 40 million beneficiaries would fall into this \nblack hole. I believe that number reflects the number of beneficiaries \nwho would fall into the gap today, in June of 2003. By the time we get \nto 2006, however, when the bill would actually become effective, data \nfrom the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that more than 20 percent of \nthe beneficiaries would fall into this gap.\n  This debate would certainly be informed by more information from the \nCongressional Budget Office, but in the absence of CBO numbers I will \nuse the CMS and Kaiser numbers. If CMS is correct, nearly 5 million \nMedicare beneficiaries would fall into the benefit gap if the benefits \nwere available today. If the Kaiser projections for 2006 are correct, \nnearly 8 million Medicare beneficiaries would fall into the black hole \nin the first year of this program. Eight million seniors and people \nwith disabilities would be forced to pay a premium when they are \ngetting absolutely no benefit in return.\n  I do not believe we should tax those 8 million Medicare beneficiaries \nwhose prescription drugs are high enough to place them in this black \nhole.\n\n[[Page S8276]]\n\n  In my own State of Florida, it is estimated that there will be \n600,000 Medicare beneficiaries who would fall into this black hole. I \ndo not want to go home and tell 600,000 of my constituents that instead \nof getting a comprehensive, affordable Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, they are going to get a meager benefit run by private \ninsurance, and to top it off they will have to pay the ``sick tax'' \nimposed upon them when they need the benefit the most.\n\n  One goal of a Medicare prescription drug benefit, which I believe is \ncommonly shared, is that seniors will find it in their best interest to \nvoluntarily enroll in this new program. Last week, we debated a \nprovision that would have given greater choice to seniors. They could \nhave elected either to stay in the plan that is now being imposed, \nalbeit a plan that has no history of a drug-only insurance policy, or \nthey could make an election to stay with standard Medicare fee for \nservice. That proposal was rejected. In my judgment, that is going to \nsuppress voluntary participation in this prescription drug program.\n  Surely, the success of any program depends on a high participation \nrate. The ``sick tax'' would be an even further discouragement and \ncould doom the program to failure. We know seniors will reject a plan \nthat does not provide them the benefits they need. We have already seen \nthat with the passage and then the quick rejection of catastrophic \nMedicare benefits in the late 1980s.\n  People like Virginia will not enroll in a program that requires them \nto make a monthly payment while they get nothing in return.\n  This amendment to suspend the payment of premiums once a \nbeneficiary's drug utilization is within the gap in coverage would \neliminate the unfair provision under which beneficiaries with high drug \ncosts would continue to pay premiums while receiving no benefit.\n  In summary, the amendment that is before us would say if a \nbeneficiary is in the black hole, if they are not receiving any \nbenefits, they would not have to pay the monthly premium.\n  I bring to the attention of my colleagues that there has been some \ndefense given of this legislation which says we cannot vote for any \namendment which would change the basic structure of the bill; that \nwould change, in my judgment, the unwise reliance on an unproven, drug-\nonly insurance benefit. I want to emphasize, this does not change the \nstructure. Rather, this removes a clear inequity but maintains the \nfundamentally flawed structure of this legislation. Yes, it has a cost. \nAgain, we do not know what the cost is from CBO, but I am going to \nsuggest an offset which will be more than adequate to pay the cost.\n  There are some who say we cannot afford any amendments which would \nincrease the benefits of this program. That reminds me of the old story \nabout the child who shot his mother and his father and then threw \nhimself at the mercy of the court because he was an orphan. The fact \nis, we shot a legitimate prescription drug benefit for Medicare by \npassing a reckless tax cut that has absorbed the resources that would \nhave enabled us to provide a legitimate benefit.\n  The offset that I am offering is an amendment which would secure the \nsavings attributable to a clarification of the Medicare secondary \npayment provisions. For most of the history of Medicare, the assumption \nhas been that if a person had double coverage, the primary payer would \nbe that payer other than Medicare, and Medicare would wrap around that \nprimary payer. A recent court opinion has reversed that assumption.\n  There is a provision, which is included in Chairman Tauzin's House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee mark, supported by the Justice \nDepartment, that would clarify the circumstances in which Medicare is \nthe secondary payer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated \nJanuary 17 from the Assistant Attorney General, William E. Moschella, \noutlining the Department of Justice support for this offset.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legislative \n           Affairs, Office of the Assistant Attorney General,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 2003.\n     Hon. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to advise you of the \n     Department's support for a provision in the Medicare \n     Prescription Drug and Modernization Act, set forth in Title \n     III, Section 301, which would protect the integrity of the \n     Medicare Trust Fund by clarifying that Medicare must be \n     reimbursed whenever another insurer's responsibility to pay \n     has been established. The Section is consistent with the \n     litigation positions taken by this Department and the \n     Department of Health and Human Services (``HHS'') in numerous \n     court cases.\n       Congress enacted the Medicare Secondary Payer (``MSP'') \n     statute in 1980 to protect the fiscal integrity of the \n     Medicare program by making Medicare a secondary, rather than \n     a primary, payer of health benefits. To ensure that Medicare \n     would be secondary, Congress precluded it from making payment \n     when a primary plan has already made payment or can \n     reasonably be expected to pay promptly. Congress recognized, \n     however, that in contested cases, payments under such plans \n     would be delayed. To protect, providers, suppliers, and \n     beneficiaries, Congress authorized Medicare to make a \n     ``conditional'' payment when prompt resolution of a claim \n     cannot reasonably be expected. The Medicare Trust Fund must \n     be reimbursed, however, once the primary insurer's obligation \n     to pay is demonstrated.\n       Some recent court decisions have held, however, that \n     Medicare has no right to reimbursement unless the primary \n     insurer could reasonably have been expected to make prompt \n     payment at the outset. See e.g., Thompson v. Goetzmann 315 \n     F.3d 457 (5th Cir. 2002). These rulings make the statute's \n     reimbursement mechanism inoperative in some jurisdictions. \n     Section 301 of this legislation would end this costly \n     litigation and provide clear legislative guidance regarding \n     Medicare's status as a secondary payer of health benefits. \n     The technical changes in Section 301 make clear that Medicare \n     may make a conditional payment when the primary plan has not \n     made or is not reasonably expected to make prompt payment.\n       The technical amendments of Section 301 clarify other \n     provisions of the MSP statute, as well. They make clear that \n     a primary plan may not extinguish its obligations under the \n     MSP statute by paying the wrong party (i.e., by paying the \n     Medicare beneficiary or the provider instead of reimbursing \n     the Medicare Trust fund. The Section clarifies that a primary \n     plan's responsibility to make payment with respect to the \n     same item or service paid for by Medicare may be \n     demonstrated, among other ways, by a judgment, or a payment \n     conditioned upon the recipient's compromise, waiver or \n     release of items or services included in the claim against \n     the primary plan or its insurer; no finding or admission of \n     liability is required. In addition, section 301 makes clear \n     that an entity will be deemed to have a ``self-insured plan'' \n     if it carries its own risk, in whole or in part. Finally, the \n     Section makes clear that the Medicare program may seek \n     reimbursement from a primary plan, from any or all of the \n     entities responsible for or required to make payment under a \n     primary plan, and additionally from any entity that has \n     received payment from the proceeds of a primary plan's \n     payment. These provisions of Section 301 will resolve \n     contentious litigation and are designed to protect the fiscal \n     integrity of the Medicare program.\n       We hope that this information is helpful. The Office of \n     Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection \n     to this report from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program. Please let us know if we may be of additional \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William E. Moschella,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. This amendment is endorsed by the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. I ask unanimous \nconsent that their letter of endorsement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 2003.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the millions of members and \n     supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare (NCPSSM), I am writing in support of \n     Senator Graham's ``No Premium in the Gap'' amendment to ``The \n     Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003.''\n       We understand that the amendment would suspend the payment \n     of premiums once a beneficiary's drug utilization is within \n     the gap in coverage. Charging seniors a monthly premium \n     without offering any benefit in return is the equivalent of \n     levying a tax on the sick.\n       The amendment would improve the ``The Prescription Drug and \n     Medicare Improvement Act of 2003'' by eliminating the unfair \n     provision under which beneficiaries with high drug costs \n     would continue to pay premiums while receiving no benefit.\n       We applaud your efforts and dedication on behalf of \n     America's seniors, and appreciate\n\n[[Page S8277]]\n\n     your continued leadership on these issues. Please support \n     Senator Graham's ``No Premium in the Gap'' amendment and we \n     look forward to continuing to work with you.\n           Cordially,\n                                              Barbara B. Kennelly,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I urge my colleagues to join me in amending \nthis legislation and repeal the ``sick tax.''\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will comment on the amendment, the no \npremium on the donut amendment.\n  First, let me say that I wish we did not have a gap in coverage. \nUnfortunately, eliminating the gap in coverage could add as much as \n$200 billion to the cost of this proposal. As we all know, we are \nworking within a budget of $400 billion and this bill targets those \nfunds to those who need it most.\n  Most seniors, however, will not be affected by the gap in coverage at \nall. This is because their drug spending will not reach limit, or \nbecause they qualify for the additional assistance in the low-income \nbenefit, or because they have additional coverage from a retiree health \nplan, or coverage they have purchased themselves.\n  Most seniors will not have drug spending in a year that exceeds the \nbenefit limit. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 80 percent \nof seniors will not even have prescription drug spending that exceeds \nthe $4,500 benefit limit.\n  That means that right off the bat only one senior in five would even \nhave drug spending high enough to be affected by the gap in coverage at \nall.\n  Now, the drug benefit package for lower income seniors does not have \na gap in coverage. In drafting this bill we have targeted resources to \nthose who need it most. We made it a priority not to have any gap in \ncoverage for lower income seniors.\n  This means that beneficiaries with incomes below about $15,000 and \ncouples with incomes below about $20,000 in 2006 will have no gap in \ncoverage. That is 41 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who are \ncompletely unaffected by the benefit limit.\n  In addition, beneficiaries who have coverage from a retiree health \nplan will not be affected by the benefit limit when the plan provides \nthat additional coverage. Today, about 32 percent of beneficiaries have \nretiree coverage and this bill provides generous Federal assistance to \nretiree-sponsored plans so that they can continue to offer coverage to \ntheir former workers.\n  Other seniors will be able to purchase additional prescription drug \ncoverage from their prescription drug plan or through their \nMedicareAdvantage plan. This additional drug coverage will be \nseamlessly integrated into their drug benefit package and will ensure \nthat seniors who want additional coverage will be able to get it.\n  As a result of the elimination of the gap for 44 percent of seniors \nwho have lower incomes and the fact that many seniors have additional \ncoverage, we estimate that only about 2 to 12 percent of seniors will \never be affected by the gap in coverage.\n  Now every single beneficiary who enrolls in the drug benefit will \nhave comprehensive coverage including coverage against catastrophic \ndrug costs. That coverage is present even for those 2 to 12 percent who \nare in the gap in coverage. These seniors are always protected against \nhigher drug costs.\n  Any enrollee will have 90 percent of their prescription drug costs \ncovered if they have $3,700 in out of pocket spending on prescription \ndrugs in a year.\n  Now Senator Graham calls the benefit limit a sick tax because he \nbelieves that seniors should not pay a premium for the coverage for \ncatastrophic costs if they hit the benefit limit. This is like saying \nthat you should not pay for fire insurance if your house isn't on fire.\n  But of course that is not how insurance works. People purchase \ninsurance to protect them against unfortunate events like a house fire, \nan accident, or some other tragedy.\n  To get the coverage in your insurance policy, you pay an insurance \npremium. If you do not pay the premium, then your insurance policy is \nnot going to give you the coverage.\n  That is the same idea here with coverage for prescription drugs. Any \nsenior who wishes to enroll in the voluntary benefit will pay a monthly \npremium for that coverage. The coverage is voluntary and the premium is \nan affordable $35 per month. And 44 percent of beneficiaries with lower \nincomes will have very low or no premium at all for the coverage \noffered in this bill.\n  Finally, if we were to close the gap in coverage for seniors at \nhigher income levels it could cost over $200 billion, which would \nrequire us to take benefits away from the seniors with the lowest \nincomes. Personally, I cannot justify that action.\n  Of course, today's seniors receive no assistance from Medicare for \noutpatient prescription drugs, and this bill changes that by adding a \nnew comprehensive prescription drug benefit to the program. The average \nsenior will save at least 53 percent, about $1,700, off their \nprescription drug costs after paying an affordable monthly premium of \n$35. And lower income seniors will have 80 to 90 percent of their drug \ncosts covered.\n  We have worked hard to minimize the gap in coverage within the \nresources available for the proposal. We have done that. Most seniors \nwill not have spending that hits the benefit limit, and for those who \ndo, many of those will have coverage above the limit through the low-\nincome benefit package, from retiree plans or from additional coverage \nprovided by their plan.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Graham amendment.\n  I urge we not consider the Graham amendment, that, in fact, this has \nbeen covered and is covered in the bill as it now exists and is \ndesigned to help those beneficiaries with the lower incomes.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to alert my colleagues this \nmorning to an important new study that has just been published by the \nInstitute of Medicine entitled ``Hidden Costs, Value Lost: Uninsurance \nin America.''\n  According to the Institute's findings, the United States economy \nloses between $65 billion and $130 billion each year because of the \ncost of the undiagnosed or untreated illnesses of those Americans who \nlack insurance. In short, the report found that the cost of not \nproviding insurance is higher than the cost of providing insurance.\n  If these findings are borne out, this would represent an astonishing \nfact that should force the Congress to rethink our approach to the \nhealth care and insurance, policies in the country today. The report \nalso examined the effect being uninusured has on individuals and their \nfamilies.\n  It states:\n\n       Unisured individuals and families bear the burden of \n     increased financial risk and uncertainty as a consequence of \n     being uninsured. Although the estimated monetary value of the \n     potential financial losses that those without coverage bear \n     is relatively small, the psychological and behavioral \n     implications of living with financial and health risks and \n     uncertainty may be significant.\n\n  Recently, I was home in South Dakota meeting with citizens. I saw \nfirst-hand the effect that the lack of insurance and the fear of losing \ninsurance has on the people of my State.\n  Day after day, too many South Dakotans know that they are one layoff, \none bad crop, one accident, or one illness away from being totally \nunprotected. I met with veterans who are picking up a greater share of \ntheir health care costs, because cuts to their health benefits are \ncausing longer waits and worse care in the VA system.\n  I met with self-employed people, small business owners and farmers, \nwho buy their own insurance and as a result face premium costs as high \nas $20,000 a year. I met with the families of National Guard members \nwho just a few weeks ago were afraid that their loved ones might get \nhurt in the line of\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\nduty in Iraq. Today, they were worried that their husbands or wives \nwill lose their health coverage when they return home. And I met with \ncitizens from all walks of life who can't afford the high cost of \ninsurance and live in constant fear that an illness or an injury could \nthrow them and their family into bankruptcy.\n  I recently heard from a couple in Springfield, SD, who own a small \nbusiness, but who do not have insurance. The husband is a veteran and \nhe has been on the waiting list to receive benefits for himself through \nVeterans Health Administration for a year-and-a-half. In the meantime, \nhe has looked for health insurance for both for he and his wife. But, \nthe only policy they could find had monthly premiums of $800 and \ndeductible of $2,500. In addition, the insurance would not cover the \ncouple's pre-existing conditions. This policy was too expensive, so \nthey are forced to live without coverage of any kind until the Veterans \nAdministration is able to provide it. They may wait for as long as 2 \nyears.\n  To bring resources for Veterans health more in line with the \noverwhelming need, many of us introduced a bill, S. 19, that would \nchange the funding process for the Veterans Health Administration. The \nbill would mandate increased funding to correspond to any increase in \nthe number of patients. This section, which is identical to S. 50, the \nVeteran Health Funding Guarantee Act introduced by Senator Johnson, \nwould help ensure that the VA can provide medical services to every \neligible veteran.\n  Our failure to provide coverage to veterans is one of the most \nglaring examples of the unfairness in our health care system. But the \nproblem extends throughout our entire country. Forty-one million \nAmericans lack health insurance today, and high costs are driving that \nnumber even higher. With the release of the Institute of Medicine's \nreport, we learn that doing what's right is in fact less costly for our \ncountry than doing nothing. We can do better. This is a national \nproblem and it demands national leadership to fix it.\n  We have an obligation to focus on the troubles of our economy and the \nAmericans who are struggling to work and raise families. We certainly \nwant to do everything we can to keep the Senate's attention focused on \nthe crisis in health care. Our citizens are asking for our leadership, \nand we have an obligation to answer their call.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as we did with the Graham amendment, I \nwould now like to allow consideration of the Kerry amendment, and thus \nI ask unanimous consent that all the terms of the previous order remain \nin place except that the pending amendments be temporarily set aside, \nand that the Senator from Massachusetts be recognized to offer his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 958\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 958.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase the availability of discounted prescription \n                                 drugs)\n\n       On page 204, after line 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. ACCESS TO DISCOUNTED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\n       (a) In General.--From amounts made available under \n     subsection (c), the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall award grants to covered entities described in section \n     340B(a)(4) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     256b(a)(4)) to enable such entities to pay the start-up costs \n     associated with the establishment of pharmacies to provide \n     covered drugs under such section 340B.\n       (b) Application.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \n     subsection (a), a covered entity shall prepare and submit to \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services an application at \n     such time, in such manner, and containing such information as \n     the Secretary may require.\n       (c) Funding.--The following sums are appropriated, out of \n     any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated to the \n     Prescription Drug Account established under section 1860DD-25 \n     of the Social Security Act, $300,000,000 to carry out this \n     section. Amounts made available under this subsection shall \n     become available October 1, 2004, and shall remain available \n     until expended.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member \nand congratulate both him and Senator Grassley on what is obviously an \nextraordinarily important, complicated, and difficult road--to try to \nmove toward prescription drug coverage for seniors in America. I wish \nto share a few words, if I may, at the outset, before moving \nspecifically to the amendment, and to talk generally about the bill \nitself.\n  Obviously, all across our country we have accomplished an \nextraordinary service for seniors through what we have achieved through \nMedicare. It is one of the great social programs of the United States \nof America. I can remember years ago a shared responsibility by \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. I think it was President Nixon who \nsigned the enormous proportion of it into law in the beginning of the \n1970s. We lifted a great many seniors in this country out of poverty as \na consequence. It has benefited millions of Americans who would \notherwise go without quality health care and otherwise either be forced \ninto poverty or remain in poverty. The face of poverty in the United \nStates of America changed because of this program.\n  I might add that it is a Government program. Often, the Government \ncomes under great criticism. But the truth is that this is a program \nthat has worked, a program that has made a difference in the lives of \nour fellow Americans, and a program that a large proportion of America \nappreciates, respects, and doesn't want to see destroyed. I think we \nhave a duty to try to strengthen and improve the program by adding a \ncomprehensive, affordable, and guaranteed prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare.\n  Notwithstanding the very best efforts of the chairman and ranking \nmember and others on the committee on which I serve, there are still \nquestions as to whether this in fact does that at this point in time.\n  That doesn't mean it isn't perhaps for some people worth voting for. \nI haven't made a final decision with respect to final passage. That may \ndepend somewhat on what we achieve over the course of these days. But \nwe need to put to the test the question of what we are doing versus \nwhat we could do. This is a fair standard for us to try to measure.\n  My concern today is that the underlying bill as currently drafted is \na good start, it is a good foundation, but it doesn't fulfill the full \nmeasure of the promise of comprehensive, affordable, and guaranteed in \nways in which I think we could do it. Our Nation's seniors, I fear, \nwill experience a very severe case of sticker shock when they learn how \nfar the bill falls below their expectations for relief.\n\n  Also, I wish we did not have to wait until 2006. I have serious \nquestions about why, given it took us only 11 months to set up Medicare \nitself, it takes us 2\\1/2\\ years to set up the Medicare drug benefit. \nFrankly, it is beyond my acceptance of what is a legitimate reason. I \nknow the reasons. I have heard the reasons. But think about that: We \nset up the entire Medicare Program in about 11 months, and now we are \ntold to add a benefit within it, we ought to wait about 2\\1/2\\ years. I \nthink it has far more to do about budgets and far more to do about \nelections than it does with the realities of what we need to do.\n  Seniors, obviously, need this relief. Nearly 40 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries report having no--zero--prescription drug coverage. And \nthe average amount they pay out of their own pocket for prescription \ndrugs has increased from $644 in the year 2000 to $996 in 2003. These \nexpenses are projected to grow to $1,147 in 2004 and $1,454 by 2006, \nwhich is the year when the benefit actually gets implemented. So we are \ntalking about a much larger bill than we have today.\n  People who are measuring this bill by what we have today are actually \nmeasuring it short of what the need is because the need is going to be \nthe year\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\nof implementation, 2006, and then we will have more than doubled the \namount that individuals are paying for prescription drugs. That means \nthe average annual out-of-pocket spending by seniors for prescription \ndrugs will have doubled over that period. And I think seniors are to \ngoing to question: Well, if they all knew that, why am I still having \nsuch a hard time paying for prescription drugs?\n  Now, again, I want to underscore, I know how hard it is for the \nchairman and Senator Baucus to try to do this. And the reason it is so \nhard is because we have been given an arbitrary number. And I will say \nsomething more about that in a minute.\n  Let me say, for a moment, what I think is good that we have \naccomplished. No. 1, we have rejected President Bush's efforts to force \nseniors into private plans. We have rejected the President's plan to \ndisadvantage seniors who want to stay in traditional Medicare and to \nkeep the same doctors they have now. We have rejected the President's \nplan to give a windfall of incentives to PPOs to encourage their \nparticipation in the program. And we have adopted certain longstanding \nDemocratic principles that include significant cost-sharing protections \nfor low-income beneficiaries, a guaranteed fallback plan, and some key \nefforts that are targeted at improving the traditional fee-for-service \nbenefits under Medicare.\n  But there are concerns I expressed in my ``no'' vote in the Finance \nCommittee, and I want to express those concerns now on the Senate \nfloor.\n  First of all, there are crucial areas I would hope we would try to \nfind a way to improve. The most important of those is this gap in the \ncoverage, in the donut hole as it is called, where seniors are charged \na premium, but they do not get anything for the premium.\n  It seems to me there ought to be adequate protection to ensure, also, \nthat employer coverage is not substituted or dropped. We do not want to \ncreate a situation where employers are covering people today, but \nbecause you have a fallback situation, they may decide, OK, we are \ngoing to drop that coverage, and, in fact, people are downgraded in \nwhat is available to them because there are not enough private people \ncoming in to make up for that; therefore, the fallback is what they \nget. In addition, we must improve the stability of the fallback plans \nto minimize confusion and inconvenience to seniors.\n\n  Finally, I think we have to protect lowest income seniors by making \nsure they, too, can get the Medicare benefit. We ought to guarantee--or \ndo our best to guarantee--a uniform national premium, somehow, for that \nbenefit, and try to eliminate the new increases in beneficiary cost \nsharing under traditional Medicare and be more aggressive about \nproviding additional benefits under the program.\n  But the stark reality is, all of these constraints are not the fault \nof Senator Baucus or Senator Grassley. There is a reason we are \noperating under this straitjacket where we have had to tell a bunch of \nseniors they are going to pay a premium, they can buy insurance, they \nget to buy insurance up to $3,000--whatever it is--$4,500, and then \nthey stop, but they continue to pay premiums. They continue to pay, but \nthey are not going to get any benefit. They have to go back and start \npaying their full premium. But then when they get up to the $5,800 of \ncatastrophic level, it begins to cut back in.\n  The reason we are there is fundamentally that $400 billion is all the \nCongress was given to deal with this--the arbitrary: Let's pick a \nnumber. Here is what we will put into prescription drugs.\n  I think every American has a right to ask--and they will ask over the \ncourse of the next years--why they were limited to $400 billion when \nthe U.S. Congress chose to take $3 trillion off the table in tax cuts \nthat went to upper income Americans over the course of the last 2 \nyears.\n  Now, that is a fair question. That is the choice in America today. We \nmake choices. People sent us here to make choices. And the choice made \non behalf of the American people is that it is more important to reward \npeople earning $315,000 a year than to make certain a lot of seniors \ndon't have a donut hole in their coverage in prescription drugs.\n  When I heard Senator Craig Thomas a moment ago say not that many \nseniors are going to be left out, I said, well, that is interesting \nbecause in the next breath he said we can't afford it because it is \ngoing to cost $200 billion. Well, if it costs $200 billion, it sounds \nto me as if somebody is being left out to a pretty large amount of \nmoney.\n  You cannot have it both ways. If it is expensive, it means it is \nmeaningful to a lot of people. And if it is meaningful to a lot of \npeople, we ought to be thinking about why we are not doing it.\n  Warren Buffett--the second richest man in the United States of \nAmerica--wrote a letter a couple weeks ago where he said: Well, I own \nmy own company. And now that I own my own company, and I've been given \nthis very nice dividend benefit by the Republicans, I can pay myself $1 \nbillion. And when I pay myself $1 billion, I'm not going to have tax, \nin this first year, on $365 million of it. It's tax free. That's it. He \nsaid he thought it would have been better to give 365,000 families in \nAmerica $1,000 each. He did not think he ought to get that benefit.\n  Now, I think it is going to be fair for a lot of seniors in this \ncountry to ask the question, as we go forward, why Warren Buffett \nthinks that, and a whole bunch of people here think it is OK to do \nsomething else.\n\n  So if we are going to offer a prescription drug benefit that stands \nthe test of time, the test of coverage, the test of fairness, and \nultimately the test of the compact that Medicare created with our \nseniors, I think we ought to try to eliminate the coverage gap in this \nbill.\n  I think it is hard to turn to a senior at some point in time and say: \nLook, we want to help you buy drugs, but we are only going to help you \nup to the point where it gets really expensive. Then, when it gets \nreally expensive, you are going to have to start carrying the bigger \nweight until it gets really, really expensive, and then we will come \nback and help you. It seems to me a lot of seniors are going to be \nasking questions about that choice.\n  I think we also could do better in protecting seniors with retiree \ncoverage. The current bill contains a flawed definition for the true \nout-of-pocket costs by prohibiting any drug spending payments made on \nbehalf of Medicare beneficiaries by an employer-sponsored plan from \ncounting toward the stop-loss threshold.\n  In other words, they have an employer. That employer has given them a \nplan as a retiree, and they retire. They are qualified for Medicare. \nThey paid into their retiree plan. It is their deal. But that is not \nnow going to count toward their out-of-pocket expense. So they could, \nin fact, be left without the coverage that they deserve as a \nconsequence of this definition. And that means that retirees covered \nunder employer-sponsored plans will likely never reach the stop-loss \nthreshold, and they will effectively be denied benefits under the \ncatastrophic portion of the Medicare plan, even though they qualify for \nMedicare and worked just like everybody else for retirement and put \nmoney into the system.\n  Seniors who have retiree prescription drug coverage from their former \nemployer worked a lifetime. They made wage concessions over the years, \nwith the expectation they were going to receive those benefits. This \nbill comes along and, in effect, denies them benefits and treats them \nunequally in the context of the Medicare plan. It is unfair to change \nthose rules after the fact. We ought to try to change it and reward \nemployers who do the right thing and provide retiree coverage for their \nemployees.\n  We also ought to try to strengthen the guarantee of a fallback plan \nand provide seniors with more stability and less confusion. Under the \ncurrent bill, when a fallback program is available, it may not be \navailable for very long. Medicare beneficiaries who are in the fallback \nprogram and like it will have to leave that program if two private \ninsurers decide later to serve their region. In other words, the bill \nsays there is only a fallback if you don't have two providers. But the \nminute you have two providers in a region, people who may have gone \ninto the fallback program will have to turn around and leave the \nfallback program because there are now two providers, even if the two \nproviders are providing more expensive premiums than they had in\n\n[[Page S8280]]\n\nthe fallback. So they will be forced out of their fallback into a more \nexpensive plan which a lot of seniors are going to find both oppressive \nas well as very confusing to them as to why they have to do that.\n  Some people are going to argue there is another area of concern. That \nis how we treat low-income seniors in this bill. These are our most \nvulnerable and poorest seniors. They are eligible for both Medicare and \nMedicaid. But under the bill, they are going to get their benefit from \nthe Medicaid Program. They won't be allowed to go into the Medicare \nProgram because they are poor.\n  Some people are going to come to the floor and say: Wait a minute, a \nlot of States offer a better benefit in Medicaid. It is true. Some do. \nBut we are not offering them an option. We are telling them they have \nto get it from Medicaid. And the problem is a whole bunch of States \nhave a very limited Medicaid drug benefit. For instance, in the State \nof Texas, the benefit covers only three prescriptions. That is not a \nlot of protection. So we are forcing people into Medicaid in a State \nwhere, because they are poor, they have to take Medicaid, and they may \nonly have three prescriptions available to them in the whole program. \nWe are asking for trouble if that stays the way it is.\n  Moreover, we all know a lot of States are facing the worst deficits \nin a generation. That means States are beginning to cut back their \nbenefits. There isn't one of us who hasn't seen a State where a \nGovernor is forced to start to clip back on Medicaid. That means we are \ngoing to see higher copayments. We will have tighter formularies, more \nbureaucracy, and we will not necessarily be achieving the goal we are \nseeking.\n  Requiring low-income seniors to stay in a Medicaid prescription \nprogram is a bad deal for seniors because of the States that provide an \ninferior prescription drug benefit in Medicaid. We are now essentially \ncreating the very thing we have always tried not to do. We are creating \na second-class tier of citizens based on their income within the \nMedicare Program. We will for the first time say to seniors who paid \ninto Medicare through a lifetime that just because now in their old \nage, because of their low income, they are going to have to accept a \nlesser benefit. That is wrong. For the first time in the history of the \nMedicare Program, seniors will be denied a benefit simply because of \ntheir income. It is a terrible precedent. It strains the social compact \nthat was the foundation of Medicare in the first place.\n\n  Another concern in the underlying bill is the lack of the guaranteed \npremium or uniformity of it. Under this legislation, insurance \ncompanies providing the new drug benefit have the freedom to design \ntheir prescription drug plan. That is great. I am for the marketplace. \nI am all for companies offering a private prescription plan to the \ndegree they want to or choose to or can. They can decide what premiums \nand copayments they want to charge. But the point is, under Medicare, \nwe have always decided there was a fundamental compact with seniors for \nwhich they could pay and which ought to have some uniformity of \ntreatment in essence. What we are doing now is throwing that whole \nsense of the system into the competitive structure of sometimes very \nlimited choices which may ratchet up prices in a way that is going to \nbecome very complicated for a lot of Senators and Congressmen to \nexplain to seniors who are used to the Medicare plan being something \ndifferent in the context of the compact.\n  The bill promises an ``average premium'' of about $35 per month. But \npremiums are obviously going to vary from region to region in the \ncountry which means some seniors may pay $39 a month in Alabama, maybe \n$40 a month in Tennessee, but be charged $160 in New York. I believe we \nhave to be very sensitive and thoughtful about what happens to people \non fixed incomes. This is not your average marketplace. This is not a \nplace where people even have the same set of choices.\n  When a senior on a fixed income winds up with high blood pressure, \ndiabetes, perhaps prostate cancer or a mastectomy, any number of \ndifferent problems that seniors cope with, they are forced into an \neconomic status, not choosing to get into one. The question is whether \nwe are going to do our best to try to protect them from that kind of \nvolatility.\n  It is estimated in the first year of the program, approximately 35 \npercent of the Part D beneficiaries are going to pay more in premiums \nand out-of-pocket cost sharing than they will save from the new drug \nbenefit; 35 percent will pay more than they are going to save from the \nnew benefit. And to add insult to injury in that context, the bill \ndoesn't just fail to provide an affordable, comprehensive drug benefit, \nbut it also increases cost sharing for other Medicare benefits.\n  In that context, there are two troublesome cost-sharing requirements. \nIt increases the Medicare Part B deductible from $100 to $125. And then \nit indexes it by inflation and permits a new coinsurance for clinical \nlaboratory services. That means Medicare beneficiaries will be asked to \ncarry the burden of an additional $24 billion in new cost-sharing \nrequirements over the next 10 years. Wait until your grandmother finds \nout about that one.\n  For all of my concerns, we have certainly come closer than we have \nbeen at any time in recent years to trying to achieve the great goal of \nputting prescription drugs into some kind of Medicare benefit. I \nbelieve with additional persistence, with additional negotiations \nbetween us and the administration, we could make those concerns I just \nexpressed go away or we could mitigate them. We could diminish them. I \nintend to support a number of amendments on the floor seeking to do \nthat.\n  I have an amendment I have just called up that seeks to do one part \nof that. Let me explain it very quickly. I want to talk about an \namendment I have and I will get to the one I just called up in a \nmoment.\n  We have talked for a long time in the Senate about mental health \nparity. It is a goal we really want to achieve in this country. Senator \nDomenici has been a champion for it. There have been bipartisan efforts \nto try to get there. I would like to see us end the discriminatory \npractice of charging seniors in Medicare a 50 percent copay for mental \nhealth services, when we only charge a 20 percent copay for the other \nphysician services. Too many seniors have mental illnesses that go \nuntreated, and we should try not to make that worse by making it harder \nfor people to be able to get the care.\n  I have an amendment to bring parity for mental health services for \nseniors. I am also working with Senator Sununu to try to improve the \nMedicare benefit by adding vision rehabilitation services to the list \nof covered services.\n  I am also pleased to join with Senator Hutchison and Senator Kennedy \nas a lead cosponsor of an amendment to increase the Medicare indirect \nmedical education--so-called IME--payments for teaching hospitals. I \nappreciate very much the efforts of Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley \nto try to accommodate us to find a way to deal with this issue. It is a \ncritical issue. Teaching hospitals incur a different set of costs, and \nyou cannot measure the Medicare reimbursement against the expenses of \nthe hospital in the same way.\n  Fifty percent of the doctors in Montana were taught at hospitals in, \nI think, 11 or 12 States, including Massachusetts, New York, \nCalifornia, and a few others in the country. So 11 or 12 States are \nspending money in their teaching hospitals to provide the benefit to \nthe rest of the country of that quality medical education. When 50 \npercent of the doctors in Montana were educated in 11 or 12 States, \nMontana has a benefit, but it is not measured in the Medicare \nreimbursement. We need to make up that difference so we can continue to \nhave the quality medical instruction and education in our country from \nwhich every American benefits.\n  In the spirit of improving this legislation, the amendment I offer \ntoday, which has bipartisan support, would dramatically improve the \nbill for some of the things I said I think are problems. It does it for \nvery little money.\n  My amendment will help seniors who are in the coverage gap. What it \ndoes, it doesn't fill the whole ``donut,'' but it will offer \nsignificant help to seniors who fall into the donut by expanding access \nto the existing prescription drug safety net.\n  The Federal Government currently sponsors a discount prescription \ndrug program for those qualifying entities, such as a community health \ncenter or\n\n[[Page S8281]]\n\na public hospital or the Ryan White grantees, and others. Under this \nprogram, which is known as the 340(b) covered entities program, they \nhave access to discounted prescription drug pricing for their patients \nin the program. In other words, if you have a community health center \nand your community health center has an in-house pharmacy, they could \nfill the prescriptions for seniors at discounted rates. They are \nallowed to do it. We have already had that under law. The problem is, \nwe know a whole bunch of community centers and public health hospitals \ndon't have the in-house pharmacies.\n  The benefit of this is to provide drugs that are significantly lower \nthan the retail and wholesale prices. Based on a recent analysis of 200 \nvery popular drugs, under 340(b) prices, on average, those drugs were \n54 percent lower than the average wholesale price. Another recent \nsurvey showed that 340(b) prices were 24 percent lower than those \navailable to groups purchasing as group organizations. So it is a sound \nprogram, but it is underutilized. Not all health centers and hospitals \nhave an in-house pharmacy.\n\n  One of the biggest barriers to participating in 340(b) for many of \nthe qualifying entities is the very expensive upfront capital cost of \nputting in place a pharmacy in their facility. So what I would do is \nestablish a $300 million grant fund from the prescription drug trust \nfund created under the bill for HHS to award grants to health centers, \nhospitals, and other qualifying 340(b) institutions to help them with \nthe startup costs associated with establishing a pharmacy in their \nentity. CBO scoring of this bill showed there is about a $10 billion \nsurplus available in the current scoring, and so we have come in under \nthe $400 billion. We have some cushion here. If we took that $300 \nmillion and made it available to these in-house entities to create \nthose discount drug centers, then we could have those people who fall \ninto the donut hole go to those centers, get the discount drugs, and \nsignificantly reduce the impact of the donut, which I think is a \nworthwhile effort.\n  We estimate there are up to 2,000 organizations in communities all \nacross the country who would be assisted to set up in-house pharmacies \nas a result of this amendment. That will mean seniors all across the \ncountry who find themselves in the coverage gap will be able to \npurchase their prescription drugs for as much as 50 percent below the \nwholesale price. That savings is very significant in the context of \nwhat we are facing here.\n  My amendment is endorsed by the National Association of Community \nHealth Centers, the National Association of Public Hospitals, and the \nPublic Hospital Pharmacy Coalition. I hope it can earn the support of \nmy colleagues so we can address one of the unintended consequences of \ndealing with only a $400 billion benefit, such as we are today.\n  I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to share these thoughts \nwith them. I hope we can pass this amendment or have it accepted at the \nappropriate time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as we hear more and more about this bill, \nof course, it causes us to reflect on it and that is the purpose of \nhaving conversation, that is the purpose of having debate. There will \nbe much more of that, of course, but it is interesting to listen to \nwhat is being discussed, much of it based on the fact we need more \nmoney for this and more money for that, when we are adding to Medicare \n$400 billion, continuing to support the basic Medicare Program as it is \nfinancially, and adding to it this additional amount.\n\n  Medicare will be improved in every way as this happens. So I know it \nis a logical time to talk about how we might do more, how we might \nprovide a Government program, as the Senator from New York talked about \nthis morning, for everyone; take all the payments out, and that is a \npoint of view.\n  I think, however, the concept of this business of Medicare is one in \nwhich we all pay into it, we pay something for it. Obviously, one of \nthe principles of health care is for the recipient to pay something. We \nhave found when they do not, it is out of control entirely.\n  We have a lot of worrisome times about Medicaid where there is no \ninitial payment and we have overutilization. These are all part of the \nelements that go into it. I know it is great to talk about giving \neverything to everyone, but the fact is, that is not what is going to \nhappen.\n  We have to get a balanced program that does what we really want to \ndo. We talk about the gaps and helping people. The fact is, there is no \ngap for people who are below 160 percent of poverty. If we are going to \nassist someone, we assist those who are less able to assist themselves. \nThat is what it is all about. That is what we seek to do.\n  Is it perfect? Of course not. If there were 100 of us sitting here \nworking on the plan, we would probably have 100 different ideas as to \nhow to do it, but we have to come to some consensus as to what our \ngoals are and how we can best achieve those goals. Over time, it is \nsomething that is useful.\n  We have to keep that in mind as we go forward. Obviously, there are \nall different kinds of ideas, such as the fact we had a tax reduction \nand, therefore, we should be able to spend more. We had a tax reduction \nbecause we have an economic problem. We are trying to fix the economy--\nthat is why we had a tax reduction--along with terrorism and other \nneeds. To say we should pay more because we already had a tax reduction \nis not relative. That is not where we are.\n  Out-of-pocket expenses, of course, are always important, and should \nbe. That is one of the keys. Here we have a program on which we have a \ncertain amount of money we can legitimately spend. How do we best do \nthat? How can we deal with everyone the same? Do we do more for those \nwith low income and those who are less able to afford it? Of course. \nThe true out-of-pocket limit targets the drug benefit to those who need \nit the most. That is what it is about.\n  The purpose of out of pocket is to protect seniors from high out-of-\npocket costs. It is that simple. Spending that counts toward the out-\nof-pocket limit spending by the beneficiary. If the beneficiary drug is \ncovered by some other source, such as a retiree's health plan, that \nmoney does not count out of pocket.\n  Seniors with additional coverage are not penalized for having \nadditional coverage. They are protected if they have $3,700 out-of-\npocket spending. In addition, they continue to benefit from additional \ndrug coverage beyond that point, of course.\n  In addition to out-of-pocket spending by the beneficiary, spending by \nfamily members or friends also counts toward the out-of-pocket limit, \nas does spending by State pharmacy assistance programs, by State \npharmacy plus programs. These programs target resources to lower income \nseniors who need additional assistance. They are in place now.\n  Allowing this spending to count toward the out-of-pocket limits \nallows these lower income seniors to receive additional assistance and \nstill be protected against prescription drug costs that are not covered \nby Medicare drug benefits.\n  We should care about what the individual beneficiary has to pay, not \nwhat others pay on their behalf. This is the purpose of out-of-pocket \nlimits in the proposal. Those who reach the amount of spending \navailable will have 90 percent of their drug costs covered.\n  The House and Senate bills encourage employers to continue providing \nbenefits by allowing them to avail themselves of 100 percent of the \nsubsidies for offering standard benefit. If employers want to provide \nmore, they are free to do so.\n  These are tough issues as to how we deal with some limitation on the \nspending and how we distribute it. We will hear more about it, and, \nindeed, we should.\n  There will be finally some principles involved as to the best way to \nspend the amount of money that is legitimately available. I hope we \ncontinue to focus primarily on those who are in that category of 160 \npercent of poverty level, and that is where it will continue to be.\n  Mr. President, we will continue to hear more. We certainly should \nhear\n\n[[Page S8282]]\n\nmore. We will continue to have more amendments, and that is fine. The \nSenator from Massachusetts was a member of the committee. We worked on \nit in the first place, and he has had an opportunity for input. Many of \nthese proposals have already been voted on in the committee. Of course, \nif they are being proposed again, they were not successful in \ncommittee. Nevertheless, they should be brought up to this body, and \nthey will.\n  Again, my hope is we can take a look at where we want to be in the \nyear 2006, but what we want the result to be and make the adjustments \nthat are necessary to get us to that point and not be taking up issues \nthat are not even a part of debate. We are going to have to be very \ncareful that we keep it limited to the issues that do impact Medicare \nand are in this area. I know we will continue to do that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are now awaiting the arrival of Senator \nLincoln from Arkansas who has two amendments she wishes to offer. She \nwill be arriving shortly. Until she arrives, I have a few words about a \nparticular provision in the bill. It is called MARCIA, Medicare Appeals \nRegulatory and Contracting Improvements Act. Last year I joined my \ncolleagues, Senator Grassley, Senator Kerry, and now-Governor \nMurkowski, in introducing what we called the Medicare Appeals \nRegulatory and Contracting Improvements Act, otherwise know as MARCIA.\n  Today this bill is an essential part of our Medicare improvement \nproposal, the underlying bill. The purpose of the provision is to make \nMedicare a better business partner to providers, a smarter purchaser of \nservices for our taxpayers, and a more customer-friendly organization \nfor our beneficiaries. MARCIA will strengthen and improve Medicare and \nwill help bring the program's administration into the 21st century.\n  The provisions provide for regulatory improvements. I have heard from \nhundreds of doctors, as I know all in this body have, and many \nproviders who complain that the sheer number and complexity of Medicare \nregulations can drive them crazy and, at times, drive them out of \nbusiness.\n  While we cannot make Medicare into a simple program, this bill would \nmake and does take some helpful steps in the right direction.\n  For one thing, it will require the Secretary on a regular basis to \nreview the thousands of pages of statutes and regulations to see if \nthere are any inconsistencies in Medicare's many requirements.\n  Just a couple of days ago, the majority leader from Tennessee held up \na book which showed the Medicare requirements back, I think it was \n1965. It was a fairly thick volume, actually. Then alongside that he \nalso held up a book with the current Medicare regulations, which was a \ngigantic volume. It is similar to the problems we face in the Tax Code, \nas we all know.\n  I am not standing here to say the provisions of this bill are going \nto make Medicare simple and easy, that we are going to cut the number \nof pages down to half. But I am saying we are trying to do our very \nbest, and the provisions in this bill should help reduce some of the \ninconsistencies and the complexities that do now occur in the Medicare \nregulations. At least we are focusing on that problem and requiring the \nSecretary to address that, specifically giving that direction.\n  Second, our legislation would cut down on the CMS practice of using \nso-called interim final rule authority to impose major new regulations \nwithout even giving the public an opportunity to comment. It just \nstands to reason that the public should have an opportunity to comment \non rules because it is more likely if they do, the rules are going to \nbe better rules or, on the other side of the coin, if there is not an \nopportunity for the public to comment, there is going to be a tendency \nover time for CMS or any agency to be a little less sensitive to what \nthat is really all about, which is about serving people because, after \nall, we are all public servants, including CMS personnel. Our real job \nis to serve the people in the country, and I think this will help move \nCMS in that direction.\n  The third provision would make sure that new regulations cannot be \napplied retroactively. Intuitively, I think it makes sense that it does \nnot apply retroactively. I think these new requirements are just a \nsimple matter of fairness.\n  The underlying bill, as we are talking about the regulatory \nprovisions, would also make improvements to the Medicare appeals \nsystem. In the year 2001, on average it took 441 days to complete an \nappeal before an administrative law judge. The next level of appeal \ntook almost 2 years. It is true certain provisions in the 2000 law that \nwe passed tried to speed up the appeals process, but unfortunately that \nlaw did not provide the resources or the realistic timeframes necessary \nto make these changes work.\n  MARCIA, the regulatory provisions, would make some important \nimprovements to get this appeals system back on track so our Medicare \nbeneficiaries and providers can get justice more quickly. Clearly, 441 \ndays for the first level of appeal and 2 years for the second is not \nright, for a whole host of obvious reasons.\n  The bill also requires CMS to submit a plan to develop and train a \ngroup of dedicated Medicare ALJs, administrative law judges. This plan \nwould ensure that administrative law judges remain truly independent, \nwhich I think is a crucial feature of any fair appeals system.\n  Medicare contractors will also have to bid and compete for contracts \nunder this bill. That is a very significant change from current \npractice. Essentially, under the current practice, Medicare \ncontractors, especially talking about the intermediaries, are \nessentially nominated by the intermediaries. They themselves nominate \nwho it is going to be, and there is no limit to how long a contracting \nperiod can be. I think it tends to be a little bit too close and there \nis not enough fresh air to help assure, at least the best we can, that \nthe contractor selection process is one that provides more efficiency \nand better service to our people.\n\n  The Medicare contractors will have to bid now. They are going to have \nto compete for contracts under this bill--that is new--thereby assuring \nthat the Medicare Program and the taxpayers are getting the best \nservice for the lowest price the market will allow.\n  In assessing the bids, CMS will have to consider customer service and \naccuracy. That is required when CMS is now selecting contractors and \ngetting bids from contractors. Again, we are talking generally about \nthe so-called intermediaries who are the ones who deal directly with \nproviders. They deal between the providers and the beneficiaries and \nthe Government.\n  In assessing the bids, CMS will have to consider customer service and \naccuracy, as I said, and contractors will also have to provide much \nmore information to providers and to beneficiaries. If the providers \nraise questions about Medicare claims or policies, contractors will \nhave to answer them in writing. That, too, is new.\n  The bill also would require the Secretary to standardize the way in \nwhich Medicare conducts audits, the way it conducts prepayment and \npostpayment reviews of provider claims. We often hear of great, almost \ngross, inconsistencies among different parts of the country, different \nregions. It makes sense to standardize this a little bit better. I am \nencouraged that CMS has already taken steps in this direction to make \nthe audit process more fair but to ensure that providers are treated \nfairly and consistently, I believe the law has to require it.\n  Finally, I am pleased this bill also contains money for continued \nstrong enforcement against waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare \nProgram. I have long believed the Medicare integrity programs must be \nfirm, but they must also be fair. This bill takes important steps to \nensure honest dealing with taxpayer money and fair treatment for the \nprofessionals who serve our seniors every day.\n  Essentially, these are provisions that hopefully address a good part \nof the regulatory complaints, the legitimate\n\n[[Page S8283]]\n\ncomplaints that all of us in this body have been hearing about from \ndoctors and hospitals as they try to do their very best job in \nproviding care, in this case, to seniors. I think these are good, solid \nprovisions.\n  Turning to another matter, as we did for Senator Graham and Senator \nKerry, I would now like to make it possible for the Senator from \nArkansas to offer her amendments. I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be temporarily set aside and that the Senator from \nArkansas be recognized to offer up to three amendments in succession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I begin by complimenting my colleagues \nfrom the Finance Committee: Senator Grassley, our chairman; the ranking \nmember, Senator Baucus; and all of the other members on the committee \nwho have really focused on what is most important to the American \npeople, and that is to get a good, commonsense product out of the \nSenate that encourages our seniors and lets them know that we do \nunderstand that this is a critical issue. It is critical not only in \nterms of the quality of life for our seniors but also in regard to \neconomics. We want them to understand we can provide cost savings not \nonly to our Nation but to our aging families by providing a \nprescription drug package which will allow them to be healthier \nindividuals; to not cause or create greater costs for this country and \nfor the other parts of the health care system in this great Nation \nthrough acute care or difficulties in long-term care, in nursing homes \nand emergency rooms, but being able to have a quality of life and \nproviding a good economic way to deal with the aging process.\n  As we went through this bill in committee, we talked an awful lot \nabout ways that we could improve Medicare; looking at coordination of \ncare, at how we could provide a better, commonsense way of \nadministering health care to our elderly in this country not only \nthrough a prescription drug package but recognizing that disease \nmanagement is an enormous part of what we are doing for our elderly, \nand that with the multiple diseases they are dealing with, if we can \nmanage that disease management of multiple diseases and have a \ncoordination of care, we are going to get a better bang for our buck in \nMedicare.\n  I am excited about the possibilities and want to compliment my \ncolleagues on a lot of hard work that has been done, particularly \nrecognizing that rural areas of our Nation also have great needs. I \ncertainly applaud the chairman and the ranking member on that.\n  Today I bring up several of the amendments I have to offer. Many of \nthese amendments we discussed in the committee. In my approach in the \ncommittee I was willing to visit with the chairman and the ranking \nmember and say I hoped we could work through whatever we needed to in \norder to get these passed and get them in part of the bill. Those \ndiscussions are ongoing and I compliment my colleagues for working with \nme on these critical issues.\n  Hopefully we can resolve them without going to a vote, but I want \nthese amendments placed and filed and in the queue so my colleagues \nhave an opportunity to comment on them and work with me in order to get \nthem done.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 934, as Modified\n\n  First is amendment 934 which has already been filed. Medicare Part B \ndoes not currently cover insulin or syringes used to inject insulin for \nthe majority of enrollees in the Medicare Program. This is a horrific \noversight in a program that should be designed to deal with our elderly \nbut, more importantly, dealing with, again, some of these diseases that \nare predominantly in our aging population, especially when we see that \nof the 7 million or so Americans over 65 with diabetes, 40 percent \ninject insulin every day to control their diabetes.\n  Providing syringes for insulin will go a long way to helping seniors \nkeep their diabetes in control. It is a fabulous preventive measure. It \nis obviously a critical area of need for our seniors. The management of \nblood glucose levels for diabetes helps prevent long-term complications \nlike kidney failure, blindness, amputation, and a multitude of other \nchronic illnesses and problems that arise when diabetes is not kept in \ncheck.\n  Syringes are required to inject insulin because there is no oral or \ninhaled form of insulin. The lack of coverage for syringes means \nsyringe purchases will not count toward their yearly maximum out-of-\npocket expenses and their copayments. This will lead to the reuse of \nsyringes that are not FDA approved for more than one use. We recognize \nit is a very minimal cost to the overall package and makes a huge \ndifference.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a look at this amendment. I \ncompliment the ranking member and the chairman for being willing to \nwork with me as we go through this process. I hope it is something we \ncan get accepted. If it is not, I hope my colleagues will recognize for \nthis very small amount of money we can make an enormous difference in a \nhuge population of our elderly who are suffering from diabetes. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on that.\n  I call up amendment 934 as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], Ms. Collins, and \n     Mr. Miller, proposes an amendment numbered 934, as modified.\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure coverage for syringes for the administration of \n      insulin, and necessary medical supplies associated with the \n                       administration of insulin)\n\n       On page 8, line 12, insert ``(including syringes, and \n     necessary medical supplies associated with the administration \n     of insulin, as defined by the Administrator)'' before the \n     semicolon.\n       On page 174, line 14, insert ``(including syringes, and \n     necessary medical supplies associated with the administration \n     of insulin, as defined by the Secretary)'' before the comma.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent to lay that amendment aside to \nproceed to the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 935\n\n  Mr. President, the next amendment I bring up has to do with the \ngraduate medical education 2-year program in geriatrics. One of the \nprovisions of my geriatric care act bill pertains to the Medicare \ngraduate medical education financing of this second year of a \ngeriatrics fellowship training. It clarifies that geriatric training \nprograms are eligible for 2 years of fellowship support. This can be \ndone administratively. We have worked with Tom Skully at CMS, and he is \ninterested in making something such as this happen.\n  The fact is, out of 125 medical schools in this great country, only \nthree have a department of geriatrics. At a time when we are getting \nready to see 41 million Americans over the age of 65 blossom into well \nover 70 million Americans over the age of 65, it is not just a critical \nmeasure to provide a prescription drug package.\n  We have to be prepared with the types of physicians and medical \ntechnicians who can care for our aging population, who understand what \ncoordination of care actually means in bringing together this disease \nmanagement. In understanding that it is not just one medical visit, but \nthat has to be coordinated with a nutritionist, perhaps dealing with \ndepression, a psychologist, they have to deal with orthopedics, they \nhave to deal with a multitude of other disease management areas.\n  If we can include that 2 years of funding for geriatric training, \nthen we will be able to not only train the geriatricians we need, but \nwe will also be able to maintain the level of academic geriatricians \nwho will be the ones teaching geriatric medicine and geriatricians for \nthe future. It is a critical part of what we have to do.\n  We worked out a compromise in the committee after having come through \nthe committee, and in talking to CMS they suggested some changes. These \nare only technical changes. I don't think anyone will have a problem \nwith them. I hope not. I want to make sure I get them out there and \nmake sure we can work through those differences. I look forward to \nworking with the chairman on that.\n  I call up that amendment, which is amendment 935.\n\n[[Page S8284]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 935.\n\n (Purpose: To clarify the intent of Congress regarding an exception to \n  the initial residency period for geriatric residency or fellowship \n                               programs)\n\n       Strike section 410 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 410. EXCEPTION TO INITIAL RESIDENCY PERIOD FOR GERIATRIC \n                   RESIDENCY OR FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Clarification of Congressional Intent.--Congress \n     intended section 1886(h)(5)(F)(ii) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)(5)(F)(ii)), as added by section 9202 of \n     the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 \n     (Public Law 99-272), to provide an exception to the initial \n     residency period for geriatric residency or fellowship \n     programs such that, where a particular approved geriatric \n     training program requires a resident to complete 2 years of \n     training to initially become board eligible in the geriatric \n     specialty, the 2 years spent in the geriatric training \n     program are treated as part of the resident's initial \n     residency period, but are not counted against any limitation \n     on the initial residency period.\n       (b) Interim Final Regulatory Authority and Effective \n     Date.--The Secretary shall promulgate interim final \n     regulations consistent with the congressional intent \n     expressed in this section after notice and pending \n     opportunity for public comment to be effective for cost \n     reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2003.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent that amendment be laid aside \nfor my next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 959\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. The next amendment is amendment numbered 959. I am \noffering this amendment that authorizes a 3-year, five-State \ndemonstration project of direct access to outpatient physical therapy \nservices within the Medicare Program without the sometimes burdensome \nrequirement of seeking a physician referral.\n  This is not a new concept. Several health professionals currently \nenjoy practice without referral under Medicare for their respective \nscopes of practice--dentists, podiatrists, chiropractics, optometrists, \nnurse practitioners. They all practice independent physician referral.\n  Non-Medicare citizens in my State of Arkansas and 36 other states, \nincluding Iowa, Utah, Maine, Arizona, Wyoming, Pennsylvania, the home \nState of our Presiding Officer, Tennessee, Oregon, Kentucky, Montana, \nWest Virginia, South Dakota, North Dakota, Florida, New Mexico, and \nMassachusetts, all of which have Senators represented on this \ncommittee, allow direct access to licensed physical therapists as \nauthorized by their State law.\n  However, Medicare requires its beneficiaries in my home State and \nyours to obtain a referral in order to access the services of a \nphysical therapist. I certainly believe it is time to study the example \nof the States in a demonstration project to see if the referral \nrequirement is indeed necessary. We are talking about seniors who are \nstriving so diligently to claim the final years of quality of life. \nPhysical therapy, occupational therapy, vocational therapy, all of \nthese therapies are the tools that allow these individuals to go back \ninto their home and to live their life, with the quality of life, with \nthe dignity they want in their end-of-life years. It is so critical \nthey can get the necessary access to these services in order to be able \nto do that.\n  I encourage my colleagues and certainly the ranking member, Senator \nBaucus, and our chairman, Senator Grassley, to work with me on this \nprogram. I believe it is budget neutral. It simply is moving forward on \nthe concept that many of our States have already embarked on. It is \nvery practical on behalf of the aging community that we are working on \nright now.\n  With that, I call up amendment 959.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 959.\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a demonstration project for direct access to \n         physical therapy services under the medicare program)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

and\n       (B) in the case of the report on the final evaluation, not \n     later than 180 days after the closing date of the project.\n       (3) Funding for evaluation.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated such sums as may be necessary to provide for the \n     evaluations and reports required by this subsection.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation services.--\n     Subject to paragraph (2), the term ``comprehensive outpatient \n     rehabilitation services'' has the meaning given to such term \n     in section 1861(cc) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395x(cc)).\n       (2) Direct access.--The term ``direct access'' means, with \n     respect to outpatient physical therapy services and physical \n     therapy services furnished as comprehensive outpatient \n     rehabilitation facility services, coverage of and payment for \n     such services in accordance with the provisions of title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act, except that sections \n     1835(a)(2), 1861(p), and 1861(cc) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395n(a)(2), 1395x(p), and 1395x(cc), respectively) shall be \n     applied--\n       (A) without regard to any requirement that--\n       (i) an individual be under the care of (or referred by) a \n     physician;

I ask unanimous consent that amendment be laid aside so \nI can bring up my final amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Before I get to my final amendment, I want to touch on \none other issue and that is the issue of our rural ambulance providers. \nI see my colleague, Senator Thomas. He and many others who are in the \nrural health caucus have done a tremendous job in working through this \nbill and providing great access issues for our rural areas. I am \nencouraging my colleagues, as well as the ranking member and the \nchairman, to work with us on the issue of the rural ambulance \nproviders.\n  We do not have an amendment as of yet and I am hoping we can work \nthrough some of those details as we move forward in this piece of \nlegislation. I encourage them to work with us and hopefully we can \nfinish that on Monday and move expeditiously on a piece of legislation \nthat will benefit all of the seniors across the Nation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 963\n\n  My last amendment is an amendment we have brought on the fallback \nissue, which is a critical piece of this bill. I think it is absolutely \nessential, as we look toward making sure private industry can play a \nrole in providing a Medicare prescription drug package. We have seen, \nover the course of many past years, where private industry has \ncertainly the option, even today, to participate in Medicare and the \napplication of it. In some of our areas across this great Nation they \nare reluctant to do so because the profitability is not there for them.\n  We want to make sure there is every opportunity for private industry \nto come in and provide a product for everyone across this Nation. But \nif, in fact, in the time it takes to implement this program certain \nareas of our Nation find themselves in the same predicament they are \ntoday, which is private industry does not find it quite profitable \nenough to come in there, we want to make sure there is a fallback. We \ndon't want anyone left behind. We think all seniors in this great \nNation are equally important. We are going to make sure, across this \ngreat Nation, if for some reason there is an area that does not meet \nthe test for private industry, there is a fallback.\n  In that fallback we want to make sure they have the same contract \nbenefit the private industry does. We have talked a little about this \nissue in the past. We want to make sure, as we move forward on all \nthese issues, again, that the fallback measure that is going to be \nthere in some of our less populated areas is going to have that 2-year \ncontract ability.\n  In the Finance Committee, when we brought the bill up, we found in \nmany instances it primarily affects our rural States, and primarily \nrural areas. We want to make sure we offer them the same opportunity we \ndo in private industry.\n  It improves stability, provides a more stable benefit by reducing \nyear-to-year variability in premiums and cost sharing, and provides \nbetter assurances that needed medications and local pharmacists will be \ncovered. It improves choice. After all, that is what we are here to do, \nto provide our seniors with as much choice as we possibly can.\n  It provides that once seniors are in a fallback plan, they have the \noption to remain in that plan for 2 years. One of the concerns we have \nhad in our State is that when we have seen private plans come in, they \ncome in and then they leave and then they come back. Seniors do not \nknow what they can depend on. They have to make different decisions. \nEach year, because there is no standard design here, their choices are \ngoing to be different. They are going to have different premiums, \ndifferent formularies, different pharmacies they can go to. So we want \nto make this the least confusing possible. Providing them the ability \nto have the same stability in the fallback as they do in the private \nplans I think is very important. And I think it is fair. Therefore, we \ndo improve on fairness, providing the seniors in the fallback plan the \nsame rights given to seniors who are in a drug-only plan, the \nopportunity to stay in for that same 2 years.\n  Continuing the first bidding rights for drug-only plans--maintaining \nfirst bidding rights for the drug-only plans, allowing fallback plans \nto enter a region only after it has been determined the two private \ndrug-only plans will not be available--I encourage my colleagues to \nlook at this. If there are two private plans, there is no fallback. You \ndo not have to worry about a 2-year contract. You do not have to worry \nabout a 1-year contract. That is because the fallback doesn't even \nexist. These are just emergency measures, to make sure individuals in \nrural areas are going to get the same benefit and they are going to be \ncovered. We are not asking anything more of a Government fallback plan \nthan we are of private industry. If private industry is there, you do \nnot have to worry about it because the fallback is not going to exist.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a look at this. It comes at a very \nminimal cost. It adds substantial stability to the system and, \ncertainly, by not costing much more in dollars.\n  We again plead with our colleagues to make sure those seniors in \nrural States will have the same benefit there as have other seniors \nacross this great country. We look forward to working with them if \nthere are any concerns they have.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate your patience in allowing me to bring \nbefore the Senate my amendments to this very important bill and to \nencourage my colleagues. These are probably some of the most important \npolicy decisions we will be making. As we embark on this journey to \nprovide a critical component of health care to an enormous population \nin our Nation, as far as I am concerned, one of the most important as \nwell as the most vulnerable, I think it is critical for all of us to \nlook at ways we can improve this bill. Once this bill is passed, once \nit is signed into law, are changes going to be easy to make? No, they \nare not. So it is critical for each of us to take the time and \nrecognize where we can make these slight changes and improvements in a \nbill. It is going to make a remarkable difference in the lives of the \nelderly of this Nation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a look at these very simple \namendments that I think will be improving amendments to a bill that is \nmoving down the pathway, something we encourage everyone to support in \nthe coming days as we come to completion on a remarkable piece of \nlegislation and a remarkable help to the seniors of this Nation.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for their indulgence today and \nfor being able to offer these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

COUNCIL FOR TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION.\n\n       Section 1868 (42 U.S.C. 1395ee), as amended by section 534, \n     is amended--\n       (1) by adding at the end of the heading the following: ``; \n     council for technology and innovation''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Council for Technology and Innovation.--\n       ``(1) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish a \n     Council for Technology and Innovation within the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services (in this section referred to as \n     `CMS').\n       ``(2) Composition.--The Council shall be composed of senior \n     CMS staff and clinicians and shall be chaired by the \n     Executive Coordinator for Technology and Innovation (as \n     appointed or designated under paragraph (4)).\n       ``(3) Duties.--The Council shall coordinate the activities \n     of coverage, coding, and payment processes with respect to \n     new technologies and procedures, including new drug \n     therapies, under this title in order to expedite patient \n     access to new technologies and therapies.\n       ``(4) Executive Coordinator for technology and \n     innovation.--The Secretary shall appoint (or designate) a \n     noncareer appointee (as defined in section 3132(a)(7) of \n     title 5, United States Code) who shall serve as the Executive \n     Coordinator for Technology\n\n[[Page S8287]]\n\n     and Innovation.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor \nand offer some comments about the Medicare prescription drug bill. I \nwanted to give my accolades to the chairman and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee for how they have so expertly crafted a bill in a \nbipartisan fashion which is how this body ought to be operated, and so \noften we are operating exactly the opposite way. There are just too \nmany partisan votes around here. They have shown, Senators Grassley and \nBaucus, that the spirit of bipartisanship in fact does live and that \ngood work products can be accomplished.\n\n\n                          Antispam Legislation\n\n  Before I make my remarks on the legislation, I want to recall to mind \nanother bipartisan work product that was produced out of the Commerce \nCommittee yesterday and will be coming to the floor. It is the antispam \nlegislation. I have reserved for the floor to offer a major amendment \nto it. It is very possible that we will work out and the prime sponsors \nof the bill will accept my amendment, but it has to do with the \nquestion of spam, which is all of that unwanted e-mail everybody gets \non their computer.\n  I was just absolutely dumbfounded; One day I went in my Tampa office \nand I said: How about printing out for me the e-mail we received today, \njust one day. And they produced a full letter-sized sheet, single \nspaced, of e-mail that we did not want, that had come anyway. Of those \ne-mail messages, two of them were pornographic which, if that is \nhappening in the office of a Senator, you can imagine what is happening \nall across the country. That is exactly what is happening.\n  People are fed up. They want the Federal Government to do something \nabout it. Fortunately, we have finally gotten the political will now \nthat we are going to do something about it.\n\n  I bring this up not only as an example of bipartisanship reflecting \nwhat Senator Baucus has done with this masterful crafting of a \nlegislative package, but I wanted to alert the Senate to the fact that \nthe antispam bill is going to come. I am going to have an amendment \nthat will improve it.\n  In the bill the only penalty is a misdemeanor. What I want to do is \nto strengthen that penalty and to give the prosecutors the tools so \nthat the violation of sending unwanted and undisclosed in its address \ne-mail becomes an element that will trigger the Racketeer Influenced \nCorrupt Organization act, RICO.\n  What that does is give prosecutors the tools to go after the criminal \nenterprise and then take their assets. Let me tell you what is in this \nmorning's paper. Here is a good example of an e-mail scam that used a \nretailing giant's name in an attempt to capture credit card numbers and \nother personal data on a nationwide basis. They sent out millions of \nthese e-mails. What they did is, they took a retailer, Best Buy, and \nthey sent a message that said they wanted to offer something on Best \nBuy. Of course, it was all fraudulent. It was claiming to be Best Buy's \nfraud department. They said they were informing people their credit \ncard number had supposedly been used in a suspicious purchase through \nBest Buy dot com. And then it instructed the card holders to go to a \nspecial Web link to help resolve the problem.\n  Then when those Best Buy customers went to that Web link, they \noffered their credit card number and then ``Katie bar the door.''\n  Here is obviously a deceptive scheme, taking the advantage of a \nlegitimate business, using a deceptive message in order to obtain \ncredit card numbers which they then will use fraudulently to bilk \npeople of millions of dollars. And because they send out hundreds of \nmillions of these e-mail messages, it is time for us to get serious and \nnot just come in with an antispam bill that is going to spank people on \nthe hand with a misdemeanor but is going to go after the assets of the \ncriminal enterprise under the RICO Act.\n  I bring this to the attention of the Senate. That debate will be \ncoming up hopefully fairly quickly. I must say, ever since I happened \nto talk about this down in Tampa that day I just checked my e-mail in \nthe Tampa office, I have gotten so many calls and letters to say: Right \non, Bill, right on.\n  We can't even use our computer and our e-mail anymore, because we are \nso cluttered up with e-mail. It is time for the Federal Government to \ndo something about it.\n  We have a crime against mail fraud. The Presiding Officer, as a \nformer U.S. Attorney, knows all about prosecuting mail fraud. If you \ndid that kind of scheme I just showed you in today's Orlando Sentinel, \nand instead you used the mails and you sent out 100 letters like this \nsame thing, posing as a department store, saying we have reason to \nthink your credit card has been stolen, give us your card number so we \ncan correct this--of course, it is a deceptive scheme; it gets your \ncredit card number so they can charge--you would prosecute under the \nmail fraud statute. But that is sending out a hundred letters--my \ngoodness gracious--through e-mail--snap, just like that, 175 million e-\nmail messages. Think how many people are going to bite and how many \ncredit card numbers are going to be stolen--just in this particular \ncase.\n\n  That is why we have to give them strong penalties in the bill that is \ngoing to be considered by the Senate. That is why we have to be able to \nhook it as one of the elements that triggers the RICO Act--the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act--so that the \nprosecutors can go after the assets of the organized criminal thug \nring.\n\n\n                           Prescription Drugs\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I came to talk today about this \nprescription drug bill. I certainly support this bill, and I am going \nto vote for it. I commend the chairman and the ranking member for how \nthey have crafted this legislation. I commend the Finance Committee for \nhow it has put it together. If I had my druthers, we would have passed \nthose amendments that we would have had in the last few days that we \ndidn't pass because, clearly, giving an option for seniors to go \ndirectly through Medicare for a prescription drug benefit is, in my \nopinion, keeping faith with the seniors. So many of us have already \nsuggested that we wanted to modernize Medicare from a 1965 health \ninsurance system funded by the Federal Government for senior citizens--\nmodernize that to the year 2003.\n  If you were writing Medicare today instead of in 1965, 38 years ago, \nwould you include a prescription drug benefit? Of course you would \nbecause the miracles of modern medicine, the miracles of prescription \ndrugs so often today will take care of the ailments and the chronic \nproblems; so that when the Medicare system was set up in 1965--38 years \nago--the state of the art of medical care was centered around a \nhospital and doctors. But hospitals and doctors have new tools today. \nSome of those tools, by the way, that I will share with you sometimes \ncome directly out of America's space program. They are the spinoffs of \ntechnology. Some of them have come out of the State of the Presiding \nOfficer at the Marshall Space Flight Center. I am telling you, there is \nsome miracle equipment that has come out of the space program.\n  Part of the miracle of modern health care is prescription drugs. For \nthat, I give great commendation to NIH, to our universities, and all \nthe research institutions, and to the research departments of the \npharmaceutical companies that are producing these new wonder drugs of \ntoday. But we ought to be modernizing Medicare with a prescription drug \nbenefit that is a part of Medicare. The problem is, we cannot get the \nvotes to do that.\n  So what the Finance Committee has done is fashion a plan whereby you \ncan offer in the private sector, through a preferred provider \norganization--a PPO is a managed care kind of concept--and they will \nprovide it or the senior citizen can go and get two separate drug\n\n[[Page S8288]]\n\nplans and directly there. But if they fail, there is a backup of the \nFederal Government doing its own prescription drug plan, according to \nthe elements in the outline of what they have done in the legislation.\n  I would prefer it if a senior citizen could, in fact, go to the \nprivate sector or have the choice of getting their prescription drugs \ndirectly from Medicare. That would be the senior citizen's choice. But \nwe could not get the votes for that amendment.\n  So we are proceeding on with the bill, and I am certainly going to \nsupport the bill because it is a major first step along the way to \nproviding prescription drugs for senior citizens. We need to keep faith \nwith those seniors. This is what a lot of us have talked about and said \nwe wanted to do, and this is a first major step to do it. Since the \nSenator from Montana has come back in, I have been commending him on \nthis package saying that I wish we had adopted a couple of the \namendments that were offered over the last couple of days, but that I \nsupport the package. I commend him. This is a major first step on the \nroad to keeping faith with our seniors. I appreciate what he has done.\n\n  I would like to take a few moments to critique some parts of the \nbill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before the Senator critiques the bill, if \nthe Senator from Florida will yield, I very much appreciate his kind \nremarks. As virtually every Senator knows, this is not the perfect \nbill. Each Senator would like to change it a little bit. This Senator, \nin particular, would like to have had more money, frankly. We have $400 \nbillion over 10 years. If we had a little more, maybe we could \naccommodate many of the provisions to which the Senator is referring. \nThey are good ideas. But I think this legislation is a good first step, \na chapter in a very long Medicare book. Chapter 1 was in 1965, when it \nwas first enacted. There will be many more chapters as we work to \nimprove Medicare, so that our senior citizens get the benefits they \nrightly deserve.\n  I thank the Senator very much for his working with us. He has given \nus some great ideas. I think over time, in the next couple to 3 years, \nwe will have another chance. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I think the Senator from \nMontana is ``Merlin the Magician'' to finally be able to craft a \npackage that will get through in a bipartisan fashion with a huge \nnumber of votes in this Chamber. And I think if it is appropriate with \nthe ranking member--and I believe parliamentary-wise, it is \nappropriate--I will lay down a couple of amendments now that can be \ntaken up at a separate time, and then I will discuss them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside so the Senator from Florida may \nproceed to offer up to two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 938\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send to the desk amendment \nNo. 938.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 938.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for a study and report on the propagation of \n                            concierge care)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. GAO STUDY AND REPORT ON THE PROPAGATION OF \n                   CONCIERGE CARE.\n\n       (a) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--The Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall conduct a study on concierge care (as defined in \n     paragraph (2)) to determine the extent to which such care--\n       (A) is used by medicare beneficiaries (as defined in \n     section 1802(b)(5)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395a(b)(5)(A))); and\n       (B) has impacted upon the access of medicare beneficiaries \n     (as so defined) to items and services for which reimbursement \n     is provided under the medicare program under title XVIII of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).\n       (2) Concierge care.--In this section, the term ``concierge \n     care'' means an arrangement under which, as a prerequisite \n     for the provision of a health care item or service to an \n     individual, a physician, practitioner (as described in \n     section 1842(b)(18)(C) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395u(b)(18)(C))), or other individual--\n       (A) charges a membership fee or another incidental fee to \n     an individual desiring to receive the health care item or \n     service from such physician, practitioner, or other \n     individual; or\n       (B) requires the individual desiring to receive the health \n     care item or service from such physician, practitioner, or \n     other individual to purchase an item or service.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than the date that is 12 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller \n     General of the United States shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the study conducted under subsection (a)(1) \n     together with such recommendations for legislative or \n     administrative action as the Comptroller General determines \n     to be appropriate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 936\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send another amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 936.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for an extension of the demonstration for ESRD \n                             managed care)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. EXTENSION OF DEMONSTRATION FOR ESRD MANAGED CARE.\n\n       The Secretary shall extend without interruption, through \n     December 31, 2007, the approval of the demonstration project, \n     Contract No. H1021, under the authority of section \n     2355(b)(1)(B)(iv) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, as \n     amended by section 13567 of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of \n     1993. Such approval shall be subject to the terms and \n     conditions in effect for the 2002 project year with respect \n     to eligible participants and covered benefits. The Secretary \n     shall set the monthly capitation rate for enrollees on the \n     basis of the reasonable medical and direct administrative \n     costs of providing those benefits to such participants.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will tell you just very \nbriefly about these amendments, and I want to make comments basically \non the underlying bill. I think these amendments are such that it is my \nunderstanding that they may be accepted--perhaps even in a managers \npackage. But one of them involves extending the Federal role in the end \nstage renal disease demonstration project, which is a project that we \nhave in Florida. I will speak about it later. It will stand on its \nmerit.\n\n  The other is amendment No. 938 to require a GAO study to examine the \nextent of how concierge care has been expanded in the country and what \nwe need to do about it. I am working with Senator Breaux on this \nparticular amendment.\n  What is happening is we have a Federal health insurance system for \nsenior citizens that is available to all senior citizens if they \nqualify on the age. Lo and behold, a practice is arising around the \ncountry where some physicians are saying: I will no longer serve you \nunless you pay me a dollar amount per patient per year--in the case of \nsome physicians in Florida, $1,500 per year. At the same time they are \ncutting the number of patients they see, they are saying: For this \n$1,500 entrance fee that you pay, we are going to give you specialized \ntreatment, same day appointments, hot towels; you can call us at any \ntime of the night--all of that personalized concierge care for $1,500 a \nyear per patient. But if you do not pay us that, you cannot be my \npatient, and, oh, by the way, I still want to receive reimbursement \nfrom the Federal Government for the reimbursable services I am giving \nto you, the senior citizen.\n  That was not how Medicare was set up. Medicare was set up for all \nsenior citizens, not just those who can pay $1,500 a year to see the \ndoctor.\n  This concierge care popped up here and in several other States. This \namendment is to require a GAO study to examine the extent to which this \nmight ultimately be a destructive force against the Medicare \nreimbursement system and the entire Medicare system because the logical \nconclusion of this kind of concierge care is we would have completely \ntwo tiers of service within Medicare. We would have those who could pay \nthe $1,500 per year, and, by the way, that is just in one case. There \nis another case in California where they are having to pay $24,000 per \nyear per patient just to be under the care of that particular doctor. \nSo we would\n\n[[Page S8289]]\n\nhave two tiers under Medicare. We would have the Medicare recipients, \nthe senior citizens, who qualify, and they would pay that money and \nwould go to certain doctors, and the doctors who were not going to \ncharge that, who would be left over, would get all the rest of the \nMedicare patients who could not afford to pay the fee.\n  That is not the way Medicare was set up, and that is not how Medicare \nis intended to deliver health care services to senior citizens that are \npaid for by the Federal Government.\n  Instead of just coming in here and breaking down the door, I took the \nsuggestion of the senior Senator from Louisiana. In this bill, he has a \nspecial provision having to do with speciality hospitals, but he first \ndid a GAO study to show the extent to which those speciality hospitals \nwere being utilized. That became the basis for changing the law. That \nis what I will be doing by offering this amendment No. 938 which we \nwill discuss at a future time.\n  I inquire of the Senator from Montana--I am just getting ready to get \ninto my comments about the bill--does the Senator from Montana know of \nsomebody else who wishes to speak and, if so, can he give me an \nindication of how long he would like me to speak? I yield to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Florida how long he \nwishes to entertain us and to educate us.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. With the enormity of this subject, Mr. \nPresident, I could go all the way from 5 minutes to 55 minutes. So what \nis the pleasure of the Senator from Montana?\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I was expecting a longer speech, frankly. I suggest the \nSenator speak for, say, 10, 15 minutes or whatever time the Senator \nwishes to take.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield to the distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for scheduling this afternoon, in 15 or 20 \nminutes I am going to speak for 20, 25 minutes, and then Senator Byrd \nis going to come over later as well. We have plenty of time, but if \nsometime in the next 30 minutes or so I may have the floor for 20 or 30 \nminutes, that will be helpful.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank my colleagues. I was actually willing \nto step down and let the distinguished majority leader go ahead. He is \nvery kind.\n  I would like to point out some critiques. I want it nailed down that \nI support this package. I think we can improve it, but at the end of \nthe day, if we have not been able to improve it by the amendment \nprocess, it is my intention to vote for it because I think it is a \nmajor step in the right direction. Over the course of time, we are \ngoing to be able to add to the law and improve it so that at the end of \nthe day, perhaps in a year or two down the road, we are going to have a \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare for senior citizens.\n  This legislation does many things, not the least of which is the most \ncomprehensive attempt at expanding one of our Government's most \nsuccessful experiments, this Medicare Program.\n  Today, almost 80 percent of our seniors take at least one \nprescription drug a day and over half of them take an average of four \nprescription drug medications each day. Prescription drugs are \nresponsible for keeping people out of the hospital and helping them \nmaintain their health. Spending money on medicines not only reduces the \nsuffering of millions but it also reduces their health-care-related \ncosts.\n  Let me give an example. There is a lady named Ms. Rita Salls from \nSebring, FL. She takes at least 12 medications each day and sometimes \neven more than that. Those medicines are what allow her to continue to \nlive on her own, an independent life.\n  Like many of our colleagues, when we first ran for the Senate, we \ntalked to our constituents--and we still do--and we said we were going \nto try to enact this prescription drug benefit under Medicare.\n  What do many of our seniors without the prescription drug coverage \ndo? They have to skip doses to make their prescriptions last longer or \nthey have to spend less on food. Can you imagine in the year 2003 in \nthe United States of America that there are senior citizens who are \nhaving to make a choice between food or their medicine because they do \nnot have enough money? In some cases, they are completely unable to \nfill a prescription solely based on its cost. The need for this benefit \nhas never been clearer.\n  While this legislation is certainly an exceptional effort to fulfill \nour promise for a prescription drug benefit, it does fall short in some \ncategories.\n  My first concern is as it relates to the provider of the drug \nbenefit. Given Medicare's mixed experience with Medicare HMOs--what we \ncall Medicare+Choice; it is an HMO created under Medicare-- we have not \nhad too good of an experience with that because those Medicare HMOs \nhave folded up and are cancelling out beneficiaries all across the \ncountry, particularly in rural areas such as Montana, and many of the \nrural counties in my State. How do I know that? Before I came to the \nSenate, I was the elected State insurance commissioner of Florida and I \nsaw in county after county, as the regulator, where I had to go beg, \ncajole, and wheedle when a Medicare HMO stopped serving a rural county \nto get another Medicare HMO to come in and fill that role.\n\n  Should these companies come in, I still believe there should be the \nGovernment's fallback provision in the bill. It is certainly a very \nimportant provision. I wish it were in place permanently as the first \noption a senior could go to, but that amendment from a couple of days \nago did not pass. In other words, I believe all seniors should have the \noption of receiving their drug benefit through Medicare rather than \njust through the private insurer. I think that ought to be the senior \ncitizen's choice and yet that is not the case with the bill.\n  Another worry I have is how this plan is going to treat low-income \nseniors. In my State of Florida, over one-third of the seniors have \nincomes low enough to qualify for the low-income benefit of this \nlegislation. This is especially true in Florida because the State \npharmacy assistance plan in the State of Florida provides only a very \nlimited benefit and is only available to a very small fraction of low-\nincome seniors in Florida.\n  This Grassley-Baucus compromise provides premium and deductible \nassistance to seniors well above what Medicaid is required to do and \nwhat my own State is doing, but under the bill, some low-income seniors \nwill not be eligible for the Medicare benefit because the plan insists \nthat they continue to receive their benefit through Medicaid. \nFurthermore, beneficiaries will be subjected to an asset test in order \nto qualify for the benefit, which could deter some eligible \nbeneficiaries from seeking the assistance in the first place.\n  Another grave concern I have is the coverage gap faced by the seniors \nunder this legislation. Beneficiaries with drug costs in excess of \n$4,500 a year will find themselves continuing to pay a premium while \nnot getting any benefit until the catastrophic provision kicks in, \nwhich is around $5,700. It is as if we are penalizing the sicker \nbeneficiaries who depend on more prescription drugs.\n  Assistance to seniors should focus on individuals like Mr. and Mrs. \nLomax of Longwood, FL. Mr. Lomax is 67 years old. He cannot afford to \nquit working because he and his wife would not be able to afford their \nprescription drug costs. So he continues to provide them coverage \nthrough his employer, because the cost of his medications add up to \nover $600 per month. Under this bill, Mr. Lomax would be required to \npay over $4,200, over 40 percent of his annual drug costs.\n  Another critique I would make of the bill is it fails to address an \nissue not only affecting our Nation's seniors but anyone who has to \npurchase prescription drugs. I have talked to my former chairman of the \nFinance Committee and now the ranking member, Senator Baucus, about \nthis. We realize these are the hard realities because nothing in the \nbill today guarantees that when Medicare or private plans on behalf of \nMedicare purchase their drugs from manufacturers that they get the very \nlowest possible price. If taxpayers are going to have to face the long-\nterm burden of ensuring a viable prescription drug benefit for years to \ncome, we should make certain the Government uses its purchasing power \nto the best of its ability.\n\n  That is a question that no doubt will be answered over the years as \nthis new bill becoming law begins to be added to and perfected over the \ncourse of time.\n\n[[Page S8290]]\n\n  In addition to expanding coverage of drugs in Medicare, this \nlegislation does include some very worthy provisions aimed at easing \nthe States' increasing burden of providing care to our Nation's \nimmigrants. Immigrants and Florida, the two so often go hand in hand \nbecause of the desirability of coming to this wonderful country of \nours. Where do so many of them come? To the shores of the State of \nFlorida.\n  In this bill, by allowing the States the option to cover legal \nimmigrant children and pregnant women through Medicaid and the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, States will finally be able \nto obtain Federal dollars to offset the States' costs for immigrants. \nSimilarly, increases in Federal reimbursement for providers of \nemergency treatment to undocumented aliens is welcome.\n  Florida ranks fifth among States with the highest population of \nillegal immigrants. Providing uncompensated care to illegal and legal \nimmigrants is a major and growing problem for many of our hospitals in \nFlorida. This provision in the bill will go a long way in helping to \nease that situation.\n  Another major component of this proposal would increase funding to \nrural health care providers by more than $30 billion over the next 10 \nyears, but I must say I am troubled by the way this bill pays for \nnecessary increases in provider reimbursements by passing along their \ncosts to Medicare's beneficiaries. They are already struggling to pay \nfor their share of the health care costs. Their share of these costs \ncan often exceed 45 percent of the total. So I think it is \nunconscionable to think that as we ask them to pay an additional $35 \nper month for drug coverage and an increased deductible we would ask \nthem to pay for things they have not had to pay for in the past such as \nnew deductibles and copayments on such things as outpatient lab \nservices.\n  Furthermore, we are again threatening the ability of some of our \nsickest beneficiaries to receive the care they so desperately need. \nWhile we all agree that the method for payment of anticancer agents \nshould be reformed, reducing the reimbursement from 95 to 85 percent of \nthe average wholesale price without appropriate increases in payments \nfor essential patient services could further jeopardize access to \nquality cancer care in a physician's office setting.\n  I, along with my colleagues, will do all we can over the course of \nthe next several days to improve this legislation with amendments \nensuring that the Government maximizes its purchasing power and \nensuring a beneficiary's coverage is stable. They will, hopefully, be \naccepted. It will strengthen this legislation.\n\n  This is a starting point. We must also ensure that is a solid \nfoundation for a comprehensive benefit that fulfills our promises to \nAmerica's seniors.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I know the people in Florida very much appreciate the \nhard work the Senator does. Part of that is on behalf of senior \ncitizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on this Friday we have had a number of \nspeakers come forward over the course of the morning and the afternoon \non the topic of how best to improve Medicare, strengthen Medicare, \npreserve it, and build upon what we have learned in the past to bring \nit up to date and to give seniors the opportunity to receive the type \nof health care available today of which most people in the private \nsector are able to take advantage but to which, because of the \nstructure of Medicare today, seniors simply do not have access in a way \nthey really deserve: Things such as prescription drugs, which, as we \nheard debated 20 or 30 minutes ago by the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida, are so absolutely critical to the health care toolbox, to the \narmamentarium out there today to take care of seniors and individuals \nwith disabilities to prevent more serious illness for people on those \npills that keep their blood pressure down at a reasonable level, that \nprevent debilitating strokes, prevent massive heart attacks; if they do \nnot take that pill, those acute diseases that become chronic diseases \noccur, or episodic acute diseases occur.\n  There is such a high barrier for prescription drugs that they are \nless likely to reach out and get the drugs. The whole purpose is to \nreverse the burden in a way that is sustainable over time. As \npoliticians, we want to help people, we want to help them now. But if \nwe do it in a shortsighted way, we can create bigger problems for \npeople 3 years out, 5 years, 10, 15, 20 years out, or at this time we \nmust think 30 years out.\n  In the next few minutes, I will again step back and look at where we \nare in health care, what we are doing. Then we will be able to come \nback in next week and look at a lot of the individual amendments. They \ncan be very technical. They involve a lot of terms that are unfamiliar \nto even a lot of Senators but also to the public at large.\n  In the next few minutes, I want to take this big-picture look and \nintroduce the demographic challenge that should be the backdrop for all \nof our discussions when we look at health care for seniors, for \npromises we are making today that we are writing into legislation to \nmake sure we are doing it in a way that can be sustained over time. \nThis is talking to seniors but, even probably more directly, to the \nnear seniors and to the younger generation because it is their health \ncare we are talking about. It is their money we are using, in large \npart, to pay for the health care security for seniors today. Thus, I \nthink we have to look at it in this intergenerational way.\n  In the big picture, the U.S. health expenditures for the dollars \nspent in 2001 and 2002 are similar, although this chart shows the most \nrecent data for today of all health care dollars spent in the United \nStates of America. The red on the chart is public expenditures, public \nprograms--what is government--and the blue is the private sector. It is \nan interesting chart because it shows about half of the health care \ndollars run through government programs--Federal, State, and local--and \nhalf of the health care dollars are spent in the private sector.\n  What we have the opportunity to do now is marry these two with \npublic-private partnerships, to take care of one segment of these \nhealth care dollars, and that is this 17 percent, this bright red 17 \npercent--almost a quadrant--but 17 percent of the overall health care \ndollar which is spent on and for and by senior citizens and individuals \nwith disabilities, about 40 million people. That is 17 percent.\n  What we were concentrating on the last week, really the last several \nmonths, is this part of the pie. Medicaid, which is lower income, other \nFederal programs, other State and local programs are the other public \nprograms--46 percent of the overall pie.\n  What we are going to be doing is capturing the very best out of the \nprivate sector, in terms of health care delivery, technology, \nprescription drugs--which, remember, are not up in this red sector--\ncapture the best of the private sector with the best of the public \nsector, marry the two, and thereby give the seniors who fall into this \nsector here, this piece of the pie, better health care, better value \nthat can be sustained over time. We are capturing the best of this \nsection with the best of this section, marrying public and private.\n  It is a new concept. Traditionally, Medicare has been command and \ncontrol, Washington, DC-based: we dictate; we say what is in it, what \nis not in it. We dictate, micromanage the decisions. The problem with \nhealth care today, with the advances in health care delivery, with the \nnew innovations, with the human genome project, with the new \ntechnology, it is not being adopted into this sector. To me, that is \nsort of the big picture I want to begin with.\n  The challenge, if we are looking long term, if one of the goals of \nwhat we do now is we must be responsible for the future, we need to \nrecognize what the demographic backdrop is. What does the future look \nlike? The future looks different now, from a demographic standpoint--\ndemographic being numbers of people, ages of people, genders of people. \nThat is what I am talking about when I am talking about demographics. \nThat backdrop is changing more radically than ever, than at any time in \nthe history of this country. I will tell you why shortly. It is \nchanging in several ways.\n  This chart is the number of Medicare beneficiaries. That 17 percent I \njust showed you was of the overall health care dollar, how many people \nfall in that section of that pie chart. Just look at two bars on this: \nThis is the year 2000; this is in the year 2030. The important thing is \nthere are 40 million beneficiaries--beneficiaries just means seniors, \npeople who are in the program in the year 2000. You see it goes up, but \njust jump over and you can see it is 77 million in the year 2030. It \nseems like a long time from now, but it is not. That is not very long \nfrom now. But from this green bar to this green bar is a doubling in \nthe number of seniors.\n  Historically, we did not have that. I will show why we had this \ndoubling that we have to face up to if we are responsible legislators.\n  No. 1 is the baby boom. I love this chart because it is the way I \nview the baby boom. You see, it really is a baby boom. This, along this \nY axis, is births per woman. You can see how it has changed over time. \nThis is 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000--so we are about where \nthis dotted line is now.\n  You can see that we had this baby boom, this fertility curve, this \nincrease in population right after 1945, up to about 1970, with the \npeak around 1959, 1960. You just add 60 or 65 years to this part of the \nchart and you quickly get out to 2010, 2015, 2020. That is what we need \nto look for. In other words, this fertility curve, this baby boom, this \nincrease in the population has just moved right across this chart, and \nthis baby boom is going to begin to hit us in about 2008--5, 6, 7 years \nfrom now. It just begins to hit, and then over the next 5, 10, 15 years \nit peaks and then goes back down. But it goes back down over a period \nof about 30 years. So we are talking 2010 out to 2040, 2050.\n\n  The big thing is this anomaly is unprecedented in entitlement \nprograms. This is what we have to prepare for.\n  If this is the Medicare system here, and we are taking care of \nseniors, we are going to have a doubling in the number of seniors. One \nof the reasons is because of the baby boom. The other reason--and I am \nproud of this reason. I think we all are. I am, as a physician, because \nphysicians focus their lives on health care and improving length of \nlives as well as quality of life. This is probably, to me, the easiest \nway of looking at the fact that people are living longer now than they \ndid 10 or 15 years ago, and as we improve health care, as we do better \nwith preventive care and better technology and get people to eat better \nand exercise more, we are going to continue to have these seniors--\nwhich are already doubling in number--live longer. Let's just take an \nexample.\n  This is what it was like in 1940, 1950, 1960. What this means is--\nlet's say I am 65 years old. If I am 65 years old, in the year 2000 I \nwould be predicted to live another 20 years. This is years of life \nremaining at age 65. That is pretty good.\n  Let's say if it were for me, 60 years old, I would be 65 plus 15 is \n80.2 years of age. If I were a woman, I would be able to say I am 65 \nyears of age, and I am\n\n[[Page S8293]]\n\ngoing to live 20 more years. That is pretty interesting.\n  But the good news is that when Medicare started, when you were 65, \nsay, back in 1965, if I was 65 years of age, they would say I am only \ngoing to live 13 more years. But because health care has gotten better \nnow, I am going to live 15 more years, and if I am out in 2030, I am \ngoing to live 17 more years.\n  You have not only more seniors but each one of those seniors is \nliving longer. Thus they are going to be in the Medicare system for a \nlonger period of time than what we would have thought or predicted \nback, either in 1965, the year 2000, or 2030.\n  If we are good, which I think we are in terms of science, technology, \nhealth care, this is going to increase more and more. I don't know \nwhere it is going to stop. Nobody really knows, in terms of how long \npeople will live. But it is interesting, doubling the number of seniors \nbecause of the fertility curve, and each one of those seniors will live \nlonger, of which we are all proud.\n  As an aside, this differential between women and men is pretty \nremarkable. If I am talking to a woman 65 years of age, I say you are \ngoing to live 20 more years. If I am talking to a man, you are only \ngoing to live 15 years. Why is that? There are a lot of hypotheses, and \nwe don't fully know why the difference, why it is. But the point is \nthey both are going to live longer.\n  This is sort of a summary chart. In 1970, we had 20 million people. \nNow we have 40 million people. You are going to see this line break. In \n2030, we are going to have 77 million people. Again, the summary chart: \nA lot more people coming out of the system. That is one component.\n\n  Let's say this is the Medicare system. We say trust fund but it is \nnot really a trust fund like in a bank or the way you envision money \naccumulating and then paying it out. That is just not the way it \nhappens. It is a pay-go system, which means for every senior over here \ntaking out for health care, you have workers--that is most of the \npeople who are probably listening to me right now, people who have been \nworking--who have to support it. The moneys they pay on April 15, or \nwhenever they pay their taxes, go out to support these seniors. The \nmoney we are spending is not money seniors paid in in the past; it is a \npay-go system. That is why this trust fund is not really a trust fund.\n  What is interesting there, not only do we have a doubling of the \nnumber of seniors, but we have fewer workers paying into the system, \nwhich the very next day are paying out to support an increasing number \nof seniors. This is fascinating because it, too, is a part of that \nfertility curve, in the 1940s and 1950s.\n  You will see in 1970 there were 7 of these individuals, 7.3 to be \nexact--paying taxes to support every senior in the system. What is \ninteresting is that in the year 2000 that has come way down. Instead of \nhaving 7 people over here working to support each senior, you have \n3.9--say 4. You have these 4 working. So, therefore, they are having to \nwork twice as hard or pay twice as much for taxes, or work twice as \nmany hours a day than they were working in the past because you have \nfewer of them supporting each worker--for health care.\n  Again, with the fertility boom, as it comes through, this is going to \nfall, by 2030, to only 2 or 2.4 workers, and they are going to have to \nwork that much harder to support whatever we promise and whatever \nhealth care we give to seniors.\n  All of sudden, we saw a huge challenge. We can promise so many things \nright now. We can promise to improve their benefit. We can promise to \ngive them whatever they ask for and what they want. But in doing so, if \nwe fulfill our obligation to both this generation and also the next \ngeneration, we need to do so in a way that can be sustained. We have a \ndoubling of the number of seniors with fewer people paying in, which \ncompounds the challenge of technology and adding benefits and the \nchallenge of looking at chronic care.\n  The product of that is, if we didn't change the law at all--if we \njust kept the Medicare law as it is, which is not realistic because it \nwill change no matter what--we are spending about $226 billion a year \nnow. In 2030--not with this bill--we are going to be spending $448 \nbillion and fewer people are going to be paying into that system to \nexpend the $448 billion that we have today. That is why you will hear \nagain and again from Members such as the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nNickles, and also the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg. They will \nagain and again remind me and our colleagues in our caucus that \nwhatever we do, we need to do it in a way that can be sustained over \ntime. We can't be making promises that cannot be in any way upheld or \nfulfilled in the future by putting an unnecessary and unfair burden on \nthat next generation.\n  This is a chart which I almost hesitate showing. This summarizes and \nputs things in perspective why we have to address Medicare now.\n  No. 1, because seniors deserve better health care security. It is \njust too obvious to me that without prescription drugs, and without \npreventive care and disease management within Medicare today, they are \nnot getting what they deserve.\n  The second issue is as important as Social Security. At some point we \nneed to come back and address Social Security as well as the cost of \nthe demographic shift because of our responsibility to seniors and that \nnext generation.\n  But if we look--this is the financial challenge--at the unfunded \npromises over the next 75 years--I am not going any further out than 75 \nyears, but it is important having gone out 30 years to mention the next \n75 years--if you add up all of the unfunded promises, promises that are \nmade, mandates that are in the law but we haven't determined how to \nbest pay for them; as comparison, the debt held by the public of $3.6 \ntrillion, just for comparison purposes--if we look over the next 75 \nyears for Social Security, what is the shortfall there? That is why we \nhave to come back and address it at some point, and I am not sure when \nit will be. But it is $3.6 trillion, and somebody is going to pay for \nit. We are going to have to address that.\n  But Medicare and health care for our seniors--this is not the bill on \nthe floor; this is today, the current law as it exists--there is a \n$13.3 trillion Medicare shortfall over the next 75 years.\n  That is one of the reasons I think it is important for us to address \nMedicare now, relatively early in this Congress, why we should not \ndelay, why we do need to finish the bill next week, and have the House \ndo the same, have the President sign it as soon as possible, but also \nstress the point that we have to get this thing right. We have to do it \nresponsibly because what we are doing as a product of modernizing \nMedicare is making sure we get the very best value, that it is an \nefficient system, that it is adding a brandnew benefit of prescription \ndrugs which even isn't calculated in this. This $13.3 trillion is \nMedicare as we have it today.\n\n  One of the things we are going to do is add the $400 billion benefit \nover a 10-year period--not 75 but a 10-year period on top of this \nalready $13.3 trillion Medicare shortfall. We are going to add a \nbenefit on top of that. That is why we can't just add a benefit on top \nwithout addressing Medicare overall. That is why you heard the \nPresident from day 1 say yes, we have to have prescription drugs; yes, \nwe have to improve the nature of the benefits; but at the same time we \nhave to address reform because not to do so would be irresponsible as \nthe leader of the United States of America. And the same thing goes on \nin this body today.\n  That is why the bill we have brought to the floor is not just a \nMedicare package and not just a bill that says let us promise pills to \nseniors, but says, yes, those medicines are critical and vital, but at \nthe same time we have to address the overall integrated delivery of \nhealth care which, I would argue, allows us to have a more efficient \nsystem, a system that has more value, and a system that allows us to \naddress, as we look out to the future, this huge unfunded promise we \nhave made in the past.\n  When we are in the middle of talking about each of these individual \namendments and the technical nature of materials, it is hard to back up \nand look at some of these principles that underlie doing this thing \nright--doing it in a bipartisan way, allowing ample time, as we have \nhad all week, to fully debate the amendment process.\n  This is the issue Senator Dorgan talks about a lot, and he talks \nabout\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\nthe Finance Committee a lot. And we are beginning to talk about it a \nlot on the floor. I don't want to get into the debate, but it will be a \nbackdrop for much of the discussion next week.\n  If you look at Medicare beneficiaries and a pie chart of 40 million \npeople, all of those 40 million people are not very expensive in what \nthey actually expend in terms of health care expenditures.\n  Over here, these are all the beneficiaries. This is 100 percent of \nthe 40 million people. Over here is health care expenditures.\n  The point of this is, if you just focus on the orange, 6 percent of \nall Medicare beneficiaries, about one in two--if this whole body were \nfilled right now, there would be only about five or six of them in the \nwhole body, just six desks, who would be responsible for 50 percent of \nall the money we put in Medicare. Of that $220 billion which we put in, \nonly six desks--you probably see these six desks around me--would be \nresponsible for half of that money. Why? Because they are sicker; they \nhave more chronic diseases.\n  Right now, I think as we say in approaching a program that is \nsustainable that gives very good care, wouldn't it be great to be able \nto identify this 6 percent which accounts for 50 percent of these \nexpenditures--or it could be the top 15 percent or 14 percent--this 6 \npercent, and the 8 percent which accounts for 76 percent--wouldn't it \nbe great if we made absolutely sure that in that population we gave \nthem the very best care possible in terms of prevention, in terms of \nmanagement, in terms of coordination, in terms of an integrated way of \ntaking care of their health care problems and making sure they are \ntreated and cared for?\n  I am absolutely convinced--and I say this having taken care of \nthousands of Medicare patients, which I was blessed to be able to do \nbefore coming here--if we had the data system to be able to identify \nwho they are and had them in the appropriate system to manage their \ncare, they would be better cared for with a better value for the \ndollar.\n  But this is a fascinating chart on which very few people have \nfocused. We will get back to it I think in the debates next week.\n  I mentioned Senator Dorgan. He and I have been discussing the same \ncharts many times. This chart is very similar to the prescription drug \nexpenditures as well. We can focus on certain populations.\n  This is an extension of Senator Dorgan's conversation, and my \nconversation with him. These ``CCs'' are ``chronic conditions.'' A \nchronic condition is something such as congestive heart failure. \nCongestive heart failure is when the heart gets big, it just does not \npump quite as well. It is like water behind a dam; it begins to fill up \nin the body. It fills up in your lungs. You get short of breath and \nswelling in your feet. If you see people who are a little short of \nbreath, typically it is an element of congestive heart failure, if they \nhave heart disease at all.\n  But what is interesting is, if you look at Medicare expenditures, for \npeople who only have one chronic condition such as heart failure, they \naccount for about 4 percent of expenditures. If they have two chronic \nconditions--say, heart failure and diabetes--they would account for an \nadditional 7 percent of expenditures. If they have three or four or \nfive chronic conditions, they account for about 65 percent of \nexpenditures.\n  What I am suggesting is, if you could identify people with five \nchronic conditions or four chronic conditions--and right now, it is \namazing, because in Medicare, in our data base, you really cannot do \nthat, but in a newer system, an up-to-date system, if you could \nidentify these people and then manage them better, to make sure you had \nintegrated care, coordinated care--maybe it would be a phone call from \na nurse once a week, to say: Have you weighed yourself today to see if \nyou picked up any weight? If you have picked up weight, you better come \nin and see us because your lungs are filling up with water. But in a \nnewer system we could catch it before they are hospitalized, and all of \na sudden you have saved the hospitalization or maybe someone's life.\n  That sort of integrated care is just not a part of Medicare today, \nand it should be. Thus, if we better manage these people--and \n``management'' is not a great word. If we better treat them, if we \nbetter care for them, we would cut overall costs and improve the \nquality of care. We simply cannot do that in the Medicare program \ntoday.\n  Thus--and this comes to what this bill is all about--how do you \naddress some of those issues? The bill on the floor allows us to \naddress each of the issues I have mentioned.\n  In 2006, seniors, after having had access to a prescription drug \ncard--and every senior could have a drug card in about 9 months from \nnow. If we can pass this bill next week, get it through conference, \nhave the President sign it, probably 6 to 8 months after that every \nsenior could have a prescription drug card that would give them some \nbenefit in terms of lowering the cost of their prescription drugs. That \nis a pretty good, immediate response, if we can get this bill through \non time.\n  In the year 2006, though, the prescription drug card begins to be \nreplaced by three options an individual senior would have. They could \nkeep what they have today--traditional Medicare--and with that they \ncould have access to an insurance drug package; No. 2, they could take \nadvantage of Medicare+Choice, which is a coordinated care, integrated \ncare type program; or, No. 3, they could take advantage of a PPO, which \nis an integrated health care, coordinated health care delivery system \nthat includes prescription drugs, preventative care, and that chronic \ndisease management.\n  Thus, as we look ahead in designing this program--and this, as shown \non the chart, is sort of the general outlay of the bill itself--you \nwill hear about a lot of amendments over the next week, and those \namendments will talk about, for example: Well, what about the size of \nthe drug package in each? A decision in the bill was made to have this \nsame drug benefit under traditional Medicare and Medicare+Choice, \nwhich, by the way, has 5 million people in it. And this other program \nhas 35 million people in it today. This prescription drug benefit is \nthe same.\n\n  Some people might say: Well, we ought to change the benefit. Some \npeople will say: Let's make sure this is a truly competitive model that \ntakes advantage of what we know in the private sector works, which has \nmore market-based principles--yes, that is highly regulated by the \nGovernment--to make sure those benefits are delivered; and those \nbenefits have to be a part of each PPO that comes forth and bids, but \nlet's make this more competitive. And Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday \nwe are going to hear a lot about how to make this a really up-to-date \nsystem and as competitive as possible, which would improve quality and \nimprove the value of each dollar put into the system.\n  So you will hear about market-based competition. It will be maximized \nin this area, as shown on this part of the chart. Again, people will be \nable to keep exactly what they have today. So I say to seniors who are \nlistening, you do not have to worry about things being taken away from \nyou or the question: What is Government going to do? Are they going to \ncome in and take away benefits you already have? No. You are going to \nget access to additional benefits, even if you stay in traditional \nMedicare. You will be able to take advantage, like 5 million people do, \nof an HMO.\n  People start running when they hear that word HMO, but let me tell \nyou, 5 million people who are in these HMOs are pretty pleased because \nthey have access to prescription drugs today or people can choose this \nPPO model, which is the model that works best in the private sector \ntoday. It is the model most people who have employer-sponsored \ninsurance today have. It definitely is the model of the future because \nof this continuity of care delivered in a seamless way as we look to \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, I am going to cover just one more little bit different \nconcept as a preface to what we will be talking about next week in the \nMedicare debate, and that is on what is called the donut. Now I am \ncoming back down from 35,000 feet to about 5,000 feet to look at what \nwill be one of the hot topics and an issue that will be debated in \nterms of what is called a gap or a donut. I guess those are the two \nwords that are used mainly.\n  The concept is that people will get a lot of assistance, especially \nif you are\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\nunder the poverty level or under 160 percent of the poverty level. \nThere is no donut for 44 percent of all seniors. There is no gap. There \nis no donut. I will come back and talk a little about what the donut \nis. If you are under 160 percent of poverty--that is about $16,000, \n$17,000, if you are married, of income every year as a senior--there is \nno donut, there is no gap.\n  This chart I show you deals with those individuals who are below 100 \npercent of the Federal poverty level. What this chart shows, in the \nblue, is the percent of your total expenses in a year that is paid for \nby the plan. The green is the amount that is paid for by the \nbeneficiary.\n  So if you have $1,000 of drug expenses a year, and you are below the \npoverty level, you will have almost 98 percent of all of your drug \nexpenses paid for by the plan, and you will pay $25--very little. It is \na very generous benefit.\n  I will have one more chart that goes above the poverty level to 160 \npercent of the poverty level.\n  If you have $2,000 of expenditures in drugs a year, again, if you are \nbelow the poverty level, the plan pays for 98 percent of all your drug \nexpenses. If you have $3,000 of expenditures a year, again, the plan \npays for about 95 or 98 percent of all your drug expenses. You can see \nthat goes up. If you have $7,000 of drug expenditures a year, again, \nthe plan pays about 98 percent of that.\n  And this is one of the beauties. Remember, none of these people get \nprescription drug coverage through Medicare today. I do not know what \nit is below the poverty level, how some of them get it through other \nplans. In fact, if you look at all seniors, about two-thirds do get \nsome element of prescription drug coverage somewhere. And we have to be \nvery careful because we do not want to have everybody coming to a \nGovernment program.\n  But the point I want to make is, if you are under the poverty level \nor indeed at 160 percent of the poverty level, the plan itself is very \ngenerous. We are going to hear on the floor next week the question: Is \nthat too generous? Or maybe it is not generous enough. It is hard to \nargue it is not generous enough, given the fact that 44 percent of all \nseniors are going to have no donut and get a very generous benefit, and \neverybody is going to get a benefit.\n  Referring to the same chart again, for example, this shows, for an \nindividual who has $1,000 of drug expenses or $2,000 of drug expenses, \nhow much they are going to pay for those prescription drugs. So whoever \nis listening to me right now, they would be able to know how much they \ncould spend on drugs every day and know where they are going to fall.\n  For example, if you were a heart transplant patient of Bill Frist 10 \nyears ago, you would have probably had about $7,000 in drug expenses \nevery year. Every time I transplanted a heart or a lung, the patient \nwould have anywhere from $5,000 to $7,000 of drug expenses every year. \nDrugs are expensive and can take your life savings. For every patient I \nhad who had a heart or a lung transplant, they did not go through that \nprocedure without expending $6,000 to $7,000 on prescription drugs \nevery year.\n  Most of them are seniors. That is one of the reasons why this plan \nmeans so much to me. I have a personal interest in that these are \npeople whose faces I have looked into and eyes I have looked into over \nthe years.\n  Let me go above 160 percent and you see it looks different. What I \nwant to focus on, of the 40 million people out there, of the seniors, \nthe 50 percent richest, 50 percent highest income people. They still \nget a lot of help. Just graphically look at it. Remember in blue and \ngray here is the percent paid by the plan. This is 100 percent at the \ntop. So you can see it is anywhere from 30 to 50 percent coming all the \nway through. This chart, you can look at it all sorts of different \nways, but the point I want to make, in the bill, when we talk about \ngap, it doesn't mean you will be left out. If you fall into what is \ncalled a donut or gap, you benefit all the way up until that level, and \nthen through that gap you pay for your prescription drugs. But then at \nthe other side of the gap you are picked up again.\n  Thus, at the end of a year, what happens? The gap is right about \n$4,500 to about $5,800. I am looking to my staff member because the \nfigures have changed a little bit as we tried to narrow the gap over \nthe last several weeks. But that means the gap is somewhere right \naround $4,500 to this bar here, this is $6,000. But, remember, if you \nare an individual and you are listening to me and you have $4,500 in \nexpenditures, still about 45 percent of all your expenditures are paid \nfor by the plan. And if you are in the gap, the so-called donut, it is \nlittle bit less, it is a couple percentage points less, but still right \nat 42 percent, at $5,000. And then if you are into $6,000, you are back \nup around 40 percent, $6,000, $7,000, $8000, coming up. The reason why \nI show this chart is because I have seniors calling me now and saying: \nWhat about if I am in the hole of that donut? What about if I am in \nthat gap? Does that mean the Government excludes me, doesn't help me? \nThe answer is absolutely no. You just pick where you are on here and \ngraphically you can see that these are for the wealthiest seniors, and \nthe bar graph I showed you for the poor. I am showing you the two ends, \nthe two extremes. But above 160 percent of poverty, this is the gap \nright here. So still you are getting huge assistance at the end of the \nyear.\n  Again, probably the best example, because the gap is between $4,500 \nand $5,800, would be the $6,000 that at the end of the year you are in \nthe gap between $5 and $6,000, and you are still getting about 40 \npercent of your drugs paid for. Some people say it should be higher; \nsome people say lower. The point is, on the gap itself, it doesn't mean \nyou are left out in the cold. Over time we tried to minimize it and \nkeep it as small as possible.\n  We will come back to that later. It is a concept that takes a little \nbit of time to explain. Depending on who is arguing which side in terms \nof the gap, there will be some, as you try to make the point, who make \nthat gap sound real bad. Others might minimize it. The reality is, you \nwill be helped wherever you are, even if you are in the gap. You will \nget huge help as you go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8295-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, an issue outside of Medicare but one that \nhas been in the news, one that deserves more attention, is an issue \nthat is changing a little bit, like the demographics I just went to, in \nan unprecedented way. That is childhood obesity. This is flipping from \nMedicare, where we are talking about seniors, all the way to the other \nend of the spectrum as we look at an epidemic occurring in children \nthat we have never seen before. It is a medical issue. It is an issue I \nfirst became aware of as a physician, but it has gotten worse. Many of \nus saw the release by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nfrom this past weekend which led me to want to restate the importance \nof addressing this issue.\n  Historically childhood obesity was thought of in moral terms, there \nwas an unfair stigma to obesity.\n  But what we have become aware of in medical science only recently, \nand that is childhood obesity is a serious condition that has \nimplications not just to the child as a child or as an adolescent but \nhas grave lifelong complications. The kids, are not just at risk for \ndeveloping bad habits but now we know they are at risk of adult \ndiseases, of developing evolving adult diseases because of that \nchildhood obesity, because of that inactivity.\n  It was last weekend, Friday or Saturday, that the CDC released \nstatistics\n\n[[Page S8296]]\n\nwhich were alarming even to me. I have been studying this and writing \nlegislation on it. It has to do with a type of diabetes called type 2, \nadult onset diabetes. What this new research showed is that one in \nthree Americans born right now--the date was from the year 2000, but \none in three Americans who are born in the year 2000 will develop \ndiabetes in their lifetime. That is higher than any estimate we have \nknown to date in medical literature. In fact, the American Diabetes \nAssociation had an estimate which was generally accepted broadly, based \non good data. This is three times that. One in three Americans born \nright now will develop diabetes.\n  The good news is that doesn't have to be the case. Things can be done \nthat can reverse that. I am very interested and will continue to focus \non health disparities between gender, men, women, between ethnicity, \nbetween race. And if you look at this data in terms of African \nAmericans and Hispanic children, nearly half will develop diabetes. \nWomen are at higher risk than men, and the disease is striking at \nyounger ages. It used to be a little bit older. Now it is younger and \nyounger that this type of type 2 diabetes strikes.\n  The number of diagnosed cases among the population as a whole has \njumped 50 percent in the last 10 years hitting over 11 million in the \nyear 2000. That figure will skyrocket to 165 percent by 2050, putting \nthe number of Americans with type 2 diabetes at 29 million. The \nimplications of this are severe. Diabetes leads to a whole host of \nchronic illnesses. It is the leading cause of kidney disease, heart \ndisease, amputations, and blindness.\n  The good news is these high rates of diabetes are not inevitable. \nType 2 diabetes can be prevented. That is because the leading cause of \ntype 2 diabetes is obesity and lack of exercise.\n  Walking for 30 minutes a day, losing a few pounds can literally cut a \npersons's risk by more than half.\n  You don't have to be a marathon runner, an iron man participant, but \nfollowing that mantra of moderate exercise and moderate, even minimal \nweight loss can make a huge difference. You can reap huge health \nrewards.\n  That is why Senator Bingaman, Senator Dodd, and I and many others on \nboth sides of the aisle introduced a piece of legislation called the \nINPACT Act, the Improved Nutrition and Physical Activity Act, with \nobesity rates double what they were 30 years ago. And we are learning a \nlot about obesity disease scientifically almost every day. Americans \nneed, more than ever, to be able to make and be encouraged to make \nhealthy decisions about nutrition and physical activity. On the House \nside, I am pleased that Representatives Mary Bono and Kay Granger, \nalong with other cosponsors, introduced companion legislation earlier \nthis year. I will not go into the legislation now.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues who are not cosponsors to look at it so we \ncan pass that in the future. It is a multifaceted approach. It \nemphasizes youth education to jump-start healthy habits early on, to \nprevent a future struggle with weight. It funds demonstration projects \nto find innovative, creative ways of improving eating and developing \ngood exercise habits. It includes rigorous evaluations so we can learn \nwhat works best. What it does not do is outlaw certain ``bad'' foods in \nany way.\n  It doesn't attempt to micromanage or regulate what Americans eat or \ndrink. It does have a modest price tag, consistent with what the \nappropriate role of the Federal Government should be. It doesn't \nattempt to replicate a billion dollar diet industry or the fitness \nindustry that is out there. I know--we all know--there is no single \nsolution to this growing epidemic of obesity. We know it is an \nepidemic. We know it is getting worse. We do know that leadership on \nour part can make a difference, can increase awareness of the serious \nmedical consequences, in particular for children.\n  As the adults in this situation, we can and indeed we must show our \ndetermination to keep them safe by keeping them fit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8296-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOMINATION OF C.

Mr. President, researchers at the University of California \nat Los Angeles published a study in the June issue of Injury Prevention \nentitled ``Buying a Handgun for Someone Else: Firearm Dealer \nWillingness to Sell.'' The study found that more than half of gun \ndealers are willing to ignore or sidestep the law to sell a firearm. \nThe researchers performed their test on 120 dealers in 20 cities. \nAccording to the study, the researchers at UCLA posed as potential \nbuyers giving different reasons for wanting to buy guns. The \nresearchers found that when they said they wanted to buy guns for an \nindividual who needs it, 52 percent of dealers were willing to make the \nsale.\n  In addition to the first round of phone calls, the researchers \nrandomly chose 20 dealers and again posed as prospective buyers. In the \nsecond round of calls, the researchers said they needed to buy guns for \ntheir boyfriend or girlfriend because he or she was not allowed to \npurchase a firearm. In 16 followup calls, the dealers responded with \nunequivocal nos and indicated that the purchases would be illegal. In \nthe remaining four cases, the dealers agreed to sell the guns, but \nindicated to the customer that it was illegal. The researchers also \ninterviewed law enforcement officials who concluded that such sales \nwould amount to illegal straw purchases. A straw purchase involves a \nbuyer with a clean record purchasing a gun for someone who is \nprohibited by law from doing so.\n  Some gun manufacturers and dealers know their practices facilitate \ncriminal access to firearms but they do nothing about it. The Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act, which recently passed the House and has been \nreferred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, would shield such negligent \nand reckless gun dealers and manufacturers from many legitimate civil \nlawsuits. Certainly, those in the industry who conduct their business \nnegligently or recklessly should not be shielded from the consequences \nof their actions. This study contributes further evidence that there \nare some in the gun industry who could potentially avoid responsibility \nfor their business practices under such legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8296-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8296-S8297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BONNY O'NEIL\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the three other \nsitting Senators who have served as chairman of the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, to salute a dedicated public \nservant, Ms. Bonny O'Neil, who is retiring after more than 34 years of \nmeritorious service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  As the senior career official in the Department in charge of the Food \nStamp Program, Ms. O'Neil is responsible for national oversight of \npolicy and operations for a program that\n\n[[Page S8297]]\n\nserves over 20 million people each month at an annual cost of over $20 \nbillion.\n  Ms. O'Neil came to the Department in November of 1968 following \ngraduation from Ohio Wesleyan University where she majored in politics \nand government. She has spent the majority of her career in various \npositions with the Food Stamp Program, with the exception of 6 years \nthat were spent in the agency's Office of Regional Operations. She has \nbeen USDA's main career official on all Food Stamp Program legislation \nsince 1984.\n  Since that time, Ms. O'Neil has worked closely with Congress to help \ncraft food stamp legislation. She has been available at any hour of the \nday, including weekends, to provide her wise counsel. She spent \ncountless hours and worked tirelessly to assist the Agriculture \nCommittee on significant legislation, including numerous farm bills and \nthe landmark 1996 welfare reform bill.\n  In 2003, due to Ms. O'Neil's exemplary work, she received a \nPresidential Rank Award recognizing her contribution to the \nreauthorization of the Food Stamp Program.\n  In her years of Federal service, Ms. O'Neil has overseen many program \nimprovements, including replacing paper coupons with electronic benefit \ndelivery, setting records for payment accuracy and extending many \npolicy options to States to improve customer service.\n  Ms. O'Neil is a native of New Jersey and now resides in Alexandria, \nVA.\n  I commend Ms. Bonny O'Neil for her many years of devoted service to \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture and for the outstanding work she has \ndone throughout her distinguished career. I congratulate her on the \noccasion of her retirement and extend my best wishes for much happiness \nand satisfaction in the years ahead.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I too wish to pay tribute to the \naccomplishments of Ms. Bonny O'Neil and thank her for her many years of \ndedicated service to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Ms. O'Neil has \ndone an outstanding job as the senior career official responsible for \nthe Food Stamp Program. Under her very capable leadership, this \nimportant program has been greatly improved.\n  During the writing of the recent farm bill, which took almost 2 \nyears, Ms. O'Neil worked tirelessly with the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry on the food stamp provisions. Her expertise in \nthis area was invaluable and she was always available to provide \nassistance. After the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 \nwas signed into law, Ms. O'Neil worked to implement the food stamp \nprovisions, including the large number of State flexibility sections \ncontained in the act.\n  The quality of her efforts in this regard are obvious. In the one \nyear since the farm bill passed, numerous States have already \nimplemented or are planning to implement important State options that \nsignificantly improve the Food Stamp Program. As a result, we are \nhelping working Americans in their efforts to enter and stay in the \nworkforce and also making sure that, for millions of American children, \nthe shadow of hunger does not loom so darkly.\n  In always remembering that her job is to serve Americans and to \nbetter their lives, rather than just to run a program from an office in \nWashington, Bonny meets and surpasses the highest ideals of civil \nservice.\n  I thank Ms. O'Neil for her years of service to our Nation and wish \nher well in her retirement.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing my \nsincere gratitude to Ms. Bonny O'Neil for her more than 34 years of \ndevoted service to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As a result of \nher wealth of knowledge and experience with the Food Stamp Program, Ms. \nO'Neil was an invaluable resource to the entire Congress as we crafted \nthe 1996 welfare reform law. Ms. O'Neil's wisdom, patience and good \nhumor were vitally important during the long process of writing that \nlandmark legislation.\n  I thank Ms. O'Neil for her many accomplishments and for her honorable \nservice to this Nation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I, too, join my colleagues today to \nrecognize and honor Ms. Bonny O'Neil upon her retirement from the \nFederal Government. Ms. O'Neil is a true public servant--in all the \nbest sense of that phrase--diligent, hardworking, attentive to details, \nwilling to dig in and truly analyze both sides of each issue, smart, \ntotally honest, a woman of her word, and driven by a desire to do the \nright thing.\n  She is to be commended for serving her Nation and the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture so well. She also served the Congress well by providing \nus with clear and informative answers, and guiding us through complex \nissues. I know that she worked closely with my nutrition counsel Ed \nBarron for many years--both when he was at USDA and while he worked for \nme starting in 1987. On many occasions late at night during a \nconference, I would hear someone say: ``Let's call Bonny to get the \nfacts.''\n  Bonny spent all but six of those years in various positions with the \nFood Stamp Program, where she currently serves as the Associate Deputy \nAdministrator.\n  Ms. O'Neil provided valuable assistance during our work on nutrition \nprograms, food stamp amendments and several farm bills. Anyone who has \never worked on a farm bill knows that it is an extremely complicated \ntask that requires many long hours, including nights and weekends. Her \nattention to detail and willingness to be available at any time, day or \nnight, was most appreciated.\n  I thank Ms. Bonny O'Neil for her distinguished service to the public \ngood and wish her well in her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8297-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Farwest, \nWA. On September 13, 2001, a Sikh cab driver was stopped by a 21-year-\nold man who had hailed his cab. Once inside the cab, the passenger \nverbally accosted the driver accusing him of being a terrorist and that \nhe had no right to be in the United States. The passenger subsequently \ngrabbed the driver around the neck and choked him. Before the driver \nwas able to escape, the passenger punched the victim in the face, \ngrabbed fistfuls of his beard and ripped off parts of his turban. The \nattacker was eventually arrested by a passing police officer.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8297-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ORBIT ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the 140th\n\n[[Page S8298]]\n\nbirthday of the great state of West Virginia. On this day, 140 years \nago, West Virginia was born amidst the conflict of the Civil War.\n  In 1964, I came to West Virginia as a VISTA worker and spent 2 years \nin Emmons, WV. Those 2 years changed my life and I decided to make West \nVirginia my home and make public service my career. Over the years, I \nhave been proud to serve the people of West Virginia in various ways \nand I feel very privileged to represent West Virginia in the Senate.\n  On West Virginia Day, I believe it is important to reflect upon our \nState's rich history, scenic beauty, and its hard-working, independent \ncitizens who truly reflect our State motto, ``Mountaineers are always \nfree.''\n  West Virginia's scenic trails and winding roads make it one of the \nmost beautiful States in the country. Its mountainous terrain, \nbreathtaking scenery, and raging rivers make it perfect for hiking, \nskiing, biking, rafting, fishing, and many other types of recreation. \nWest Virginia truly earns the travel slogan of ``wild and wonderful''.\n  The small farms and growing industry of early West Virginia set it \napart from the tobacco plantations of eastern Virginia. West Virginia \nwas made up of large numbers of immigrants, along with rugged, hard-\nworking frontiersmen and women who instilled the values and ideals that \nWest Virginians embody today.\n  The people of West Virginia remain its greatest asset. West \nVirginians are industrious, ambitious, open, and fun-loving people. \nThey value equality and liberty which tie them to both our State and \ncountry. West Virginians have been some of the most innovative and \ncreative people, contributing to all aspects of American society and \nculture.\n  After his family left Virginia and slavery for a better life west of \nthe mountains, Booker T. Washington was raised in Malden, Kanawha \nCounty, WV, and began working in the salt furnaces at the age of seven. \nHe rose up from slavery and illiteracy to become the foremost educator \nand leader of Black Americans at the turn of the 20th century. He \nfounded the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, later known as \nTuskegee University.\n  Jerry West was born in Cabin Creek, WV and attended West Virginia \nUniversity, where he was a two time All-American basketball player. \nAfter he won a gold medal for the U.S. Olympic team in Rome in 1960, he \nmoved west to play for the Los Angeles Lakers. He excelled throughout \nhis playing career, gaining a reputation as a perfectionist. He helped \nthe Lakers win a championship in 1972 and was elected to the Basketball \nHall of Fame in 1979.\n  Col. Ruby Bradley, a native of Spencer, WV, was the most highly \ndecorated woman ever to serve in the U.S. military. Her military record \nincluded 34 medals and citations of bravery, including two Legion of \nMerit medals, two Bronze stars, two Presidential Emblems, the World War \nII victory medal, and the U.N. Service Medal. She was also the \nrecipient of the Florence Nightingale Medal, the highest distinction \ngiven by the International Red Cross. She was a U.S. Army nurse and a \nPOW for 2 years in the Philippines and was known as the ``Angel in \nFatigues'' at Santo Tomas Internment Camp in Manila. On July 2, 2002, \nshe was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  These three West Virginians are but a few representative examples of \nthe kind of talented, successful, courageous, and independent people in \nour great State. Their lives and stories provide a glimpse into the \nspirit of our State, and they also serve as an inspiration to the young \npeople in our State today.\n  The natural beauty, the people of West Virginia, and their countless \nachievements should be celebrated and remembered every day. As we \nstrive to promote our economic growth, I hope we will also be mindful \nof our responsibilities to preserve what makes our state so special, \nthe values and character of its people.\n  I hope all Americans have the opportunity to experience some of West \nVirginia's beautiful vistas and to meet the wonderful people I have \ncome to know and love throughout my service to West Virginia.\n  I am proud to represent my home State of West Virginia and am honored \nto be able to recognize the 140th anniversary of the Mountain State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8298-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              COMMENDING THE SERVICE OF DANIEL P. BURNHAM\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I would like to take a \nmoment to recognize the dedication and professionalism of Daniel P. \nBurnham, chairman and chief executive officer of Raytheon Co. in \nLexington, MA. On July 1, 2003, Dan will step down from his position \nafter 5 years at the helm at the company.\n  Dan worked tirelessly to make Raytheon the hallmark company it is \ntoday. He came to the company from Allied Signal, bringing his long \nhistory in the defense industry. He introduced a management tool known \nas Six Sigma to improve Raytheon's efficiency. Sigma Six is a testament \nto Dan's ingenuity, allowing the company to decrease waste, and at the \nsame time, increase productivity. Dan's unwavering commitment to \nexcellence is clearly demonstrated in his ability to streamline the \ncompany while preserving its quality.\n  Dan improved customer relations while presiding over a transformation \nand realignment of Raytheon. Under Dan's leadership, the company made \nvaluable acquisitions that increased its capabilities. He concentrated \non customer-focused initiatives and disciplines to ensure that Raytheon \nprovided our men and women in uniform some of the most important \ndefense systems ever developed--many of which were demonstrated \nrecently in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  One example of this is the PATRIOT Missile, manufactured by the \nRaytheon Co. The PATRIOT Missile protected our troops and allies in the \nMiddle East from the threat of Iraqi missiles that our military \nbelieved had the potential to carry deadly chemical or biological \nweapons. The PATRIOT Missile is a valuable tool in our arsenal to \nassure swift victory in Iraq and save countless lives.\n  Under Dan's leadership, Raytheon won a U.S. Navy contract to develop \nand produce the next generation of naval vessels. The DD(X) destroyer, \nwith its cutting edge technology will ensure that the United States \nmaintains its tactical and technological superiority on the high seas.\n  Admiral Vern Clark, the Chief of Naval Operations, described the \nDD(X) destroyer as ``the future of the surface force in the United \nStates Navy.'' The DD(X) will truly be the ship of the 21st century. \nThe Raytheon Co., in no small part, is responsible for providing the \nUnited States Navy with this unparalleled vessel.\n  The Tomahawk Cruise Missile, produced by Raytheon and first used in \nOperation Desert Storm in 1991 has become the premier weapon in the \nU.S. military's conventional arsenal. Launched from the air, or from \nthe sea, Tomahawk has evolved with the Navy's needs and proved \ninvaluable in Operation Desert Fox, 1998, and was once again the weapon \nof choice for ``shock and awe'' in Operation Iraqi Freedom this year. \nUnder Dan Burnham, Raytheon has provided the U.S. Navy with an \nunequaled precision strike capability offering long-range strike \ncapability against heavily defended targets.\n  Although Dan will continue to hold the position of nonexecutive \nchairman for some time, his leadership at the helm of a company he made \nstrong will be dearly missed. I believe the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts and especially, brave men and women of our Armed Services \nhave benefited from Dan Burnham's keen sense of right and relentless \npursuit of excellence.\n  We wish him, his wife, Meg, and his family every success in this new \nand exciting chapter of his life. We bid him ``Fair winds and following \nseas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8298-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8298-S8299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SALUTE TO CHARLESTON'S PHILIP SIMMONS ON HIS 91ST BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my hometown of Charleston, SC, \nmaintains a special relationship with history. Rather than keeping \nhistory in books and museums for occasional viewing, the Charleston \ncommunity\n\n[[Page S8299]]\n\ncelebrates its cultural heritage everyday, be it through our downtown \ndistrict, our vibrant Market, or the skyline full of church steeples.\n  This month, Charleston marks the 91st birthday of a man famous for \nhis dedication to preserving our historic personality. Master \nblacksmith and legendary craftsman Philip Simmons practiced the art \nform of traditional ironwork throughout the 20th century. As he has \nbeen known to say, ``If you see ironwork curve like that, it's either \ntwo hundred years old, or I did it.''\n  Though he retired in 1990, Mr. Simmons now spends most of his time \nensuring the tradition of classical ironwork lives on in South \nCarolina. John Paul Huguley, president of the Charleston School of the \nBuilding Arts, says what separates a craft worker from Mr. Simmons is \nthat Mr. Simmons has a ``love for the trade and the desire to educate \nthe next generation of artisans.''\n  Indeed, that is the case. Mr. Simmons was at the forefront of \ncreating the School of the Building Arts. He now teaches classes there, \nand within 2 years the school will be open full time. Mr. Simmons also \ninstructs at his blacksmith shop, and travels to lecture at southern \nart and building conferences.\n  He has received numerous accolades over the years, including a \n``lifetime achievement award'' from the South Carolina Legislature. He \nreceived a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for \nthe Arts. His work has been displayed in the Natural Museum of American \nHistory, here in Washington.\n  I hope members of this Chamber join me in recognizing and celebrating \nthe birthday of a great man. No question, his role in the Charleston \ncommunity, and beyond, is a standard for artistic excellence and public \nservice that can be an example for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8299-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    225th ANNIVERSARY OF GRAY, MAINE\n\n Ms. COLLINS.

The Gray Celebration Days festival begins today, and I \nam pleased to acknowledge this special event, which celebrates the \nhistory of this outstanding Maine community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8299-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO BETHPHAGE AND MARTIN LUTHER HOMES\n\n Mr. HAGEL.

For a combined 168 years, Bethphage and Martin \nLuther Homes have been dedicated to helping disabled children and \nadults achieve their full potential. Together as Mosaic, will they \nserve 900 Nebraskans.\n  By merging their resources and expertise to form Mosaic, Bethphage \nand Martin Luther Homes will strengthen their reach to the disabled. \nMosaic will support and advocate for more than 3,700 people with \ndisabilities in 16 States, Great Britain, and Latvia. Through \nparticipation in an international alliance called IMPACT, Mosaic will \nwork with the disabled in emerging democracies around the world.\n  Guided by the principle that ``every individual is a person of \nworth,'' Mosaic will continue the work begun by Bethphage and Martin \nLuther Homes by serving disabled individuals at every stage of life.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate and thank Mosaic for its service to the \ndisabled.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8299-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE STATING THAT THE EMERGENCY DECLARED WITH RESPECT TO THE WESTERN \n      BALKANS IS TO CONTINUE IN EFFECT BEYOND JUNE 26, 2003--PM 41\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the Western Balkans emergency is to \ncontinue in effect beyond June 26, 2003, to the Federal Register for \npublication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was \npublished in the Federal Register on June 25, 2002, 67 Fed. Reg. 42703.\n  The crisis constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, or \nassisting, sponsoring, or supporting, (i) extremist violence in the \nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and elsewhere in the Western \nBalkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton \nAccords in Bosnia or United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of \nJune 10, 1999, in Kosovo, that led to the declaration of a national \nemergency on June 26, 2001, has not been resolved. Subsequent to the \ndeclaration of the national emergency, acts obstructing implementation \nof the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 in the former Yugoslav \nRepublic of Macedonia, have also become a concern. All of these actions \nare hostile to U.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to \nthe Western Balkans and maintain in force the comprehensive sanctions \nto respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act and \notherwise revise the Medicare Program to reform the method of paying \nfor covered drugs, drug administration services, and chemotherapy \nsupport services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today for the purpose of \nintroducing the Quality Cancer Care Preservation Act. This bill is \naimed at sending reinforcements to those on the front lines of the war \non cancer. While there are millions of researchers, policy makers, and \nadvocates fighting against cancer around the country, we cannot forget \nthat the real battles are won in the cancer center, where the care is \ndelivered. The war on cancer will be won by nurses, patients, and \nphysicians--one survivor at a time.\n  For years, bureaucrats at Medicare have overpaid for cancer drugs, \nbut underpaid for cost of administering the therapy. Unfortunately, \nmany in Washington have advocated fixing the overpayment for the drugs \nand ignored the underpayment for administering the drug. Well, as any \ncancer patient knows, while cancer therapies may be a miracle, it is \nthe oncology nurses that are the angels. That is why my colleagues and \nI are offering this legislation, which we believe will bring about fair \nreimbursement for chemotherapy drugs and administration.\n  I know that the managers of this bill have committed to work with, \nand are working with the cancer community to find a reasonable solution \nto this issue in the context of the Medicare bill that is on the floor. \nOn behalf of cancer patients around the country, I thank my colleague \nfor their dedication. I also thank my friend from Oklahoma for his \ncomments during the markup of S. 1 and for his dedication to ensure \nproper reimbursement for cancer treatment.\n  My hope in introducing this bill at this time is that it can serve to \nhelp my colleagues in their pursuit of fair reimbursement.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 1304. A bill to improve the health of women through the \nestablishment of Offices of Women's Health within the Department of \nHealth and Human Services; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Women's Health \nOffice Act with my colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe. The Women's Health \nOffice Act authorizes and strengthens women's health offices or \nofficers at Federal health agencies in the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. This legislation will make sure that men and women get \nequal benefit from Federal investments in medical research and health \ncare services.\n  Today, doctors, scientists, Members of Congress, and the American \npublic know that women and men have different bodies and different \nhealth care needs. Diseases like ovarian cancer and endometriosis \naffect only women. High blood pressure is two to three times more \ncommon in women than men. Women are four times more likely to develop \nosteoporosis than men. The number of uninsured women has grown three \ntimes faster than the number of uninsured men over the past 5 years. \nWomen make three-quarters of all health care spending decisions for \nthemselves and their families.\n  For decades, despite these differences, men's health needs set the \nstandard for our health care system and our health care research \nagenda. Women were systematically excluded from medical research \nbecause decisionmakers said that our hormone cycles complicated the \nresults. One study on heart disease risk factors was conducted on \n13,000 men--and not 1 woman. But the results of studies like these were \napplied to both men and women. This neglect put women's health and \nlives at risk.\n  That's why my colleagues and I took action. More than a decade ago, I \nworked with Olympia Snowe, Ted Kennedy, Tom Harkin, and other women in \nthe House to get an Office of Research on Women's Health at the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH. In 1993, I worked with these same \nwomen and Galahads in Congress to make sure that the women's health \noffice would stay at NIH by putting it into law.\n  This office at NIH has made a real difference in how women are \ntreated for certain illnesses. We now know that men and women often \nhave different symptoms before a heart attack. Women's symptoms are \nmore subtle, like nausea and back pain. Knowing these systems means \nwomen can get to the hospital sooner and can be treated earlier. \nThat's turning women's health research into life-saving information.\n\n  I am proud that there are now women's health offices or officers at \nnearly every Federal health agency at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. Like the one at NIH, women's health offices mean that \nwomen's health needs are always at the table. These offices at the Food \nand Drug Administration, (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, (CDC), and the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, (HRSA) make sure women are included in clinical drug \ntrials, reach out to low-income and minority women to make sure they \nare getting vaccines and cancer screenings, and work with health care \nproviders to put research on women's health into practice. Recent \nquestions about the risks and benefits of mammography and hormone \nreplacement therapy remind us that women's health offices are as \nimportant as ever.\n  Right now, many of these offices and the important work they do could \nbe eliminated or cut back without the consent of Congress. That is why \nthis bill is so important. This bill would put women's health offices \ninto our Nation's law books.\n  The Women's Health Office Act does more than protect the status quo. \nIt keeps us moving forward on women's health. It gives women's health \noffices a clear, consistent framework throughout the Department. By \nwriting them into law, it gives women's health offices the stature they \nneed to be strong, effective advocates for women's health within the \nFederal Government. This legislation coordinates women's health \nactivities within each agency, to identify needs and set goals. The \nwomen's Health Office Act centralizes overall coordination throughout \nthe Department of Health and Human services, to clarify lines of \naccountability and chart a clear course on women's health. Finally, it \nauthorizes funding for these women's health offices or officers, to \nmake sure that we put our Nation's priorities in the Federal checkbook \nas well as the Federal law books.\n  This bill has strong bipartisan support. During the 107th Congress, \nthe Women's Health Office Act passed the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions, HELP, Committee unanimously as part of a \ncomprehensive women's health bill that would have expanded women's \nhealth research and improved women's access to health care. It also \npassed the House of Representatives overwhelmingly during the 107th \nCongress. I am disappointed that Congress was not able to pass this \nbipartisan legislation, but I am hopeful that last year's momentum will \nhelp us get to women's Health Office Act signed into law this year.\n  I would like to thank Senator Olympia Snowe for leading the way on \nthis important legislation. As Dean of the Senate women, I will \ncontinue to fight to get this bill signed into law and to make progress \nto improve the health of American women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Conrad, \n        Mr. Breaux, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 1305. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of certain motor vehicle dealer transitional \nassistance; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today with \nSenators Hatch, Baucus, Conrad, Breaux, Snowe, Lincoln and Smith that \nwill provide thousands of our Nations' automobile dealerships with \nneeded additional flexibility to re-invest franchise termination \npayments so that taxes are not unfairly imposed. This legislation has \nbipartisan support in both the House and the Senate and was included in \nthe Chairman's modified mark in last year's small business tax bill.\n  At the end of 2000, GM notified their 2,801 Oldsmobile dealers that \nthey were phasing out the 100 year-old Oldsmobile brand and its \ncomplete line-up of vehicles shortly after the dealers had signed a new \nagreement with a commitment of up to five years on this\n\n[[Page S8303]]\n\nproduct line. With this surprising elimination of the Oldsmobile \nproduct line, many family-owned dealerships are facing an increased \nthreat to the viability of other product lines at their dealerships \nand, in some cases, a complete loss of their business.\n  GM is in the process of compensating these dealers to minimize the \nimpact, as many of these dealers are facing a significant and \npreviously unforeseeable financial burden, through no fault of their \nown, in connection with their efforts to continue in the automobile \nretail business. The legislation we are introducing today seeks to \nlessen that burden by allowing these dealerships up to two years to re-\ninvest their GM's financial assistance payments in other dealership \nproperties and defer payment of taxes under IRC Section 1031. Under \ncurrent law, the dealerships would only have 6 months to identify and \npurchase a similar business or property. This time restriction would \nmake it difficult, if not impossible, for most of these businesses to \nre-invest these payments because, as is the case with most franchises, \nthere are very few businesses or investments that are similar enough to \nbe considered ``like kind'' and hence qualify for tax deferral. The \nfailure to do so results in the owner paying taxes on the payment, even \nif they are ultimately re-invested in a business that would have \nqualified. Since the dealers did not want to forfeit their rights to \nsell Oldsmobiles, this seems like a particularly harsh result.\n  In rural States like New Mexico, family-owned businesses supply the \nmajority of jobs and services in the State. This legislation gives \nthese small businesses an opportunity to continue their family-owned \nbusinesses and, at the same time, give a boost to the local economy. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on advancing this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--For purposes of subtitle A of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986, in the case of a taxpayer who elects \n     the application of this section and who was a party to a \n     motor vehicle sales and service agreement with a motor \n     vehicle manufacturer who announced in December 2000 that it \n     would phase-out the motor vehicle brand to which such \n     agreement relates--\n       (1) amounts received by such taxpayer from such \n     manufacturer on account of the termination of such agreement \n     (hereafter in this section referred to as ``termination \n     payment'') are considered to be received for property used in \n     the trade or business of a motor vehicle retail sales and \n     service dealership, and\n       (2) to the extent such termination payment is reinvested in \n     property used in a motor vehicle retail sales and service \n     dealership located within the United States, such property \n     shall qualify as like-kind replacement property to which \n     section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall apply \n     with the following modifications:\n       (A) Such section shall be applied without regard to \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B)(ii) of subsection (a)(3).\n       (B) The period described in section 1031(a)(3)(B) of such \n     Code shall be applied by substituting ``2 years'' for ``180 \n     days''.\n       (b) Rules for Election.--\n       (1) Form of election.--The taxpayer shall make an election \n     under this section in such form and manner as the Secretary \n     of the Treasury may prescribe and shall include in such \n     election the amount of the termination payment received, the \n     identification of the replacement property purchased, and \n     such other information as the Secretary may prescribe.\n       (2) Election on amended return.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall permit an election under this section on an \n     amended tax return for taxable years beginning before the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Statute of Limitations.--Notwithstanding the provisions \n     of any other law or rule of law, the statutory period for the \n     assessment for any deficiency attributable to any termination \n     payment gain shall be extended until 3 years after the date \n     the Secretary of the Treasury is notified by the taxpayer of \n     the like-kind replacement property or an intention not to \n     replace.\n       (d) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to amounts \n     received after December 12, 2000, in taxable years ending \n     after such date.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am proud to support Senator Bingaman's \nlegislation to ensure equitable tax treatment for Oldsmobile dealers \nimpacted by General Motors' sudden decision to eliminate the Oldsmobile \nfrom its product line. General Motors did agree to partially compensate \nOldsmobile dealers for their loss.\n  Senator Bingaman's bill ensures that like-kind exchange treatment, \nwhich defers the gain on the exchange of business or investment \nproperty until it is ultimately sold, is also available for motor \nvehicle dealers who receive payments when the brand of automobile they \ncarry is eliminated by the manufacturer. The proposal allows such \nreinvested payments to be treated as a like-kind exchange of property \nif exchanged within 2 years from receipt of the payments, thus \ndeferring the tax consequences. As such, the proposal encourages \ncapital investment by recognizing that a longer period of time is \nrequired for dealers to obtain a new franchise or establish a new car \nsales business.\n  The manufacturer, not the automobile dealer, makes the unilateral \ndecision to eliminate vehicle brands. Nonetheless, the dealer is the \none who invests years of hard work in bringing a particular brand to \nhis or her local community. When a manufacturer decides to eliminate a \nbrand, many family-owned dealerships face a complete loss of business \nas well as an increased threat to the viability of other brands located \nin the same facility.\n  Approximately one-third of the 2,801 Oldsmobile dealers across the \ncountry are expected to reinvest the GM payments into another franchise \nor other retail motor vehicle sales business. Many of the 27 Oldsmobile \ndealers in Montana have expressed their interest in reinvesting the GM \npayments they received, if this legislation becomes law. These \nMontanans have been stripped of a source of income at a time when the \neconomy is not too forgiving.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1306. A bill to introduce the efforts of the California Missions \nFoundation to restore and repair the Spanish colonial and mission-era \nmissions in the State of California and to preserve the artworks and \nartifacts of these missions, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing a bill \ntoday that will provide the necessary resources to protect the 21 \nhistoric California missions for future generations. I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by my colleague from California, Senator \nFeinstein.\n  The California missions represent some of our Nation's oldest \nhistorical treasures. Furthermore, they are important illustrations of \nthe historical, cultural and architectural heritage of the State of \nCalifornia. Yet, until recently, little had been done to preserve the \nmissions and their artifacts. They are in dire need of structural \nrepair and restoration.\n  The California missions are the most visited historic attractions in \nthe State, drawing more than 5 million tourists a year. The missions \nalso serve an important role in educating our children in the history \nand the early settlement in California. We must make restoration and \nprotection of the missions a priority.\n  In 1998, the California Missions Foundation, a charitable \ncorporation, was established in the State of California to fund the \nrestoration and repair of the California missions and the preservation \nof the Spanish colonial and mission-era artworks and artifacts of the \nCalifornia missions. The Foundation is leading a statewide campaign to \nraise funds to repair the missions and preserve their precious artworks \nand artifacts. But they need help.\n  My legislation would provide $10 million for the restoration of the \nCalifornia missions through a Department of the Interior grant program \nto be administered over 5 years. These funds would supplement the \nprivate and State funds that have been dedicated to preservation of the \nmissions.\n  The House version of the bill has been introduced by Representatives \nSam Farr and David Dreier. It has the support of a majority of the \nCalifornia congressional delegation. It is my hope that this \nlegislation can move forward quickly, so we can restore and protect \nthese national treasures.\n\n[[Page S8304]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This Act may be cited as the ``California Missions \n     Preservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n        Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The California missions represent some of our Nation's \n     oldest historical treasures.\n       (2) The first of the California missions was founded in \n     1769, and eventually a chain of 21 missions and various sub-\n     missions extended along the coast of California on El Camino \n     Real.\n       (3) The California missions contribute greatly to the rich \n     historical, cultural, and architectural heritage of \n     California and the American West.\n       (4) The knowledge and cultural influence of native \n     California Indians made a lasting contribution to the early \n     settlement of California and the development of the \n     California missions.\n       (5) More than 5,300,000 people visit the California \n     missions annually, and the historical importance of the \n     California missions extends worldwide as they have become a \n     frequent destination for foreign visitors to the United \n     States.\n       (6) The history of the California missions is an important \n     educational component in California schools, and the study of \n     the California missions is part of the Statewide fourth grade \n     curricula on California history.\n       (7) Restoration and repair of the California missions, and \n     the preservation of the Spanish colonial and mission-era \n     artworks and artifacts of the California missions, for the \n     public enjoyment will ensure that future generations also \n     have the benefit of experiencing and appreciating these great \n     symbols of the spirit of exploration and discovery in the \n     American West.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Bureau of Reclamation, to assist in the implementation of \nfish passage and screening facilities at non-Federal water projects, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide the Bureau of Reclamation, an agency of the Department of the \nInterior, with limited off-site mitigation authority in the Columbia \nRiver Basin. This legislation, if enacted, would enhance Reclamation's \nability to comply with the provisions of the December 2000 biological \nopinion for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System.\n  This legislation is similar to an Administration proposal that was \nsubmitted to the Congress on October 30, 2002, but never introduced \nduring the 107th Congress. Prior to the introduction of this bill, I \nhave sought comments from numerous stakeholders in the Pacific \nNorthwest and have addressed any concerns raised whenever possible.\n  While there has been a recent court ruling on the 2000 biological \nopinion that found certain aspects of the opinion to the arbitrary and \ncapricious, it is important to move forward with the reasonable and \nprudent alternatives, including fish passage improvements. The \nAdministration is currently working to address the deficiencies in the \nbiological opinion. I remain committed to working with my colleagues, \nthe Northwest governors, and the Administration to keep salmon recovery \non track, while preserving the multiple benefits for the Pacific \nNorthwest of the Federal Columbia River Power System.\n  The good news in our region is that over the past few years there \nhave been robust salmon runs on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. \nPromising new technologies, such as removable spillways, have also been \ntested in recent years. I know that the Administration remains \ncommitted to taking actions throughout the salmon's life cycle to \nrecover salmon runs in the Columbia and Snake Rivers. This important \nlegislation, if enacted, will provide yet another tool in addressing \nthe complex issues of salmon recovery. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this legislation, and will press for its consideration in \na timely manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 1308. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to pursue \nand complete actions related to the implementation of a U.S. District \nof a U.S. District Court Consent Decree; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Savage Rapids \nDam Act of 2003, for myself and my friend and colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Gordon Smith.\n  This legislation is another good example of the Oregon way: bringing \ntogether varied interests to get win-win results for all stakeholders. \nBorn out of controversy concerning the detrimental effects of the \nSavage Rapids Dam on fish passage and survival, this legislation is now \nsupported by the Grants Pass Irrigation District, Waterwatch, Oregon's \nGovernor, Trout\n\n[[Page S8305]]\n\nUnlimited, and various Oregon river guide and sport fishing concerns.\n  This legislation simply authorizes the Secretary of Interior, acting \nthrough the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Secretary of Commerce, \nacting through National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nFisheries, to undertake activities identified for Federal \nimplementation, including construction, in accordance with U.S. \nDistrict Court Consent Decree ``United States, et al., v. Grants Pass \nIrrigation District, Civil No. 98-3034-HO'', August 27, 2001.\n  This legislation has been years in the making. Senator Smith and I \nintroduced a related measure in the 106th Congress. As we return to \nthis legislation in the 108th Congress, I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues in the Senate and the stakeholders at home to make this \nlegislation and this process work for the Grants Pass Irrigation \nDistrict and the environment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1308\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1. AUTHORIZATION TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPLEMENTATION OF \n                   CONSENT DECREE.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of \n     Reclamation, and the Secretary of Commerce, acting through \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, \n     are hereafter authorized to implement, and enter into \n     financial assistance or other agreements as may be necessary \n     to undertake activities identified for Federal implementation \n     (including construction) in accordance with U.S. District \n     Court Consent Decree ``United States, et al., v. Grants Pass \n     Irrigation District, Civil No. 98-3034-HO'' (August 27, 2001)\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1309. A bill to provide emergency assistance to producers that \nhave suffered crop losses due to disasters; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Emergency \nAgriculture Assistance Act of 2003 on behalf of farmers throughout the \nstate of Arkansas.\n  Last month, my State was hit with devastating storms that produced at \nleast three dozen tornadoes and as much as 20 inches of rain fall. \nThese natural disasters occurred at the worst possible time for \nfarmers, at the beginning of the planting season, when they need to get \ntheir crops into the ground.\n  This is a particularly vulnerable time for farmers, since freshly \nplanted crops are highly susceptible to severe weather conditions.\n  A single day of heavy rains and high winds can undo a months worth of \nhard work, forcing producers to start over from scratch and replant \nentire fields or even entire farms.\n  Recently I was home in east Arkansas and saw much of this damage \nfirsthand. To take just one example: In Mississippi County in northeast \nArkansas, where Clark Long farms with his two sons, Clark Jr. and \nNathan, 11 inches of rain fell in a two day period. As a result, the \nLongs were forced to replant 1400 cotton acres. Other farmers I have \ntalked to are on their second or even third plantings.\n  Similar conditions abound throughout Mississippi County and northeast \nArkansas, where historic planting deadlines have now passed. As a rule \nof thumb, a cotton farmer wants to have his crop planted no later than \nMay 20th in order to maximize yields and to avoid having to harvest his \ncrop in October. Farmers can typically expect yield reductions of up to \ntwo percent per day beyond this deadline, since late crops are \ngenerally more susceptible to weed and insect infestation and harsher \nweather conditions.\n  Cotton farming, as well as farming commodities such as soybeans, \nwheat, and rice, is an expensive and labor intensive process. These \nsevere weather conditions exacerbate that situation greatly and place \nour farmers at serious risk.\n  We're going to monitor conditions throughout the year, guarding \nagainst further threats from severe weather, such as further tornadoes \nor even drought.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Pryor and me in passing this \nbill and protecting our farmers in this time of need.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today along with my good friend and \ncolleague from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln, in support of the Emergency \nAgricultural Assistance Act of 2003 to assist those in the agriculture \ncommunity who have been devastated by natural disaster across our \ncountry.\n  I hold in my hand a June 19th article from the Arkansas Democrat-\nGazette that describes one of the countless stories of farmers across \nmy State and the hardships they have faced due to unusually large \namounts of rainfall their farms have received during the absolute worst \npossible time. In the past month, some areas have received in excess of \ntwenty inches of rain. Arkansas, along with many other States across \nthe Midwest and South, has been pelted continuously by rain and \nnumerous tornadoes. As many as three dozen tornadoes have touched down \nin Arkansas alone. Bob Bevis, a farmer in Lonoke County, AR hasn't been \nable to work for three weeks due to soggy fields. In the meantime, \nwheat crops that were expected to bring record yields rot in the field, \nwaiting for water to recede before the wheat can be harvested. Over \nfifty percent of Arkansas' wheat crop remains in the field, and with \nevery passing day, the prospects for a successful harvest of wheat \ndiminish. If current weather conditions abate, our farmers may be able \nto harvest five hundred fifty thousand acres, the lowest total in over \nseventeen years.\n  The harvest of winter wheat has been greatly affected by weather. But \nwinter wheat, generating $112.1 million in sales last year, represents \nonly the fourth largest field crop in Arkansas. Rice, soybeans, and \ncotton represent our top three field crops. During the time wheat is \nbeing harvested, these other crops are being planted. Thus, while wheat \nhas been affected, soybeans, cotton, rice, and numerous other crops \nhave been devasted just as they are being put into the ground. Fields \nare under water. Crops that were planted early have been wiped out. \nOver 1.3 million acres of farmland across Arkansas have been affected \nby the excessive rainfall. Many of these acres had to be replanted, and \njust as quickly as our farmers began to have hopes of a decent crop, \nthose hopes were dashed by disasters beyond their control. As you and \nmany of our colleagues know, this is the critical time for planting \ncrops. The later crops get in the ground, the later they will be \nharvested. The later they are harvested, the greater the chance insect \nproblems, weed problems, and a whole host of other problems will damage \nthese crops become likely. Yields will be dangerously low. Our farmers \ncannot suffer this burden alone. Our farmers provide our citizens \naround the country with an abundant food supply, greater than any other \ncountry in the world. We have the safest, least expensive food in the \nworld, because farm families who are suffering through excessively \ntough times now work from dawn to dusk in the fields to make sure that \nwe do. As a country, and as a government, I hope that my colleagues \nwill show these dedicated Americans the support they deserve. They need \nour help, and they have asked for our help. I consider this a matter of \nnational and homeland security, and I hope that my colleagues will see \nit this way as well.\n  This bill will provide farmers in disaster areas designated by the \nPresident who experience a thirty-five percent yield loss with disaster \nassistance. I would like to thank my colleague from my home state for \nher hard work and collaboration on this bill. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure our farmers get the support and help they \nneed to keep America's food supply safe, inexpensive, and the best in \nthe world.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8306-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8306]]\n                  SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS--June 19, 2003\n\n\n                            [Corrected Text]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 177--TO DIRECT THE SENATE COMMISSION ON ART TO SELECT \n    AN APPROPRIATE SCENE COMMEMORATING THE GREAT COMPROMISE OF OUR \n    FOREFATHERS ESTABLISHING A BICAMERAL CONGRESS WITH EQUAL STATE \nREPRESENTATION IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, TO BE PLACED IN THE LUNETTE \nSPACE IN THE SENATE RECEPTION ROOM IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE INTO \n THE SENATE CHAMBER LOBBY, AND TO AUTHORIZE THE COMMITTEE ON RULES AND \n ADMINISTRATION TO OBTAIN TECHNICAL ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE IN CARRYING \n                             OUT ITS DUTIES\n\n  Mr. DODD submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

More than 50 percent of these exposures will \n     involve children under the age of 6 who are exposed to toxic \n     substances in their home. Poisoning accounts for 285,000 \n     hospitalizations, 1,200,000 days of acute hospital care, and \n     13,000 fatalities annually.\n       ``(3) Stabilizing the funding structure and increasing \n     accessibility to poison control centers will promote the \n     utilization of poison control centers, and reduce the \n     inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other \n     more costly health care services.\n       ``(4) The tragic events of September 11, 2001, and the \n     anthrax cases of October 2001, have dramatically changed our \n     Nation.

Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, we have had a \nproductive week. We have moved forward and we have debated and we have \namended the prescription drug Medicare bill. We have discussed such \nissues as asset testing, generic drugs, and appropriate premiums. \nYesterday we discussed drug reimportation and the issue surrounding \npharmacies and mail order prescriptions. We have made good progress \nover the last 5 days on this legislation. I want to express my sincere \nappreciation to my colleagues for their attention and for their very \ndiligent participation. If we look back over the last several days, we \nsee some other things we have been able to accomplish at the same time \nwe have been on this bill.\n  Indeed, the Senate has had H.R. 389, which will help increase public \naccess to defibrillation in schools. We passed a series of bills \nreported by Chairman Domenici and the Energy Committee relating to \nhistoric sites and trails to watershed studies and to recreation areas. \nWe passed S. 1276, which strengthens the AmeriCorps program and allows \nour national volunteer program to be more efficient.\n  This week we were able to adopt a conference report to accompany S. \n342, the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act. This bill will assist \nin the dissemination of information of child abuse programs and the \navailability of psychological services for child victims.\n  The Senate also agreed to conference with the House on the child tax \ncredit legislation, allowing that bill to move forward and differences \nbetween this body and the House to be worked out.\n  Lastly--this reminds me that on tomorrow, summer begins officially--\nwith the approach of summer, I would be remiss if I did not mention \nthat the Senate passed S. 1015, the Mosquito Abatement for Safety and \nHealth Act. This legislation authorizes grants for mosquito control \nprograms to prevent mosquito-borne diseases.\n  This morning--again, I have great delight because it was on behalf \nand at the instigation of and with the leadership of my colleague from \nthe great State of Tennessee, Senator Alexander, who brought forth the \nbill--the American History and Civics Education Act passed unanimously \non a rollcall vote.\n  Next week we will resume the prescription drug/Medicare bill, and \nhopefully we will pass that--not hopefully, I am confident we will pass \nthat bill prior to the beginning of the July 4 recess.\n  I thank all of my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8317-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 23, 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

LONG\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Cicero was asked which of Demosthenes' \nspeeches he most admired. Cicero's answer was: The longest. By the way, \nDemosthenes committed suicide. He carried some poison in a bracelet and \nhe committed suicide. While I admire Demosthenes, I do not hope to \nfollow his course in that regard.\n  The greatest oration that was ever delivered was the Oration on the \nCrown by Demosthenes. In that oration, he asked the question: Who \ndeceives the State? He answered his own question. He who does not speak \nwhat he thinks.\n\n     God, give us men!\n     A time like this demands strong minds,\n     great hearts, true faith, and ready hands.\n     Men whom the lusts of office do not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie.\n\n     Men who can stand before the demagogue\n     And brave his treacherous flatteries without winking.\n\n     Tall men, sun-crowned;\n     Who live above the fog,\n     In public duty and in private thinking.\n     For while the rabble with its thumbworn creeds,\n     It's large professions and its little deeds, mingles in \n           selfish strife,\n\n     Lo! Freedom weeps!\n\n     Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps.\n     God, give us men.\n\n     Men who serve not for selfish booty;\n     But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty.\n     Men of dependable character;\n     Men of sterling worth;\n     Then wrongs will be redressed, and right will rule the earth.\n     God, give us Men!\n\n  Mr. President, those lines by J. G. Holland call my reflections to a \nman who served in the Senate with me a good many years ago. For 38 \nyears, Russell B. Long was a giant among the giants of the U.S. Senate. \nAlthough not a large man, his mere presence on the Senate floor was \noverpowering. His accomplishments were enormous, and I am confident in \nsaying that his legacy will prove to be long lasting. He was a \nSenator's Senator.\n  He sat here in this row of seats where I now stand. Mr. Mansfield sat \nin the chair at the desk just in front of me. The greatest Senator of \nall, in my public career, was another Southerner whose name was Richard \nBrevard Russell, and he sat at the seat which I now have the honor to \nfill. At the desk behind me was Russell B. Long.\n  He was a man of powerful intellect. He was a walking history blessed \nwith common sense and a sharp, clear mind. He could keep one \nentertained for hours with his down-home stories, his folksy humor, and \nmemories of his remarkable and controversial family.\n  His father, Huey P. Long, was called the Kingfish in Louisiana. His \nfather was the legendary populist Governor and Senator from Louisiana, \nHuey Long. Russell's self-effacing mother, Rose, who Russell Long said \nwas the ``nearest thing I knew to an angel''--now that is putting it \nright. ``The nearest thing I knew to an angel.'' That was Russell \nLong's way of referring to his mother.\n\n  His mother served briefly in the U.S. Senate following the \nassassination of her husband. So here you have the husband, the wife, \nand the son all serving in the U.S. Senate at different times, of \ncourse.\n  Born in Shreveport, LA, in 1918, Russell B. Long received his \nundergraduate and law degrees from Louisiana State University. He \nserved as a naval officer during World War II and practiced law after \nthe war.\n  On November 2, 1948, he was elected to the U.S. Senate. I was in the \nWest Virginia House of Delegates at that time. So Russell Long was \nelected to the U.S. Senate 1 day before his 30th birthday, making him \nthe sixth person to be elected to the Senate under the age of 30. When \nhe retired from the Senate in 1986, he had served longer than all but \nthree other Senators in history at that time.\n  His love for this institution and his respect for this institution's \ntraditions were always evident. He opposed television coverage in the \nU.S. Senate. He and I were both together in feeling that way about it \nat that particular time. We both opposed television coverage in the \nSenate at that point.\n  He opposed the efforts to limit Senate filibusters. I opposed them \nwith him. I joined in filibusters with him. And I today oppose efforts \nto eliminate the filibuster in the U.S. Senate, and I always will \noppose those efforts.\n  He did so, meaning he opposed the elimination of the filibuster and \nany efforts to eliminate it, because he cared so much about preserving \nthe unique role of the U.S. Senate in American Government and American \nsociety.\n  During his tenure in the Senate, Russell Long served on a number of \nimportant committees, including the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee, the Banking and Currency Committee, and the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  In 1965, his Democratic colleagues elected him--and I was here at \nthat time to cast my vote for him--to serve as the Senate Democratic \nwhip, the post he held until 1969. I was the secretary of the \nDemocratic conference at that particular time, and I believe I sat on \nthe back row over here.\n  It was on January 10, 1966, that another legend was born, and that \nwas the day that Senator Long became chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, a position he held for 15 years, the longest continuous \nservice in the history of that committee. As chairman of this powerful \nSenate committee, Senator Long displayed such a command of the subject \nmatter and demonstrated such skillful management abilities that during \nfloor debates Senators would line up at his desk seeking his \nencyclopedic memory and knowledge about complicated tax provisions. In \nfact, on most of the landmark tax and trade legislation during that \ntime one can see the imprint of this remarkable Senator, Russell Long.\n  His was a powerful voice on health care finance and Social Security. \nHis genius fathered ESOP, the employee stock ownership plan concept, \nwhich enabled the workers and management at Weirton Steel in Weirton, \nWV, to keep the plant from closing in 1982. Russell Long went with me, \nand with the late Senator Jennings Randolph, my colleague at the time, \nto Weirton Steel and talked with the employers and employees, the \npeople, the citizens, about the ESOP plan. That plan was applied and it \npreserved the jobs of 8,500 employees.\n  Russell Long's legislative achievements included the 1972 and 1976 \nFederal revenue sharing laws and the 1969 and 1976 tax reform laws. I \nwish he were here today. Indeed, his work on the Nation's tax laws \ncontinued throughout his years in the Senate. In 1986, his last year in \nthis Chamber, he helped to write a major simplification of income tax \nlaw.\n  President Jimmy Carter liked to say that he was elected President and \ncame to Washington to run the country but that when he got here, he \ndiscovered that Russell Long was already running it.\n  Senator Long's colleague from Louisiana at that time, Senator Bennett \nJohnson, used to point out that President Carter was probably \nexaggerating but not by much.\n  Russell Long's success as a Senator is largely attributable to his \nskills as a debater and speaker, and his skills as a technician and \ncraftsman in the writing of tax laws. These are skills which he likely \ninherited from his dynamic father. Those skills included his formidable \nability as one of the Senate's best negotiators.\n  President John F. Kennedy once told him:\n\n       You traded me a biscuit for a barrel of flour and I didn't \n     even get a biscuit.\n\n  Following the Republican landslide of 1980 in which Ronald Reagan was \nelected President and the Republican Party gained the majority in the \nSenate, Senator Howard Baker, who had become the new Senate majority \nleader, telephoned Senator Robert Dole to congratulate Senator Dole on \nhis new role as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. The story \ngoes that Senator Dole responded:\n\n\n[[Page S8319]]\n\n\n       Howard, that is great, but who is going to tell Russell \n     Long?\n\n  I enjoy that story. It demonstrates both the power and the respect \nthat Senator Russell Long commanded as a U.S. Senator and as chairman \nof the Senate Finance Committee. No wonder the Wall Street Journal once \nreferred to Russell Long as the fourth branch of Government. \nJournalists, as well as Presidents and Senators, revered and enjoyed \nthis colorful man, and brilliant Senator. During his 38 years in the \nSenate, Russell B. Long truly became an institution within this \ninstitution.\n\n  I missed Russell Long when he left the Senate. Erma and I missed his \nlovely wife Carolyn. I called Carolyn a few minutes ago to speak with \nher about her late husband Russell Long. I told her I was going to have \na few words to say about Russell, and I asked her to listen in if she \nliked.\n  I close this short statement about Russell Long with a poem by Thomas \nMoore, that great Irishman. The title of the poem is ``The Light of \nOther Days.''\n  I dedicate these words by Thomas Moore to Carolyn, and in so doing, \nof course, I think about my own service in this Chamber with Russell \nLong.\n\n       Oft, in the stilly night,\n       Ere slumber's chain as bound me,\n       Fond memory brings the light\n       Of other days around me;\n       The smiles, the tears,\n       Of boyhood's years,\n       The words of love then spoken;\n       The ayes that shone,\n       Now dimm'd and gone,\n       The cheerful hearts now broken.\n       Thus, in the stilly night,\n       Ere slumber's chain has bound me,\n       Sad memory brings the light\n       Of other days around me.\n       When I remember all\n       The friends, so link'd together,\n       I've seen around me fall\n       Like leaves in wintry weather.\n       I feel like one\n       Who treads alone\n       Some banquet-hall deserted,\n       Whose lights are fled,\n       Whose garland's dead,\n       And all but he departed.\n       Thus, in the stilly night,\n       Ere slumber's chain has bound me,\n       Sad Memory brings the light\n       Of other days around me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8319-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8319-S8320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HAPPY 140TH BIRTHDAY, WEST VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

The little streamlets,\n       As they glide and race along,\n       Join their music to the anthem\n       And the zephyrs swell the song.\n\n       Always free! The mountain torrent\n       In its haste to reach the sea,\n       Shouts its challenge to the hillsides\n       And the echo answers ``FREE!''\n\n       Always free! Repeats the river\n       In a deeper, fuller tone\n       And the West wind in the treetops\n       Adds a chorus all its own.\n\n       Always Free! The crashing thunder,\n       Madly flung from hill to hill,\n       In a wild reverberation\n       Makes our hearts with rapture fill.\n\n       Always free! The Bob White whistles\n       And the whippoorwill replies,\n       Always free! The robin twitters\n       As the sunset gilds the skies.\n\n       Perched upon the tallest timber,\n       Far above the sheltered lea,\n       There the eagle screams defiance\n       To a hostile world: ``I'm free!''\n\n       And two million happy people,\n       Hearts attuned in holy glee,\n       Add the hallelujah chorus:\n       ``Mountaineers are always free!''\n\n  It is that time of year again.\n  It is that time when the flowers are in full bloom and birds are \nchirping the sweetest and the loudest. It is that time when you feel \nmost like breathing the clean, fresh air blowing in from the \nAppalachian mountains. The time of year when you feel most like taking \nyour loved one by the hand and strolling, arm in arm, through your \nfavorite park knowing that all is right with the world--and all is \nright with the world because it is West Virginia Day!\n  June 20 is West Virginia Day. I am celebrating this glorious day. It \nwas 140 years ago that West Virginia became a State. It was on June 20, \n1863, the Reverend J.T. McLure offered the State's inaugural prayer. \nReferring to the fact that the State was created in the middle of the \nAmerican Civil War, he prayed:\n\n       We pray Thee, almighty God, that this State, born amidst \n     tears and blood and fire and desolation, may long be \n     preserved and from its little beginning may grow to be a \n     might and a power that shall make those who come after us \n     look upon it with joy and gladness and pride of heart.\n\n  I am pleased and proud to say, 140 years later, that I can look upon \nmy West Virginia with ``joy and gladness and pride of heart.'' On this \nWest Virginia Day, I again want to speak about the people of West \nVirginia, the hardest-working and most patriotic people in the United \nStates. They have endured hardships, poverty, and floods of biblical \nproportions, but have remained loyal to their State and our Nation. \nWhenever the country has needed them, in war or in peace, they have \nalways been there, and I have always been so proud to represent them in \nthe United States Senate.\n  On this West Virginia Day, I again speak about the splendors of my \nState--truly one of the most beautiful states in the Nation. With its \nrushing, trout-filled mountain streams, its majestic rolling green \nhills, picturesque villages and towns, magnificent forests, scenic \nstate parks--no wonder the State has been depicted in song and verse as \nbeing ``almost heaven.'' There are the State's natural beauties like \nSeneca Rocks and the New River Gorge. I hope the pages will go and see \nthese scenic beauties in this State that is almost heaven. There are \nthe State's natural wonders like Cranberry Glades, Hawks Nest, and \nBerkeley Springs.\n  You can go camping in West Virginia's beautiful parks like Cooper's \nRock State Forest, Babcock, Pipestem, or Watoga. You can go fishing in \nthe Greenbrier River, Holly River, and Tygart Lake. You can take a ski \ntrip in the wondrous Canaan Valley, or go white-water rafting down the \nmagnificent Cheat River, go hiking along the awesome Appalachian Trail.\n  Simply drive around the State and enjoy a pace and a view far \ndifferent than the drives most of us suffer through daily. I invite my \ncolleagues, I invite the media, I invite the people in the galleries, \npeople everywhere, to take a drive in West Virginia. You will love it. \nYou will never forget it. There is nothing like it elsewhere in the \nworld. West Virginia. Almost heaven.\n  I invite the Democratic pages and the Republican pages, our staffs. I \nhave often spoken enthusiastically of the ``wild and wonderful'' \nscenery of West Virginia. Therefore, on this, the 140th anniversary of \nmy great and glorious State, I want to tell you about its history.\n  Some of my State's history is well-known and well-documented; like \nthe fact that it is the only State created from another State without \nthe parent State's permission, and that it is the only State to achieve \nstatehood by the proclamation of a president, Abraham Lincoln. It can \nbe argued that the first battle of the American Revolution took place \nat Point Pleasant and that the last battle of the Revolution was fought \nat Fort Henry, in Wheeling. The State is rich in Civil War history; at \nHarpers Ferry, John Brown began the bloody quest to finally eliminate \nthe scourge of slavery from this nation, and the first significant land \nbattle of the Civil War took place at Phillipi, on June 3, 1861.\n  But there is another, lesser known, side to my State's history that I \nwant to talk about today--a history that shows what a unique, \ndiversified, and fascinating state West Virginia really is.\n  Most of my colleagues are aware that West Virginia's political \nhistory includes providing the Senate's Majority Leader, the Senate's \nMinority Leader, the chairman of the Senate Appropriation's Committee, \nand the second longest serving Senator in American history--and that \nwas all one person--who? Me. But I proudly point out that my State's \npolitical history includes the first African American woman, Minnie \nBuckingham Harper of Welch, to ever serve in a State legislature. That \nwas in 1928. In 1934, West Virginians elected one of the youngest \npersons ever elected by popular vote to the United States Senate--Rush \nD. Holt. His son, Rush Holt, now represents the State of New Jersey in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Most people are aware of the importance of coal to West Virginia, and \nthe\n\n[[Page S8320]]\n\nimportance of West Virginia coal to the Nation. For nearly a century, \nWest Virginia coal helped fuel America's industries, heat our homes and \npower our battleships. But West Virginia's natural resources have also \nincluded America's first natural gas well, in 1815, near Charleston, \nand the world's largest gas well, ``Big Moses'' in Tyler County, which \nwas drilled in 1894 and produced 100,000,000 cubic feet of gas per day. \nIn 1941, the first and largest synthetic rubber plant in the United \nStates began operation near Charleston.\n  There is so much to see and do in West Virginia. Come on down. Come \non down to West Virginia. There is nature. There is beauty. There is \nhistory. And the State's modern highway system. I can remember when, \nwhile serving in the West Virginia Legislature in 1947, seeing that \nState as a State without a single mile of divided 4-lane highway on the \n1947 highway map. Think of that. A 1947 highway map shows not a single \nmile, not one in the whole State, of divided 4-lane highway. Oh, but \nwhat a change.\n  With the State's modern highway system, you can drive to Weirton, WV, \nand see the only city in the United States that stretches from a \nState's eastern border all the way to its western border.\n  At Grafton, WV, you can visit Andrews Church, which, on May 10, 1908, \nwas the site of the first celebration of Mother's Day. Just a few hours \naway, near Thomas, WV, is a unique, picturesque little church, Our Lady \nof the Pines, once considered the smallest church in the United States.\n  You can travel to Charles Town, WV, and see where rural free mail \ndelivery began in 1896 and see the Court House in which more than 500 \ncoal miners went on trial for treason and insurrection in 1922.\n  Speaking of labor history, drive over to Martinsburg and see where \nthe great railroad strike of 1877 began, or down to Logan County, WV, \nand view the site of the largest labor uprising in American history, \nthe Battle of Blair Mountain.\n  West Virginia also has a fascinating business history. The first \ntrust in the United States was the salt trust organized in 1817 by the \nsalt manufacturers along the Kanawha River.\n  The first patent for a soda fountain--if you have ever taken your \ngirl to the soda fountain? What a great memory that is. I used to walk \n3 miles to take my girlfriend at that time--she's my wife now, after 66 \nyears--I took her to the soda fountain. And I would buy a quart of ice \ncream. It just cost 5 cents in those days.\n  The first patent for a soda fountain was granted to George Dulty, of \nWheeling, WV, in 1833 and outdoor advertising had its origins in that \nsame city in 1908. The first municipally owned parking building in the \nUnited States opened in Welch--that is in Dowell County. The very \nSouthern point of West Virginia--in 1941.\n  Sports history, West Virginia has that too. Colliers, WV, on June 1, \n1880, was the site of the first barenuckles heavyweight championship \nfight. At Burnsville, in 1960, Danny Heater scored 135 points in a \nsingle basketball game, for which he is in the Guinness Book of World \nRecords. Can you believe that, 135 points in a basketball game?\n  Finally, let me invite you to drive over to Ritchie County, WV, and \nsee where history was made when a Mountain was made from a Mole Hill--\nliterally. It actually happened. It happened when the good people of \nthe town of Mole Hill, WV, decided to change the name of their town to \nMountain. They changed it from a ``molehill' into a ``mountain.''\n  On this the 140th anniversary of West Virginia, we will welcome you.\n  On this, the 140th anniversary of West Virginia, I say happy \nbirthday, West Virginia. Come on down to West Virginia. \nCongratulations, West Virginia.\n  ``Born amidst tears and blood and fire and desolation,'' in the words \nof Reverend Mr. McLure, from a ``little beginning'' you have grown ``to \nbe a might and a power'' that has made us look upon you `` with joy and \ngladness and pride of heart.''\n\n     This was no land for lily-fingered men\n     Who bowed and scraped and danced a neat quadrille,\n     In towns and cities far beyond the ken\n     Of mountaineers--who loved each rock and rill.\n\n     It was a place for lean, tall men with love\n     For freedom flowing strongly in their veins,\n     For those attuned to vagrant stars above,\n     To rugged peaks, deep snows and June-time rains.\n\n     And so our State was whelped in time of strife\n     And cut its teeth upon a cannon ball;\n     Its heritage was cleaner, better life,\n     Within the richest storehouse of them all.\n\n     With timber, oil and gas and salt and coal,\n     It bargained in the world's huge marketplace.\n     The mountain empire reached a mighty goal;\n     It never ran a pauper's sordid race.\n\n     And best of all, it sired a hardy flock\n     Whose fame will grow with centuries to be,\n     Tough as a white-oak stump or limestock rock,\n     The mountaineers--who always shall be free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8320-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8320-S8321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CLEARING AWAY THE MUD AND MUCK\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Mother Nature has once again, as I have seen \nso many times, dealt West Virginia a heavy blow. For more than a week, \nheavy rains have spawned flash floods and mudslides. The storms have \nresulted in millions of dollars in damages to homes and businesses in \nCentral and Southern West Virginia, damage so significant that \nyesterday Governor Bob Wise requested a Federal disaster declaration \nfor then counties.\n  His request seeks Federal aid for Boone, Cabell, Kanawha, Lincoln, \nLogan, Mason, McDowell, Mingo, Putnam, and Wayne counties.\n  The need for help is abundantly clear. Hundreds and hundreds of homes \nhave been washed away or significantly damaged because of the storms. \nMudslides continue to threaten communities nestled along West \nVirginia's many mountains, mudslides that could be triggered with just \na little more rain or a little more wind. Thousands of West Virginians \nhave been without power, without telephone service, and without utility \nservice. Bridges and roads have literally been wiped off the map, \nisolating communities that already are working to pick themselves up \nfrom this devastation.\n  Make no mistake, West Virginians are committed to rebuilding.\n  So many times I have seen them after a flood, if the homes were still \nstanding, go right back into those homes, or, if the homes were gone, \nbuilding another home and going right back into those homes.\n  So they are committed to rebuilding their lives. But they need help \nto get back on their feet.\n  As I have just indicated, today is West Virginia Day--a day normally \nset aside to celebrate the anniversary of the Mountain State becoming a \nfull-fledged partner in this union of States. There will not be much \ncelebrating today in these storm-ravaged counties. But we do celebrate \nthe West Virginia spirit that has shined throughout the years, and in \nthat same spirit that has shined throughout this disaster. It is a \nspirit that can never be washed away, no matter how heavy the rains \ncome, and no matter how deep the floods.\n  Thousands of Mountain State residents have taken part in the recover \neffort. I applaud them. Like so many before them among those West \nVirginia hills, they have filled sandbags and carried pets to safety. \nThey have pulled people from homes just before the onrushing waters \ncame rolling in. It is no surprise. Helping neighbors in need is the \nWest Virginia way.\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\n  It is with regret that I inform the Senate that that West Virginia \nspirit may have cost one man his life. In Lincoln County, in the town \nof Spurlockville, 37-year-old Joey Roberts was trying to give a hand to \na friend whose car had stalled in waist-high water. The friend was \ntrying to cross the Mud River in an area that normally is shallow \nenough for passage. But not on this day. The waters were just too much. \nWhen trying to help, Mr. Roberts slipped and fell. His body was \nrecovered some time later. Our thoughts and prayers are with his \nfamily, and with all of the families who are struggling to regain some \nsense of safety and normalcy amid these storms.\n  I hope that the request for Federal disaster assistance is approved \nquickly. Every moment counts in the recovery efforts, and every little \nbit of help is crucial.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/20/senate-section/article/S8321-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 2 P.M., MONDAY, JUNE 23, 2003\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
