Mr. President, I want to make a brief statement in leader \ntime on a visit I had last week with the new President of the Iraqi \ninterim government, Sheik Ghazi al-Yawr. The distinguished minority \nleader, the distinguished President pro tempore, and Senators Leahy, \nWarner, Lugar, Reid, and Levin all participated in what was a \nfascinating luncheon discussion.\n  Our meeting was a timely one. I traveled about 12 days ago to Baghdad \nand had the opportunity to spend time with other leaders in Baghdad. To \nbe able to host the President here and have a discussion about his \nperspective was very useful, very productive.\n  Two weeks ago, I was in Baghdad with Senators Ensign and Bennett, and \nwhile we were there we had the opportunity to meet with the new Iraqi \nPrime Minister, Dr. Ayad al-Alawi. I mentioned our discussions with him \non the Senate floor yesterday morning.\n  Our meeting this week also came on the heels of the unanimous passage \non Tuesday a week ago of the U.N. Security Council resolution that \ngoverns the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi people as we move from \noccupiers to a mission presence in Iraq.\n  President al-Yawr at our meeting last week laid out his vision of a \nfree Iraq. He reminded us that the Iraqi people want a free society \nthat is governed by a rule of law. A rule of law has become a real goal \nof his as he looks over the next 6 months in terms of the operation of \nthis interim government. The Iraqi people want to do what you would \nexpect, and that is to be able to raise their children in peace and to \nbe able to live their lives in peace. That element of security coupled \nwith preparing for these elections 6 months from now are his dual \nobjectives.\n\n  The President did point out and underscored the importance of the \ndate that will occur now in 2 weeks, and that is June 30, which is the \nformal transfer of sovereignty. He stressed the importance of \nmaintaining a coalition presence posthandover in order to preserve \nsecurity while the new Iraqi police forces are being built and rebuilt, \nand the Iraqi Armed Forces are being equipped, appropriately armed, and \ntrained. He rejected those who commit acts of terror against the Iraqi \npeople. No Iraqi wants to return to the days when a single individual \nruled that country with fear.\n\n[[Page S7030]]\n\n  He pledged that Iraq would serve as an example of peace and of \nfreedom--for Iraq, yes, but even more, or equally important, I should \nsay, as an example for the entire region.\n  The Iraqi people look forward to holding democratic elections and to \ngoverning themselves, he told us. But he was quick to say the Iraqi \npeople must have that security in order to rebuild their lives.\n  It was interesting. When we asked him about the coalition and how \nbroad a coalition, what he said is what the Iraqi people need is not \njust a broad coalition, but he needs--the Iraqi people need--an \neffective coalition. It is that effectiveness that ultimately is most \nimportant to him as the new President of that country. He needs people \nwho can get the job done for him.\n  The President was quick to express his thanks on behalf of the Iraqi \npeople and asked us to extend that thanks, that appreciation of the \nsacrifices Americans have made so the Iraqi people could live in a free \ncountry, that they would have that opportunity to live freely and to \npursue democracy. He made it clear the full pursuit of democracy will \ntake time. The first step is the election 6 months from now. It may be \na series of elections before full-blown democracy, as we generally \nconceive of democracy, will take hold.\n\n  In these difficult times, the President of Iraq stated Iraq would \nneed the full support of the United States of America, both \npolitically, financially, and militarily, as they go through this \ntransition and over the coming months.\n  He recognized that without a secure and stable environment the U.S. \ncoalition provided, a democratic Iraq simply would not succeed.\n  President al-Yawr recognized the huge task confronting the new Iraqi \ngovernment, but he was determined. He expressed that determination in \nevery sentence, in every thought he shared with us. He stated he was \nencouraged by the widespread support of the Iraqi people for the new \ninterim government.\n  He clearly draws his strength from the aspirations to transform Iraq \ninto a thriving democracy. President al-Yawr made clear that what is \ncalled TAL, transitional administrative law, the law of the land during \nthis interim period, would govern their actions in the coming months, \nand the rights of all would be protected under this transitional \nadministrative law. His immediate focus is to build those professional \nsecurity forces to establish an independent judiciary that can uphold \nthat rule of law.\n  As Iraqis rebuild their capacity to maintain security and govern \nthemselves, the President said the world would see an Iraqi face on the \nwar against terrorism in Iraq. Having met the Prime Minister in Baghdad \na week and a half ago, and now the President of Iraq here in the \nNation's Capital, the impact of having that Iraqi face, telling the \nIraqi story, having it not told just by Americans or by an occupying \nforce, will make a huge difference on the world stage. It is for the \nIraqi people, it is by the Iraqi people, and it is up to the Iraqi \npeople at this point.\n  No nation wants to rely on another for its security. The President of \nIraq expressed that. The Iraqi people want to stand on their own \nstrength. But they need help through this transition period. He also \nmade it clear that to rely upon a coalition while they are rebuilding \ntheir police and their army is not a surrender of their sovereignty in \nany way. Indeed, it is in Iraq's vital national security interests to \naccept the coalition's help, he stated.\n  Having now met with Iraq's two most senior leaders over the last 12 \ndays, I am confident these two leaders and this new government is a \nstrong one. They have the vision, they have the fortitude, they clearly \nhave the courage, but they also have the resolve to lead the Iraqi \npeople on this path toward freedom and democracy.\n  Indeed, Iraq's new leaders have the confidence of our friends in the \nregion. Senator Daschle, Senator McConnell, Senator Biden, and I all \nmet with King Abdullah of Jordan this week in the Capitol. His Majesty \nexpressed his confidence in and support of the new Iraqi government, as \nwell. That is, again, a perspective from a very important, very \nsignificant leader in that part of the world.\n  It is important to praise President Bush and his team for their \nvision, for their resolve, and their efforts to get the United Nations \nand the international community behind this government. That has been a \nsuccessful endeavor.\n\n  We are all concerned about the recent terrorist activity in Iraq. As \nI have mentioned in the Senate in the last couple of days, an increase \nin terrorist activity is anticipated. It is expected by the Iraqi \nleaders and by our civilian and military leaders because the terrorist \ngroups--whether it is the Zarqawi network, whether it is the former \nregime loyalists, or whether it is the insurgents--will increase \nactivity to derail this transition of sovereignty to the new \ngovernment. They are not going to be successful. Yet we will see that \nincreased terrorist activity. Indeed, we see the increased activity \nwhen we open the news each morning.\n  The terrorists want to disrupt this handoff. They are simply not \ngoing to be successful. They do not want to see the Iraqi people \nbreathe that fresh air of freedom. They will not be successful. Indeed, \nwe will win.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/18/senate-section/article/S7030-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This amendment is being offered by myself, Senators \nMikulski, Landrieu, Sarbanes, Corzine, Murray, Dayton, and Biden. This \nis an amendment that will be a familiar amendment to many Members of \nthe Senate. It is an amendment I offered before on an appropriations \nbill and was adopted with an overwhelming vote in the Senate. \nUnfortunately, it was stripped out of the bill in conference.\n  This amendment to the Defense authorization bill addresses the \nfinancial burden facing many of the men and women who serve in the \nmilitary Reserve and National Guard and are forced to take unpaid leave \nfrom their Federal jobs when called to active duty. I offered this \namendment to the fiscal year 2004 supplemental. It passed by a margin \nof 96 to 3 before it was removed in conference. The vote recognized the \nreality that since the end of the cold war, employment of our Reserve \nforces has shifted profoundly, from being primarily an expansion force \nto augment active forces during a major war to the situation today, \nwhere the Department of Defense admits that no significant operation \ncan be undertaken by the United States of America without Guard and \nReserve components.\n  Think of how often we, as individuals, both elected and unelected, \nhave come forward to congratulate employers who stand behind their \nemployees when activated. We salute them. We say it is a great show of \ncitizenship that when an employee of a company is activated in a Guard \nor Reserve capacity that the company makes up the difference in their \npaycheck; continues their health insurance; of course, promises them a \njob when they return. We salute all these great employers.\n  This amendment addresses an employer that has turned out to be a \ndeadbeat when it comes to Guard and Reserve. That employer happens to \nbe the Federal Government. Yes, that is right, the United States \nFederal Government is an employer which does not offer Guard and \nReserve activated employees the same benefits being offered by State \ngovernments, local governments, and private companies.\n  One might ask, How many Federal employees are in the Guard and \nReserve? Today, there are about 1.2 million members in the National \nGuard and Reserve. Of that number, 10 percent, 120,000, are Federal \nemployees. More than 43,000 Federal employees have been activated since \n9/11. That is more than one-third of those Federal employees who are \nmembers of the Guard and Reserve have actually been activated.\n  Currently, more than 15,000 Federal employees remain activated with \nGuard and Reserve. They are dedicated. They are loyal. They are serving \ntheir country. They have chosen not only to work for our Federal \nGovernment but also to volunteer for the Guard and Reserve. But they do \nit at a price.\n\n  While these individuals receive pay for the time they are on active \nduty, the salary gap many times between military pay and their \nGovernment pay and allowances can be considerable.\n  A Department of Defense survey of 35,000 reservists, including \nFederal employees, found that 41 percent of all reservists suffer lost \nincome during mobilization and deployment. Of the 41 percent reporting \na loss, approximately 70 percent said their annual income was reduced \nby almost $4,000. Approximately 7 percent, however, reported an annual \nloss ranging from $37,000 to $50,000.\n  So imagine this scenario: Someone works for the Department of \nTransportation of the United States of America. They have signed up for \nthe Army Reserves. They have a job that pays $60,000 a year, being a \nFederal employee. Now they have been activated and they are being paid \n$30,000 a year. What about that salary gap?\n  A lot of State governments and local governments and private \ncompanies say: We will make up the difference. We will stand with you. \nYou are serving your country. You are risking your life. We will stand \nby you--but not the Federal Government. Many companies, State and local \ngovernments--companies such as Ford, IBM, Verizon, Safeway; and the \nState of California, Los Angeles County, Austin, TX--recognize the \nburden and voluntarily pay the difference between Active-Duty military \nsalary and civilian salary for reservists. Typically, these employers\n\n[[Page S7032]]\n\ncover their reservists anywhere from 90 days on, with possible \nextensions of up to 18 months.\n  In my State of Illinois, Boeing Aerospace, State Farm Insurance, \nSears, Roebuck & Company, the State of Illinois, the city of Chicago, \nand many other Illinois companies and local governments and \ninstitutions, cover the pay differential for Reserve and Guard members. \nThe State of Alaska has passed legislation, which Governor Murkowski \nsigned into law, that allows the government to make up the difference \nin pay and continue some or all health benefits for State employees \ncalled to active duty in the Reserves and National Guard. The authority \nwould be discretionary, triggered by an order of the Governor. The \nbill's effective date is retroactive to September 11, 2001.\n  In addition to Illinois and Alaska, similar legislation has been \nenacted in at least 21 other States, including the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. I know the Senator, who is chairman of this committee, is \nparticularly proud that his State stands behind State employees who \nhave been activated for the Guard and Reserves and makes up the \ndifference in salary.\n  But what an embarrassment it is for us to stand on the floor of the \nSenate and say the Federal Government does not do the same thing. That \nis right: The Government of the United States does not offer the same \nbenefits offered by Illinois, Alaska, Virginia, and many other States \nacross the Nation. These States have gone above and beyond the \nrequirements of law in many circumstances. They stand behind these \npeople. In fact, when you look at the private sector, hundreds of \ncompanies provide full salary differential for at least 90 days when \nthe Guard and Reserves are activated.\n  The Federal Government is the Nation's largest employer. We, in \nWashington, are the first to stand up and salute our troops, as we \nshould. But instead of just saluting, why don't we give these troops a \nhelping hand? For goodness' sake, these Federal employees--activated \ntime and time again, causing great hardship to their family--deserve \nthe same consideration as those employees of State and local \ngovernments and private companies.\n  My amendment will help alleviate some of the financial burdens faced \nby these Federal employees who have been mobilized. Federal employees, \nwithout hesitation, take time off their jobs, away from their families, \nto serve our Nation.\n\n  On October 11, 2002, I voted against the resolution to give the \nPresident authority to go forward with this war. That decision was a \ntough one. The decision was made by this Congress to go forward anyway.\n  What has happened since? We have found a war that we hoped would be \nshort in duration has become much longer. We now have some 135,000 to \n140,000 troops in the field in Iraq. We hope they will come home soon, \nbut there is no end in sight. Many of my activated Guard and Reserve \nunits have been extended. They are over there for extended periods of \ntime, causing great hardship, really assaulting the morale of many of \nthese units. Yet they continue to serve, and they continue to risk \ntheir lives. Some have been mobilized for more than a year. Many have \nhad their tours involuntarily extended. Some are subject to stop-loss \norders.\n  Given the increased commitment of Reserve components--the longer \ntours, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan--and concerns over \nrecruiting and retention, this legislation is timely and a vote of \nsupport for each and every Federal employee who is also a citizen \nsoldier. We have to provide our reservist employees with financial \nsupport so they can leave their civilian lives to serve our country \nwithout the added burden of worry about whether their loved ones back \nhome can make a monthly mortgage payment or provide new shoes for the \nkids. They are doing so much for us, we can do no less for them.\n  Let me also say, this is an authorization, and it is an authorization \nwith a retroactive date back to October 11, 2002, when the Senate \ninitially enacted my reservist pay security bill. The amendment \nprovides for the authorization of $100 million to cover retroactive \npayments from October 11, 2002, through the date of enactment. Of \ncourse, this $100 million is subject to appropriation.\n  Prospectively, the funds come from discretionary funds for each \nagency, so that as Federal employees in each agency are activated into \nGuard and Reserve units, serving and risking their lives overseas, the \nagencies will understand they are going to stand by these employees \nwhile these employees are standing by our country.\n  I believe this is a reasonable amendment. I think it is one that the \nSenate has embraced with an overwhelming bipartisan rollcall vote of 96 \nto 3. It belongs in this authorization bill so we can say to Federal \nemployees: We respect you no less than all of the others who are \nserving in the Guard and Reserves. We believe you should be given a \nhelping hand to keep your family together as you volunteer to serve \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, at this point I would ask that this amendment be set \naside and I be given an opportunity to call up another amendment which \nI have pending at the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3225.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if we could----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could we \nfirst discuss this amendment a minute?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I would be happy to discuss it. In fact, I did not \nknow the Senator wanted to, but I am anxious to.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the concern I personally have had--and I \nthink shared by some of our colleagues--is almost less from a fiscal \nstandpoint and more from the fact that when you put a unit together and \nyou bring into that, say, Regular Army unit a guardsman and reservist--\nthe Senator well understands that young people exchange with each other \ntheir own pay and background and one thing and another--and suddenly, \nyou have two sergeants, equally competent to operate that tank or \nartillery piece or Humvee, whatever the case may be, and one is getting \nthis bump up in pay from, again, the Federal Government as opposed to \nthe State and the other is not, it causes a friction. This is the main \nconcern I have. I just wonder to what extent my colleague has thought \nthrough that issue.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, and \nalso for his leadership on this bill.\n  Retired MG Bob McIntosh of the Reserve Officers Association has \ntestified on this same issue. He said he does not believe that people \nin the military sit around comparing pay stubs. But if they did, I am \nafraid the Senator's argument would lead us to conclude that we have to \nstop State and local governments from providing additional pay because \nthat, too, is a differential being provided out of the largess and \ncharity--charity is not the right word; it is really a payment that is \nmade because of a sense of obligation to the family involved. But it is \na payment that is made.\n  In my State of Illinois and your State of Virginia and in the State \nof Alaska, you have the decision that, when your State employee is \nactivated, the State is going to send them the pay differential. So you \nwill have two sergeants: one in Virginia who might be receiving this \npay differential, and one from the Federal Government who does not.\n  So in my way of thinking, we should be encouraging all of these \nemployers to stand by their people. We are more dependent on the Guard \nand Reserves now than ever in our history. We want to have good \nrecruitment, good retention. I think if we have more employers standing \nbehind those men and women, it is going to help us keep and attract the \nvery best.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I see that argument very clearly. Of course, you \nknow the Army proudly has this motto: ``We are one,'' which means every \nsoldier can do a variety of things, and whether you are a guard or \nreservist, you are respected now just as much as that career person.\n  Do you have that list of 22 States? I think we have it over here on \nour side. I would like to look at that.\n\n[[Page S7033]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to show you.\n  Mr. WARNER. Do most of those States do both their National Guard as \nwell as their Reserves or do they just do their Guard?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, I am not certain as I stand here. I \ndo not want to mislead him, so I will check into that. But I think they \ndo cover the Guard, and I will find out specifically whether they cover \nthe Reserves as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. President, I am going to ask that a quorum call be put in while I \nhave an opportunity to take some of the facts which the Senator \ndelivered in his very comprehensive opening statement and check them \nout.\n  As I am doing that, would you prefer to go on to your other \namendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, the pending \namendment is set aside so the Senator may offer another amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3225\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3225.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3225.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require certain dietary supplement manufacturers to report \n                    certain serious adverse events)\n\n       On page 147, after line 21, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 717. REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE HEALTH EXPERIENCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense may not permit a \n     dietary supplement containing a stimulant to be sold on a \n     military installation unless the manufacturer of such dietary \n     supplement submits any report of a serious adverse health \n     experience associated with such dietary supplement to the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, who shall make such \n     reports available to the Surgeon Generals of the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (b) Effect of Section.--Notwithstanding section 201(ff)(2) \n     of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n     321(ff)(2)) and paragraph (3) of subsection (c), this section \n     does not apply to a dietary supplement containing caffeine \n     that is intended to be consumed in liquid form.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) The term ``dietary supplement'' has the same meaning \n     given the term in section 201(ff) of the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)).\n       (2) The term ``serious adverse health experience'' means an \n     adverse event that is associated with the use of a dietary \n     supplement in a human, without regard to whether the event is \n     known to be causally related to the dietary supplement, \n     that--\n       (A) results in--\n       (i) death;\n       (ii) a life-threatening condition;\n       (iii) inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of \n     hospitalization;\n       (iv) a persistent or significant disability or incapacity; \n     or\n       (v) a congenital anomaly, birth defect, or other effect \n     regarding pregnancy, including premature labor or low birth \n     weight; or\n       (B) requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 \n     of the outcomes described in clauses (i) through (v) in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (3) The term ``stimulant'' means a dietary ingredient that \n     has a stimulant effect on the cardiovascular system or the \n     central nervous system of a human by any means, including--\n       (A) speeding metabolism;\n       (B) increasing heart rate;\n       (C) constricting blood vessels; or\n       (D) causing the body to release adrenaline.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to the bill because \nof a serious health danger which exists in America and one that has \nbeen demonstrated clearly on military bases.\n  Military personnel are under unusual pressure to be physically fit. \nThe conditions under which they work and train are often harsh and \ndemanding, making physical strength and endurance essential. The \npressure makes dietary supplements particularly attractive to members \nof our armed services, especially products marketed for weight loss and \nperformance enhancement.\n  A 1999 study by the U.S. Army Research Institute for Environmental \nMedicine found that 85 percent of the more than 2,200 male soldiers \nsurveyed reported using dietary supplements. A military study conducted \nby the Department of the Navy found that overall 73 percent of \npersonnel reported a history of supplement use, with the numbers as \nhigh as 89 percent among marines. When broken down by supplement \ncategory, the survey by the Department of the Navy showed that 26 \npercent of marines took supplements containing stimulants.\n  Most dietary supplements are safe and provide health benefits to \nthose who take them. This morning I took my vitamins. I don't know if \nit will make me live longer. I hope it will. I don't think it did me \nany harm. Millions of Americans take vitamins and minerals every \nmorning believing it is good for them. They are probably right. Medical \nscience proves that.\n  Within the category of dietary supplements, however, are not just \nvitamins and minerals but other combinations of chemicals, some \nnaturally occurring, which are not as benign as the vitamins and \nminerals we take in the morning. There are some supplements, \nspecifically those containing stimulants, which are often marketed for \nenergy promotion, performance enhancement, and weight loss. We know \nthey can cause harm.\n  Between 1997 and 2001, 30 Active-Duty personnel in America's Armed \nForces died after taking dietary supplements containing ephedra. That \nwas a supplement marketed across the United States with names such as \nMetabolife for weight loss and energy. Eventually that substance was \nbanned by the Federal Government, by my State of Illinois, and others. \nIt had already been banned by the U.S. military, the nation of Canada, \nbanned for use in athletics on the professional level, and by the NCAA, \nbut it has been banned now by the FDA.\n  A list of adverse events related to dietary supplements released by \nthe Navy includes health events such as death, rapid heart rate, \nshortness of breath, severe chest pain, and becoming increasingly \ndelusional. These are members of the Armed Forces who are going to base \nexchanges and buying dietary supplements which are dangerous. They look \nat what is printed on the bottle. They think they are safe. They buy \nthem with sometimes disastrous results.\n  Unfortunately, most of the time adverse events such as those I \ndescribed are not even known to the Food and Drug Administration or to \nthe public because the companies that make the products don't report \nthese bad results. If you walk into a drugstore today, anyplace in \nAmerica, and you go to the prescription counter with your prescription \nfrom the doctor and you get the pills, here is what you know about the \npills you are holding. They have been clinically tested for safety so \nthat you can be reasonably sure that if you ingest them you will not \ndie, and that they are likely to achieve the result they are supposed \nto achieve.\n  Secondly, if something goes wrong with one of those pills, if you \ntake it and get sick and notify the company, they are bound by law to \nnotify the Food and Drug Administration. If something happens, the Food \nand Drug Administration says: We may have to remove this from the \nmarket to make sure it is still safe. That is the law that applies to \nprescription drugs.\n\n  Now go to the over-the-counter drugs where you don't need a \nprescription. Have they been tested? The component parts of virtually \nall over-the-counter drugs have gone through the same testing to make \nsure they are safe and effective.\n  Now move over to the section of the drugstore that has the vitamins, \nminerals, and dietary supplements. None of those rules apply. There has \nbeen no testing of that dietary supplement which says it is going to \ngive you energy or help you lose weight, no testing whatsoever.\n  Let me take that back. The testing is taking place as you buy it. You \nare the test case, as the consumer. You are ingesting this compound to \nsee what happens. But safety testing of the dietary supplement is not \nrequired. What happens if they are dangerous, like ephedra? What if \nthey cause people to have a stroke, heart attack, high blood pressure, \nor death? Does the company that makes the dietary supplement have any \nobligation to notify the Government that the product is dangerous? \nAbsolutely not, no requirement whatsoever. That adverse event reporting \nfor prescription drugs does not apply to dietary supplements.\n\n[[Page S7034]]\n\n  My amendment would require manufacturers of dietary supplements that \nsell supplements containing stimulants on military installations to \nturn over to the FDA serious adverse event reports relating to their \nproducts. These would include adverse events such as death, life-\nthreatening condition, hospitalization, persistent disability or \nincapacity, or birth defects. We made a specific exemption in this \namendment for supplement beverages containing caffeine, such as tea and \nsports drinks.\n  The Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services estimated in 2001 that less than 1 percent of all \nadverse events associated with dietary supplements are reported to the \nFDA. The Institute of Medicine issued a report last month recommending \nthat adverse event reporting become mandatory for dietary supplement \nmanufacturers.\n  They asserted that:\n\n       While spontaneous adverse event reports have recognized \n     limitations, they have considerable strength as potential \n     warning signals of problems requiring attention, making \n     monitoring by the FDA worthwhile.\n\n  The Institute of Medicine recommended that Congress amend the 1994 \nsupplement law, DSHEA, and require manufacturers of supplements to \nreport to the FDA in a timely manner any serious adverse event \nassociated with their products.\n  The men and women in uniform serving this country face enough danger \nin the field. They should not have to worry about the so-called health \nproducts being sold on military bases with the approval of the Federal \nGovernment that may, in fact, be dangerous to their health. This is the \nminimum we should require of companies selling dietary supplements on \nmilitary bases, that they be forced to notify the FDA if the product \nthey are selling to our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and members \nof the Coast Guard are, in fact, dangerous and cause serious adverse \nhealth events such as death and stroke.\n  In closing, let me tell you what the dietary supplement industry is \ndoing to lobby against this amendment. This is an outrage. This \nmultibillion-dollar industry that sells dietary supplement products all \nacross America without testing them to make sure they are safe and \nwithout reporting to the Federal Government when they become lethal and \nkill people opposes my amendment which would require that they notify \nthe FDA when people face stroke and adverse events, death and serious \nhealth consequences.\n  This is what they are saying on their e-mail to their customers: The \nDurbin bill will hold dietary supplements to a higher level of scrutiny \nthan prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and food additives. \nThey are wrong. Supplements face none of the up-front scrutiny that \nprescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and food additives face, nor \nare they required to report adverse events as prescription drugs are.\n  The standard we are establishing is the same standard. They should \nlive by the same standard. We lost 30 American soldiers to these \ndietary supplements, which were lethal. At this point in time, as a \nminimum, we should require these companies to report to the FDA, when \ntheir products are killing people. If they will not report, they should \nnot be allowed to sell their product on military bases. The military \nbanned ephedra when they found out it was killing our soldiers.\n  We should not test-market dietary supplements on our soldiers. That \nis what my amendment will do. I hope the Senate will adopt it and that \nwe will show concern for the military and their families and protect \nthem as we should protect every American consumer.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be set \naside. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, regarding \nthe second amendment we are currently on, I would like to reserve the \nright to have an amendment in the second degree. I want to make that \nclear. We will lay this aside, and one of our colleagues, who is as \nactive in this field as the Senator is, wishes to address a certain \naspect of this amendment.\n  For the time being, this amendment will be laid aside until, \nhopefully, some time Monday when our colleague will have time.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Durbin was only asking for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, regarding the first amendment, during the \ncourse of the colloquy with the Senator from New Jersey, if he would \nlike to speak with me, I have some thoughts on that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3291\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3291.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3291.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to offer a fairly \nstraightforward amendment to this bill. The amendment will change the \nflawed policy that currently prevents media access to the arrival of \ndeceased military personnel from overseas. I include access by the \nfamilies as well.\n  On the eve of the Iraq invasion, the Department of Defense issued the \nfollowing bizarre directive:\n\n       There will be no arrival ceremonies for, or media coverage \n     of, deceased military personnel returning to or departing \n     from Ramstein (Germany) Airbase or Dover (Delaware) base.\n\n  With this order, the administration effectively blocked images of \nflag-draped coffins from appearing in the media coverage of this war. \nIt is very hard to understand that decision. I and my colleague from \nNew Jersey, Senator Corzine, went to Arlington Cemetery this week to \nhonor the funeral and burial of one of four New Jersey guardsmen who \nwere killed last week. I was struck by the ceremony. I have seen such \nceremonies before, but in Arlington it has a special significance. \nThousands of our comrades in arms from different wars are at rest \nthere. But in the formal ceremony, it was particularly noteworthy that \nthe flag was handled by the honor guard in such a way that every fold, \nevery edge was perfectly handled by this obviously well-trained honor \nguard. When the final recipient among the guard was handed the flag, \nfolded in triangular form, he took it, almost reverently, and carried \nit over to the mother of this young man who was killed. What a touching \nmoment.\n  Even though there were no direct photographs, it is permanently \netched in the minds of those who viewed this ceremony. The symbolism of \nthe American flag covering the coffins of those killed doing their duty \nhas been televised as never before, and journalists are embedded in \ntanks with combat units. But by the order of the Pentagon, the solemn \nhomecoming of the dead--a time-honored tradition--was forbidden to be \nphotographed or to appear on a television screen. Perhaps--just \nperhaps--the American people might believe that the reports on the \ndeaths of our soldiers are somehow exaggerated, and this time-honored \nrespect for giving one's life in battle for his country--an honor by \nhaving a flag draped over that coffin--was going to be ended. In seeing \nthese coffins, the American public would make it impossible not to \nshare the sorrow of the families who received them. You didn't have to \nknow who was in that coffin, or the family, to know there was another \nAmerican hero being returned to his country.\n  Seeing the returning coffins prompted a national sense of shared pain \nand sacrifice and despair. But during this war, the administration has \nchosen to fence itself in and ban cameras not only from the central \nmilitary morgue at Dover Air Force Base but also make it difficult for \nthe press to access the Walter Reed Army Medical Center here in \nWashington.\n\n[[Page S7035]]\n\n  I visited Walter Reed this week with Senator Corzine after we left \nArlington Cemetery. We felt it was appropriate to visit with those who \nwere wounded and being treated at Walter Reed from the same contingent, \nfrom the Guard company that was attacked so ferociously. We talked to \nthe soldiers who were there with their families. When you see the pain \nand suffering of those people, you realize how brave and courageous \nthey had been.\n  I talked to one man, who is now sightless, looking blankly into \nspace. His wife was sitting there with him. He thanked us for visiting. \nHe said he would never again see his 20-month-old daughter. But that \nwould not prevent him from holding her in his arms. He was anxious to \nget back home to do that. He wanted to return to his fatherly status. \nHe talked of his faith and loyalty to his country. That is a message \nthat ought to go out across America. Why should the press be deprived \nfrom an orderly visit, prearranged, to talk to a young man like \nthat, to see the incredible spirit that accompanied this man's faith.\n\n  As a result of the current policy at the Pentagon, the over 830 \nservice men and women who died in Iraq passed through a politically \nimposed void hiding the truth. Even during the Afghanistan war, flag-\ndraped coffins were filmed, and during the Kosovo conflict, President \nBill Clinton was on the tarmac to receive U.S. dead.\n  In 1983, one of the most revered people in American history, \nPresident Reagan, personally and publicly received the bodies of 241 \nmarines who were killed by terrorists in Beirut, Lebanon.\n  I believe the current Pentagon directive is an attempt to manipulate \npublic opinion or make this war pass something that is called the \n``Dover test,'' as the Pentagon itself has coined it.\n  The Dover test dictates that the Pentagon should suppress images of \ncoffins returning from overseas in order to prevent the American people \nfrom seeing the real sacrifices that are being made.\n  The current policy has nothing to do with the privacy of the deceased \nor their families, as the administration claims. Rather, this policy \nhas everything to do with keeping the country from facing the realities \nof war, shielding Americans from the high price our young service \npeople are paying.\n  My amendment is straightforward. It simply instructs the Department \nof Defense to work out a protocol so that the media can respectfully \ncover the return to the United States of these heroes who died serving \ntheir country.\n  The amendment specifically states that the new protocol must preserve \nthe dignity of the occasion and protect the privacy of the families. I \nagree with that statement. The amendment requires the Pentagon to \nreport to Congress on the new protocol within 60 days of enactment of \nthis bill.\n  The American people deserve to know and see the truth about the cost \nof the war in Iraq. My amendment will bring an end to this shroud of \nsecrecy cloaking the hard, difficult truth about the war and the \nsacrifices of our soldiers.\n  Our soldiers are fighting for democracy, fighting for a free press in \nIraq. Yet our Government is censoring the press here. It is not right \nand is out of line with American values.\n  My amendment is supported by leading media associations, including \nthe American Society of Newspaper Editors, and in my view, we should \nembrace a free press in this country and not fear it. There are heroes \nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice in this war for our country. Let's \nnot censor the honor they earn when they return to our shores.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I always enjoy debating my good friend \nfrom New Jersey. I have fond memories of a recent trip we took to the \n60th anniversary of D-day when he told me some of his own personal \nexperiences as a young soldier in the closing moments of World War II, \nserving with our forces in Germany. He is a modest man and does not \ntalk about it much, but he is one of the few remaining veterans of \nWorld War II in the Senate.\n  I wonder if the Senator might go back to that reference in his \nstatement about the Beirut bombing. Mr. President, would the Senator \nfrom New Jersey repeat that because it invoked a memory I have? Did he \nnot talk about how President Reagan went down--I wonder if he will, \nonce again, recite that very important chapter of history.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. I did say President Reagan made a point of \nwelcoming the bodies back to this country, 241 of those marines who \ndied in Beirut, and I pointed to the fact that this President, to whom \nwe just said goodbye and who was revered by so many in this country, \nfelt in his heart that it was something he should do. It is so contrary \nto what is happening now. It does not make sense to me.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if my dear friend will indulge me my own \nrecollection, when that tragic incident happened in Beirut, Senator \nTower was the leader of the Republican side of our committee, and I was \nsort of one of the junior members. I remember he came into my office \nand said: We are leaving for Beirut in 2 hours. If you have time to \npack a bag, pack it; otherwise, just bring a toothbrush.\n  We went over there and saw the tragedy that had befallen our marines. \nI will never forget it. When we came back on the plane, we talked a \nlittle bit, and President Reagan did receive the benefit of our trip. \nHe was deeply moved by that incident.\n  I cannot recall exactly the days thereafter when we were working with \nbringing the remains home, but I let it be known to the President that \nmaybe this would be an opportunity to send a strong message of his deep \nbereavement for the losses and the resolve that he had to challenge \nthose who brought this about and bring to accountability those who \nperpetrated that crime. We suggested he go down, and sure enough he did \ngo.\n  I was privileged he asked if I would come down with him. It was a day \nI will never forget. It was a cold and rainy day. Because of the number \nof caskets, it was on the outside largely. I recall the schedule, as \nall Presidential schedules are detailed, and I had a little copy in my \npocket.\n  He went down to speak to some of the families. It was just \nmagnificent the way this President stood in that cold rain and spoke to \nthem. He turned to me and he said: You know, we should stay and speak \nto every single family member. He did that. We found the time to go \ndown very orderly and speak to every single family member.\n  The commanding officer of Camp Lejeune was MG Al Gray. Gray is an \nextraordinary man. He came up through the ranks in the Marine Corps to \nbecome a general. He knew the name--I don't recall he even used any \nnotes--of everyone there, and he stood side by side with the President. \nI was just a few feet to one side going through and talked to the \nPresident. If a wife or a loved one wanted to hug the President, the \nPresident hugged them. It was remarkable. It was one of the most \nextraordinary moments in my long career of working with the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces and a series of Presidents over the many \nyears.\n\n  I am glad the Senator from New Jersey brought that up because that \nattack, in a sense, caught this Nation by surprise. We were ill-\nequipped. I don't know that the Senator from New Jersey would have any \nreason to remember this, but the guards around the barracks could not \neven have live ammo in their weapons to try and deter an attack. We \nwere relying on host country security and the like. But that is an \nincident which I commend the Senator again for bringing up, but we \ncould not, in my judgment, replicate that today because of the \nregrettable constancy of bringing back our beloved lost ones in the \npresent conflicts, be they Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3458 To Amendment No. 3291\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is for that reason that I send to the \ndesk a second-degree amendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3458 to amendment No. 3291.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To propose a substitute expressing the sense of Congress on \n  media coverage of the return to the United States of the remains of \n          deceased members of the Armed Forces from overseas)\n\n       Strike the matter proposed to be inserted, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 364. MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES \n                   OF THE REMAINS OF DECEASED MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n                   FORCES FROM OVERSEAS.\n\n         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n         (1) The Department of Defense, since 1991, has relied on \n     a policy of no media coverage of the transfers of the remains \n     of members Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany, nor at Dover Air \n     Force Base, Delaware, and the Port Mortuary Facility at Dover \n     Air Force Base, nor at interim stops en route to the point of \n     final destination in the transfer of the remains.\n         (2) The principal focus and purpose of the policy is to \n     protect the wishes and the privacy of families of deceased \n     members of the Armed Forces during their time of great loss \n     and grief and to give families and friends of the dead the \n     privilege to decide whether to allow media coverage at the \n     member's duty or home station, at the interment site, or at \n     or in connection with funeral and memorial services.\n         (3) In a 1991 legal challenge to the Department of \n     Defense policy, as applied during Operation Desert Storm, the \n     policy was upheld by the United States District Court for the \n     District of Columbia, and on appeal, by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the case of \n     JB Pictures, Inc. v. Department of Defense and Donald B. \n     Rice, Secretary of the Air Force on the basis that denying \n     the media the right to view the return of remains at Dover \n     Air Force Base does not violate the first amendment \n     guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.\n         (4) The United States Court of Appeals for the District \n     of Columbia in that case cited the following two key \n     Government interests that are served by the Department of \n     Defense policy:\n         (A) Reducing the hardship on the families and friends of \n     the war dead, who may feel obligated to travel great \n     distances to attend arrival ceremonies at Dover Air Force \n     Base if such ceremonies were held.\n         (B) Protecting the privacy of families and friends of the \n     dead, who may not want media coverage of the unloading of \n     caskets at Dover Air Force Base.\n         (5) The Court also noted, in that case, that the bereaved \n     may be upset at the public display of the caskets of their \n     loved ones and that the policy gives the family the right to \n     grant or deny access to the media at memorial or funeral \n     services at the home base and that the policy is consistent \n     in its concern for families.\n         (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Department of Defense policy regarding no media coverage \n     of the transfer of the remains of deceased members of the \n     Armed Forces appropriately protects the privacy of the \n     members' families and friends of and is consistent with \n     United States constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech \n     and freedom of the press.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I share in many ways the objectives of my good friend and \ncolleague from New Jersey. As I said, I respect his own service in the \nmilitary where both he and I have been along with the loved ones of \nthose who have given their lives in situations, and I am sure both of \nus, in the course of our long public careers, have attended many \nfunerals with those loved ones.\n  This substitute is carefully thought through and I hope the Senator \nwill take a look at it. I would like to read it.\n\n       The Department of Defense, since 1991, has relied on a \n     policy of no media coverage of the transfers of the remains \n     of members to Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany, nor at Dover \n     Air Force Base, Delaware, and the Port Mortuary Facility at \n     Dover Air Force Base, nor at interim stops en route to the \n     point of final destination in the transfer of the remains.\n\n  Now, that final point is basically where the families of the deceased \nare located. Continuing:\n\n       The principal focus and purpose of the policy is to protect \n     the wishes and the privacy of families of deceased members of \n     the Armed Forces during their time of great loss and grief \n     and to give families and friends of the dead the privilege to \n     decide whether to allow media coverage at the member's duty \n     or home station--\n\n  That refers to the final destination of the transfer of the remains--\n\n     at the interment site, or at or in connection with funeral or \n     memorial services.\n\n  Those could be elsewhere selected by the family.\n\n       In a 1991 legal challenge to the Department of Defense \n     policy, as applied during Operation Desert Storm, the policy \n     was upheld by the United States District Court for the \n     District of Columbia, and on appeal, by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the case of \n     JB Pictures, Inc. v. Department of Defense and Donald B. \n     Rice, Secretary of the Air Force [86 Fed. 3rd 236, 1996] on \n     the basis that denying the media the right to view the return \n     of remains at Dover Air Force Base does not violate the first \n     amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia in that case cited the following two key Government \n     interests that are served by the Department of Defense \n     policy:\n       Reducing the hardship on the families and friends of the \n     war dead, who may feel obligated to travel great distances to \n     attend arrival ceremonies at Dover Air Force Base if such \n     ceremonies were held.\n       Protecting the privacy of families and friends of the dead, \n     who may not want media coverage of the unloading of caskets \n     at Dover Air Force Base.\n\n  Especially when their loved one may be among them.\n\n       The Court also noted, in that case, that the bereaved may \n     be upset at the public displays of the caskets of their loved \n     ones and that the policy gives the family the right to grant \n     or deny access to the media at memorial or funeral services \n     at the home base and that the policy is consistent in its \n     concern for families.\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Department of Defense \n     policy regarding no media coverage of the transfer of the \n     remains of deceased members of the Armed Forces appropriately \n     protects the privacy of the members' families and friends and \n     is consistent with United States constitutional guarantees of \n     freedom of speech and freedom of the press--\n\n  As determined by the Federal courts. I would like the Senator's views \non that approach.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my colleague and friend from Virginia. We \nhave shared many experiences. One of them is reaching a particular age \nwhen memories go back a long, long time.\n  The recall that the Senator from Virginia just delivered to us about \nPresident Reagan's sensitivity and the part that my friend was able to \nplay, viewing all of that and trying to expedite things, it is a \nwonderful recall as to what happened with a very sensitive President.\n  I traveled to Beirut--and that was my freshman year in 1983--and I \nwas there between the killing of the 241 and the killing of 8 more that \nthe Senator recalls a few weeks later. It was a disastrous scene and \nleft an impression that one can never forget of these young people in \ntheir sleep taken from us. I never recall hearing one family saying too \nmuch exposure resulted from that. I did not hear anybody ever say to \nthe public, my son, in an unidentified casket, should not be honored in \na generic way with his comrades who also are fallen in pursuit of an \nAmerican objective.\n  As the Senator was recalling his views and offering this amendment, I \nlooked at some information we have, a New York Times/CBS poll from \nSeptember 2003 that found 62 percent of Americans said the public \nshould be allowed to see pictures of the military Honor Guard receiving \nthe coffins of these soldiers killed in Iraq as they return to the \nUnited States. There were 27 percent who said no.\n  In response to our good friend's concerns about whether families \nmight be inconvenienced if they are called to Dover, DE, or perhaps \nembarrassed somehow or another, they do not have to go. That is not \nwhat my amendment says. It says that media should not be prohibited \nfrom going there and taking a picture and saying here is a picture of \nunknown heroes.\n  We walked in Normandy together just a week ago, and I saw lots of \ncrosses and Stars of David. I looked at some of the stones and saw a \nlot of them had a New Jersey home when they left, but I looked at one \nstone and it just gave me such a shock because it said on this stone, \nhere lies a valued comrade known but to God.\n  The unknown soldier of a family who lost a brother, a son, a father \nwill never know what happened to them, but they were respected in that \npiece of turf with their colleagues who had fallen.\n  I get very emotional when I think about the days that I enlisted in \nthe Army. I was 18. My father was on his deathbed, 42 years old. My \nmother was about to become a 36-year-old widow, and what it meant to me \nto join with all of my other comrades to try to do something. The \npromise I had from the Army was they would give me until my father's \ndeath so I would know that I would be home with my mother.\n  I went, and although I did not serve in active combat, lots of people \nI know\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n\ndied. We were attacked by German bombs constantly. Those days meant so \nmuch. Then there were the opportunities that were given to us: a \ncollege education, an opportunity to serve our country even more \nforthrightly.\n  So when I look at veterans and visit the hospital, I see a fellow who \nhas one limb remaining, a prosthetic on his arm, prosthetics on his \nlegs, learning to walk that way, I say, by God, what a price we paid. \nHow dare we not honor them in the most obvious ways.\n  I hope I can have a talk with my friend and colleague from Virginia--\nnot to cover this issue with anything but a determination to say if \nsomeone has died for their country and we take that flag and put it on \nthat casket, they have received the honor of their country, every one \nof the 280 million citizens we have here. When that flag is placed \nthere it says your country loves you and they are terribly saddened by \nwhat happened to you. I believe that practice should be made obvious to \nthe public. It is not the display of the coffin I am looking for; it is \na display of our honoring this individual. It is the way to do that.\n  I hope the good Senator's second-degree amendment can stand alone. \nLet this first amendment be considered. It is just to say we are not \ngoing to hide anything. The public is going to know that in that box \nlies a young man or a young woman who gave his or her life in pursuit \nof the country's interests.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are rare moments in the life of the \nSenate. I have enjoyed our colloquy. The Senator has raised one of the \nmost important issues that will be considered on this bill. Despite all \nthe billions and billions of dollars, some $420 billion involved in \nthis bill, this is a matter of principle of the greatest concern to \nevery single Member. Therefore, I am going to ask that this amendment \nbe laid aside so the Senator and I can resume this debate on Monday and \nlet each one of our colleagues have the benefit of our thoughts and \nhave the opportunity to do some careful study of the different \nproposals, the one you have submitted and the one I have submitted.\n  May I suggest, however, with regard to yours, there may be one \ntechnical thing you might wish to reflect on, and that is the use of \nthe word ``killed.'' You limit it to the people who have been killed \noverseas. There are some who lost their lives overseas other than in \nsituations that would be characterized as ``killed.'' I would broaden \nthat definition, if I were you, to include those who for other reasons \nmight have lost their lives but who deserve, no less, the recognition \nwhich my distinguished colleague from New Jersey wishes to accord them.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Toward the end of my amendment I use the term \n``died.'' That is an appropriate correction. I would certainly accept \nthat.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I think you do refer to that. But to make it clear, \nyou might wish to broaden it.\n  Mr. President, at this time--unless there is further debate from my \ndistinguished colleague?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I wonder if the Senator from Virginia would confirm \nat this point that we will vote on this amendment whether it carries \nthe second degree or it does not?\n  Mr. WARNER. At this point in time I would like to leave it in the \nstatus it is in, assuring you that you have my personal assurance, \nbecause of my personal respect for you and the contents of this \namendment and its importance, that it will be treated with eminent \nfairness. No procedural mechanisms will be utilized in any way to \ndeprive the Senator of an opportunity for his debate to be heard and \nconsidered.\n  I thank my friend. I would only conclude: One of the great values in \nmaking a trip with a fellow Senator--no matter how long you have served \nwith them and visited with them, there are some things about their life \nwhich are fascinating. I hope someday you tell the story about how you \nwere in the Army over there, and both you and I were communicators, and \nat times in our careers we used to climb up the poles to get the wires \nthat transmitted the signals and orders to those at the front. While \nyou were on top of the pole, a Buzz Bomb--I wonder if even a few \nrealize that weapon was employed by Hitler in the final months of the \nwar, which is a very lethal and dangerous weapon. But that is for \nanother day. The Chamber should hear that story.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In those days the Germans would knock down the wires \nand I would put them up, they would knock them down, I would put them \nup, but somehow we survived.\n  Mr. WARNER. But to be on top of that pole and to get down in safety \nfrom the Buzz Bomb--that was a trip.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3353\n\n  Mr. REED. I call up amendment No. 3353.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering if my friend from Rhode \nIsland would yield? He would get the floor as soon as Senator Dayton \ntakes a minute to introduce a bill as in morning business. Will the \nSenator allow us to do that? We promised him some time yesterday.\n  Mr. REED. I have no objections. I understand Senator Sessions also--\n--\n  Mr. REID. But you already have your amendment pending here. Has it \nbeen reported?\n  Mr. REED. It is being reported right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3353.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the obligation and expenditure of funds for the \n  Ground-based Midcourse Defense program pending the submission of a \n               report on operational test and evaluation)\n\n       On page 33, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 224. LIMITATION ON OBLIGATION AND EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS \n                   FOR GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE PROGRAM \n                   PENDING SUBMISSION OF OPERATIONAL TEST REPORT.\n\n       Of the amount authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year \n     2005 by section 201(4) for research, development, test, and \n     evaluation, Defense-wide, and available for the Missile \n     Defense Agency for Ground-based Midcourse interceptors, and \n     long-lead items for such interceptors, $550,500,000 may not \n     be obligated or expended until the occurrence of each of the \n     following:\n       (1) The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation has \n     approved, in writing, the adequacy of the plans (including \n     the projected level of funding) for operational test and \n     evaluation to be conducted in connection with the Ground-\n     based Midcourse Defense program in accordance with section \n     2399(b)(1) of title 10, United States Code.\n       (2) Initial operational test and evaluation of the program \n     is completed in accordance with section 2399(a)(1) of such \n     title.\n       (3) The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation has \n     submitted to the Secretary of Defense and the congressional \n     defense committees a report stating whether the test and \n     evaluation performed were adequate and whether the results of \n     the test and evaluation confirm that the Ground-based \n     Midcourse Defense system is effective and suitable for \n     combat, in accordance with section 2399(b)(3) of such title.\n       (4) The congressional defense committees have received the \n     report under paragraph (3).\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Minnesota be \nrecognized and be able to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes, \nand the Senator from Rhode Island then regain the floor to discuss his \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Unshackle Seniors Act\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for making that \narrangement. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for giving me that \nopportunity and also the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for allowing this as well.\n  I will be introducing my Unshackle Seniors Act, which will allow \nseniors and others who are on Medicare to purchase their Medicare \ndiscount cards as they choose and to cancel their participation with \nfull refunds and other returns whenever the cards are changed in their \ncoverage or their discounts.\n  As you know, last year Congress passed a prescription drug coverage \nplan that was far different from the Senate-passed version which I \nsupported. I voted against the final conference report after voting for \nthe Senate bill. I did so for several reasons, but one was the \nexcessive delay until the actual program would begin, which \nnecessitated these drug discount cards\n\n[[Page S7038]]\n\nbeing made available until the program begins in January of 2006, which \nis over 2 years after the bill's passage. Until then, seniors are going \nto be able to sign up for only one, just one drug discount card and \nonly one for that entire year, even though the care plan providers can \nchange the coverage and the amount of the discount they are choosing.\n  What kind of deal is that, where seniors are stuck with one card for \nthe entire year, but the plan can be changed at the discretion of the \nprovider, yet seniors can't change theirs accordingly? My bill would \nunshackle seniors from that restriction and would allow them to \npurchase as many drug discount cards as they choose and also grant them \na full refund whenever the card providers change the coverage or the \ndiscount, thereby unshackling seniors from this ridiculous restriction \nthat works to the benefit of providers rather than the patients.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3353\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I understand my amendment has been reported \nand we are on the amendment now. Let me endeavor to explain the \namendment and do it as quickly as possible.\n  The amendment I support today would provide a condition on the \nacquisition of interceptors 21 through 30 of the national missile \ndefense. The condition would be that the operational testing would be \ncompleted--or initiated, at least--prior to the acquisition of these \nmissiles.\n  In a sense, it embraces two issues. The first issue is the unwise \nacquisition of another 10 missiles beyond the 20 that already have been \ndesigned for this initial rudimentary deployment of the national \nmissile defense system. That issue is one. The second issue, again, is \nthe issue of making sure we have realistic operational testing.\n  Yesterday we engaged in a very vigorous debate. I believe the debate \nwas productive. My legislation, as amended by that of Chairman Warner, \nwould require realistic testing. In fact, it set a date of October 1, \n2005, to complete such testing. But I do believe it is important to \nonce again look at this issue of testing, particularly in the context \nof the acquisition of these additional missile systems.\n  Initially, when the administration talked about the rudimentary \ndeployment of a national missile defense system, they conceived of a \nsystem with 20 interceptors. Suddenly, this year, they have moved \nforward and added an additional 10 interceptors, interceptors 21 \nthrough 30. More than that, they requested an additional long lead time \nfunding for interceptors 31 through 40.\n  That is an unwise use of very scarce resources at a time when we are \ntrying to expand the size of the Army, when we are trying to do so many \nthings that are putting huge pressure on the bottom line of the \nDepartment of Defense. It is unwise. We are talking about an extremely \npremature acquisition of missiles before we have ``proved out'' the \nsystem.\n  I was struck yesterday when Senator Allard submitted a letter from \nThomas Christie, Director of the Office of Director, Operational Test \nand Evaluation at the Pentagon. Dr. Christie said:\n\n       The Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element is \n     currently at a maturity level that requires continued \n     developmental testing with oversight assistance from \n     operational test personnel. Conducting realistic operational \n     testing in the near-term for the GMD element would be \n     premature and not beneficial to the program.\n\n  We have the chief testing official in the Department of Defense \nsaying this system is so immature that we cannot even do operational \ntests. Yet in this proposal, the administration is asking to go ahead \nand buy additional interceptors that have not yet been adequately \nproven and adequately tested. Once again, it is a misuse of very scarce \nresources.\n  I have no qualm today with acquiring the 20 interceptors initially \nplanned for the system. But to go beyond that is a mistake in terms of \nusing scarce resources for, basically, unproven interceptors.\n  It is useful to review the situation of this midcourse ground system \nand where we are in terms of the system. First, as I mentioned \nyesterday, one of the key elements is a DSP satellite system that will \nmonitor the initial launch of a missile. That is from a cold war legacy \nsystem. It is reliable; it is limited. You simply identify the lift-off \nof the aggression missile.\n  The second part of the system is the Aegis ships which have been \npressed into service. They were originally designed simply to track and \nto defend against cruise missiles and aircraft. Now they have been \ngiven this extra task of trying to monitor the target as it rises out \nof the North Korean peninsula headed toward--we hope never but at least \nhypothetically--the United States.\n  A third element is the Cobra Dane radar, another system of 1970 \nvintage, designed not for missile defense but for looking at Russian \nmissiles and their missile rangers. It is not even capable, most people \nconcede, of tracking effectively a missile bound for Hawaii. It has \nbeen upgraded but still it is not the X-band radar, the big powerful \nradar originally designed for the system.\n  Then there is the interceptors element which is the subject of this \namendment. Originally, as I indicated, the plan was to have 20. Now the \nadministration is talking about 40. The interceptors have not been \ntested together with the new ``kill'' vehicle. In fact, the new kill \nvehicle, the warhead that sits on top, has not even been flight tested. \nAs a result, we are rushing into this deployment. In fact, the whole \nsystem has not been tested. So bits and pieces have been tested. It is \npremature to go ahead now and ramp up production of these missiles.\n\n  If it turns out there is a systematic flaw in the missiles, and they \nhave been acquired and deployed, if they have not been worked on in the \nsilo, they will have to be removed from the silo and transported. It is \nvery expensive.\n  I beg the obvious question. If we have not tested the system \nadequately, if we are planning for years now to have a 20-interceptor \nstructure of our missiles, why are we rushing ahead now and buying \nadditional missiles? My amendment says, at least before we get to this \npoint of buying the additional missiles, we should be in the area of \nplanning and carrying out realistic operational testing.\n  Yesterday, again, we had a very good debate. We were able to make \nsome progress. But I point out again, the amendment proposed by Senator \nWarner, and adopted to change my language, moves the responsibility \nfrom the Office of Director of Operational Test and Evaluation of the \nPentagon to the Secretary of Defense. It takes away that objective \nindependent voice, which is the traditional way in which we evaluate \nany weapon system, not just the missile defense system.\n  I hope by the time we get around to making these acquisitions, \nacquiring interceptors 21 through 30 and 21 through 40, that we would \nnot have the specialized testing regime under the Secretary of Defense, \nand that we would be back in a situation where we are doing operational \ntesting the way it was designed and carried out.\n  That is the essence of my amendment. It would not in any way inhibit \nthe deployment of the system. It would not in any way try to shrink the \nnumber below 20, which has been the plan for years. It would not \ndecrease funding for missile defense. If this operational testing \nregime was in place, then these 21 through 30 interceptors could be \nacquired. It is really designed to first highlight and underscore the \nfact that we are rushing ahead, not just in terms of deployment but in \nactually building out this system way beyond what has been proven by \ntesting; and, second, also, to emphasize the need for a thorough \ntesting not beyond, frankly, what was required in yesterday's \namendment.\n  Although I think yesterday's amendment was a good step forward, \noperational realistic testing by October 1 of 2005 is a very laudable \ngoal. I hope we can follow through and carry it out.\n  Ultimately, we want to get the whole system back into the situation \nof practically every other major defense program; that is, before \ndeploying the system, build the system, go to production, and that you \nhave actually done operational testing, independent operational \ntesting, supervised, conducted, monitored by Dr. Christie and his \ncolleagues in the Defense Department Office of Director of Operational \nTesting and Evaluation.\n\n[[Page S7039]]\n\n  One other point I make, in the discussion yesterday, there was some \nmention of how this system was going to protect us from threats around \nthe world, including threats from Iran. This system is exclusively \ndesigned to protect from a missile launch from North Korea. It will \nprovide no protection from a missile launch from any other point on the \nglobe, as far as I can tell. It is not a comprehensive system defending \nthe United States. It is a limited system focused on North Korea.\n\n  One can fairly ask, if North Korea is such a dangerous threat that \nrequires this very hasty emergency deployment of a missile system, why \nare we withdrawing troops from North Korea, ground forces that could \ncomplement our diplomacy? We are we not taking aggressive diplomatic \nsteps to try and disarm North Korea when they have made it clear they \nhave nuclear material. They very well may have fashioned multiple \nnuclear weapons in the last year while we have been trying to negotiate \nbut doing so unsuccessfully.\n  Again, this raises the whole question of how do you deal with these \nthreats through this very expensive, very limited missile defense \nsystem or through other means complementing the development of the \nsystem. I argue, of course, that we have to be much more aggressive \ndiplomatically with the North Korean situation; that we have to do it \nfrom a position of strength. That position is not enhanced when we take \nout troops.\n  I also suggest if we did that, we would have the time to develop this \nsystem properly, to declare it deployed--not now, but when we have had \na test of the entire system, of all the elements, so that we know this \nsystem will work and it will work effectively.\n  An interesting final point I make is that in the discussion yesterday \nabout operational testing, there was an example given about the Patriot \nsystem, which is the PAC-3 system. That is a complicated missile \nsystem, hit-to-kill technology, the same basic technology that will be \nemployed in this national missile defense system.\n  We talk about this midcourse system. It did extremely well in all its \ndevelopmental tests, and then it had operational tests. They had four \nconsecutive operational test failures; that is the PAC-3.\n  Now, certainly we do not want a situation where the first operational \ntest is the acquisition of an incoming missile from a hostile power, \nand we don't know if we are going to have the PAC-3 record of four \nfailures in a row or we are going to do much better. I think that, \nessentially, is where we are today.\n  So my amendment, in summary, which will be disposed of next week, \nwould condition the acquisition of interceptors 21 through 30--the new \nrequirement that sprung up this year, after years of looking at 20--it \nwould condition it on having operational testing according to the \nstandard procedures that are in place in the Department of Defense.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Reed \namendment, but I would note that Senator Reed has certainly done a lot \nof work on this issue. Yesterday, Senator Warner proposed a second-\ndegree amendment that incorporated a number of the concerns the Senator \nhad about missile defense. This amendment today would cover much of the \nsame ground that was considered in the amendment offered by Senator \nReed yesterday. That amendment was adopted by the Senate and modified, \nas I noted, by Senator Warner.\n  The amendment today uses the same approach to testing as the \namendment yesterday, but it has the additional disadvantage of imposing \na very significant cost to the Missile Defense Program and to our \nability to defend the Nation from long-range missile attack. It would \nprohibit expenditure of fiscal year 2005 funds for ground-based \ninterceptors until initial operational test and evaluation is \ncompleted. And that has a technical and important legal definition.\n  I remind my colleagues, the Warner second-degree amendment, adopted \nyesterday, requires the Secretary of Defense to establish criteria for \nrealistic testing of ballistic missile defense systems and to conduct a \ntest consistent with those criteria in 2005. The Senate approved this \napproach, rather than the Reed approach, which would require \noperational tests and evaluation of each configuration of the BMD \nsystem.\n  Indeed, the Senator's amendment today is much more demanding because \nunlike the one yesterday, it would restrict the ability to acquire \nadditional missile defense interceptors until such testing is \ncompleted.\n\n  During the debate yesterday, we noted that the Department of Defense \nDirector of Operational Test and Evaluation believes that operational \ntest and evaluation for ground-based midcourse missile defense \nelements--the kind of testing the Senator is proposing--is premature \nand not helpful to that effort. We note the need for flexibility to \nincorporate developmental goals into missile defense testing so that \nthe missile defense system can continue to evolve and improve over \ntime. These developmental goals are precluded, by law, from operational \ntest and evaluation.\n  We noted that the Warner amendment provides the flexibility to \ninclude developmental goals and avoids the cost delay involved in \nsignificant replanning of the test program. All these arguments are \nrelative to the amendment before us today as well.\n  So I note again that the Warner amendment, adopted by the Senate \nyesterday, requires a test be conducted in 2005, consistent with the \nSecretary's criteria for realistic testing. Yet the Reed amendment \nbefore us would prohibit the Department from using funds for additional \ninterceptors in 2005, until the approach to testing rejected by the \nSenate yesterday is not only adopted but completed. So the Senate has \nspoken on this issue.\n  Further, the amendment we are considering, if adopted, would do \nserious harm to the Nation's ability to defend itself from long-range \nmissile threats. While we have no defense today against long-range \nballistic missile attack, we are on track to field a missile defense \ntest bed that will provide an early, limited capability to defend \nagainst long-range missiles later this year.\n  Our goal is to have five missiles in place in September that have the \ncapability of knocking down attacking missiles whether they come from \nany place on the globe, protecting the entire United States by placing \nthem in this geographically perfect spot in Alaska that allows us to \nprotect the whole country.\n  I think most people need to remember that. People made fun of this. \nThey said it could not be done, a system like this would not work. But \nit is going to be deployed in September. What this amendment would do \nis stop the assembly of additional missiles that are now ongoing, block \nthe assembly line that really needs to continue for at least a year, \nmaybe two. I think that is the biggest problem we have with it.\n  The kind of testing and evaluation and development we are doing \ntoday, through a spiral development type concept, is to move forward, \nto get this system up. As Senator Reed's chart showed, we have ships at \nsea. We have early radar warning systems. We have communications \nsystems.\n  We have to have command systems as well as the missile and its \ntechnical capability to hit an incoming missile. The tests so far have \nproven that the existing capabilities of the guidance systems that we \nhave enable an American antiballistic missile to knock down an incoming \nmissile with remarkable certainty. It is a remarkable scientific \nachievement. Someone said recently, it is equivalent almost to putting \na man on the Moon.\n  It has been done. We are there. We do not need to slow this down. But \nthere is no doubt in my mind that as we go forward additional tests \nwill be conducted, that additional scientific and technological \nadvancements will be brought on line. We will continue to improve this \nsystem as we go forward with it.\n\n  We have had a lot of debate on national missile defense. I know \npeople have different ideas about how it ought to be developed. We have \nput some real faith in General Kadish and his team at National Missile \nDefense. I think they have proven worthy of the faith we have put in \nthem. We gave them flexibility. We did not try to micromanage what they \nwere going to do. We challenged them to produce a system that\n\n[[Page S7040]]\n\ncould be deployed this year. We gave them the ability to develop and \nmove forward in a way they thought best. If they believed changes \nneeded to be implemented differently from what they thought when they \nfirst started, we gave them flexibility to do that. They are coming \nforward in a great way.\n  I am proud of what General Kadish has accomplished and what Admiral \nEllis has stated and his confidence in this system. I believe we have \nbeen very fortunate to have top-flight people in charge of this \nprogram. If not, we would not be nearly as far along as we are. I do \nnot think we ought to constrict them with this amendment.\n  I respect the Senator's goals. I know he has studied it carefully. He \nbelieves this would help. But at this point I think it would do more \nharm than good, and I oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. REED. I want to understand and make sure that I am accurate. In \nreference to the system being deployed this September in Alaska, my \nunderstanding, which I stated, is that it would only provide coverage \nfor essentially the North Korean threat. And then I heard you say the \nsystem--it might be in the future--but the system would cover all \nthreats. My sense is that this system that will be deployed would cover \nNorth Korea.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe it would cover at least a good bit of the \nUnited States against a Middle Eastern threat, and it could be \neffective against other threats. But, obviously, the main threat at \nthis point--the ultimate goal is to provide a system that can protect \nus from all threats.\n  Mr. REED. I understand, as the system is eventually designed to be. \nBut, if you will indulge me, I also understand that other radars have \nto be put in place beyond Cobra Dane, beyond the Aegis systems that \nthey have not yet put in place. There are other elements that have to \nbe in place for a more comprehensive system.\n\n  The other point on which I raise a question is the simple fact \nreflected in Mr. Christie's letter. This isn't a question of logic as \nmuch as technology. He seems to be saying the system is so premature or \nhas a lack of maturity such that you can't do operational testing. I \nmust say, I find it difficult, then, to say we can't do operational \ntesting but we are going to put it in operation. That is the situation \nwe face in September. But that is more of a comment than a question.\n  I thank the Senator for his kindness.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know the Senator has studied this carefully, and I \nrespect him for that. We have made a commitment to go forward and \ndeploy. We have done a good deal of testing to date. We are going to \nneed to test the whole system. The Senator is right. We may find that \nsome difficulties exist that need to be dealt with. We may find that \nsome things work better than we thought. But until we get the system in \nthe ground, I don't think we can do the kind of realistic testing that \nwe need, testing the command center, the advanced radar, the \ncommunications systems, and all of that. I am committed to this spiral \ndevelopment system in which we don't straitjacket ourselves but \ncontinue to develop as we test. I think your amendment would limit the \ndevelopment and go back to the more traditional firm testing, step by \nstep. I respect your view on it, but I think we should go the other \nway.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3297, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside and that we now call up amendment No. 3297, as \nmodified, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3297, as modified.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To repeal the phase-in of concurrent payment of retired pay \n   and veterans' disability compensation for veterans with a service-\n               connected disability rated as 100 percent)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 642. REPEAL OF PHASE-IN OF CONCURRENT RECEIPT OF RETIRED \n                   PAY AND VETERANS' DISABILITY COMPENSATION FOR \n                   VETERANS WITH SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITIES \n                   RATED AS 100 PERCENT.\n\n       Section 1414 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(1)--\n       (A) by inserting after the first sentence the following new \n     sentence: ``During the period beginning on January 1, 2004, \n     and ending on December 31, 2004, payment of retired pay to \n     such a qualified retiree described in subsection (c)(1)(B) is \n     subject to subsection (c).''; and\n       (B) in the last sentence, by inserting ``(other than a \n     qualified retiree covered by the preceding sentence)'' after \n     ``such a qualified retiree''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``(other than a \n     retiree described by subparagraph (B))'' after ``the \n     retiree'';\n       (ii) by redesignating subparagraphs (B) through (F) as \n     subparagraphs (C) through (G), respectively; and\n       (iii) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following new \n     subparagraph (B):\n       ``(B) For a month for which the retiree receives veterans' \n     disability compensation for a disability rated as 100 \n     percent, $750.'';\n       (B) by redesignating paragraph (11) as paragraph (12); and\n       (C) by inserting after paragraph (10) the following new \n     paragraph (11):\n       ``(11) Inapplicability to veterans with disabilities rated \n     as 100 percent after calendar year 2004.--This subsection \n     shall not apply to a qualified retiree described by paragraph \n     (1)(B) after calendar year 2004.''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it seems that every year at this time I come \nto the floor to offer an amendment on behalf of America's disabled \nveterans. It is something that I have become accustomed to and \nsomething that the veterans expect of me.\n  The amendment I offer today, and have for many years, deals with \nconcurrent receipt, a subject first brought to my attention many years \nago by a disabled veteran. This is also called the veterans tax.\n  A disabled veteran told me in Nevada many years ago that he wasn't \nallowed to receive both his retirement pay and disability compensation \nat the same time. I thought he misunderstood what the law was all \nabout. His retirement pay was being offset dollar for dollar by the \namount of disability compensation he received. He said it was a \nrestriction found in U.S. law. I assumed he was wrong because it seemed \nso unfair.\n\n  He was right. It was a law that had been in effect for more than 100 \nyears. The law was on the books and hundreds of thousands of disabled \nveterans were having their retirement pay wiped out. No other disabled \nFederal retiree was being subjected to this tax; only those who retired \nfrom the U.S. military.\n  So with the help of my colleagues, especially Senators Warner and \nLevin, and at a later time Senator McCain, we have been chipping away \nat this unfair restriction for a number of years. With their help, we \nhave made some progress, I think considerable progress.\n  At first, it was a tiny bit, and it became bigger and bigger, until \nlast year we took a major step forward. We had been looking for full \nconcurrent receipt, but last year we ended up with a compromise \nagreement that ends the restriction on current receipt for combat-\ndisabled retirees and those retirees who have a service-connected \ndisability rated at least 50 percent.\n  Had we had this law changed 20, 30, or 40 years ago, many more people \nwould have been able to apply for it. Sadly, each day of every year \nmore than 1,000 World War II veterans die. Even though we have almost \n30,000 people still eligible for these benefits, many who should have \nreceived them are now gone. So our step last year was an important step \nforward, but it was far from perfect.\n  Many tens of thousands of disabled veterans are still not covered \nunder last year's agreement, and even those who are covered have to \nwait a full 10 years before their offset in retirement pay is \ncompletely eliminated. That is a long time to wait, particularly for \nthe severely disabled and especially for veterans of the Korean \nconflict and\n\n[[Page S7041]]\n\nWorld War II because the average age of those individuals is 83 for a \nWorld War II veteran and over 70 for a Korean war veteran.\n  My amendment that I offer today does a simple thing. It eliminates \nthe 10-year phase-in period for the most severely disabled; that is, \nthose who are rated 100-percent disabled. As I indicated, there are \nabout 30,000 of those 100-percent disabled veterans. Their average age \nis 59 years old, which takes into consideration the conflicts in \nVietnam, the Persian Gulf war, and many other battles we have fought \nover the years.\n  Most of these thousands of veterans are disabled from their military \nservice, and they cannot work anymore. Rarely do we find someone 100-\npercent disabled who can work, but there are some. Typically, these \ncases include conditions that run the whole spectrum. Some are medical \nconcerns. Some are as a result of actual injuries received. Remember, \nthese are service-connected disabilities. There are some with chronic \nillnesses who have been diagnosed during active duty and the disease \nprogression prevented a second career.\n  Madam President, 100 percent is the highest disability rating given \nby the Department of Veterans Affairs, and it is always associated with \ndecreased life expectancy. So a 10-year phase-in for these veterans to \nreceive full disability and retirement payment will not be realized by \nmany of them. Many will simply not live long enough to reap the \nbenefits of full concurrent receipt.\n  Let me give an example about the harsh financial impact caused by \nthis long phase-in period. One disabled veteran from Nevada who served \n24 years in the Air Force wrote to me recently. She is 100-percent \ndisabled. Under last year's 10-year implementation scheme, she still \nforfeits $1,571 of earned retired pay every month. Since retiring from \nthe Air Force in 1991, she has forfeited $275,000 of retired pay. If we \nkeep the 10-year phase-in period as is, she will forfeit an additional \n$80,000. For a person unable to work because of a service-connected \ndisability, every dollar counts and this offset becomes punitive.\n  This amendment that is now before the Senate pays the most severely \ndisabled now at a fraction of the cost of last year's concurrent \nreceipt bill. We do not create a new benefit. We simply want to pay \nthose most severely disabled now, instead of waiting until they are \ndead and, therefore, not able to receive it.\n  This is a compromise. I want every disabled American veteran not to \nhave to give up any part of their pay. This is a compromise. We are not \nexpanding the law in the sense that we are going to include people \nrated differently than 50 percent, but we are going to allow these \npeople, the 100-percent disabled, to get their money now. I think they \ndeserve this. I think it is so unfair we do not do it.\n  This is a matter that will be voted on. If the committee decides not \nto accept it, we will vote on this issue. I feel confident that it will \nbe very difficult for people to return home and look a 100-percent \ndisabled veteran in the face and say: We couldn't afford to pay you \nnow. Wait a while.\n  I cannot ask for the yeas and nays, but I will at the appropriate \ntime. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3196\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask that my amendment be set aside and \nwe return to amendment No. 3196.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there is no further debate on this \namendment. I, therefore, ask that we vitiate the yeas and nays. The \namendment has been reported. This is the Durbin amendment that has been \ndebated this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3196.\n  The amendment (No. 3196) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment NO. 3353\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I rise in strong opposition to Reed amendment No. 3353, \nwhich fences the funds for ground-based midcourse interceptors pending \ncompletion of initial operational test and evaluation.\n  In effect we have already had that debate, and I find it perplexing \nthat here we are, having that same issue introduced again in the form \nof another Reed amendment on the floor of the Senate. I think we \nadequately addressed it yesterday when we had a Reed amendment at that \nparticular time where he put in some requirements for operational \ntesting, and we second-degreed that with the Warner amendment where we \ntalked about modifying that in a way so that we maintain flexibility \nwith the Secretary of the Department of Defense, yet had some \naccountability.\n  There was a policy set forward where we could move forward with the \nmissile defense issue and still show the accountability we needed. We \nhad that vote and the Warner amendment was adopted as a second-degree \namendment on the Reed amendment. We resolved that issue. But here again \nwe are talking about the same issue.\n  I certainly don't quarrel with the need to conduct operational \nrealistic testing. We recognized that yesterday. Everyone supports \nthat, so much so that this body voted, as I said, strongly. They didn't \njust vote for it, they strongly voted in favor of the Warner amendment \nyesterday, which requires such a test to be conducted next year so we \ncan get that behind us and move on. We address it in terms of realistic \ntesting instead of operational testing, which would be much more \nrestrictive.\n  But this amendment would cause serious harm to the effort to defend \nour Nation from missile attack. It is a delay in our moving forward. In \nfact, it would disrupt the production lines to a point where it may \neven put the total program in severe jeopardy. By fencing these funds, \nthe amendment would prevent obligation or expenditure of fiscal year \n2005 funds for the next ground-based midcourse missile interceptors \nuntil completion of initial operational test and evaluation.\n  I know some Senators have maintained this is not a cut to the \nprogram. To plan, conduct, and assess a formal operational test--just \none test--would take the Missile Defense Agency and the Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation a year or more.\n  The fact is, the fiscal year 2005 funds requested could not be \nexecuted in fiscal year 2005. That is the problem. In effect, this is a \ndeep cut to a very important effort.\n  This reduction would cause serious disruption in the effort to \nacquire additional interceptors. The contractors making the \ninterceptors would have to interrupt their efforts. Subcontractors \nwould be lost. Key personnel would be lost. Valuable manufacturing \nexperience and processes would also be lost.\n  Requalifying, then, these subcontractors and retraining workers and \nrelearning the manufacturing process takes time and money. The \nprojections are it would delay the program up to 2\\1/2\\ years and cost \ntaxpayers more than $250 million extra.\n  Ironically, the loss of expertise and experienced personnel, and the \neffort to retrain and requalify, inevitably involves increased \ntechnical risk, exactly the opposite result which I know Senator Reed \nhopes to achieve.\n  Let me make several key points. First of all, the GMD effort is \nthreat driven. North Korean ballistic missiles already pose a serious \nthreat to the United States. The justification for the additional 10 \ninterceptor missiles is to defend the country. It is clear for all \nthose who want to look at the evidence. Delay will leave us critically \nshort of assets to defend ourselves.\n\n  Second, the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command has expressed concern\n\n[[Page S7042]]\n\nwith efforts to reduce the number of GMD interceptors. He supports the \nearly exploitation of the operational capabilities inherent in the BMD \ntest bed and believes the GMD element provides him with a useful \nmilitary capability and enhances deterrence.\n  Third, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, the \nDepartment's chief tester, as I like to refer to him, wrote in a letter \nto me that operational testing for a GMD element is premature and would \nnot be helpful to the program. I have introduced that letter into the \nRecord in previous debates. This is in direct contradiction to the \ndirection of this amendment.\n  The Director, Mr. Christie, has testified that he supports the BMD \ntest program and how it is being conducted, that the testing of the \nground-based midcourse element is appropriate, and that he provides \noperational assessments on a continuing basis.\n  Fourth, this amendment offers no real benefit to the GMD test \nprogram. It is characteristic of a spiral development program such as \nthe ballistic missile defense development effort to incorporate both \ndevelopmental goals and operational goals and testing. The GMD testing \nalready incorporates operational goals in each of its tests and, as I \nnoted, the Director of OT already provides operational assessments \nbased on this testing.\n  I believe this amendment provides no benefit, absolutely no benefit \nto the GMD effort and, in fact, will do significant harm to our \nnational defense.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this Reed amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague. That leaves the \nReed amendment for further discussion on Monday. Am I correct on that?\n  Mr. ALLARD. That should do it, yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you.\n  Speaking with the distinguished Democratic whip, I believe we are \nclosing in on the final matters on this bill. One end I am going to try \nto tie down, then it would be my intention, subject to leadership \nconcurrence, to close out today's activities on the bill and go into a \nperiod for morning business; is that correct?\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that is true. We already have people lined \nup for Monday for amendments. We have Senators Dayton, Byrd, Bingaman, \nLevin, and we have a number of people on Tuesday. We are about to \nfinish this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I may say, Madam President, I feel we are mutually \nreaching the goal established by Senator Reid and the majority leader \nand the distinguished Democratic leader. I think we are getting \nexcellent cooperation from all Senators, and we will be able to \nconclude this matter.\n  Mr. REID. We have a couple of votes--maybe as many as three votes--on \nMonday, if necessary, but we will have to see what happens on Tuesday. \nThere could even be more than that on Tuesday. I have heard the \npossibility that we could have maybe six or seven amendments on \nTuesday. If we are fortunate, we will be able to finish the bill \nsometime late that night.\n  Mr. WARNER. I again appreciate the Senator's assistance. We, frankly, \nhave no more amendments on our side that I know of. Possibly one. I \nappreciate the cooperation which the other side has given to this \nmatter.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3297\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Democratic whip on \nthe floor. He has a pending amendment. We are prepared to accept it on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is amendment No. 3297.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3297) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I add, in the many years I have worked \nwith the distinguished leader from Nevada, this is an issue which he \nhas singlehandedly, in so many instances, taken the role to care for \nveterans, particularly those who carry the wounds of war or the wounds \nthat have been incurred in the course of their service to the country.\n  I say to the Senator, this is a further chapter in that long and \ndistinguished history of your personal intervention on their behalf, \nand I commend you, sir.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator was off the floor when I gave my \nstatement. Senator Sessions was covering the floor. But I was quite \neffusive in my praise of the chairman and the ranking member. These \nyears we have worked on this issue have been tough years. There have \nbeen monetary concerns on what we have to do for the military.\n  Had it not been for the breaking of new ground by the chairman and \nranking member--this law has been in effect for more than 100 years--\neven though I was the person who was advocating this, but for the \nunderstanding of the two people we hold out as being our experts in the \narea of taking care of our military, it would not have been done.\n  I am so grateful for the help of Senator Levin and Senator Warner. \nThe veterans around the country know that. They know I was the guy out \nyelling and screaming. But they know the two individuals who made sure \nwe got something done every year--the first year I introduced this, it \nwas not a shutout. The first year we got a little bit. The second year \nwe got more. We have continued to the point where we now are at 50 \npercent. Those people who are 100-percent disabled will start receiving \ntheir money the minute the President signs this most important bill.\n  I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Virginia, because \ncertainly he is that. But, also, I want to pat him on the back because \nhe certainly deserves it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I appreciate your \nsentiments. Thank you very much. And further I sayeth not, except I \nwant to add, we have had a good day on this bill. We have adopted \nseveral amendments. We have laid down others that will be completed on \nMonday and Tuesday. Again, I thank all colleagues for their \ncooperation, particularly the leadership.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in a few months, the administration will \nannounce that a national missile defense has been fielded in Alaska. \nNobody in this body will be fooled by that announcement. We know smoke \nand mirrors when we see them, and that is what the so-called \n``rudimentary'' missile defense will be.\n  The Bush campaign will say that he kept his promise to defend America \nagainst an attack by intercontinental ballistic missiles, but they \nwon't admit that it doesn't work. And they won't mention the price, \nboth in dollars and in the diversion of high-level attention from the \ntruly pressing threats to our national security.\n  For those reasons, it is absolutely vital that we approve the \namendment offered by Senator Reed of Rhode Island. No complex weapons \nsystem should be deployed with as little evidence as we have today that \nthe system could ever succeed in wartime. It is astounding that the \nPresident's desire to field a system by this October takes precedence \nover the need to ensure that the system will work. The administration's \npursuit of missile defense has been anything but smooth.\n  First, it put on hold the program inherited from President Clinton. \nThen it decided on a defense remarkably similar to that one, but with a \nrequirement that a so-called ``Alaska test bed'' be made operational by \nOctober 2004. After a test failed in December 2002, the administration \nactually reduced the number of intercept tests to be conducted before \ndeployment, in order not to delay the deployment date. It\n\n[[Page S7043]]\n\nhas not conducted a single intercept test since then, let alone one \nusing the intended booster, the actual kill vehicle, the planned radar, \nthe space-based infrared satellite that would be vital to the success \nof this system, or anything approaching a realistic test geometry or \ntarget set.\n  Very little, if any, of this will be accomplished before the \nadministration claims its schedule-driven success. General Kadish has \nalready said that the next test might be delayed until the fall.\n  Mr. Thomas Christie, Director of the Pentagon's Office of Operational \nTest and Evaluation, wrote in his most recent annual report:\n\n       Delays in production and testing of the two booster designs \n     have put tremendous pressure on the test schedule immediately \n     prior to fielding. At this point, it is not clear what \n     mission capability will be demonstrated prior to initial \n     defensive operations.\n\n  In February, the General Accounting Office wrote:\n\n       No component of the system to be fielded by September 2004 \n     has been flight-tested in its deployed configuration. \n     Significant uncertainties surround the capability to be \n     fielded by September.\n\n  Two months ago before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. \nChristie agreed with Senator Reed's statement that:\n\n       At this time, we cannot be sure that the actual system \n     would work against a real North Korean missile threat.\n\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists has noted that, given the limited \ncapabilities of the Cobra Dane radar in Alaska and the SPY-1 radar on a \nship in the Pacific Ocean, this system would leave Hawaii essentially \nundefended. In fairness, there is a precedent for the administration's \napproach. It is a very old and famous precedent. You can find it in \nChapter 1 of Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes.\n  Don Quixote checks out his old helmet, which he has been restoring:\n\n       In order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he \n     drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of \n     which undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. \n     The ease with which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted \n     him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he set to work \n     again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he was \n     satisfied with its strength . . .\n\n  So far, so good. This is what we do whenever an interceptor fails to \nhit its target in a flight test. My guess is that this is what the \nMissile Defense Agency did after the December 2002 test.\n  But note what Don Quixote does next:\n\n       . . . and then, not caring to try any more experiments with \n     it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most \n     perfect construction.\n\n  Does that sound familiar? The Missile Defense Agency did about the \nsame thing: they decided to do fewer intercept tests, rather than more, \nand to defer nearly all of those tests until well after this missile \ndefense ``helmet'' is fielded. So let's give the Pentagon credit where \ncredit is due: they are downright literary. I do wonder, though, \nwhether they ever got beyond Chapter 1. If they had read Chapter 11 of \nDon Quixote, they would have discovered that his helmet was demolished \nin its first encounter with an enemy. That is why Don Quixote ended up \nputting a barber's washbowl on his head.\n  There is a clear lesson here, and it is a lesson that Cervantes \nunderstood fully 400 years ago. Testing is not a one-time exercise. \nAfter you make your corrections to the system, you have to test \nagain. and the reason for testing is so as not to field a system that \nwill fail.\n\n  The administration will say that it is employing ``spiral \ndevelopment,'' under which weapons are deployed in an initial \nconfiguration that is then improved through regular upgrades. That \nconcept assumes, however, that the initial configuration is at least \nworkable. In missile defense, it is not clear that we have even made it \nto the barber's washbowl.\n  To declare that a system protects the American people when none of \nits real components has been tested realistically is really to deceive \nthe American people. The decision to decrease near-term testing in \norder to maintain a deployment date weeks before the next election \ndemonstrates neither realism nor wisdom.\n  The administration's fixation on missile defense has also blinded it \nto the opportunity costs of its pursuit of that goal. As Richard Clarke \nlater reported, the administration was so focused on missile defense \nand the ABM Treaty in 2001 that it paid too little attention to the \ngrowing threat of al Qaeda terrorism.\n  It also put on hold, throughout 2001, our important nonproliferation \nprograms in the former Soviet Union, which help to keep Russian \nweapons, materials, and technology out of the hands of rogue states or \nterrorists.\n  In the wake of September 11, when the administration was given a \nchoice of spending $1.3 billion on missile defense or on countering \nterrorism, it still opted to spend the funds on missile defense. The \ndifficult situation in which we find ourselves today regarding North \nKorea may be yet another result of the administration's missile defense \nfixation.\n  The administration inherited a mixed, but hopeful, situation from \nPresident Clinton: North Korea's spent nuclear reactor fuel, except for \nenough to make one or two nuclear weapons, which had been illegally \nreprocessed in the 1980s, was being safely canned and stored under U.S. \nand IAEA observation. American access to a suspect underground site had \ncreated an inspection precedent that might be enlarged upon in other \nagreements. Negotiations were proceeding on a deal to end North Korea's \nlong-range missile sales. And while North Korea was engaged in an \nillegal uranium enrichment program, that was apparently still at an \nexperimental stage.\n  But the administration refused to build on President Clinton's work. \nIt delayed any engagement with North Korea throughout 2001, insulting \nSouth Korea's President and undercutting our own Secretary of State in \nthe process.\n  There were persistent rumors that administration officials viewed \nmissile defense, rather than negotiations, as the real answer to any \nNorth Korean threat. The North Korean threat was, in turn, a widely \ncited justification for pursuing a national missile defense and \nwithdrawing from the ABM Treaty.\n  So here we are in 2004, and what do we have? The North Korean missile \nthreat is still uncertain, since there have been no further flight \ntests of long-range North Korean missiles. But if North Korea ever does \nfield an ICBM, there is a much better chance now that it will carry a \nnuclear weapon. Four years ago, we guessed that North Korea had one or \ntwo nuclear weapons; now we reportedly think they have at least eight, \nwith perhaps more on the way.\n  Has this administration's policy made us safer? It doesn't look that \nway to me. What has happened, however, is that the stakes in missile \ndefense have gotten higher. If faulty missile defense were to let a \nNorth Korean missile through with a high explosive warhead, or even a \nchemical weapons warhead, that would be one thing. But if a missile \ngets through with a nuclear weapon, then say goodbye to Honolulu or \nSeattle or San Diego.\n  That gets back to the matter of realistic testing. it is one thing to \nhave ``spiral development'' of a new bomb, or even a new airplane. The \nloss of life in the ``learning by doing'' phase will be tragic, but \nlimited.\n  It is quite another thing to tell the American people to put their \ntrust in a ``rudimentary'' missile defense that could well permit the \ndestruction of whole American cities. The Reed amendment won't stop \nmissile defense. All it does is redress the balance, a little, between \nfeckless deployment and desperately needed testing.\n  Whether we like our missile defense program or not, we should all \nvote in favor of testing it. If we need a missile defense, then we need \none that does more than raise a ``Mission Accomplished'' banner in \nAlaska. It is time to stop acting like Don Quixote and start heeding \nthe wisdom of Cervantes.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Reed amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/18/senate-section/article/S7043-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7043-S7044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, as spring turns to summer, as the calendar \nrolls from Easter to Memorial Day to the Fourth of July, our workaday \nschedule is pleasantly interrupted by numerous holidays--days of \nremembrance, for the most part.\n  We honor the death and the rebirth of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we \nhonor the fallen heroes of our Nation's wars. We honor our mothers and \nthe flag of our Nation. Graduation ceremonies honoring matriculating \nstudents have been taking place every weekend around the country as \nhigh schools and colleges conclude their academic years. In West \nVirginia--how sweet the sound--we honor the anniversary of our \nstatehood this month as well. This Sunday, June 20, 2004, the \npenultimate day of spring, the Nation honors fathers.\n  The word ``father,'' how sweet that sounds. Jesus taught us to pray, \n``Our Father who art in Heaven.'' The Bible says, ``Honor thy father \nand thy mother.''\n  We can be sure that fathers will be honored this Sunday because it \nwill be the mothers and the daughters who do the planning for this \nevent--not the often inept party planners who call themselves men. Men \ncan plan military campaigns and vacation travels, but somehow our \nskills frequently fall short at birthdays and holidays.\n  Fathers do offer other talents, however. Fathers are builders--\nbuilders of tree houses, builders of sand castles, of backyard patios, \nand model volcanoes for third grade science projects. Fathers are \nmechanics, for the family car as well as bicycles and, in this \nincreasingly technology-laden day, computers, cell phones, and digital \nrecorders and players of many purposes. Fathers are coaches for \nsoftball and junior soccer leagues, and fathers are chauffeurs for \npiano lessons and school dances. Fathers are workers, striving to keep \ntheir families fed and clothed and housed. Fathers are bankers, saving \nfor college educations and making loans to start their youngsters off \non a new career.\n  Fathers do traditional things, such as mow lawns, take out the trash, \npay the bills, and change the tires. But fathers are also cooks, \nlaunderers, and diaper changers.\n  Fathers are part of the silent cheering section, rooting on their \nchildren with their solid presence at the back of recitals and \ngrandstands, always pleased to mutter, ``That's my kid,'' ``That's my \nkid,'' ``That's my kid,'' to other spectators.\n  Fathers may not always show the true depth of their emotions, but \nthere can be no father who does not glow inwardly as his child's \nshining face seeks theirs, seeks the father's, asking the unspoken \nquestion: ``Did I do well, Pa?'' ``Did I do well, Dad?'' ``Did I do \nwell?'' ``And are you proud of me?'' ``Are you proud of me, Dad?'' As \nfathers, men are honored and humbled by the seeking of their approval, \nsilently savoring the precious father-child bond.\n  I was raised by just such a silent man. My uncle, Titus Dalton Byrd, \nworked hard all of his working life in the coal mines of southern West \nVirginia. He never had much. I have heard others say: Well, I am the \nfirst in my line to have a college education. Or I am the first in my \nline to have a high school education. I am the first in my line to even \ngo to the second grade.\n  This was my dad. He was not my biological father, but he was my dad. \nHe was the greatest man I have ever met, and I have met with shahs and \nkings and princes and princesses, Presidents, Senators, Governors. This \nwas the greatest, the greatest of all.\n  As I say, he never had much. He did not have much of an education. He \ndid not have vacations. He was a man of few words. He walked to work, \ncarrying his lunch in a pail, and he was grateful to be able to walk \nhome at the end of the day, having worked all day, having toiled in the \nbowels of the Earth, having earned his bread by the sweat of his brow. \nYes, I can see him.\n  He took me in as an infant, less than 1 year old. He did all that he \ncould for me. He gave me his name. He encouraged me in my school work. \nHe never bought me a cowboy suit or a cap buster. He bought me \nwatercolors with which to paint. He bought me my first violin. In these \nways, he gave me gifts that have stayed with me throughout my life.\n  So when I wanted to seek a job working in the mines to be like him, \nthe man I call my dad discouraged me--discouraged me. He took me back \ninto the mountains, into the bowels, into the depths of the Earth on a \nmine motor so that I could hear the timbers cracking, so that I could \nsee the water holes in which he and other coal miners plodded their \nway, often on their knees. Yes, he showed me where he worked. He said \nthe mines were dangerous places to work, and they were in those days \nespecially. He wanted better things for me, and he urged me to get an \neducation, a formal education.\n  He had the heart of a father. He wanted life to be better for his boy \nthan it was for him. He made whatever sacrifices he had to make in \norder to make his dream come true. He couldn't give me much, but he \ngave me the best example. He set the best example that he could each \nand every day of his life.\n  He could have complained. He could have been a complainer. He could \nhave whined. But he did neither. He just got up day after day and set \nout to work, and every day he came home tired. But he would save \nsomething sweet from his lunch for me. I used to watch him coming down \nthe railroad tracks from a mile away, that tall man with black hair and \nred mustache. I saw him coming down the railroad tracks, and I would \nrun to meet him. When I came near, he would stop, take the lid from the \ndinner pail and reach in and get a cake, a 5-cent cake. In those days, \nthese were 5-cent cupcakes--5 cents. My mom had put into his lunch this \ncake every day. She knew what he would do with it. He took that cake to \nwork, and then when I came near him, as he came walking on those cross-\nties down the Virginian Railroad tracks, there in that coal mining camp \nin southern West Virginia, that tall man reached into the dinner pail \nand he pulled out that 5-cent cake, and he gave the cake to me.\n  From the morning when he arose to toil in the mines, he must have \nlooked forward to the time in the afternoon when he would be giving \nthat cake to me. He always gave the cake to me.\n  I wonder if I appreciated, as I should have, I wonder if I even \nunderstood all of his efforts, all of his sacrifices at the time of \ntheir commission. I am sure I did not, but age and fatherhood have \ngiven me greater insight into the life of this quiet man, this good \ndad, my dad.\n  Yes, I have walked with the greatest of the Earth, the leaders of the \nworld. I sat down, as I said, with kings, princes, shahs, Governors and \nPresidents, but this was the greatest of them all. He was great because \nhe was good.\n  This Nation is full of good fathers, fathers who work hard, fathers \nwho come home tired, fathers who take care of their families. Most days \nthey do not get much attention, these armies of good fathers. Headlines \nare not made by them. Unfortunately, headlines are made by bad fathers, \nnot the good ones.\n  This Sunday, the good fathers will be fussed over, but they will \nenjoy every moment of attention. Some men will spend their Father's Day \nfar away from home, serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, or in other dangerous \nplaces. Some men will work on Father's Day protecting the Nation at \nhome in police and fire departments. For these men, Father's Day \ncelebrations may be delayed but nonetheless sweeter for the wait.\n  I am the father of two daughters, mothers now themselves, even \ngrandmothers. I am a great-grandfather, and I can attest that it is \nindeed great to be a great-grandfather.\n  As my sweet wife Erma and I celebrated our 67th wedding anniversary 3 \nweeks ago, I had the very special pleasure of sharing that occasion \nwith most of my family and with friends. I could look around the long \ntable past my wife's beautiful face and see small snatches of her and \nof myself in the voices, the gestures, the faces of three generations \nlooking back at me. I am so proud of these.\n  ``Yet, in my lineaments they trace, some features of my father's \nface.'' So\n\n[[Page S7045]]\n\nwrote the poet George Gordon Byron, Lord Byron, in his poem. It is at \ntimes like these that one can feel the tide of history flowing from the \ngenerations before me to the young faces just setting out on the long \nride of life.\n  We strive to be remembered by our loved ones, as my dad strove to be \nremembered. To all the good fathers out there and in honor of my own \ndad, who is looking down today from heaven, I close with a few lines \nthat I learned and recited when the days were young.\n  In those days, children routinely did such things as memorize poetry. \nAnd I say to the fine Senator who presides today over this body, it is \none of a multitude of poems that were taught to children in order to \nteach them lessons, and this one is just a few lines titled, ``The \nLittle Chap That Follows Me,'' or in some instances, ``A Little Fellow \nFollows Me.'' This was written by the Reverend Claude Wisdom White, \nSr., and it reminds me of how my dad lived, a noble man whom I never \nheard once, in all of the years, use God's name in vain. I never heard \nhim tell an off-colored joke. That was the man whom I remember this \nday. Thank God for a man like Titus Dalton Byrd.\n\n     A careful man I ought to be,\n     A little fellow follows me.\n     I dare not go astray,\n     For fear he'll go the self-same way.\n\n     I cannot once escape his eyes,\n     Whatever he see me do, he tries.\n     Like me, he says, he's going to be,\n     The little chap who follows me.\n\n     He thinks that I am good and fine,\n     Believes in every word of mine.\n     The base in me he must not see,\n     That little fellow who follows me.\n\n     I must remember as I go,\n     Thru summers' sun and winters' snow.\n     I am building for the years to be,\n     In the little chap who follows me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/18/senate-section/article/S7045-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7045-S7047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WEST VIRGINIA DAY, 2004\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I mentioned a moment ago, Sunday will be \nJune 20, and it will be West Virginia Day. West Virginia Day.\n  On this day before West Virginia eve, there are so many things I \nwould like to say about my great and proud and glorious State.\n  I would like to talk about her rolling hills, how each year scores of \nthousands of people come to West Virginia to camp in our State and in \nour parks, to hike the Appalachian Trail, to fish in our mountain \nstreams, or simply to relax and enjoy our majestic mountain scenery. \nThe only thing more beautiful than the Sun setting over the hills of \nWest Virginia is the Sun rising over our beautiful green peaks.\n  I would like to brag a little. You know, Dizzy Dean said it is all \nright to brag if you have done it. I would like to brag a little about \nWest Virginia's ``firsts.'' The first patent for a soda fountain was \ngranted to George Dulty, of Wheeling, in 1833. The first bare knuckle \nworld heavyweight championship was held near Colliers on June 1, 1880--\nColliers, WV. The first rural free mail delivery was started in Charles \nTown, just a few miles from here, on October 6, 1896. The first female \njockey to win a horse race was Barbara Jo Rubin, at the Charles Town \nRacetrack on February 22, 1969.\n  And, of course, I would like to boast, and I shall boast--why not? \nWhy not? Why should I say I would like to boast? I am going to boast.\n  I want to boast about all of the biggest and the best of West \nVirginia. The world's largest axe factory was located--where? In \nCharleston; Charleston, WV. The world's largest clothespin factory was \nlocated in Richwood, in Nicholas County, WV.\n  The world's largest sycamore tree--where? Why, in Webster Springs, \nWV.\n  And the town of Weirton, right up there in that northern panhandle, \nis the only city in the United States that extends from one State to \nanother, one State border to another, the only city in the United \nStates that extends from one State border to the other.\n  And, of course, I will talk about the people of West Virginia, how \nthey have endured disasters, exploitation, national scoffs--we are \ncalled hillbillies, you know. Hillbillies? How blessed the name, \nhillbillies. Count me in. How they have endured neglect but still they \nremain among the friendliest, the warmest, the most courageous, and \nmost patriotic people in the United States.\n  West Virginians are good people who care about each other and care \nabout you, even if you are a stranger. And it has been said that West \nVirginians ``don't just loan someone a socket wrench, we help them fix \ntheir cars.''\n  And then I want to talk about the West Virginia coal industry. I \ncould point out how West Virginia coal helped to fuel the Industrial \nRevolution and for over a century heated American homes. Look about \nyou.\n  You know the Great Fire in London occurred in 1666 and the great \narchitect who drew the designs for the buildings that replaced those \nthat were swept away with the fires, the great architect of that period \nwas Christopher Wren. As my wife and I walked the halls of Saint Paul's \nCathedral in London, we looked upon the floor and there on the floor, \ninscribed, were these words:\n\n       If you seek my monument, look about you.\n\n  That was Christopher Wren, who was the architect for perhaps more \nthan 50 of those cathedrals and great buildings that grew up in the \nplace that had been swept by the disastrous fire.\n\n       If you seek my monument, look about you.\n\n  I would point out how West Virginia coal helped to fuel the \nIndustrial Revolution, as I say, and for a century heated American \nhomes and fueled our warships and provided energy for our industries. \nYes, these lights we have in the Chamber, where do you think that power \nis coming from? Not very far away. West Virginia coal made it possible.\n  But as the great and glorious day known as West Virginia Day \napproaches, I decided not to do all these things but to discuss another \naspect: the West Virginia apple industry. I have to wonder how many \npeople listening to me even realize that West Virginia has a \nsignificant apple industry, but it does. In fact, West Virginia ranks \nninth in the Nation in apple production. Furthermore, West Virginia is \nthe home of two important--now listen to this. When you go to the \nstore, to the Giant food store tomorrow, with your husband or your wife \nor your brother or your sister, take a look at those apples as you go \nby. And just remember this, that two important and very popular and \ndelicious, delectable, tasty apple varieties originated in West \nVirginia. In 1775, Thomas W. Grimes produced the first Grimes golden \napple since Adam and Eve walked together as evening came and enjoyed \nthe apple.\n\n  Thomas Grimes produced the first Grimes Golden apple in Wellsburg, \nWV. The Grimes Golden became a highly esteemed dessert apple.\n  In the early 1900s, Anderson Mullins discovered on his family \nproperty in Clay County, WV, a mysterious tree bearing the Golden \nDelicious apple.\n  Did you know that? I am looking at these bright faces that greet me \nwith smiles every day--the wonderful young people who work for Senators \nand work for their Nation, who perform services for this Nation in this \nSenate, these wonderful young people--we call them pages. How wonderful \nthey are.\n  I pause from time to time to talk to these pages and to tell them \nwholesome stories and talk a little about Nathan Hale, talk with them \nabout this great institution, the Senate of the United States. I talk \nwith them about the Great Compromise that was hammered out in \nPhiladelphia on July 16, 1787.\n  Look how attentive these pages are. They are listening. They are \nlistening. That smile, that radiant smile that I see on each page's \nface--Republican on the Republican side, and on the Democratic side--I \nwill carry that smile with me all day, all day long, and it will warm \nmy heart.\n\n       Great it is to believe the dream as we stand in youth by \n     the starry stream, but greater still to live life through and \n     find at the end that the dream is true.\n\n  As these young people go tomorrow perhaps to the Giant food or to the \nSafeway store or the corner grocery, they will look at the apples. When \nyou do, remember that this Golden Delicious apple originated in Clay \nCounty, WV.\n  Clay County is where I attended a Democratic rally one night 50 years \nago. Just before I got into my car, I put my fiddle--it is a violin, \nbut some people call it a fiddle--on the trunk of my car. And I began \ntalking with one of the others who was departing late or last from that \nrally. I forgot about leaving my fiddle on the trunk of my car. When I \ngot into my car and turned the ignition on and backed it up, I heard \nsomething. I heard the sound\n\n[[Page S7046]]\n\nlike something was being crunched under the rear wheels of my car. Lo \nand behold, it was my fiddle case and the fiddle that was in it. That \nhappened in Clay County.\n  But I like to remember Clay County for that oval-shaped apple with a \ngolden-yellow skin and the juicy, firm flesh and sweet flavor which won \nwide acclaim. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, the founder of Kellogg's \nbreakfast food company--have you tried Kellogg's Corn Flakes lately? I \nhad them just this morning. He wrote that he considered ``the Golden \nDelicious, the finest apple I have ever tasted.'' That is a quotation \nfrom Dr. John Harvey Kellogg.\n  Listen to that again. Here is what he said:\n\n       The Golden Delicious, the finest apple I have ever tasted.\n\n  Where does it start? Where was its beginning? Where was its genesis? \nWest Virginia.\n  The world renowned horticulturist Luther Burbank agreed, as he \nstated:\n\n       I have no hesitancy in stating that it is the greatest \n     apple in all the world.\n\n  How about that? The ``greatest apple'' in all the world. And it came \nfrom where? West Virginia.\n\n  Offsprings of the Golden Delicious have now been developed in every \narea of the United States and on every continent. It is recognized as \nWest Virginia's most famous contribution to horticulture. In 1995, the \nWest Virginia State Senate designated the Golden Delicious apple as the \nofficial State fruit.\n  The apple industry in West Virginia began in a story book fashion. \nAround the year 1800, a young man by the name of John Chapman traveled \nthe northern regions of what would become the State of West Virginia \nwhere mountaineers are always free. John Chapman traveled the northern \nregions of what would become the State of West Virginia planting apple \ntrees throughout the region.\n  Chapman was born in 1774, and he spent 50 years of his life planting \ntiny apple trees throughout the frontiers of the Eastern and Midwestern \nStates. He was a simple man, John Chapman, whose clothes were said to \nhave been made from sacks, and he wore a tin pot for a hat, which he \nused for cooking--cooking out of your hat. His dream was for a land \nwith blossoming apple trees everywhere and no one was ever hungry.\n  On the frontier, apples were not only a source of nutritious food, \nthey were also used for the making of cider, vinegar, and apple butter \nas well.\n  Have you been to the Apple Butter Festival? We have the Apple Butter \nFestival over in Berkeley Springs. Where is that? In West Virginia.\n  Mr. Chapman is known to us today as the legendary Johnny Appleseed.\n  Many people think of Johnny Appleseed as a fictional character, but \nhe was a real person. I like to think of him, perhaps, as the ``Father \nof the West Virginia Apple Industry.''\n  As the apple nurseries that Johnny Appleseed planted in West Virginia \ndeveloped, apple trees were distributed throughout the region, and \napple production blossomed. It wasn't long until West Virginia apples \nwere being loaded on flat boats and shipped down the Ohio and the \nMississippi Rivers to as far south as New Orleans, or loaded on canal \nboats and shipped to the Capital City of Washington.\n  By 1889, West Virginia was producing nearly 5 million bushels of \napples a year. Apple production in West Virginia peaked in 1931, when \nthe State produced over 12 million bushels of apples.\n  Today, apple production in West Virginia averages 143 million \npounds--3.4 million bushels. Apple production takes place on an average \nof 9,000 acres, representing 126 commercial fruit growers.\n  I am sure you have heard of Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia. Harry \nByrd owned some great apple orchards. Some of them were in the Eastern \nPanhandle of West Virginia.\n  In the autumn, drive through southern Berkeley County, and you will \nfind the strong, sweet smell of apples being processed into sauces, \njuices, ciders, and jams. On any Saturday, ride through the Eastern \nPanhandle and see civic groups, church groups, or groups of high school \nyoungsters stirring apple butter in old, cast iron, copper-plated \nkettles set over the open fire.\n  Apples have become an important part of the culture as well as the \neconomies of West Virginia communities. In Inwood, for example, in the \nheart of old apple orchards, is Musselman High School, named after the \nworld renowned maker of apple products, Christian H. Musselman, who \nstarted one of his first plants in West Virginia. And the school's \nmascot is the apple, while the spirited students are known as \n``Applemen.'' The school newspaper is the ``Cider Press.''\n  Each year, the towns of Martinsburg and Burlington celebrate apple \nharvest festivals, while the towns of Salem and Berkeley Springs \ncelebrate apple butter festivals. Clay County, the home of the Golden \nDelicious apple, celebrates with the Golden Delicious festival.\n  On Sunday, as we mark another glorious West Virginia Day, I suggest \nthat you celebrate by biting into a piece of homemade apple pie, or \ntangy apple crisp, or savoring a delicious apple dumpling, or a sweet-\ncandied apple and thinking of West Virginia.\n     West Virginia, how I love you!\n     Every steamlet, shrub and stone,\n     Even the clouds that flit above you\n     Always seem to be my own.\n\n     Your steep hillsides clad in grandeur,\n     Alays rugged, bold and free,\n     Sing with ever swelling chorus:\n     Montani, Semper, Liberi!\n\n     Always free! The little streamlets,\n     As they glide and race along,\n     Join their music to the anthem\n     And the zephyrs swell the song.\n\n     Always free! The mountain torrent\n     In its haste to reach the sea,\n     Shouts its challenges to the hillsides\n     And the echo answers ``FREE!''\n\n     Always free! Repeats the river\n     In a deeper, fuller tone\n     And the West wind in the treetops\n     Adds a chorus all its own.\n\n     Aways Free! The crashing thunder,\n     Madly flung from hill to hill,\n     In a wild reverberation\n     Makes our hearts with rapture fill.\n\n     Always free! The Bob White whistles\n     And the whippoorwill replies,\n     Always free! The robin twitters\n     As the sunset gilds the skies.\n\n     Perched upon the tallest timber,\n     Far above the sheltered lea,\n     There the eagle screams defiance\n     To a hostile world: ``I'm free!''\n\n     And two million happy people,\n     Hearts attuned in holy glee,\n     Add the hallelujah chorus:\n     ``Mountaineers are always free!''\n\n     It is that time of year again.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my remarks I am going to give now on \nhealth care and the health care system in America will not be as filled \nwith rhapsody and melodic utterances as what we have heard from the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  I noticed all the pages, I say to my friend from West Virginia, \nlistening raptly to the Senator's comments. I can understand why. There \nis no one who can express himself or herself in such vivid terms, in \nsuch a vivid way that brings to life his beloved State of West \nVirginia, his youth, and his experiences. No one can do it and paint \nthe picture with such clarity and color and meaning as the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be delighted to, my mentor and my good friend \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. His \nfather, I believe, was a coal miner.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. BYRD. You know, the coal miner is a very special breed of man. He \ngoes into the smokey, hot bowels of the Earth to seek comrades who may \nbe still alive. He risks his life for them. I have a special bond with \nthe distinguished Senator through that coal miner background.\n  I thank him for his words, which were so well spoken, about these \nyoung pages. I thank him for what he does for his State. I thank him \nfor what he does for his country. I hope he will have a happy Father's \nDay on this coming Sunday. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for those very \nkind words. I, too, wish him the happiest of\n\n[[Page S7047]]\n\nFather's Days this week. I will be privileged to have at least one of \nmy children home, and my wife. The other one will not be there, but I \nam sure we will be connected by telephone and talking on Father's Day.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has taken great pride in his family. \nWe have shared in the past some of the tragedies that have happened to \nthe Senator from West Virginia in his own family. I know how deeply the \nSenator from West Virginia feels about family and what family means to \nAmericans in this country.\n  Through the example of the Senator from West Virginia, through his \nexample of public service, I say to the young pages, through his \nexample of public service through his entire lifetime, through his \nservice to his State but most importantly to his wife Erma and his \nfamily, that is the example we all need to follow. It is a great \nexample.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/18/senate-section/article/S7047-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7047-S7050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HELP AMERICA ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for more than a decade I have spoken out \nabout the need to fundamentally reorient our approach to health care in \nAmerica, to reorient it toward prevention and wellness and self-care.\n  I don't think too many people would argue with the statement, if you \nget sick, the best place to get the needed care is here in America. We \nhave the best trained, highest skilled health professionals in the \nworld. In fact, I have one here with me on my staff who is joining me \nin the Senate today.\n  We have great health professionals and cutting edge, state-of-the-art \ntechnology.\n  Just a few weeks ago, because of a recurring back problem I have, I \nhad an open MRI. I never liked going into those MRI machines. Now we \nhave one that is open. Great technology. Great technology.\n  We have world-class health care facilities and research institutions. \nBut when it comes to helping people stay healthy and stay out of the \nhospital--and prevent illness--we in America fall short.\n  In the U.S., we spend in excess of $1.8 trillion a year on health \ncare. Fully 75 percent of that total is accounted for by chronic \ndiseases, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes. What these diseases \nhave in common is that in so many cases they are preventable.\n  In the United States, we fail to make an upfront investment in \nprevention, so we end up spending hundreds of billions on \nhospitalization, treatment, and disability.\n  Well, this is foolish, and, clearly, it is unsustainable. In fact, I \nhave long said that we do not have a health care system in America, we \nhave a ``sick care'' system. If you are sick, you get care, but there \nis nothing there that will give you incentives and promotions to stay \nhealthy in the first place.\n  This ``sick care'' system is costing us dearly in terms of health \ncare costs, chronic illness, and premature deaths. Consider the cost of \nmajor chronic diseases, diseases, as I have said, that are so often \npreventable.\n  I will have a series of charts today. The first one is a chart from \nthe 2001 Surgeon General's report. It points out that obesity cost the \nUnited States $117 billion in public health costs in 2000. Obesity--\n$117 billion in just 1 year. And it is getting worse.\n  Other things: cardiovascular disease, about a $352 billion cost per \nyear; for diabetes, about $132 billion per year; for smoking, a more \nthan $75 billion cost per year; for mental illness, about $150 billion \na year it is costing our society. Indeed, major depression is the \nleading cause of disability in the United States.\n  Now, if I bought a new car, and I drove it off the lot, and I never \nmaintained it, I never checked the oil, never checked the transmission \nfluid, never got it tuned up, you would think I was crazy, not to \nmention grossly irresponsible. The commonsense principle with an \nautomobile is this: You pay a little now to keep the car maintained or \nyou are going to pay a whole lot later when it breaks down.\n  Well, it is the same with our national health care system. Right now \nour health care system is in a downward spiral. We are not paying a \nlittle now. We are not doing the preventive maintenance. So we are \npaying a whole lot later. And guess what. It is breaking down.\n  For example, we are failing to address the Nation's obesity epidemic. \nI have some charts that will show just what has happened in the United \nStates in the last few years. This is a chart that shows what the \nincidence of obesity was in the United States in 1990. As you will see, \nsome States had less than 10-percent obesity. No State exceeded 15 \npercent, and most of the States fell between 10 to 14 percent of the \npopulation being obese. That was in 1990. So keep that in mind. Nowhere \nin America did we exceed 15 percent. And some States were less than 10 \npercent. That was 1990.\n  Now here we are in 2002. This is the real shocker. By 2002, the \nmajority of our States were over 20 percent. A few States were over 25 \npercent. One in four of the individuals in these States is obese. No \nState now is less than 10 to 14 percent. And this all happened in 12 \nyears.\n  Actually, the story is even worse. The data on these charts is based \non--guess what--self-reported weight, which tends to be significantly \nunderestimated. So as catastrophic as this chart looks--and it is--it \nis even worse because it understates the extent of the obesity \nepidemic.\n  If you use recorded data rather than self-reported information, these \nrates are much higher. In fact, using this more scientific approach, we \nlearn that almost two out of every three Americans are either \noverweight or obese. Today, 65 percent of our population falls in that \ncategory. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently \nwarned that poor nutrition and physical inactivity could soon overtake \nsmoking as the No. 1 cause of death in the United States. So let's make \nno mistake, this is a major public health crisis.\n  Now, a lot of times people say: Well, that is all well and good, but \nthese are individuals. That is an individual choice--an individual \nchoice. Well, I understand that, except when these individual choices \nlead to more hospital utilization--when these individual choices lead \nto higher insurance costs for the rest of our population, when these \nindividual choices lead to prolonged chronic illnesses--then we have a \npublic health crisis. And if you have a public health crisis, then it \nis time for those of us in government to look at what we can do to help \nchange this course.\n  Another contributing factor to our health care crisis is tobacco. We \ndo not hear as much about the dangers of tobacco use today as we used \nto. There is a perception that we have turned the corner, that we have \ndone all we need to do. But that perception is not accurate. In 2002, \n61 million Americans regularly smoked cigarettes. That is 26 percent of \nour population. What that means is, after decades of education and \nefforts to stop tobacco use, more than one in four Americans are still \naddicted to nicotine and smoking.\n  Mental health is another enormous challenge we are grossly \nneglecting. Mental health and chronic disease are intertwined, and they \ncan trigger one another. It is about time we stopped separating the \nmind and the body when we discuss health. Prevention and mental health \npromotion programs should be integrated into our schools, workplaces, \nand communities along with physical health screenings and education. \nSurely, at the outset of the 21st century, it is time to move beyond \nthe lingering shame and stigma that often attends mental health \nillness.\n  Fully 70 percent of all of the deaths in the U.S. are now linked to \nchronic conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. In so \nmany cases, these chronic diseases are caused by poor nutrition, \nphysical inactivity, tobacco use, and untreated mental illness.\n  Again, this is unacceptable to us as a society. So after many months \nof meetings, discussions with Iowans, discussions with experts around \nthe Nation, and thanks to the help of my great staff, I will shortly be \nintroducing comprehensive legislation designed to transform America's \n``sick care'' system into a true health care system, one that \nemphasizes prevention and health promotion.\n  This bill, which I have here, which is a comprehensive bill, is one \nthat will help promote healthy lifestyles and prevention to help us \nkeep from getting sick in the first place. I will have more to say \nabout that in a couple\n\n[[Page S7048]]\n\nminutes. But I am calling this bill the HELP America Act--HELP being an \nacronym for Healthy Lifestyles and Prevention.\n\n  The aim of this bill is to give individuals and communities, schools \nand workplaces, the information and the tools and the incentives they \nneed to take charge of their own health and to prevent illness because \nif we are serious about getting control of health care costs and health \ninsurance premiums, then we must give people access to preventive care. \nWe must give people the tools they need to stay healthy and stay out of \nthe hospital.\n  This will take a sustained commitment from government, schools, \ncommunities, employers, health officials, insurance companies, and, \nyes, tobacco and food industries. But a sustained effort can have a \nhuge payoff for individuals and families, for employers, for society, \nfor government budgets, and the economy at large.\n  As I said, the HELP America Act is comprehensive legislation. It is a \nmultifaceted bill. But this afternoon I would like to outline the \nbill's major elements. The first title and the first component of the \nbill addresses healthy kids in schools.\n  Prevention and the development of healthy habits and lifestyles must \nbegin in the early years with our children. Unfortunately, today, we \nare heading our kids in the wrong direction. More and more kids all \nacross America are suffering from poor nutrition, physical inactivity, \nmental health issues, and tobacco use.\n  For example, just since the 1980s, the rates of obesity have doubled \nin children and tripled in teens.\n  Even more alarming is the fact that a growing number of children are \nexperiencing what used to be thought of as primarily adult health \nproblems. What I mean by that is almost two-thirds or 60 percent of \noverweight children have at least one cardiovascular disease risk \nfactor. We know that the onset of diabetes is happening at even earlier \nand earlier ages.\n  Recent studies have shown that increasing weight, greater salt \nconsumption from fast foods, and poor eating habits have contributed to \na rise in blood pressure, higher cholesterol levels, and a shockingly \nrapid increase in adult onset diabetes happening in our kids.\n  The HELP America Act will more than double funding for the successful \nPEP program, Physical Education Program, which promotes health and \nphysical education programs in our public schools.\n  I find it disturbing that more than one-third of youngsters in grades \n9 through 12 do not regularly engage in adequate physical activity. \nMore and more of our elementary school kids have no recess. They have \nno time during the day to engage in any kind of physical activity. This \nis a shame because studies show that regular physical activity not only \nimproves health but boosts self-esteem.\n  For example, I heard from a Mr. Rick Schupbach, who is the physical \neducation teacher at Grundy Center High School in Iowa. His school was \nrecognized as a premier model school for physical education by the PE \nfor Life national organization. Just this week I met with Lois Boeyink, \nthe national elementary school PE teacher of the year from Iowa. As \nthey pointed out, there are dozens of innovative programs and \nactivities that can help kids become more physically active, but these \nprograms are languishing for lack of funding and support.\n  The HELP America Act will also expand the fruit and vegetable \nprogram. These are basically the elements of title I of the bill. It \npromotes physical activity, doubling the PEP grants, getting down into \nour elementary schools to get kids to be more active, and to get school \nboards and principals thinking about incorporating into the school day \nsome physical activity for the kids. To me that is just as important as \nlearning a course or spending time studying during the day. They need \nsome time for physical activity.\n  It also expands the food and vegetable program, which we started a \ncouple of years ago, to provide free fresh fruits and vegetables in \npublic schools. Right now that is happening in four States, about 100 \nschools, a couple of Indian reservations. It has been a tremendous \nsuccess. What we have shown is that if you provide free fresh fruits \nand vegetables to kids in school, they will eat fresh fruits and \nvegetables, and they won't be going to the vending machines. They won't \nbe eating potato chips and candy and snack foods. And they are getting \nhealthier. Every place we have had the fresh fruit and vegetable \nprogram, it has been a tremendous success. The only problem is, we only \nhave it in 100 schools. We need to expand it. That is what this bill \nwill do.\n  The bill would also give schools incentives to create healthier \nenvironments, including goals for nutrition, education, physical \nactivity, and to give grants to schools to get them to change their \nsettings, to change their curriculum, that type of thing, to give more \nnutrition and activity in the schools.\n\n  Lastly, we would provide a grant program to provide mental health \nscreenings and mental health prevention programs in schools, along with \ntraining for school staff to help them recognize children exhibiting \nearly warning signs. It will improve access to mental health services \nfor students and their families.\n  This is a comprehensive bill. We wanted to address wellness in \neverything from kids early on, through schools, workplaces, \ncommunities, the elderly, through Medicare. This is comprehensive.\n  The second part is healthier communities and workplaces. For example, \nthe bill aims to create a healthier workforce by providing tax credits \nto businesses that offer wellness programs and health club memberships. \nStudies show that on average, every dollar that is invested in \nworkplace wellness returns $3 in savings on health costs, absences from \nwork, and so on.\n  I note for the record that the present occupant of the chair, the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, is a strong supporter and sponsor of \nwhat we call the WHIP bill. I was glad to join him as a cosponsor of \nthat bill to promote employer wellness incentives. The Senator from \nTexas is right on the mark because right now there really are not any \nincentives out there. For example, if you work for a business--let's \nsay it is a small business. They can't really put a wellness center in, \nbut let's say their employees wanted to join a health club, a wellness \ncenter. The business could pay for that and have that as an expensable \nitem, deductible, expensable item, and at the same time it would not be \na taxable benefit to the employee. That is the WHIP bill. I thank the \nSenator from Texas for his great leadership. I hope the Senator does \nnot mind that we have also included that in this bill. Whichever way, \nwhether it is stand-alone or whatever, I say to my friend from Texas, \nhe is right on the mark. I thank him for his leadership in this area.\n  We had a lot of hearings and field hearings. I heard from Mr. Lynn \nOlson, CEO of the Ottumwa, Iowa Regional Health Center. This center \noffers a comprehensive wellness program for its employees, including \nreduced health insurance premiums for those employees who meet \nindividual health goals. The center has seen tremendous savings from \ntheir investment in health promotion.\n  My bill also goes beyond just the workplace. It creates a grant \nprogram for communities to be involved in promoting healthier \nlifestyles. For example, we want to support efforts such as those going \non in two places in Iowa: Webster County and Mason City, where they \nhave mall walking programs, basically for the elderly but, quite \nfrankly, a lot of other people are joining in. Of course in Iowa, where \nyou don't walk too much outside in the wintertime it is so cold, they \nhave mall walking programs, and they have it set out for quarter-mile, \none-half-mile, one-mile walks around the malls. The owners of the malls \nhave been very helpful and supportive. But we need to expand it, and we \nneed to expand it into communitywide initiatives to promote wellness.\n  At the same time our bill also provides new incentives for the \nconstruction of bike paths and sidewalks to encourage more physical \nactivity, especially walking. It is shocking to this Senator, who grew \nup in a small community--sidewalks were a part of life; you always had \na sidewalk; I walked to school every day on the sidewalk--new \nsubdivisions and housing developments are being built without \nsidewalks.\n\n[[Page S7049]]\n\nRight away that discourages you from walking.\n\n  Roughly one-quarter of walking trips today take place on roads \nwithout sidewalks or shoulders. Bike lanes are available for only about \n5 percent of bike trips. I saw some figures the other day about how \nfewer kids today ride bikes than they did just 20 years ago. I assume \nsome of that is attributable to video games and surfing the Net, and \nwatching TV. I understand that. But might not some of it also be \nattributable to the fact that there are really not too many places to \nride bikes.\n  I can tell you that as a father of two daughters who rode bicycles, \nwe were fortunate that we lived on a small cul-de-sac where you would \nride around without traffic. We also, fortunately, lived in a \nneighborhood with sidewalks, so they could ride their bikes on the \nsidewalks.\n  If I were a parent with young children riding a bike today and I \nlived on a street and I didn't have sidewalks, I am not certain I would \nwant my kids riding those bikes out on the streets. So we are \ndiscouraging young people from biking and discouraging adults from \nbiking.\n\n  Lastly, as many colleagues know, I have been a longstanding advocate \nfor the rights of people with disabilities. So I have given special \nattention to programs and activities to include people with \ndisabilities. I just mentioned the bills and incentives to create bike \nlanes and sidewalks. This will make a difference to people with \ndisabilities, who are often forced to travel in streets alongside cars \nbecause there are no sidewalks available for people using wheelchairs.\n  The Centers for Disease Control funded a program called Living Well \nWith a Disability, which has actually decreased secondary conditions \namong people who have a disability, and it has led to improved health \nfor participants. The program is an eight-session workshop that teaches \nindividuals with disabilities how to change their nutrition and level \nof physical activity. The program not only increases healthy activities \nfor people with disabilities, but has also led--get this--to a 10-\npercent decline in the cost for medical services, particularly \nemergency room care and hospital stays.\n  In addition, my bill includes a Working Well With a Disability \nProgram, which will build partnerships between employers and vocational \nrehabilitation offices, with the aim of developing wellness programs in \nthe workplace.\n  Moving on to the next title of the bill, which is responsible \nmarketing and consumer awareness, basically, that has two major \ncomponents. It has to do with menu labeling in restaurants and \nprotecting our kids from unfair junk food advertising. Having accurate, \nreadily available information about the nutritional value of the foods \nwe eat is the first step toward improving our overall nutrition. \nUnfortunately, because of all the gimmicks and hype that marketers use \nto entice us to buy their products, determining the nutritional value \nof the foods we buy can be problematic, especially for kids.\n  I will refer to this chart again. Here we have counting books for \nkids, by which kids get to learn how to count. We have the Oreo Cookie \ncounting books, where they can count up to 10 Oreo Cookies. This is the \nCheerios counting book, the Fruitloops counting book, and the Goldfish \ncounting book. Here is another Goldfish book. This is the M counting \nbook. So you can teach little kids to count by counting Oreo Cookies, \nFruitloops, M, or Goldfish--all not good nutritional value for our \nkids.\n  Why don't we have a peaches and pears counting book? Why don't we \nhave a carrots and broccoli counting book? Why don't we have fruits and \nvegetables counting books? Why is it always sugar or things that are \nhigh in fat, high in sodium? Well, you can see what happens. The kids \nabsorb this as they go along. It is because we don't have incentives \nfor anybody to put out a pear counting book, an apple counting book, or \na carrot counting book. These people have incentives: They make money. \nThey get that brand identification out to the kids and parents early \non. I can see this little kid doing the M counting book, and they \nlearn to count to 10. When they go to the store with mom or dad and go \ndown that aisle and they see that package of M, that is what they \nwant because they recognize it from their counting book. So we need to \nget away from the gimmicks and hype. That is what that is.\n  Now, there is another chart I wanted to show. This is what I am \ntalking about--putting nutrition labeling in restaurant menus. These \nare called cheese fries. This is actually something you can get in a \nrestaurant not too far from the Capitol. Actually, it is ordered as a \nside plate. You can order a hamburger or cheeseburger and order cheese \nfries on the side. One serving of cheese fries has 3,010 calories, \nwhich is 1\\1/2\\ days worth of total calories. But you would never know \nit when you order it. You would have no idea how many calories are \nthere.\n  A few weeks ago, I suggested that we have a mandate that \nrestaurants--chain restaurants--put on their menu how much fat, \ntransfat, calories, and sodium is in each entree. The National \nRestaurant Association sort of went into orbit, saying, we cannot do \nthat; it is going to cost too much money; you don't understand, they \nchange menus a lot; you would have to reprint them every time; it would \nbe too burdensome, and on and on.\n  Well, about 1 week after the National Restaurant Association came out \nblasting my approach, one chain, called Ruby Tuesday's, decided on \ntheir own that they were going to print that exact information for \nevery entree on their menu. You can go to any Ruby Tuesday's right now, \npick up the menu, and for every entree, you can see total fat, \ntransfats, calories, and sodium. If Ruby Tuesday's can do it, anybody \ncan do it. People can now look at their menu and decide, armed with \nthat information, if they want to have something that is high in fat. \nThey might say, maybe I ought to cut back a little here. Maybe I don't \nwant to order the cheese fries today. By the way, it is not Ruby \nTuesday's that carries the cheese fries. That way, customers can make a \nmore informed choice. That is what we are calling responsible marketing \nand consumer awareness. It has to do with menus and labeling in \nrestaurants. More and more people are eating out, Mr. President. They \nreally don't have the knowledge.\n  We also know that advertising to kids is getting worse. It is \nestimated that junk food marketers alone spent $15 billion in 2002 \nadvertising to kids. As I said, they are not advertising broccoli and \napples; they are advertising items that are high in sugar, salt, fat, \nand calories.\n  Here is a chart. Look at this on the left of the chart. This is the \nUSDA Food Guide Pyramid. This is what you eat for a healthy lifestyle. \nHere is bread, cereal, rice and pasta, vegetables, fruits, milk, \ncheese, yogurt, meat, and beans, and nuts. Last would be fats, oils, \nand sweets. That is the USDA food chart.\n  Look at a typical Saturday morning advertising choices for our kids. \nThis is what they get: Fifty percent of every ad they see is for \nsomething that has fats, oils, and sweets in it--things they should not \nbe eating. They are advertising only 4.5 percent for milk, cheese, and \nyogurt; 1.8 percent for eggs, dried beans, poultry, fish, and nuts; and \nabout 43 percent for bread, cereal, rice, and pasta. Usually, they are \nsugar-laden cereals. There is not one ad for vegetables or fruits--not \none. So when kids see these ads, they think that is what they are \nsupposed to eat. When they don't see anything advertising vegetables \nand fruits, they think that is not to be eaten. So that is why children \nunder 8 years of age don't always have the ability to distinguish fact \nfrom fiction.\n  We know the number of TV ads kids see over the course of their \nchildhood has doubled, from 20,000 to 40,000. The sad fact is and what \nfew people know is that back in the 1970s--1978, if I am not mistaken--\nthe FTC recommended banning TV advertising to kids.\n  What did Congress do? Why, Congress went into orbit. What? We can't \nban TV advertising to kids. So we basically took away their authority \nto do that. We made it harder for the FTC. Right now it is harder for \nthe Federal Trade Commission to regulate advertising for kids than for \nadults. You probably think I made a mistake in what I just said. I \ndidn't make a mistake. What I said is, it is harder right now for the \nFederal Trade Commission to regulate\n\n[[Page S7050]]\n\nadvertising for kids than it is to regulate advertising for adults, and \nthat happened after 1978.\n  It is time to change that, and my bill will restore the authority of \nthe Federal Trade Commission to regulate marketing to kids, just as \nthey do for adults, and it encourages them to do so.\n  The fourth component of my bill, the HELP America Act, addresses \nreimbursements for prevention services. Right now, our medical system \nis set up to pay doctors to perform a $20,000 gastric bypass instead of \noffering advice on how to avoid such risky procedures in the beginning.\n  My bill will reimburse and reward health care professionals for \npracticing prevention and screenings. It will expand Medicare coverage \nto pay for counseling on nutrition and physical activity, mental health \nscreenings, and smoking cessation programs for the elderly.\n  Time and again--and I am sure the present occupant of the chair has \nseen it in his own State--if you go to, let's say, a senior citizens \ncenter where they have an active program for wellness, where they have \nphysical exercise, where they have nutrition counseling, mental health \ncounseling, getting elderly people who have been smoking all their life \noff tobacco, you will find those elderly people use less hospital care \nservices, they go to the hospital less; they go to the doctor less than \nelderly people who either do not go to a senior citizens center or go \nto a senior citizens center where they simply sit around and play \ncards. We know that. We need to expand Medicare coverage to pay for \nthat kind of physical activity, mental health screenings, and smoking \ncessation programs.\n  Does it cost money? You bet. But think of the money we are going to \nsave in the long run. Again, I get back to my car. If you bought a new \ncar and drove it home, and you never changed the oil, you never changed \nthe transmission fluid, you never had it tuned up, and you just drove \nit until the engine seized up because it ran out of oil, yes, you can \ngo down and put a new engine in it. I think that will cost you a lot \nmore than if you just change the oil periodically and gave it a tuneup \nperiodically. That is what we are talking about here. We are doing the \nsame thing.\n  Finally, let me point out that the HELP America Act will be funded by \ncreating a new national health promotion trust fund paid for through a \npenalty on tobacco companies that fail to cut smoking rates among \nchildren, and also by ending the taxpayer subsidy of tobacco \nadvertising and closing a few other tax loopholes.\n  I want to mention the subsidy of tobacco advertising. We see a lot of \nads for tobacco. That is a tax-deductible expense for tobacco \ncompanies. Billions of dollars every year are spent advertising \ntobacco. Everything from the Marlboro Man to Kool Lights--we see them \nall the time; I cannot remember them all--all paid for by a tax \ndeduction.\n  I am not saying that a tobacco company cannot advertise tobacco. It \nis still legal to buy it. They have the right to advertise it, but they \ndo not have any constitutional right to get a tax deduction for it.\n\n  A lot of people say to me: Senator Harkin, you want to take away \ntheir constitutional right to advertise.\n  I said: No, I do not. It is free speech. It is a legal product. So \nfar it is legal. They can advertise it, but there is no constitutional \nright for a tax deduction for them to advertise tobacco, and I think it \nis time that we remove that and put that savings into a health \npromotion trust fund.\n  It is time for the Congress to lead America in a new direction. We \nneed a new health care paradigm, a prevention paradigm.\n  As I said in the beginning, some will argue avoiding obesity and \npreventable disease is strictly a matter of personal responsibility. We \nall agree individuals should act responsibly, and I am all for personal \nresponsibility. But when something reaches the proportions that we have \ntoday where it is a public health crisis, where it is impacting every \nsingle American and the insurance we have to pay for our own health \ninsurance, where it is clogging up our hospitals with people who are in \nfor chronic illnesses and diseases, where it is costing more and more \non Medicare, which we subsidize, or Medicaid, then it is time for the \nGovernment to act responsibly.\n  We have a responsibility, at a minimum, to ensure that people have \nthe information, the tools, the incentives, and the support they need \nto take charge of their own health. That is what the HELP America Act \nis all about.\n  Again, the description I have just given of this quite comprehensive \nbill is just scratching the surface. I obviously did not go into all \nthe parts of it. I do not want to take any more time here today. But \nthe HELP America Act is a comprehensive bill addressing health \npromotion, illness prevention, physical activity, everything from early \nchildhood to late adulthood, everything from schools to communities to \nworkplaces to government.\n  I know it probably will not pass right away, but I hope this becomes \na part of our national debate. This is a political year. Fortunately, I \nam not running. Fortunately, the Senator from Texas is not running. \nObviously, there are a lot of people out there running for political \noffice this year, and there will be a lot of talk about health care and \nhow we are going to do Medicare and how we do Medicaid and how we do \nthe health insurance crisis and prescription drugs, and all this is \ngoing to be talked about.\n  It is time for our Presidential candidates on both sides to begin \ntalking about keeping people healthy, preventing illness, and what do \nwe need to do to change this paradigm from a sick care system to a \nhealth care system. We need that public debate because I believe the \nAmerican people want that shift. They want to be healthier. They want \nto eat better. They want to have a healthier lifestyle. But it just \nseems as if everything in our country is tilted against that healthier \nlifestyle.\n  When you do not have a sidewalk on which to walk, when you do not \nhave a bike path on which to ride your bike, when kids in school have \nno physical activity whatsoever, when kids in school have junk food \nshoved at them in vending machines up and down one aisle and another, \nwhen kids at the earliest age watch their Saturday morning TV shows and \nall they see is candy, sugar, and fats pushed at them, when our \nworkplaces have no incentives to provide wellness to their employees, \nwhen the elderly get Medicare and if they get sick, right to the \nhospital, right to a doctor, Medicare pays; thank God for Medicare. But \nshouldn't Medicare also be trying to keep them healthy in the first \nplace?\n  People want this. The American public wants this kind of support. \nThey want this paradigm shift to lead healthier lifestyles.\n  It is time for us to get on with this business of doing so.\n  In closing, it is time to heed the golden rule of holes, which says, \nwhen you are in a hole, stop digging. Well, we have dug one whopper of \na hole in our health care system by only addressing illness and by \nfailing to emphasize prevention and wellness. It is time to stop \ndigging that hole. It is time to commit ourselves to healthier \nlifestyles and changing the incentive structure, changing this paradigm \nthat we have in this country, a paradigm shift from a sick care system \nto a health care system.\n  I thank the indulgence of the occupant of the chair for giving me \nthis time on a Friday afternoon.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/18/senate-section/article/S7050-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7050-S7051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WORLD REFUGEE DAY 2004\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, from the central highlands of Vietnam \nto the Darfur region of Sudan, and from the Tumen river dividing North \nKorea and China to the roof of the world in Bhutan and Nepal, nearly 12 \nmillion people worldwide are refugees. Sunday, June 20, 2004 is World \nRefugee Day. This week, at events both in Washington and around the \nworld, policymakers, advocates and concerned individuals will direct \nour attention to\n\n[[Page S7051]]\n\nthe plight of those who seek safety from persecution in their \nhomelands.\n  Refugees face the most difficult of circumstances. Their stories of \nescape from persecution are more dramatic than anything Hollywood could \nscript and often too horrific for most of us to imagine. Stories of \nunspeakable brutality, long journeys, and family separation are not the \nexception but the rule. Often, refugees are alive only because of a \nfaith in God and an unshakeable will to survive.\n  Tragically, however, the plight of a refugee does not end with escape \nfrom persecution. Refugees frequently have nothing but their lives to \nbring into a new country. Most refugees would love to return to their \nhomelands, but this is often impossible. Absent a dramatic change in \nconditions at home, refugees have few choices.\n  I am proud that the United States leads the world in one of those \nchoices: refugee resettlement. From its founding, America has been the \ndream destination for the world's oppressed peoples, and that dream \nendures today. I want to applaud the determination of the State \nDepartment to resettle as many as 50,000 refugees this year--a \nsignificant increase over recent annual totals. I look forward to \nworking with the State Department for the rest of this year and into \nthe next, to return our refugee resettlement program to its historical \naverages and preserve America's commitment to the world's most \nvulnerable people.\n  Some might say ``Why should we bother?'' Some might ask why the \nUnited States should play such a role. But such questions are \nultimately short-sighted. America's principles are never better upheld \nthan when we assist the oppressed. American's image is nowhere better \npolished than in the minds of refugees who receive our assistance. And \nno, the United States cannot solve every refugee problem, so it should \nbe clear that America's interests are well-served by setting an example \nfor the rest of the world to follow.\n  There is much work to be done. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are \nfleeing the Darfur region of Sudan. They stream into Chad bringing \nnothing with them and finding little across the border. Within a few \nmonths, the region has become the world's most acute humanitarian \ncrisis. The United States has already directed millions of dollars in \nemergency funds to this region, and as we find additional ways to \nrespond, I hope the international community will commit itself to \nassisting these refugees.\n  In similar fashion, I hope that the international community will not \nallow discussions of nuclear weapons to obscure the plight of thousands \nof North Koreans who have fled into northeast China. Not only are they \nliving testimonies to the brutality of the regime of Kim Jong-il, they \nremind us that sometimes refugees are forced to trade one set of \nhorrors for another. China must stop forcibly repatriating North \nKoreans and should allow the international community to provide \nassistance to these people.\n  In other parts of the world, refugees find safe haven in camps where \nthey await a change of conditions at home or some other long-term \nresolution of their exiled status. While camps are intended to be way \nstations, however, they too often become warehouses. Seven million of \nthe world's 12 million refugees have lived in camps or segregated \nsettlements for more than 10 years. Think of that: seven million people \nwho have each forfeited a decade of human potential. The international \ncommunity never intended that it be this way. The 1951 Convention \nRelating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol--signed by the \nUnited States--give refugees the right to be recognized before the law, \nto move freely, to earn a living, and to own property. But in many \ncases, these rights are not respected and the loss of human potential \nendures.\n  There are no easy solutions to the warehousing problem, but such \ntreatment is unacceptable. I hope that as we respond to the Darfur \nsituation and others around the world, the State Department and other \nmembers of the international community will take steps to ensure that \nrefugees who receive our emergency assistance today will gain \nopportunities for self-sufficiency tomorrow.\n  Unfortunately, as long as there is conflict, there will be refugees. \nBut strong United States responses to these humanitarian crises mean \nmore than a dollar figure in the budget. When the United States \nemphasizes refugee assistance and refugees, it demonstrates a \ncommitment for other nations to emulate. Truly global responses to \nrefugee crises begin here with America's strong, compassionate \nleadership.\n  As we mark World Refugee Day 2004 this Sunday, I look forward to \nextending that leadership in the days ahead, and I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in working on this crucial part of our foreign and \nhumanitarian policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/18/senate-section/article/S7051-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN RECOGNITION OF THE JUNETEENTH FESTIVAL CELEBRATION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this week people all across the Nation \nare engaging in the oldest known celebration of the ending of slavery. \nIt was in June of 1865, that the Union soldiers landed in Galveston, TX \nwith the news that the war had ended and that slavery finally had come \nto an end in the United States. This was 2\\1/2\\ years after the \nEmancipation Proclamation, which had become official January 1, 1863. \nThis week and specifically on June 19, we celebrate what is known as \n``Juneteenth Independence Day.'' It was on this date, June 19, that \nslaves in the Southwest finally learned of the end of slavery. Although \npassage of the Thirteenth Amendment in January 1863, legally abolished \nslavery, many African Americans remained in servitude due to the slow \ndissemination of this news across the country.\n  In recognition of Juneteenth, I would like to call my colleagues' \nattention the Juneteenth Creative Cultural Center and Museum founded in \nSaginaw, MI by Lula Briggs Galloway on June 19, 2003. The Juneteenth \nCreative Cultural Center & Museum will be celebrating its first year \nanniversary with the Juneteenth Independence Day Celebration on \nSaturday, June 19, 2004, hosted by its founder and volunteers. They are \nproud to present the ``Tuskegee Airmen'' and the ``Triple Nickles'' who \nwill be performing as part of the Juneteenth Independence Day \nCelebration.\n  Many years before ``black pride'' became a popular slogan, a small \ngroup of black soldiers gave life and meaning to those words. This is \ntheir story. Born within an army that had traditionally relegated \nblacks to menial jobs and programmed them for failure, the 555th \nParachute Infantry Battalion, or ``Triple Nickles'' Succeeded in \nbecoming the Nation's first all-black parachute infantry test platoon, \ncompany, and battalion.\n  The Tuskegee Airmen, a black Army Air Force unit, were dedicated, \ndetermined young men who enlisted to become America's first black \nmilitary airmen, at a time when there were many people who thought that \nblack men lacked intelligence, skill, and courage to become pilots. \nAlthough the Tuskegee Airmen flew more than 15,000 combat missions, \nonce home, they had to give up their seats on the bus to Nazi prisoners \nof war who were being transferred to holding camps.\n  Since that time, men like Chuck Simms Sr., John Weldon, and Toney \nMuzon, have continued the legacy for the Triple Nickles and the \nTuskegee Airmen. This celebration will honor them, and their fellow \nsoldiers and airmen, who have since passed away.\n  The Triple Nickles' and the Tuskegee Airmen's families can be proud \nof their dedication to their country, and their great commitment to \nhonor the values and principles of democracy and freedom. We as a \nnation have benefitted from the extraordinary contributions--and \nsacrifices--of these veterans who bravely went off to war, despite \nturmoil and racism at home.\n  I am sure that my Senate colleagues join me in recognizing and \nhonoring the Juneteenth Creative Cultural Center and Museum's first \nyear anniversary, and the Juneteenth Independence Day Celebration \nhonoring the Triple Nickles and Tuskegee Airmen veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/18/senate-section/article/S7051-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7051-S7052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement\n\n[[Page S7052]]\n\nAct, a bill that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, \nsending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety.\n  On January 14, 1999, in El Dorado, CA, Thomas Gary, 38, died after \nbeing run over by a truck and shot with a shot gun. The assailant \nclaimed that Gary had made a pass at him.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/18/senate-section/article/S7052-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7052-S7053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL DAIRY EQUITY ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I support the legislation introduced by \nmy colleagues Senator Specter and Senator Schumer, the National Dairy \nEquity Act. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this bill. This \nintroduction is well timed as this month we are celebrating National \nDairy Month and the positive aspects that eating dairy products have on \nour health. From calcium to potassium, dairy products contain essential \nnutrients that help to manage weight, reduce the risk for high blood \npressure, osteoporosis and certain cancers, among other health \nbenefits.\n  In fact, each year 7 billion gallons of fluid milk are marketed in \nthe United States, yielding about $22 billion in annual sales. However, \nthe growing price spread between what the farmer receives and what the \nretail price is don't equal out. This is a concern to me.\n  I applaud the sponsors of this legislation, Senators Specter and \nSchumer, for their hard work and commitment to the cause of bringing \nequity into the dairy industry. It should be noted that MILC replaced \nthe very successful Northeast Dairy Compact during the reauthorization \nof the 2002 Farm bill. I fought very hard to reauthorize the Northeast \nDairy Compact at that time because the Northeast Dairy Compact was not \nstructured around payments from the government like the new MILC \nprogram. I ultimately voted for MILC because it was the best \nalternative to the Northeast Dairy Compact. I commend the resolve of \nSenators Specter and Schumer to craft a solution that is fair to \nfarmers in all regions of the United States as their efforts have been \nnothing short of extraordinary.\n  The National Dairy Equity Act is a win-win proposal that lends dairy \nfarmers a hand, without tapping into the federal treasury. Price \nvolatility in the milk market, coupled with growing production costs, \nhas made it difficult for family dairy farmers to stay in business. The \nNational Dairy Equity Act will work for both the people and the dairy \nfarmers of New England as well as other parts of the United States by \nproviding dairy farmers with a safety net and by helping to maintain a \nstable price for fluid milk. This legislation will also help to \npreserve a New England way of life. The legislation gives states the \nability to work closely together to price milk in their own areas, \ngiving states the power to determine fair prices. Of the milk sold in \nNew England, a vast majority--more than 85 percent--is produced from \nherds in the New England area.\n  The National Dairy Equity Act allows farmers in each of the five \nRegional Diary Marketing Areas, RDMAs, to establish minimum prices for \nClass I, fluid, milk based on the federal pricing structure. Under the \nbill, the Governor of each state, in consultation with producers and \ndairy industry representatives, nominates three members to the regional \nboard. Participation by farmers and--importantly--participation by \nconsumers is required. This regional approach effectively balances the \nneeds of consumers and producers, while ensuring a healthier dairy \nindustry in the future.\n  The Regional Dairy Marketing Boards also have the authority to \nconduct effective supply management for their region, including the use \nof traditional and creative development and implementation of \nincentive-based supply management programs. To protect against \noverproduction, regions in which the growth in milk production is \nhigher than the national average will be required to reimburse the \nSecretary of the Treasury for the cost of government dairy surplus \npurchases up to the amount that the region is receiving under the NDEA. \nThis system of checks and balances protects against any overproduction.\n  While the Northeast, Southern, and Upper Midwest regions are \nautomatically considered as participating states, the National Dairy \nEquity Act has a mechanism for any State to opt into or out of the \nprogram. I consider this to be a strong provision in the bill precisely \nbecause it allows states to choose the option that is best for them. \nStates that choose not to participate are eligible to participate in \nthe current federal MILC program through September 2005. Individual \nfarmers in states that opt for the MILC program can choose to continue \nreceiving payments through the MILC contract until that legislation \nexpires in September 2005. This legislation has been constructed to \ngive flexibility and certainty to family dairy farmers.\n  Further, the costs of operating the Regional Dairy Marketing Boards \nare borne entirely by those participating in the dairy industry in each \nof the respective regions, at no expense to the federal government. In \naddition, the Regional Dairy Marketing Boards provide environmental \nbenefits through preservation of dwindling agricultural land and open \nspaces that help to combat the growing problem of urban sprawl, \nparticularly near large cities, but which is starting to affect more \nrural areas as well.\n  The National Dairy Equity Act provides farmers with the safety net \nthey need to continue providing the resources for the myriad of dairy \nproducts we rely on to meet our health needs. I urge my colleagues to \ntake this opportunity, during National Dairy Month to celebrate this \ncreative policy solution presented by Senators Specter and Schumer that \nbrings equity to dairy industry and could save the Federal treasury \nbillions of dollars. This legislation is supported by the Maine Dairy \nIndustry Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Maine Dairy Industry Association,\n\n                                       Augusta, ME, June 15, 2004.\n     Senator Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the 392 dairy farmers \n     operating small businesses in Maine, I thank you for your \n     support of the effort to create regionally flexibility in \n     dairy pricing through your sponsorship of the National Dairy \n     Equity Act. You have consistently been a strong advocate for \n     Maine dairy and all of Maine agriculture and we are proud of \n     your steady leadership in Congress.\n       Dairy farming is a difficult profession. The cows work 365 \n     days a year regardless holidays, weekends or illness. The \n     weather cannot be made to order. And farmers have very little \n     to say about what they will get paid for their milk, \n     regardless of the quality, quantity or freshness. In spite of \n     these challenges, Maine has a strong dairy farming tradition \n     and our farmers are proud to produce over 50 million gallons \n     of milk (605 million pounds) every year to Maine consumers. \n     Milk is a bulky, perishable product. When it is processed it \n     can be made into products that have a longer shelf life. But \n     fresh fluid milk has many more limitations.\n       The USDA Federal Order system was put in place in the 1930s \n     to stabilize the price of milk and help the farmers get a \n     fair price for their product. Over the years, this program \n     has been tweaked and twisted in directions that no longer \n     achieve its original aim. Over the years the national \n     demographic profile of dairy farms has changed from small \n     family farms with local creameries serving small geographic \n     areas to larger farming operations concentrated by region and \n     shipping milk to a few large corporate processors with \n     multiple plant locations. Milk is priced on the commodity \n     market, responding to shifting trends of supply and demand \n     that are measured on a nationwide scale. The farmers are \n     again the Davids in an industry of Goliaths.\n       Milk pricing is an incredible complex series of market \n     calculations. Simply, when the ration between supply and \n     demand shifts 1-2 percent one way or the other, the price the \n     Federal order sets for the farmer to get paid can shift 20-30 \n     percent. If you mapped out the prices for a year on a chart, \n     it would look more like a blueprint for a roller coaster ride \n     than government-controlled pricing structure. And dairy \n     farmers are only told what price they will be paid for \n     their milk AFTER they have sent it to market. Can you \n     imagine any other business working under these conditions?\n       In Maine, we are fortunate that our style of dairy farming \n     has vestiges of the old days. Most of our farms are family \n     owned, many supporting multiple generations. The farmers live \n     on the farm in the ``homestead.'' Most farmers can track \n     their milk to the\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\n     dairy case in their local store. Visitors from states to our \n     south frequently come to Maine to see our green pastures with \n     grazing cows against the backdrop of a white farmhouse and a \n     red barn not only as tourists, but as prospective homeowners \n     and future Maine residents looking to find a simpler, more \n     traditional way of life. In fact, some of the most valuable \n     land for housing developments is adjacent to working farms.\n       But the size of our farms and the beauty of the landscape \n     are coupled with innovative production techniques and \n     creative marketing efforts. Many farmers have discovered the \n     value of organic production operations and marketing to the \n     organic food niche market. Most dairy farmers have \n     diversified farm operations to include other agricultural \n     products to supplement the dairy operation, such as selling \n     hay or other silage crops, raising replacement dairy animals \n     or a variety of animals for meat and byproducts. And studies \n     have found that 89 percent of Maine dairy farms are operating \n     at 85 percent of higher rates of efficiency, utilizing new \n     techniques and technology.\n       However, no amount of diversification can make up for low \n     milk prices. Farmers are just coming back from over 25 \n     straight months of record low prices that resulted in a loss \n     of 68 Maine dairy farms (15 percent of the total). The irony \n     is that Maine has fared better than many other states, \n     including most of those in New England, thanks in part to \n     innovative state and regional solutions to help bolster the \n     price to farmers when the Federal Order Price drops.\n       Maine has long been a leader in finding new and creative \n     solutions to the challenges in agriculture. In dairy, our \n     legacy is in finding ways to allow regional flexibility in a \n     pricing system that clumps farmers from all 50 States into \n     one big commodity category. In the early 1990s, Maine dairy \n     farmers worked with state leaders to create a Vendor Fee \n     system that supported the milk price paid to farmers when the \n     price fell below the cost of production. This became the \n     model for the Northeast Dairy Compact, which successfully \n     operated in the 6 New England states from 1997 until \n     September 2001.\n       The Vendor Fee, its successor the Maine Dairy Stabilization \n     Act, and the Northeast Dairy Compact all recognized that not \n     all parts of the country can produce milk for the same amount \n     of money. Farmers in the western U.S. can take advantage of \n     federal water subsidies to turn desert into prime grazing \n     land. Some areas have longer growing seasons than others and \n     some are not suited to growing the types of grain and feeds \n     needed for dairy cattle. These three programs utilized their \n     regional marketplace to support the dairy operations that \n     supplied the consumers in that area. Consumers were willing \n     to pay more to ensure a fresh, quality supply of local milk \n     and dairy products. It was a symbiotic relationship.\n       The National Dairy Equity Act is an attempt to recognize \n     and build on the simple concept begun in the state of Maine--\n     that regional flexibility is necessary when it comes to milk \n     pricing in order to sustain a consistent supply of fresh milk \n     to all our citizens. Our dairy farms are too valuable to our \n     economy and our way of life to risk losing due to rigid, one-\n     size-fits-all policies that have been mutated to protect the \n     consumer and the processor, but do little for the farmer.\n       Without the dairy farmer, we would not have fresh milk. A \n     robotic cow operating in a mass production plant is not a \n     solution. We need a vibrant, diversified dairy industry \n     peppered throughout this country. Today, we have one in \n     Maine. Passage of the National Dairy Equity Act could mean \n     that we will continue to enjoy quality Maine milk for \n     generations to come.\n       Thank you again for your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Dale Cole,\n     Maine Dairy Industry Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/18/senate-section/article/S7053-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7053-S7054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                      NATIONAL PEACE ESSAY CONTEST\n\n Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am honored today to present to \nmy colleagues in the Senate an essay by Adam Hofer of Rapid City, SD. \nAdam is a student at St. Thomas More High School, and he has been \nawarded first place in the annual National Peace Essay Contest for \nSouth Dakota. ``Rebuilding Societies After Conflict'' examines how \npostconflict states transition to free elections, develop a national \nconstitution, and incorporate demobilized soldiers into society. By \nusing the case studies of Nicaragua and Mozambique, Adam deftly \nillustrates the importance of all three factors in a nation's \ntransition to peace following civil war. I commend his essay to my \ncolleagues' attention. I ask consent that Adam Hofer's essay be printed \nin the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n                  Rebuilding Societies After Conflict\n\n                            (By Adam Hofer)\n\n       The Greek philosopher Aristotle noted, ``It is more \n     difficult to organize peace than to win a war; but the fruits \n     of victory will be lost if the peace is not organized.'' This \n     idea of organization as central to lasting peace is as \n     applicable today as it was over 2000 years ago. Yet, the \n     question remains as to the means by which peace efforts \n     should be organized. In the twentieth century, post-war \n     countries like Nicaragua and Mozambique strove to organize \n     peaceful, reconstructed nations. An analysis of the post-\n     conflict reconstruction methods used in these countries shows \n     that free elections, a national constitution, and the \n     reintegration of demobilized soldiers are necessary \n     conditions that must be incorporated for a post-conflict \n     reconstruction program to achieve the stability and \n     reconciliation necessary for lasting peace.\n       In Nicaragua, several developments led to the end of almost \n     a decade of civil war between the Sandinista government of \n     Nicaragua and members of the Nicaraguan Resistance known as \n     the Contras. The initial spark to end the violence was a \n     negotiated stalemate between the two factions that occurred \n     because foreign military support to both sides discontinued. \n     The military stalemate gave Nicaragua the opportunity to sign \n     a regional plan for peace in Central America, known as the \n     Arias Plan, in 1987. Apart from bringing a negotiated cease-\n     fire and national reconciliation, the Arias plan also paved \n     the way for the 1989 free national elections in Nicaragua. \n     The national elections resulted in the Sandinista \n     government's losing to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the \n     candidate of the opposition party. Led by a leader committed \n     to a democratic government and national reconciliation, \n     Nicaragua had finally stepped out of the Cold War spotlight \n     and was ready to begin its reconstruction process.\n       The reconstruction process in Nicaragua that began \n     following the recent civil war is still evident in the \n     country today. Years of conflict in Nicaragua had given the \n     country a need for many elements of reconstruction, one being \n     the country's security. Nicaragua acknowledged that the \n     social reintegration of demobilized soldiers was essential to \n     establishing security and beginning reconstruction. With the \n     help of international organizations such as Network for \n     Peace, many former soldiers were successfully reintegrated \n     and became active models of reconciliation and peace for the \n     Nicaraguan society.\n       Efforts in rebuilding the governance and economy of \n     Nicaragua continue to be key elements in sustaining peace as \n     well. Organizing Nicaragua's government after peace involved \n     the creation of a constitutional democracy. This type of \n     democracy incorporated representation from both sides of the \n     conflict, ensuring that the decisions of the government did \n     not re-ignite the issues from the past conflict. The new \n     government also created the freedom for Nicaragua's economy \n     to begin development. An economic plan ``for regional \n     cooperation in trade, financing, investment, and \n     production,'' as well as the benefit of ongoing foreign \n     assistance generated economic development in Nicaragua. This \n     reorganization of the government and economy has helped the \n     country become more stable and has inclined its citizens \n     towards reconciliation.\n       It is not by chance that the conflicts of Nicaragua's civil \n     war have not re-ignited; their reconciliation is a direct \n     result of the organized means of post-conflict \n     reconstruction. Nicaragua obtained a national sense of \n     security by organizing the demobilization and reintegration \n     of many soldiers from both the Contra and Sandinista armies. \n     The government, rooted in a national constitution, achieved \n     stability and gave the country a solid foundation for \n     recovery.\n       Mozambique's successful transition from a warring country \n     to a peaceful nation is comparable to that of Nicaragua. Like \n     Nicaragua, Mozambique experienced an internal conflict, a \n     civil war that was between the Frelimo Government and the \n     Renamo, or National Resistance Movement in Mozambique. \n     Conflict ended in Mozambique in 1992, and the country's \n     efforts of reconstruction continue today.\n       The opportunity for peace in Mozambique came in 1983 when \n     the president of the ruling Frelimo government accepted the \n     failure of socialism and recognized the need for reform. The \n     government was unable to control a country that had already \n     suffered about one million deaths from civil war. This \n     acceptance eventually led to the enactment of a national \n     constitution in 1992. The constitution ``provided for a \n     multi-party political system, market-based economy, and free \n     elections.'' These elements provided by the national \n     constitution led to peace negotiations between the two \n     factions and the beginnings of governmental and economical \n     reconstruction in Mozambiue.\n       The ``social fabric'' and ``economic infrastructure'' of \n     Mozambique had been greatly disrupted by the 17 years of \n     civil strife. A sense of security in the country was an \n     important and immediate need. The reconstruction began with a \n     United Nations' program for transitioning destructive \n     soldiers into productive citizens. These efforts of \n     reintegration and demobilization were so successful that the \n     demilitarized soldiers were soon helping remove the \n     approximately one million landmines still present from the \n     country's civil war. During the first 5 years following \n     peace, ``more than 6.5 billion in international aid flowed \n     into Mozambique * * * most of which went to \n     demilitarization and demining, infrastructure and capacity \n     strengthening, and poverty reduction.''\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\n     These international efforts to rebuild Mozambique's \n     security set the stage for the rest of the country's post-\n     war reconstruction process.\n       Reconstruction of Mozambique's economy began as the nation \n     became more secure. Since much of Mozambique was drought-\n     stricken and strewn with landmines, the agriculturally based \n     economy relied greatly on international aid at the onset of \n     peace. Fortunately, a more independent economy was soon \n     underway as many landmines were removed, and good rains \n     resulted in Mozambique's first bountiful harvest in years. \n     This economic stabilization was felt throughout the country \n     and encouraged a more suitable environment for reconciliation \n     to occur.\n       The unique cultural elements of Mozambique also proved \n     helpful in reorganizing and rebuilding the country. Since \n     Mozambique's people had ``little history of religious \n     fundamentalism, warlords, or ethnic conflict,'' the \n     reconstruction efforts faced less resistance. Also, local \n     healers used traditional rituals to emphasize ``social \n     precautions for retaining a well functioning society.'' In \n     these ways, the naturally existing cultural unity of \n     Mozambique helped the citizens to put the past conflicts \n     aside and to focus on rebuilding their country.\n       The reconstruction efforts that have taken place in \n     Mozambique have been successful in sustaining this country's \n     peace. One significant reason is that most members of the \n     former Renamo guerrilla army have become responsible \n     citizens. This successful reintegration has caused a peaceful \n     attitude to filter throughout the nation and has brought \n     confidence that violence will not re-ignite. The national \n     constitution and developing economy provided Mozambique with \n     stability and promoted national reconciliation, aiding the \n     transition from war to peace.\n       Evaluating the successful methods used in the \n     reconstruction of Nicaragua and Mozambique reveals the \n     necessary conditions for successful post-conflict \n     reconstruction in any country. Free national elections secure \n     a legitimate governing body and are an essential condition \n     for a stable society. Such elections ensure that citizens are \n     able to choose a leader who reflects their ideals and who can \n     administer with majority support. A national election and an \n     appropriate transfer of power should be organized almost \n     immediately following any conflict.\n       Anoter essential condition of post-conflict reconstruction, \n     aimed at achieving a stable society, is the establishment of \n     a national constitution. Representatives from all of the \n     country's territories should cooperate to develop a \n     constitution that addresses the political, economical, and \n     social needs of the country. This diverse representation will \n     guarantee that these elements are unbiased and endow the \n     citizens with their proper rights and responsibilities. \n     Treated justly, the citizens will be more willing to \n     reconcile former conflicts and unite to maintain peace in \n     their country.\n       The final condition to achieve stability is reconciliation \n     through the reintegration of ex-combatants. The traumas \n     experienced by the soldiers during the conflict must be \n     treated by local or international agencies at the on-set of \n     peace. The ex-combatants, reconciled from the conflict, can \n     become responsible citizens of their society. Upon successful \n     reintegration, the ex-combatants will serve as examples to \n     their communities and cause a contagious effect of \n     reconciliation to permeate the country. This reconciliation, \n     like that in Nicaragua and Mozambique, will prompt former \n     soldiers and citizens from both sides of the conflict to \n     contribute to a reconstruction process that will lead the \n     country toward stability and lasting peace.\n       Thus, the means of the post-conflict reconstruction used in \n     Nicaragua and Mozambique can serve as examples for other \n     countries trying to reconcile and stabilize to organize \n     lasting peace. Although some aspects of the reconstruction \n     process will be unique to individual post-conflict countries, \n     it is crucial that a reconstruction program incorporate free \n     elections, a national constitution, and the reintegration of \n     demobilized soldiers for the post-conflict efforts to result \n     in a stable society. These elements, integrated into any \n     country's post-conflict reconstruction program, lead to \n     lasting peace and stability because they provide the citizens \n     with justice through a legitimate governing body and the \n     conditions for social, political, and economical \n     reconciliation.\n\n\n                              Bibliography\n\n       The Diagram Group.

               S. Res. 383\n\n       Whereas on Monday, June 7, 2004, the National Hockey League \n     Tampa Bay Lightning team won the Stanley Cup, becoming the \n     second team in 30 years to overcome a 3-2 deficit in the \n     National Hockey League finals to win Lord Stanley's Cup;\n       Whereas the Tampa Bay Lightning entered the Eastern \n     Conference of the National Hockey League in 1992;\n       Whereas the Tampa Bay Lightning is the 86th National Hockey \n     League team to win the Stanley Cup;\n       Whereas coach John Tortorella has become the third \n     American-born coach to win the Stanley Cup;\n       Whereas left wing Dave Andreychuk has played for and won \n     his first career Stanley Cup during a 22-year career after \n     playing a record 1,758 games and 162 playoff games;\n       Whereas center Brad Richards was awarded the Conn Smythe \n     2004 National Hockey League Playoff MVP Trophy for finishing \n     the playoffs with 12 goals, including a National Hockey \n     League record of 7 game-winners, and 14 assists in 23 games;\n       Whereas Brad Richards led the league in playoff scoring \n     with 26 points and scored 2 power-play goals in Game 6 of the \n     finals, making Game 7 necessary;\n       Whereas left wing Fredrik Modin served to assist in 1 of \n     Brad Richards's 2 goals in Game 6;\n       Whereas left wing Ruslan Fedotenko suffered a head injury \n     in Game 3, missed Game 4, returned for Game 5, and scored 2 \n     goals in Game 7, including the game-winning goal;\n       Whereas right wing Martin St. Louis, winner of the Art Ross \n     Trophy, awarded to the player who leads the National Hockey \n     League in scoring points at the end of the regular season, \n     has made significant contributions to the team;\n       Whereas goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, a 2-time National Hockey \n     League All-Star, has\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\n     earned the nickname ``The Bulin Wall'' because of his \n     blockage of countless shots; and\n       Whereas the Tampa Bay Lightning, in its 12-year history, \n     has overcome great odds, including 3 ownership groups, 5 \n     coaches, 4 general managers, and being last in the league \n     just 3 years ago: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the Tampa Bay Lightning National Hockey League \n     team for winning the 2004 Stanley Cup;\n       (2) recognizes the achievements of all the players, \n     coaches, and support staff who were instrumental in assisting \n     the team to win the Stanley Cup and invites them to the \n     United States Capitol Building to be honored; and\n       (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit 1 \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the owner, and 1 enrolled \n     copy of this resolution to the coach, of the 2004 National \n     Hockey League champions, the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I stand to submit a resolution \nfocused on the development of self-government in Kosovo. I am pleased \nthat Senators Voinovich, Allen, Smith, and Biden have joined me in co-\nsponsoring this legislation.\n  I believe that Kosovo's future lies in building democracy, respecting \nhuman rights, and fostering ethnic reconciliation. I am hopeful that \nthe United States will remain involved in Kosovo until it is self-\nsustaining. I also believe that a successful conclusion to Kosovo's \nstatus is crucial to Balkan reintegration into Europe and into Euro-\nAtlanta institutions.\n  It has been 5 years since the signing of the United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 1244 that marked the end of a brutal conflict in \nKosovo. Much progress has been made, but it is critical to focus on the \nwork at hand: developing political processes that are inclusive and \nprotect human rights, especially those of minorities. My resolution \nfocuses on the process of getting Kosovo to achieve self-governance \nbefore its future status is determined.\n  The United States Senate must continue to support the efforts of \nUNMIK (the United Nations Mission in Kosovo) and KFOR (the NATO-led \ninternational security forces in Kosovo), and promote steps to foster \nthe development of the Kosovo economy through strengthened cooperation \nwith the South Central Europe region and Euro-Atlantic institutions. I \nwas pleased to co-sponsor a resolution submitted by my colleague, \nSenator Voinovich, that condemned the ethnic violence that erupted in \nKosovo last March, and that called upon the people of Kosovo to \ncooperate with UNMIK, KFOR and the Kosovo Police to identify and bring \nto justice the perpetrators of the violence.\n  I strongly support the Administration's new policy initiative for \nKosovo, which was launched last November. It foresees periodic review \nof progress by Kosovo's autonomous institutions of self-government on \nestablishing rule of law, multi-ethnic democracy, market economic \nreform, and stable relations with neighbors. My resolution calls upon \nthe leaders of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Governance in \nKosovo, and upon the leaders of the political parties and communities \nof Kosovo, to renew their efforts in cooperation with UNMIK, KFOR, and \nthe international community to achieve political and economic \nstability. A critical step in Kosovo's development is a stable \nrelationship with Belgrade. I urge both sides to engage in direct \ndialogue.\n  I believe that it is critical for the U.S. to continue to play a \ncentral role in Kosovo and provide strong assistance in achieving the \nbenchmarks, and at an appropriate time, in determining a process \nleading to final status. I urge my colleagues to lend their support to \nU.S. policy in the Balkans and ask their support for this resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 384--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n                DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-GOVERNMENT IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Allen, Mr. Smith, and Mr. \nBiden) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 384\n\n       Whereas United Nations Securitv Council Resolution 1244 of \n     June 10, 1999, mandates an international civil presence and \n     an international security presence in Kosovo, ending a brutal \n     conflict in Kosovo;\n       Whereas during and immediately after the conflict, the \n     people of Kosovo suffered from ethnic cleansing, war crimes, \n     and crimes against humanity;\n       Whereas more than 4 years after the end of the Kosovo \n     conflict, the incidence of ethnic strife in Kosovo remains \n     unacceptably high, and the need for the fundamental work of \n     ethnic reconciliation in Kosovo remains great;\n       Whereas the ethnic violence that erupted in Kosovo on March \n     17, 2004, claiming the lives of 19 people, displacing more \n     than 4,000 Kosovo Serbs and other minorities, and resulting \n     in the destruction of more than 500 homes and at least 30 \n     churches belonging to Kosovo minorities, serves as a reminder \n     of serious challenges that remain in Kosovo;\n       Whereas the United States and the international community \n     strongly condemned the ethnic violence that erupted in Kosovo \n     on March 17, 2004;\n       Whereas the Senate adopted a resolution on April 8, 2004, \n     urging political leaders to fulfill their commitment to \n     rebuild property that was destroyed in the violence of mid-\n     March 2004 in Kosovo, and to take all possible action to \n     allow the more than 4,000 people displaced during the \n     violence to return quickly and safely to their homes and \n     communities;\n       Whereas ethnic crimes and violent reprisals against Kosovo \n     citizens of all ethnic groups harm the victims, their \n     families, and their communities, and impair their common \n     future;\n       Whereas the integration of Kosovo into Europe, and into the \n     international community, depends on the ability of the people \n     of Kosovo to overcome the divisions which have too often \n     marked the past in Kosovo;\n       Whereas an important goal of the international civil \n     presence in Kosovo established by United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1244 is to facilitate a political process \n     to determine the future status of Kosovo, taking into account \n     the Rambouillet accords of 1999;\n       Whereas ``Standards'' of democratic self governance and a \n     multiethnic society in Kosovo are embodied in the goals \n     enunciated by the Special Representative of the United \n     Nations Secretary General in April 2002, to include the \n     effective functioning of democratic institutions, the rule of \n     law, the sustainable return of displaced persons, dialogue \n     with Serbia and Montenegro, freedom of movement, a stable \n     free-market economy, property rights, and the further \n     development of the Kosovo Protection Corps;\n       Whereas the people of Kosovo have made some important \n     progress toward the fulfillment of these goals while \n     continuing to face challenges, particularly on issues of \n     refugee return and freedom of movement of Kosovo minorities;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council, in its \n     Presidential statement of December 12, 2003, endorsed the \n     elaboration by UNMIK (the United Nations Interim \n     Administration in Kosovo) of the ``Standards'' in the \n     ``Standards for Kosovo'' document and welcomed the plan to \n     periodically review the progress in Kosovo in implementing \n     the standards;\n       Whereas UNMIK has drafted a comprehensive ``Standards \n     Implementation Plan'' to give Kosovo precise guidance on the \n     actions that must be taken to achieve the standards;\n       Whereas the United States and UNMIK are currently working \n     together with the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government \n     of Kosovo (PISG) to help Kosovo meet the standards with a \n     view to carry out a comprehensive review of the progress in \n     Kosovo ``around mid-2005''; and\n       Whereas considerable further progress toward the \n     realization of the standards remains to be accomplished \n     before the process of determining the future status of Kosovo \n     can begin: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States should--\n       (1) intensify its efforts to help Kosovo achieve the \n     ``Standards'', as set out by the Special Representative of \n     the United Nations Secretary General in Kosovo in October \n     2002, and as further elaborated in the UNMIK (the United \n     Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo) ``Standards For \n     Kosovo'' paper of December 10, 2003, to bring about a stable, \n     multiethnic, and democratic society in Kosovo by carrying out \n     the steps called for in the Kosovo Standards Implementation \n     Plan drafted by UNMIK;\n       (2) further encourage Kosovo to become a factor for \n     stability in the region by having good relations with its \n     neighbors, and in particular, by engaging in dialogue with \n     Belgrade in an effort to secure a peaceful, long-term \n     solution for peace in the region;\n       (3) encourage Belgrade to support the standards \n     implementation process in Kosovo, including by constructive \n     participation in the direct technical talks launched October \n     14, 2003;\n       (4) enhance efforts to provide support to KFOR (the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization-led international security force \n     in Kosovo), and to call upon the PISG (Provisional \n     Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo) to ensure the \n     security and freedom of movement for all the people of \n     Kosovo, and the return of refugees and internally displaced \n     persons;\n       (5) urge all people in Kosovo to reject the ethnic violence \n     that erupted in Kosovo on March 17, 2004, and work with UNMIK \n     and KFOR to apprehend and prosecute the perpetrators of the \n     violence, to rebuild property destroyed during the violence, \n     and to work to ensure that displaced persons are able to \n     return safely to their homes and communities;\n       (6) promote steps to foster the development of the Kosovo \n     economy through strengthened cooperation with the South \n     Central Europe region and Euro-Atlantic institutions,\n\n[[Page S7057]]\n\n     without prejudice to its future political status; and\n       (7) call upon the leaders of the PISG, and upon the leaders \n     of all political parties and communities of Kosovo, to renew \n     and enhance their efforts in cooperation with UNMIK, KFOR, \n     and the international community to achieve the matters \n     describe, in paragraphs (1) through (6).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/18/senate-section/article/S7057-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3458.

Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Talent) proposed \nan amendment to to the bill S. 2400, to authorize appropriations for \nfiscal year 2005 for military activities of the Department of Defense, \nfor military construction, and for defense activities of the Department \nof Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for \nthe Armed Services, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title XXXI, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3146. INCLUSION OF CERTAIN FORMER NUCLEAR WEAPONS \n                   PROGRAM WORKERS IN SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT \n                   UNDER THE ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS \n                   COMPENSATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Energy workers at the former Mallinkrodt facilities \n     (including the St. Louis downtown facility and the Weldon \n     Springs facility) were exposed to levels of radionuclides and \n     radioactive materials that were much greater than the current \n     maximum allowable Federal standards.\n       (2) The Mallinkrodt workers at the St. Louis site were \n     exposed to excessive levels of airborne uranium dust relative \n     to the standards in effect during the time, and many workers \n     were exposed to 200 times the preferred levels of exposure.\n       (3)(A) The chief safety officer for the Atomic Energy \n     Commission during the Mallinkrodt-St. Louis operations \n     described the facility as 1 of the 2 worst plants with \n     respect to worker exposures.\n       (B) Workers were excreting in excess of a milligram of \n     uranium per day causing kidney damage.\n       (C) A recent epidemiological study found excess levels of \n     nephritis and kidney cancer from inhalation of uranium dusts.\n       (4) The Department of Energy has admitted that those \n     Mallinkrodt workers were subjected to risks and had their \n     health endangered as a result of working with these highly \n     radioactive materials.\n       (5) The Department of Energy reported that workers at the \n     Weldon Springs feed materials plant handled plutonium and \n     recycled uranium, which are highly radioactive.\n       (6) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health admits that--\n       (A) the operations at the St. Louis downtown site consisted \n     of intense periods of processing extremely high levels of \n     radionuclides; and\n       (B) the Institute has virtually no personal monitoring data \n     for Mallinkrodt workers prior to 1948.\n       (7) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health has informed claimants and their survivors at those 3 \n     Mallinkrodt sites that if they are not interviewed as a part \n     of the dose reconstruction process, it--\n       (A) would hinder the ability of the Institute to conduct \n     dose reconstruction for the claimant; and\n       (B) may result in a dose reconstruction that incompletely \n     or inaccurately estimates the radiation dose to which the \n     energy employee named in the claim had been exposed.\n       (8) Energy workers at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (also \n     known as the Burlington Atomic Energy Commission Plant and \n     the Iowa Ordnance Plant) between 1947 and 1975 were exposed \n     to levels of radionuclides and radioactive material, \n     including enriched uranium, plutonium, tritium, and depleted \n     uranium, in addition to beryllium and photon radiation, that \n     are greater than the current maximum Federal standards for \n     exposure.\n       (9) According to the National Institute of Occupational \n     Safety and Health--\n       (A) between 1947 and 1975, no records, including bioassays \n     or air samples, have been located that indicate any \n     monitoring occurred of internal doses of radiation to which \n     workers described in paragraph (8) were exposed;\n       (B) between 1947 and 1955, no records, including dosimetry \n     badges, have been located to indicate that any monitoring \n     occurred of the external doses of radiation to which such \n     workers were exposed;\n       (C) between 1955 and 1962, records indicate that only 8 to \n     23 workers in a workforce of over 1,000 were monitored for \n     external radiation doses; and\n       (D) between 1970 and 1975, the high point of screening at \n     the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, only 25 percent of the \n     workforce was screened for exposure to external radiation.\n       (10) The Department of Health and Human Services published \n     the first notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the \n     Special Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and the final rule \n     published on May 26, 2004.\n       (11) Many of those former workers have died while waiting \n     for the proposed rule to be finalized, including some \n     claimants who were waiting for dose reconstruction to be \n     completed.\n       (12) Because of the aforementioned reasons, including the \n     serious lack of records and the death of many potential \n     claimants, it is not feasible to conduct valid dose \n     reconstructions for the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant facility \n     or the Mallinkrodt facilities.\n       (b) Inclusion of Certain Former Workers in Cohort.--Section \n     3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000 (title XXXVI of the Floyd D. \n     Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398);

Mr. WARNER proposed an amendment to amendment SA 3291 \nproposed by Mr. Lautenberg to the bill S. 2400, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2005 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Services, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike the matter proposed to be inserted, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 364. MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES \n                   OF THE REMAINS OF DECEASED MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n                   FORCES FROM OVERSEAS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense, since 1991, has relied on a \n     policy of no media coverage of the transfers of the remains \n     of members Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany, nor at Dover Air \n     Force Base, Delaware, and the Port Mortuary Facility at Dover \n     Air Force Base, nor at interim stops en route to the point of \n     final destination in the transfer of the remains.\n       (2) The principal focus and purpose of the policy is to \n     protect the wishes and the privacy of families of deceased \n     members of the Armed Forces during their time of great loss \n     and grief and to give families and friends of the dead the \n     privilege to decide whether to allow media coverage at the \n     member's duty or home station, at the interment site, or at \n     or in connection with funeral and memorial services.\n       (3) In a 1991 legal challenge to the Department of Defense \n     policy, as applied during Operation Desert Storm, the policy \n     was upheld by the United States District Court for the \n     District of Columbia, and on appeal, by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the case of \n     JB Pictures, Inc. v. Department of Defense and Donald B. \n     Rice, Secretary of the Air Force on the basis that denying \n     the media the right to view the return of remains at Dover \n     Air Force Base does not violate the first amendment \n     guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.\n       (4) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia in that case cited the following two key Government \n     interests that are served by the Department of Defense \n     policy:\n       (A) Reducing the hardship on the families and friends of \n     the war dead, who may feel obligated to travel great \n     distances to attend arrival ceremonies at Dover Air Force \n     Base if such ceremonies were held.\n       (B) Protecting the privacy of families and friends of the \n     dead, who may not want media coverage of the unloading of \n     caskets at Dover Air Force Base.\n       (5) The Court also noted, in that case, that the bereaved \n     may be upset at the public display of the caskets of their \n     loved ones and that the policy gives the family the right to \n     grant or deny access to the media at memorial or funeral \n     services at the home base and that the policy is consistent \n     in its concern for families.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Department of Defense policy regarding no media coverage \n     of the transfer of the remains of deceased members of the \n     Armed Forces appropriately protects the privacy of the \n     members' families and friends of and is consistent with \n     United States constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech \n     and freedom of the press.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/18/senate-section/article/S7058-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                      committee on Indian affairs\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 383) commending the National Hockey \n     League Tampa Bay Lightning for winning the 2004 Stanley Cup \n     Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, Senator Graham of Florida and \nmyself congratulate the Tampa Bay Lightning for winning the 2004 \nNational Hockey League Stanley Cup Championship.\n  In only its 12th year as a team, the Tampa Bay Lightning has reached \nthe pinnacle of hockey for the first time in its existence. The past 12 \nyears have been rather difficult for the team and it has undergone \nturbulent changes. In the history of the Lightning, not only have there \nbeen three ownership groups, but there have also been five coaches and \nfour general managers. To top it all off, just 3 years ago the team \nfinished last in the league.\n  However, due to their determination, resilience, and tenacity the \nLightning has accomplished what National Hockey League teams all over \nthe country strive to achieve. While all National Hockey League teams \nstart the season with the Lord Stanley's Cup in mind, only one gets the \nprivilege of gaining such an honor.\n  As hockey fans looked at this year's National Hockey League Season, \nit was obvious that the Lightning was the underdog and few people \nconsidered the team a contender because of the numerous changes and \nsetbacks. However, the Lightning believed in itself and was full of \ndetermination. A wise person once said: Anything the mind can perceive, \nand the heart can believe, one can achieve. The Lightning has taken \nthis to heart, and it makes me proud to say that Lightning has struck \nin the Tampa Bay Area.\n  Under the leadership of head coach John Tortorella, who has just \nbecome only the third American-born coach to ever win the Stanley Cup, \nthe Lightning deserves to be commended. Throughout the season, all of \nthe players, coaches, managers, and fans have taught the Nation a \nvaluable lesson, in any equation for success, there are three factors: \ndetermination, drive, and tenacity. I offer congratulations to all \nmembers of the Tampa Bay Lightning, their families, and their fans \nthroughout the State of Florida.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements related to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 383) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

We have quite enough.\n  Chairman Warner and Senator Levin will be here Monday to work through \nany remaining amendments. Any votes ordered with respect to defense \namendments will be stacked to occur at approximately 5:30 on Monday. \nThe leader expects that we will have more than one vote on Monday \nevening.\n  Also, I remind my colleagues that last night the majority leader \nvitiated the cloture motion with respect to the Defense bill.
