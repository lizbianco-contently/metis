Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 2660, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (H.R. 2660) making appropriations for the \n     Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and related agencies for fiscal year ending \n     September 30th, 2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I have \nbeen asked to make his introductory statement, and as indicated by the \nPresident pro tempore, we are taking up H.R. 2660, which is the \nappropriations bill for the Department of Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education.\n  As a procedural matter, in accordance with the custom of the Senate, \nI ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken \nand the text of Calendar No. 175, S. 1356, the Senate committee-\nreported bill, be inserted in lieu thereof, and the bill, as amended, \nbe considered as original text for purpose of further amendment, and \nthat no points of order be waived by reason of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of two Senators, I object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the bill which we are considering today \nis the largest of all of the appropriations bills, consisting of some \n$472 billion, even larger than the Defense appropriations bill, \nalthough a major portion of that is on mandatory spending--Medicare, \nMedicaid, family assistance, and other mandatory provisions--which \nleaves $137.6 billion to fund the three departments: the Department of \nLabor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department \nof Education.\n  The amount of the discretionary spending is $380 million below the \nPresident's budget request and $435 billion below the amount the House \nof Representatives had to spend on Labor, HHS, and Education programs.\n  It is important to note that the House and Senate bills also have an \nadditional $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2004 which was achieved by \npushing back advanced appropriations from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal \nyear 2003.\n  On August 1, the last day of the session before the August recess, \nthe majority leader, Senator Frist, and I had a brief colloquy where \nthe majority leader announced at that time for the information of all \nSenators and others that the first order of business of 9:30 on \nTuesday, September 2nd, would be this appropriations bill. The Senate \nhas an enormous agenda to take up during the month of September. As is \nwell known, the fiscal year ends on September 30th and if there is to \nbe any realistic chance of completing all 13 appropriations bills, with \nonly two having been completed so far--the Department of Defense \nappropriation and\n\n[[Page S10942]]\n\nthe military construction bill--we are going to have to take up these \nbills in an orderly and expeditious way. When I say ``expeditious,'' I \ndo not mean in a hurried way. It is a matter of taking up the \namendments so we can move through them.\n  In advance of the August 1st departure date, I conferred with the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, who agreed with that \napproach. I conferred with the ranking member of the full committee, \nSenator Byrd, who agreed with that approach. I conferred with the \nchairman of the full committee, the distinguished President pro \ntempore, about the processing of this bill. I talked to many of the \nSenators on both sides of the aisle who would be expected to offer \namendments. It is my hope amendments will be offered, that we can work \nthrough time agreements. The distinguished assistant leader of the \nDemocrats is here and has been very diligent in moving the legislative \nmatters through. It would be my hope we would have the amendments come \nto the floor, offered, that we could get time agreements, and we could \nproceed to vote on whatever amendments may be offered.\n  I am advised by staff there are 45 amendments pending--amendments \nwhich we know about. That is a large number but it is well known that \namendments tend to be refined as Members consider the matters.\n  We have a major job ahead of us. But it would not be out of reason to \nconsider amendments today. We are advised that two Senators on the \nother side of the aisle have amendments which they are prepared to \noffer. If those come to fruition, we can move right ahead with the \ndebate at an early point.\n  In the colloquy on August 1, reflected in the Congressional Record, I \nmade a point that the grave difficulties which I have seen in my tenure \nin the Senate occur when the quorum calls consume a great deal of the \nSenate's time, when those two lights are on, signifying that there is \nno business pending before the Senate. I expressed the view that if \nSenators were not prepared to offer amendments, that the majority \nleader ought to consider moving to third reading, that is final \npassage, and try to move the bill along.\n  I fully understand that requires cooperation from the other side of \nthe aisle. If the other side of the aisle decides we are not to move to \nthird reading, there are ample procedures available to preclude the \nmajority from moving to third reading. But, having given that notice \nmore than a month ago that we would be taking the bill up at this time, \n9:30 on September 2, and that the expectation was to move ahead, if we \nwere to have any chance of completing the appropriations bills by \nSeptember 30 that this bill would have to serve as a flagship for the \nmonth of September.\n  I might add that the Senate has a very crowded agenda. There is \nalready considerable speculation in the media about what will happen in \nthe Congress, the House and the Senate, now that we are back from the \nAugust recess and we face many contentious matters.\n  There is no doubt that an overlay, the international issue of Iraq, \nis very much on all of our minds. I was very glad to see the Bush \nadministration sent a signal 10 days ago that there would be \nconsideration to United Nations participation in Iraq. The precise \nformula was not indicated. I think that can be achieved, maintaining \nU.S. military command.\n  There have been strong requests for a statement from the \nadministration as to what Iraq is going to cost. All of us would like \nto know what those parameters are and what the expenses are going to \nbe. That is a difficult matter to calculate because of the \nuncertainties over Iraq in so many respects.\n  There are efforts being made to bring other nations into the \noperation there, into the policing operation, and a special effort to \nbring in Muslim nations, Pakistan and Turkey illustratively, to give \nthe Arab world more confidence as to what is going on. Certainly, if we \nare successful in bringing other nations in, that will have a material \nimpact on what the cost will be to the United States.\n  Beyond the issues of Iraq and other matters for the Department of \nState on international expenditures, there is the issue of prescription \ndrugs, where legislation has been passed by both the House and the \nSenate which will have to be submitted to conference.\n  The Energy bills will be a major matter with Congress really on the \nspot to respond to the blackouts affecting 50 million people. From the \nJudiciary Committee where I serve, there are a number of matters which \nwill be coming to the floor, litigation matters, most prominent of \nwhich is the legislation pending on asbestos. A bill was reported out \nof committee, largely along party lines.\n  During the month of August, considerable work has been done by many \nof us, including an effort to bring in a very distinguished Federal \njudge, Edward R. Becker, Chief Judge Emeritus of the Third Circuit, to \nanalyze the issues in an effort to be helpful. Obviously the matter is \na congressional matter, but Chief Judge Becker has special expertise in \nthe field by virtue of being the judge who wrote the major opinion on \nthe issue of class certification. That is mentioned as one of the many \nitems.\n  The key to the success of our Senate will turn on getting started \nwith this bill and moving ahead. I think it is not unreasonable to \nthink, if we have cooperation on all sides, that this is a matter which \ncould be completed during the course of this week.\n  The bill which is now before the Senate contains funding for medical \nresearch in the amount of $27.9 billion for the National Institutes of \nHealth. This is $1 billion over the fiscal year 2003 appropriation, and \nwill continue the work of thousands of researchers across the United \nStates.\n  The distinguished ranking member of this subcommittee, Senator \nHarkin, and I have taken the lead in the course of the past 5 years in \nmore than doubling the allocations on the National Institutes of \nHealth, from $12 billion to more than $27 billion. The increase of $1 \nbillion is a sum which I personally would like to see increased. We are \nconsidering an amendment which would have a significant increase in the \nNational Institutes of Health funding.\n  When you take a look at the diseases which are affected, they touch \nvirtually all Americans either directly or through families or close \nfriends: autism, stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal muscular \natrophy, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, diabetes, \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis, heart disease, arthritis, schizophrenia, \nCooley's anemia, kidney disorders, spinal cord injury, cancers of many \nvarieties, including but not limited to breast, cervical, lymphoma, \nprostate, pancreatic, brain, lung, and colon.\n  The increases in funding here have had a very material effect for \nenormous advances in research which moves toward the prevention or cure \nof many of these matters.\n  This bill includes $944 million for obesity prevention and nutrition \ninitiatives. We see more and more that there is a need for programs \ndesigned to increase physical activity, promote healthy lifestyles and \ngood nutritional benefits. This is an increase of some $34.2 million \nover funds available for fiscal year 2003.\n  In the course of the preparation of this budget, obviously the \nsubcommittee and then the full committee have considered a wide range \nof priorities. I think it should be noted that when there is the \ncontention raised about cuts in the funding for this subcommittee, it \nis not accurate. For fiscal year 2003, the total discretionary budget \nwas $134.6 billion. The total budget for fiscal year 2004, which we are \nconsidering today, as I have said, is $137.6 billion. So that is \nessentially flat funding but not a decrease.\n  My preference would have been to have had a significant increase in \nthe funding for this subcommittee, as I argued in the full committee, \nand repeat that argument here on the floor. But we live within the \nconstraints of the budget resolution which was enacted and with the \nallocations which have been made pursuant to the budget resolution. So \non some of these items there are increases, on some of these items \nthere are decreases, but the overall budget does not have a cut. It is \nessentially flat.\n  The budget also contains $63 billion for the prevention and reversal \nof heart disease. Americans of all ages live with the effects of \ncardiovascular disease. Heart disease is the Nation's No. 1 killer, \nwith over 960,000 deaths attributed\n\n[[Page S10943]]\n\nto this disease each year. To address this initiative, the bill \nincludes $5.7 billion for cardiovascular research, prevention, and \neducation.\n  That is obviously an increase which we think is well warranted by the \nimpact of heart disease on the lives of Americans.\n  The bill includes $4.6 billion for programs for the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention. It includes $250 million to continue \nplanning, design, and construction of new facilities, as well as repair \nand renovations of the existing structures.\n  Several years ago I made a trip to Atlanta to the Centers for Disease \nControl because I had heard a great deal about the deplorable \nconditions there. I found that was true. Senator Harkin made a similar \nvisit. Upon returning, we added $170 million to the funding. In the \nensuing years, we added $250 million in each of 2 years. This is the \nthird year for this increase in funding.\n  The Centers for Disease Control is at the forefront of so much of \nwhat we are doing trying to combat AIDS worldwide, dealing with the \nSARS epidemic, and planning for potential terrorist attacks. The \nCenters for Disease Control is one of the areas which urgently requires \nadequate funding.\n  This bill also contains funding for infectious disease initiatives. \nMore than 35 new emerging infectious diseases were identified between \n1973 and the year 2000. Recent experiences with the West Nile virus, \nSARS, and monkey pox illustrate the vital need to strengthen this \nNation's capacity to identify and combat emerging infectious diseases. \nThe bill includes $2.2 billion to improve United States research \ncapabilities and to detect and control emerging infectious disease \nthreats in the United States and around the world.\n  Also included in the bill is funding for the National Cord Blood Stem \nCell Bank Program--some $10 million to create a National Cord Blood \nStem Cell Bank to be used for patients who need transplants but lack \nsuitable family donors. The stem cells found in cord blood are useful \nin treating a variety of blood disorders.\n  Following a report from the Institute of Medicine, the subcommittee \ntook the lead in appropriating funds to deal with medical errors \nreduction. This bill contains $84 million, an increase of $29 million \nover the previous year's amount, to determine ways to reduce medical \nerrors.\n  I note the presence on the floor of the distinguished ranking member \nof the full committee. I think it might be appropriate to try to move \nthe sequencing along, so I am going to interrupt my opening statement \nso I can confer with the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will allow me to say a few \nremarks prior to that without the Record appearing interrupted.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am delighted to yield to the \ndistinguished assistant leader of the Democrats.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, let me say first of all that the Senator from \nPennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa have done remarkably important \nwork over the last many years on this most important piece of \nlegislation which we have to move every year. They have done tremendous \nwork for the National Institutes of Health and for the Centers for \nDisease Control. I think we owe them a debt of gratitude for \nrecognizing the problems which we have and which have been addressed.\n  Let me say very briefly that if we maintain the schedule we have now \nhad for this entire year where we have very few votes on Fridays--if we \nhave votes, they are usually inconsequential--and we have no votes \nuntil late Monday, we can't do all the work that needs to be done. \nEveryone might as well acknowledge that. We work here on a 3-day \nworkweek basically. That is what we have been working on. We can't do \nthe nine appropriations bills that need to be done and the mass of \nother very important legislation. Once we get the bills passed, we have \nto do the conferences and bring those back. We have the important bills \nthat are already in conference that are nonappropriations matters. Of \ncourse, we have the three appropriations bills in conference. But we \nhave lots of things to do. I just alert everyone that it can't be done \non a 3-day workweek.\n  I think it is very important to note that today there will be no \nvotes. Yesterday was an important holiday. There were parades around \nthe country and other festivities that Members of the Senate and House \nwere involved in.\n  This bill is extremely important. It is a difficult bill. We are \ngoing to cooperate in any way we can.\n  We do have one procedural problem. I don't know how long it will take \nto work that out. We have the overtime amendment which the Senator from \nPennsylvania is aware of. It will take some time.\n  We also have the Leave No Child Behind Program. I spoke to the State \nlegislature in Nevada in February and said unless something happened we \nwould be leaving lots of children behind. The State of Nevada and other \nStates are really in deep trouble in education because the Federal \nGovernment is not doing what it needs to do.\n  There will be a series of amendments. They are 60-vote amendments. We \nhave to go through those. At the present time, we have about 40 \namendments, most of which are Democrat amendments. We acknowledge that. \nWe are going to be as positive and as cooperative as we can be on this \nlegislation, recognizing that it is a difficult bill.\n  I think realistically, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, who is \nmuch more experienced than I, having been here as long as he has been, \nit is going to be extremely difficult to finish this bill this week. \nToday is Tuesday. There are no votes today. We have Wednesday and \nThursday. Unless we suddenly adopt a new procedure where we work more \nthan 3 days a week--we will not be doing anything on Friday, but we are \nwilling to work with the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Senator Daschle indicated to me this bill is important and that we \nhave to work in any way we can to move it along, and we will do that.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished assistant \nleader for the Democrats for those comments. I know from working with \nSenator Reid for many years that he is consistently cooperative. I \nagree with his characterization of the importance of this bill and the \ncomplexity of the bill.\n  When he commented about 40 amendments mostly from that side of the \naisle, that is consistent with the preliminary report which I have \nheard. It also accurately states that the amendments are 60-vote \namendments, as required under the budget resolution.\n  When he comments about my greater experience, I may have been here a \nlittle longer, but I don't have any more experience than Senator Reid \ndoes. Those who have been in the Senate or who have observed the Senate \nknow we have an amazing capacity for moving promptly when we decide to \ndo so and when we decide to make relevant comments. If we can stay on \nthe bill, I think we ought to take whatever time we need on this bill. \nI don't disagree with that a bit. But it is possible to work out time \nagreements. I do not disagree with the statement of the Senator from \nNevada that it would be difficult--perhaps even unlikely--to finish the \nbill this week. But it can be done. The last time I managed this bill \nwas in June of 2000. We finished the bill on June 28 in advance of the \nconventions that year. When this Senate starts to move in a definitive \nway, this Senate has the capacity to move expeditiously.\n  I had been in the middle of my opening statement and had come to a \nnumber of the main categories. But I am going to abbreviate this \nopening statement because I have conferred with the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, the ranking member of the full committee, \nwho has advised that he is prepared to move immediately with an \namendment.\n  To repeat, there is nothing like using the time on the Senate floor \nfor amendments as opposed to statements. As important as opening \nstatements are to the bill's managers, an opening statement is a \nstatement. And if we move to amendments, I think that would be the most \neffective use of the Senate's time.\n  We might also be establishing a new record on moving to an amendment \nwithin a half hour of the opening of the Senate, especially on a day \nwhen, as the majority leader announced, there\n\n[[Page S10944]]\n\nwill be no rollcall votes. But any amendments which will have votes \nordered on will be taken up according to the majority leader's \nschedule, no earlier than tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am delighted to see my friend. I have \nseveral friends in the Senate, but there is one very special friend of \nmine who is presently in the chair. He is the President pro tempore of \nthe Senate and a man who is well equipped for that position. He has had \na long service in the Senate and, of course, long service on the \nAppropriations Committee. He has been chairman. He has been ranking \nmember. He is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee now. I speak \nof course of my dear friend, the distinguished senior Senator from \nAlaska, Ted Stevens, who is the Man of the Century for the State of \nAlaska, and rightly so.\n  I also am very proud to say I have another friend in the Chamber at \nthe moment, among several friends in the Chamber, and this friend of \nwhom I speak is the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that \nhas in its jurisdiction the bill that is before the Senate at this \ntime, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  Senator Specter is a man--I speak of Alexander Pope, who said about \nanother gentleman: ``Thou art my guide and friend.'' Arlen Specter is a \nman after my own kidney, as Shakespeare would say. And he recognizes \nthe needs of the country, as I think I do. His heart is in the right \nplace when it comes to the education of our young people, and I am very \nproud to call him my friend. I thank him for his courtesies always, \nwhich are characteristic of him. He is one of the special people who \nhave served in this Senate with me.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1543\n\n  Now to the business at hand. I have an amendment. Before I send it to \nthe desk, let me make a brief statement.\n  When Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we made a deal \nwith the American people. I am speaking of a time which was nearly 2 \nyears ago when we made this deal with the American people. We said that \nfrom now on we will hold schools more accountable--more accountable--\nthan ever before; we will require them to make sure that all children \nsucceed academically, not just the wealthy, not just those who live in \nthe nicer parts of town, but all children--poor students, students from \nAppalachia, across the prairies, across the Great Plains, across the \nRockies, to the Pacific coast--yes, all the way to Alaska--children \nwith disabilities, and students of all races and ethnicities. Schools \nmust leave no child behind. But, in return, we promised to give schools \nthe resources they need to make these improvements.\n  This bill does not fulfill that promise, and there is no better \nexample of that broken promise than the title I program for \ndisadvantaged students. Title I helps the students who need help the \nmost, the millions who are being left behind. It is also the program \nthat, under the No Child Left Behind Act, will hold schools accountable \nfor improving student performance. That is why, when Congress wrote the \nNo Child Left Behind Act, it authorized specific funding levels for \ntitle I for every year through fiscal year 2012.\n  Now, I went to school--many years ago, of course; I started in 1924--\nand it was a little two-room schoolhouse in a coal camp in southern \nWest Virginia. It was at Algonquin, WV. That is the mining camp in \nwhich I started school. That is the mining camp in which my foster \nfather worked in the mines.\n\n  We did not have the Government support in those days that students \nhave now. I was one of the students who today would be considered a \ndisadvantaged child. Of course, about all the children in that coal \ncamp were disadvantaged. But we had caring teachers. We had good \nteachers.\n  I remember being in the primer, starting out in the primer, and the \nleading character in the primer was Baby Rae. I studied about Baby Rae. \nBut those were disadvantaged children. All of us were disadvantaged. We \nall came from poor families, but we studied hard. We had caring \nteachers, as I say, and they encouraged us to study. Mine were foster \nparents, I having lost my mother when I was 1 year old in the great \ninfluenza epidemic in 1917 and 1918. But those foster parents cared for \nme, and they loved me, and they encouraged me to study and to study \nhard.\n  So I am a supporter, a strong supporter, of education. I come here as \none who has supported Federal funds for education practically all the \nyears I have been in Congress. And this is the 51st year I have been in \nCongress. There was a great debate in the early years when I was in the \nHouse about Federal aid to education. Well, it is an accepted factor \nnow in our thinking. So today I have come to support an amendment which \nI will offer shortly.\n  Let me say again that when Congress wrote the No Child Left Behind \nAct, it authorized specific funding levels for title I for every year \nthrough fiscal year 2012. The authorized amount for fiscal year 2004 is \n$18.5 billion. That is enough to fully serve 6.2 million needy \nchildren, according to the Congressional Research Service. This bill \nbefore the Senate today provides just $12.4 billion.\n  That is enough to fully serve only 4.1 million children. The \namendment I am about to offer would increase title I funding by $6.1 \nbillion for a total of $18.5 billion, the fully authorized level for \nfiscal year 2004, and it would extend the full educational benefits of \ntitle I to 2.1 million children who otherwise would be left behind. \nThis would allow us to keep the promise we made in the No Child Left \nBehind Act.\n  This amendment is fully offset, may I say, for fiscal year 2004, and \nit achieves this by rescinding fiscal year 2004 advance appropriations \nin the fiscal year 2003 Labor-HHS appropriations bill and \nreappropriating those monies in fiscal year 2004. This is the exact \nsame mechanism that Chairman Stevens and Chairman Specter are using to \nadd $2.2 billion to the base bill. My amendment simply builds upon this \nand adds $6.1 billion more for title I.\n  Students and teachers across the country are desperate for more \nfunding. In West Virginia, the Department of Education announced this \nsummer that 326 of the State's 728 schools failed to make adequate \nyearly progress. That is 45 percent of all the schools in the State. \nMay I say to the distinguished Presiding Officer, Mr. Smith, that in \nmany other States, more than half of all the schools failed to make \nadequate progress. Let me repeat: In my own State, 326 of West \nVirginia's 728 schools failed to make adequate yearly progress. That is \n45 percent of all the schools in the State, almost half. But in many \nother States, more than half of all the schools failed to make adequate \nprogress.\n  I ask my fellow Senators: Where is the money going to come from to \nhelp these schools improve? The State governments, as we all know, are \nfacing a fiscal crisis. Yet this appropriations bill underfunds title I \nby more than $6 billion. This bill, indeed, is a bit frail on the No \nChild Left Behind Act, and it is unfair to all the people in this \ncountry who are working so hard to implement the provisions of that \nact.\n  Parents and teachers want their schools to be held accountable. They \nwant every child to succeed, and they are holding up their end of the \nbargain. Now is the time for the Federal Government to hold up its end \nof the bargain.\n  As students all over the country return to their classrooms this \nmonth, it is important to remember that this amendment is not just \nabout dollars; it is about hiring good teachers. It is about improving \nthe curriculum; it is about reducing class sizes; it is about buying \neducational materials--all the elements that are key to helping \nstudents reach their academic potential.\n  I voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. I support the reforms in \nthat law. But schools need more funding if we are truly going to leave \nno child behind.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to approve this amendment. We gave our word \nto the people when we passed the No Child Left Behind Act. We must keep \nour word.\n  Everything I have said is certainly meant to be no criticism of the \nchairman of the subcommittee or the ranking member or the members of \nthe subcommittee. They have all done the best they could do. Mr. \nSpecter has done the best he could with what he had, and so has the \nranking member. I offer this amendment not in criticism of them or\n\n[[Page S10945]]\n\nthe members of the subcommittee. They simply did the best they could \nwith what they had. I fully support the chairman and ranking member and \nthe subcommittee. I simply offer this amendment because I think the \nNation's children deserve it. I hope Senators on both sides will \nsupport it to the fullest.\n\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As a procedural matter, with an objection having been \nlodged, if I may have the attention of the Senator from West Virginia, \nthe procedure would be appropriate if the Senator from West Virginia \nwould allow me first to send a substitute amendment to the desk and \nthen the amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia would be \nin the nature of a second-degree amendment and would obviate the \nobjection which was made earlier procedurally.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well, yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. This certainly is not clear, if anybody is watching on \nC-SPAN, but that would set the procedural status in the correct shape.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, it would.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send a substitute amendment to the \ndesk. For the information of all Members, this is the text of the \nSenate-reported bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1542.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry. Would it be in order now for the \namendment to be offered by the Senator from West Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendments to the Senator's amendment are now \nin order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and my colleague from West Virginia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1543 to Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee for his accommodations that have been extended at this \npoint. I send the amendment to the substitute to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1543 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide additional funding for education for the \n                             disadvantaged)\n\n       On page 36, line 16, strike the period and insert ``: \n     Provided further, That of the funds appropriated in this Act \n     for the National Institutes of Health, $1,500,000,000 shall \n     not be available for obligation until September 30, 2004: \n     Provided further, That the amount $14,103,356,000 under the \n     heading `Education for the Disadvantaged' in title III of \n     this Act shall be deemed to be $20,253,356,000: Provided \n     further, That the amount $6,582,294,000 under the heading \n     `Education for the Disadvantaged' in title III of this Act \n     shall be deemed to be $12,732,294,000: Provided further, That \n     the amount $1,670,239,000 under the heading `Education for \n     the Disadvantaged' in title III of this Act shall be deemed \n     to be $4,745,239,000: Provided further, That the amount \n     $2,207,448,000 under the heading `Education for the \n     Disadvantaged' in title III of this Act shall be deemed to be \n     $5,282,448,000: Provided further, That the amount \n     $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $13,045,199,000: Provided further, That the \n     amount $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall \n     be deemed to be $633,301,000.''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have already spoken on behalf of the \namendment. I do not ask for recognition at this point.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I note the distinguished Senator from \nIowa advancing toward the podium. I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I am very pleased to join my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Specter, in bringing to the Senate floor \nthe fiscal year 2004 Labor, Health and Human Services, and related \nagencies appropriations bill.\n  Let me begin by thanking my good friend and partner in this endeavor, \nSenator Specter, and his excellent staff, for always working closely \nwith me and my staff in putting this bill together on a bipartisan \nbasis. It is always one of the most difficult bills to put together and \nit is also one of the most important. Our Nation's health and the \nstrength of our tomorrows are shaped by the critical health, education, \nand labor investments made by this bill.\n  I will say at the outset that this bill is not perfect--at least in \nmy estimation. I will also say that my distinguished chairman did the \nbest he could with the bad hand he was dealt by a very shortsighted \nbudget resolution. As we have done in our over 12-year partnership \nworking on this subcommittee--sometimes I am chair and sometimes he is \nchair, and it goes back and forth. But it has been a great partnership \nworking together on this subcommittee over all these years.\n  This bill is no different. It is truly the product of bipartisan work \nand negotiation. We have worked closely to shape it. We have done our \nbest to accommodate the literally thousands of requests. I assume \nSenator Specter has gotten about the same number as I have--which adds \nup to about a thousand, I suppose--to try to accommodate those requests \nwe have received from colleagues.\n  Again, at the outset, I don't think our subcommittee allocation was \nadequate to meet the demands we face in job training, health care, and, \nof course, education. I will be speaking again shortly on the pending \namendment that was just offered by Senator Byrd because we are very \nshort in the area of education.\n  I look forward to the Senate debate. There will be a number of \namendments offered. I don't know the exact number that will be offered, \nbut this bill always attracts a number of amendments, and rightfully \nso.\n  As I said, I think we are short in the bill in meeting the critical \nhealth, education, and labor-related issues that confront the \ncountry. For example, with this allocation, we are only able to \nincrease education funding by 2.8 percent over fiscal year 2003. The \nPresident promised that the mandates of the No Child Left Behind Act \nwould be accompanied by the money needed to implement those reforms. In \nthat act, we put a lot of mandates on local school districts and \nauthorized monies to back up those mandates. We are $8.4 million short \nof meeting those funding goals.\n\n  I look forward to the Senate debate as we consider this important \nbill and hope to work with my colleagues to increase funding for a \nnumber of important programs funded in this bill before the bill leaves \nthe Senate floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1543\n\n  Mr. President, I will speak for a few minutes on the amendment \noffered by Senator Byrd. First, I thank him for his leadership in \noffering this amendment on title I funding for education. This \namendment, more than any other that will be offered on this bill, will \nshow the Nation--our parents, teachers, kids, and school boards--how \nserious we are about leaving no child behind. Do we give schools the \nmoney they need to improve or do we give them just a bunch of mandates \nand leave them out to dry? That is what is at stake with Senator Byrd's \namendment.\n  Now, to make the record clear, as most Senators, I supported and \nvoted for the No Child Left Behind Act. Being a member of the \nauthorizing committee under the able leadership of the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, and the ranking minority member, Senator Kennedy, \nand also being the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee that \nfunds these programs, I followed the development and was involved in \nthe discussions with the White House as the bill was developed.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act, more than any other educational bill in \nour history, holds schools accountable for performance. It demands that \nwe hold every student, including those most disadvantaged, to the same \nhigh standards. That is fine. We all agreed on that. We all want high \nstandards. We want those standards to be met even among the most \ndisadvantaged of our kids.\n  But the bill we passed also says that schools should have the money \nto do\n\n[[Page S10946]]\n\nthe job, that they should have the resources to hire the teachers, \nreduce class sizes, update their curricula, get the new technologies \nthat are out there, and make all the improvements they need to leave no \nchild behind.\n  Now, in particular, the No Child Left Behind Act sets specific \nauthorization levels for title I. We did that because title I is the \nkey to the success of the No Child Left Behind Act. This program is \ndesigned to help the children who are most at risk of falling behind. \nIt is also the program that includes the loss accountability measures.\n  President Bush and Members of Congress spent a lot of time \nnegotiating over how much money was needed for title I. This wasn't \nsomething just plucked out of the air. This was during a long period of \nnegotiation. What did we need to put into title I so that the most \ndisadvantaged kids could really be held to the same high standards \nbecause they would be given the resources they need to achieve those \nstandards? Well, we settled on an authorization of $16 billion for \nfiscal year 2003, $18.5 billion for fiscal year 2004, and so on, for \nevery year through fiscal year 2012.\n  Looking back on it now, as I voted for the bill, perhaps I was a \nlittle bit too overeager to believe that the President would, indeed, \nstep forward and ensure that we had the resources to do the job. I \nbelieved him when he said he was serious about increasing funding for \neducation to meet the mandates of No Child Left Behind. Well, now we \nhave a bill before us that underfunds title I by more than $6 billion.\n  As I said, the authorization for fiscal year 2004 is $18.5 billion, \nwhich we negotiated and put into the law. This bill provides $12.35 \nbillion, which is exactly the amount requested by President Bush. So, \nagain, my question is, if the President was serious about both the \nmandates and the resources needed to meet those mandates--the President \nwas very eager to sign the bill and get the mandates but when it came \ntime to get the money out, he shortchanged it by $6 billion. That is \nhis request.\n  Again, I don't blame anybody on our committee. I don't blame our \nchairman or anyone else. We worked together closely. I am sure a lot of \nus would have liked to have provided more for title I but we simply \ndidn't have the resources. We were hemmed in by the budget agreement. \nSo now the bill is exactly where President Bush wanted it for title I. \nIt is nowhere close enough. It is $6 billion short. That is why we need \nSenator Byrd's amendment to fund title I at the level we agreed during \nthe negotiation process. We need to fulfill the commitment we made to \nthe students, parents, and educators of this country when we passed No \nChild Left Behind.\n  I can already tell you what some on the other side will say about \nthis amendment. They are going to say President Bush has already done a \nlot to increase funding for title I. They will say title I funding has \nincreased from $8.8 billion to $11.7 billion during his administration. \nI love that phrase, ``during his administration.'' When my friends on \nthe other side say ``during his administration,'' they want people to \nthink title I funding went up because of President Bush's \nadministration. But they cannot truthfully say that, so they use the \nphrase ``it went up during his administration.''\n  It is like the weather: It has rained a lot during President Bush's \nadministration. Sometimes it has been very hot during President Bush's \nadministration. It has even snowed during his administration. But his \nadministration did not have anything to do with any of that. It is the \nsame with title I. President Bush deserves as much credit for recent \ntitle I increases as he does for the weather outside.\n  The fact is, President Bush requested only $1.3 billion of the $2.9 \nbillion we increased during his administration. The only reason title I \nincreased more during his administration was because we Democrats in \nthe Congress insisted on it over the White House's strong objections. \nAnd now President Bush wants to underfund title I by more than $6 \nbillion.\n  I guess what Senator Byrd is saying and what I am saying and I know a \nlot of others will be saying is we have to help President Bush keep the \npromise he made when he signed the No Child Left Behind Act, and we \nintend to help him keep his promise.\n  This is back-to-school time across the Nation. I was driving in this \nmorning, seeing kids waiting on a corner for a school bus, remembering \nwhen I used to walk my daughters down to the same corner to catch a \nschool bus. Parents were standing there. The kids were eager and \nexcited, looking forward to going to school.\n  I met teachers in Iowa when I was there in August, excited about the \nnew school year and the prospect of getting these kids interested in \nlearning, expanding their horizons and their knowledge of the world \naround them. But mixed with that excitement was a lot of worry about \nthis new education bill. I have not met one teacher, I have not met one \nprincipal, I have not met one school board member who is afraid of \nreforms, who is afraid of accountability, who is afraid of high \nstandards. They all want those standards. What they are really afraid \nof is the law is going to designate their school as failing, leaving \nthem out to dry with no additional funding.\n  Throughout the summer, we have gotten our first look at how big a \nchallenge we face, as States have been reporting how many of their \nschools are making ``adequate yearly progress''--that is the phrase, \n``adequate yearly progress''--under the No Child Left Behind Act. It is \nnot a very pretty picture. In many States, more than half the schools \nare falling short of their goals. If they do not turn it around, they \nwill face sanctions. They get tougher and tougher every year until \nultimately the school can be taken over by the State or everyone who \nworks in the school can be fired. It is a whirlpool effect, and once \nthey get in the whirlpool, they cannot get out unless something reaches \nin to either stop that whirlpool or yank them out, and that is what \ntitle I does. But we are underfunding title I.\n  What is going to happen is the schools that are located in high-\nincome areas, where they have a high property tax base--and we see them \nin the suburbs. Both my kids were privileged to go to Fairfax County \npublic schools, one of the great public school systems in America. A \nlot of wealthy people live in Fairfax County. The county has a high tax \nbase.\n  How about kids who are not so fortunate, kids just across the river, \nmaybe in southern Prince George's County or maybe in places in Iowa, my \nhome State. We have the same problem. In some places there are great \nschools located where they have a good property tax base. Others \nschools, where they have a low property tax base, cannot make it. That \nis where the kids are disadvantaged. The mandates we put on schools \nunder No Child Left Behind do not distinguish between those schools \nthat are located in high-income areas and those schools located in low-\nincome areas. They all have to meet these annual yearly progress \nreports.\n\n  What is going to happen if we do not pass the Byrd amendment and if \nwe do not step up and fund title I as we previously agreed we were \ngoing to with the administration? Simply, the schools that are already \nin trouble are going to get in worse trouble. They simply have no other \nrecourse. The schools that are in good shape are going to be fine; they \nhave a high property tax base. They are in affluent areas. They are \ngoing to be fine. So we are going to have a division in this country. \nWe are going to have two educational systems: One that will be moving \nup, meeting the mandates of No Child Left Behind, and schools that will \nbe going down because we are not reaching in to help fund the mandate.\n  Make no mistake about it, No Child Left Behind is the biggest Federal \nmandate on public schools ever enacted by the U.S. Congress. It is a \nFederal mandate. I hear all this preaching around here all the time \nabout local control of schools and letting the States run the schools \nand local communities run the schools. The great genius, I think, of \nour education system in America is it has been widely dispersed because \nthey have experimentation and new programs happening in different parts \nof the country. We do not have top-down bureaucratic control of all \nthese schools, as they do in some countries. We have had a wide \ndispersal of control of education in our country, and that has been the \nreal genius of our school system.\n  The failure of our education system is how we pay for it: paying for \nit on\n\n[[Page S10947]]\n\nthe basis of property taxes. I have asked many times: Would someone \nplease show me in the Constitution of the United States where it says \nthat public education is to be funded by property taxes? We will not \nfind it anywhere. But that is the way the system evolved in our \ncountry. Public education is basically funded on the basis of property \ntaxes.\n  Congress came along after a couple hundred years, first in the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act in the 1960s, and later with the \nEducation of All Handicapped Children Act, IDEA, and title I, and said \nwe need to help provide additional resources, and that has been good. \nThen the Federal Government comes along and lays a heavy mandate on \nthese schools to meet certain requirements and they refuse to come up \nwith the money.\n  The burden lies upon President Bush, but if he will not do it, then \nwe have to do it. We do not want these schools to be taken over. We do \nnot want them to fail. We want them to meet these high standards.\n  Again, we will hear people say: Money is not just the answer. They \nwill say: Harkin, all you want to do is throw money at this problem.\n  I do not think money is the only solution for our schools, but I ask \nthis question: If we want to hire good teachers, can we hire them on \nthe cheap? We already know how many teachers are leaving education \ntoday, especially in the elementary schools, because today the private \nsector can compete for those teachers, and when those teachers find \nthat their hands are tied, that they have all these mandates, and they \ndo not have the resources to meet their annual yearly progress, they \nbecome frustrated. They want to teach, but, quite frankly, they can get \npaid more and put up with less of those frustrations on the outside. So \ntoday there is a huge exodus of teachers in elementary education in \nAmerica. These mandates are one of the causes of it.\n  If you want to hire teachers, it takes money. If you want to reduce \nclass sizes, with fewer kids per teacher, guess what. That costs money. \nIf you want to replace 20-year-old textbooks and get new technologies \nin the classrooms, guess what. It takes money. If you want to fix up \nsome of our crumbling schools that now have inadequate heating and \nventilation systems which have mold--I visited a school in Council \nBluffs, IA, a couple years ago. This is a school that was built in \n1939. It is in not a very high income area of Council Bluffs. It is an \nelementary school. They had an old heating system in the basement, a \nboiler, and there was mold all over everything. Every year, kids would \nget sick from all of this mold.\n\n  Well, they received a grant through our committee. They replaced the \nheating system with a brandnew heating system. They put in new windows. \nThey fixed up the school. In the first year, the number of kids staying \nhome from school because of illness fell 90 percent, simply because \nthey were not getting sick.\n  Now they are proud of their school. It is well lit. It is a wonderful \nthing to see. But that costs money. When one is in a low-income area \nand they do not have the property taxes to pay for it, that is when we \nhave a responsibility to step in.\n  So again, Senator Byrd's amendment meets the other half of No Child \nLeft Behind. We have already fulfilled one-half of it, and that is put \nin the mandates. That half has been enacted into law and it is \nproceeding right now. Schools have to meet those mandates. The other \nhalf, which was President Bush's assurance that we would have the money \nto do that, is not there. It is about $6 billion short. That is why \nSenator Byrd's amendment helps us help President Bush keep his promise \nto the teachers, the kids, and parents of our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to give us the 60 votes necessary to overcome \nthe point of order. This is the education amendment. This is the \namendment that will send the signal whether or not we really care about \nthe future of our kids and care about making sure all of our schools \ncan meet these annual progress levels, making sure our kids and our \nteachers have the wherewithal to meet these mandates.\n  This is the amendment. Make no mistake about it. I hope we get the \n60-plus votes. I hope we get 70 or 80 votes to send a strong signal \nthat we are not going to leave any kid behind, especially those who are \ndisadvantaged.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have listened closely to the comments \nby the distinguished Senator from Iowa. At the outset, I will say our \nworking relationship has been excellent. We have had what both of us \ndescribe as a seamless change of the gavel. Each of us says we liked it \nbetter when we were chairman than ranking member, but we have worked on \na bipartisan basis to see to it that the public interest was taken care \nof when we have worked on this subcommittee.\n  This bill has been produced on a bipartisan basis and our staffs work \nvery closely together. We have set an example for bipartisanship on \nthis very important bill.\n  When the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from West Virginia talk \nabout increases in funding public education, I agree with them that it \nwould be highly desirable to appropriate more for education. There are \nlimits, though, as to what we may do. As the manager of this bill and \nchairman of the appropriations subcommittee, it is my duty and \nresponsibility to work within the allocations which have been given.\n  The Senate has passed a budget resolution and allocations have been \ngiven to each of the 13 subcommittees. As the manager of the bill, it \nis my responsibility and duty to stay within those limits.\n  When the argument is advanced that the appropriation is not as high \nas the authorization, that is correct, but I reply that that is \ncharacteristic. In the Senate, we have authorizing committees and we \nhave the Appropriations Committee. It is the standard practice that the \nauthorizers come in at a figure which is characteristically higher than \nwhat the appropriators will put up. That is done to give more latitude \nto the appropriators to see how close we can come or think we should \ncome, as a matter of priority, to what the authorizers have said. It is \nthe exception to the rule that the appropriators come to the \nauthorizing level.\n  When we take a look at the specific figures in this bill, the bill \nauthorizing No Child Left Behind was passed by the Senate on December \n18, 2001, by a vote of 87 to 10 and signed into law on January 8, 2002. \nThe appropriations bill was passed, the conference report, on December \n20, 2001, on a vote of 90 to 7 and signed into law on January 10, 2002.\n  As we look at these dates of enactment, December 18 for authorization \nand December 20 for appropriations, we tend to forget how late we \nworked into December in the year 2001. I have a strong belief that if \nthe 13 appropriations bills are not finished by September 30 of this \nyear, we are likely to be here on the eve of Christmas in the year \n2003. I think it is a fair statement that we forget how late we worked \nin the year 2001, how we had targeted October to finish, and then \nThanksgiving to finish, and then we are back, and how impossible it is \nto make any plans into November, into December, when we have other \ncommitments we would like to undertake, State travel for one thing.\n  I mention those dates really to focus on the authorization of title \nI, which was $13,500,000,000. The appropriation was $10,350,000,000. So \nthe authorization was $2,850,000,000 over the appropriations. That was \na year when Senator Harkin was the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Byrd was the chairman of the full committee. I think they did a \ngreat job in coming as close as they did on appropriations, but the \ncritical factor is the appropriations were not as high as the \nauthorization.\n  Then on other facets of Leave No Child Behind, improving teacher \nquality authorization was $3,175,000,000. The appropriation was \n$2,850,000,000. So the appropriation was $325,000,000 less than the \nauthorization. Again, that was during the tenure of Senator Harkin as \nchairman of the subcommittee and Senator Byrd as chairman of the full \ncommittee. I compliment them for what they did. I think they did a \ngreat job, but they did not have an appropriation quite as high as the \nauthorization.\n  The other aspect of No Child Left Behind was the century community \nlearning centers. Here, the authorization was $1,250,000,000 and the \nappropriation was $1 billion. So, again, it\n\n[[Page S10948]]\n\nwas slightly under by $250 million. But again, Senator Harkin and \nSenator Byrd did a very good job in coming as close as they did.\n  So the point I am making is it is not unusual for the appropriation \nto be less than the authorization.\n  When Senator Harkin very effectively makes the analogy to the snow, \nthe rain, and the heat, I want to agree with him about that, but \nPresident Bush was not responsible for the snow, the rain, or the heat, \nnor was Senator Harkin, nor Arlen Specter, nor Senator Byrd. But when \nwe take a look at what has happened during President Bush's tenure, \nwhere Senator Harkin says President Bush was not responsible for the \nincrease in appropriations, President Bush was responsible for his \nbudget request.\n  President Bush's budget request for the year 2002, his first year, \nwas $44.541 billion, which was $4.5 billion over the previous year. \nThat is a very substantial increase. If you look at the increase in \nwhat President Bush has requested for 2002, 2003, and 2004, he has made \na request of more than $53 billion, which is $13 billion more than \nPresident Clinton's request in the year 2001, which was an increase of \n$13 billion, which was roughly an increase of one-third over the $40 \nbillion which President Clinton requested in 2001. No one would say \nPresident Clinton shortchanged education. I don't think Senator Harkin \nor Senator Byrd would suggest that, and Senator Specter is not making \nthat suggestion.\n  If you look at where President Bush was in his first 3 years, his \nrequest in the year 1996 was a little over $26 billion, and his request \nin 1999 was a little over $32.5 billion. That is a $6.5 billion \nincrease by President Clinton in 3 years, an increase of about 18 to 19 \npercent. No one would say that President Clinton shortchanged \neducation. But in his first 3 years in office, his increase was 18 to \n19 percent compared to President Bush's increase of about 33 percent.\n  If you look at President Clinton's increases in other years, \nPresident Bush compares very favorably and nobody would say President \nClinton underfunded education. A fair interpretation would be that \nPresident Bush has not underfunded education.\n  Having an increase in his request from $40 billion to more than $53 \nbillion, a 33-percent increase, is a very substantial increase and \nbetter than what President Clinton did in the 3 years from 1996 through \n1999.\n  I notice that the distinguished Senator from Hawaii is in the \nChamber. I wonder if I might inquire, is Senator Akaka prepared to \noffer an amendment?\n  Mr. AKAKA. I have an amendment to offer.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is more argument to be made, more \ndebate to be made on this amendment. But when there is another Senator \nready to offer an amendment, and we have not had a quorum call at all, \nwhich is unusual when a bill starts the first day after a recess, with \nno votes scheduled, I will utilize our time and ask unanimous consent \nwe temporarily set aside the amendment.\n  Is that satisfactory with Senator Byrd?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And Senator Harkin is nodding in the affirmative.\n  I yield to Senator Akaka for his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I ask unanimous consent the Byrd amendment be set aside so \nI can offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1544 to Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] for himself, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. Allen, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, and \n     Ms. Stabenow proposes an amendment numbered 1544.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for the Excellence in Economic Education \n                              Act of 2001)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec. 306. In addition to any amounts that may be made \n     available under this Act to carry out the Excellence in \n     Economic Education Act of 2001 under subpart 13 of part D of \n     title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965, there are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $5,000,000 to carry out \n     the Excellence in Economic Education Act of 2001.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 minutes to offer an \namendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill to add $5 million in \nfunding to the bill before the Senate for the Excellence in Economic \nEducation Act.\n  I thank amendment cosponsors Senators Allen, Sarbanes, Corzine, \nKennedy, Stabenow, and Dodd for their support. Our leaders on the \nLabor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators Specter and Harkin, \nhave been helpful in working with me on this effort. I appreciate the \ndifficult job they have before them to remain within tight budget \nconstraints imposed on us by necessary increases for military \noperations in Iraq and the newest round of tax cuts. I opposed the \nbudget resolution and the tax bill because I knew that it could lead to \nthis appropriations fight, spurred by unrealistic caps on important \neducation, social welfare, and other domestic programs, pitting \nimportant priorities against each other. Despite these challenges \nfacing the bill before us, I hope that we can work something out to \nhave the Excellence in Economic Education Act, or Triple-E, funded.\n  The Triple-E provides significant resources for economics and \npersonal finance education, which are not receiving due attention by \nCongress. Although the Triple-E was included in the No Child Left \nBehind Act, the only comprehensive economic education program being \nfunded by this bill is one to assist the teaching of economics outside \nof this country. I fully support grants to improve the quality of civic \nand economic education through exchange programs with emerging \ndemocracies, which represent important efforts to foster democracy in \nformer Soviet states and other areas of the world. However, the lack of \nsupport for a corresponding authorized domestic program is \nunconscionable. This is particularly disturbing as schools must prepare \nfor the first National Assessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, in \nEconomics, which according to the National Assessment Governing Board, \nis on track for 2006. The Triple-E can fill this gap in domestic \nsupport for economic and financial literacy, but the program must be \nfunded.\n  Let me tell you what I am referring to when I mention economics and \npersonal finance education. These are very practical subjects that \neveryone should know--as basic in many cases as are reading, writing, \nand arithmetic. Again, referring to the 2006 NAEP in Economics, the \nframework for the assessment states that economic literacy includes an \nunderstanding of ``the fundamental constraints imposed by limited \nresources, the resulting choices people have to make, and the trade-\noffs they face; how economies and markets work and how people function \nwithin them; and the benefits and costs of economic interaction and \ninterdependence among people and nations.''\n  The framework continues to note that literacy in this area ``also \nincludes having the skills that allow people to function effectively in \ntheir roles as consumers, producers, savers, investors, and responsible \ncitizens. These skills include economic reasoning, problem solving, \ndecision making, and the ability to analyze real-life situations.''\n  Personal finance, which is an important component of economics, \nspeaks cogently to situations that Americans face every day. How are we \nmaking decisions when we pull out our wallets at the grocery store or \nin the lunch line? Are we each checking our credit reports regularly \nand understanding how they contribute to a bank's or credit union's \ndecision about whether our loan applications will be approved? How are \nfamilies making budgeting choices every week, and are they sticking to \nthose choices? This is difficult to say, given that personal bankruptcy \nfilings continue to set record levels. For the first quarter of 2003, \nhousehold debt service payments were almost 14\n\n[[Page S10949]]\n\npercent of disposable personal income. During the first 3 months of \n2003, the percentage of mortgages in the foreclosure process climbed to \nanother record high. We may attribute much of this to current economic \nconditions. However, I daresay that some of the financial troubles \nfaced by Americans today could have been mitigated if they received \npragmatic, standards-based education from a young age, when individuals \nare forming the habits that they may take with them throughout their \nlives.\n  Indeed, our children are not being fully prepared by our schools to \nface the realities of life because they are proving to be illiterate in \neconomics and personal finance. According to the 2002 National \nJump$tart Survey, economic and financial literacy scores have declined \nsince the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy conducted \nits first survey of high school seniors in 1997. The significance of \nsurveying high school students is that high school is the last formal \nopportunity many individuals will have to acquire a comprehensive \nunderstanding of economic and personal finance. Therefore, the results \nfrom the 2002 survey indicating failing scores from more than 68 \npercent of high school seniors taking the survey are troubling. They \nfailed to demonstrate an understanding of the basic fundamentals of \neconomics and personal financial management. For instance, the survey \nfound that the majority of students believed that interest from a \nsavings account may not be taxed. They also thought that an elderly \nretired man and his wife, who is also retired, should have the highest \namount of life insurance, as opposed to a young single mother with \nchildren. While some may not think that this is important, young adults \nentering the workforce should understand that interest from \ninvestments, including savings accounts, is a form of income that is \ntaxable just like one's salary. In addition, life insurance is meant to \nprovide income for those who are significantly dependent upon the \nprimary income earner in the family. The survey also found the greatest \ndeclines in scores on questions relating to money management and \nsavings.\n  The need to provide funding for the Triple-E Act is now. We need to \nsend a message to our schools that we will support economic and \npersonal finance studies. While results from the Jump$tart survey are \nilluminating, many public high schools did not participate out of \nconcern that poor scores would require them to focus valuable and \nlimited resources on courses other than those such as math, English, \nand science. As schools hesitate to understand the real-world \nimplications of this attitude toward personal finance and economic \neducation, it is the students who are the real losers.\n  My attention was drawn to the need in this area faced by the State I \nrepresent. Over the August recess, I cosponsored with the Hawaii \nCouncil on Economic Education Hawaii's first ever Economic and \nFinancial Literacy Conference, which drew tremendous support from many \ndifferent levels and sectors of the community. I was pleased to have \nrepresentatives from the Departments of Education and the Treasury, the \nFederal Reserve Board, Jump$tart and the National Council on Economic \nEducation--NCEE, as well as a broad array of representatives from \nHawaii's business and education sectors, State Legislature, and \nGovernor's office. The more than 200 people at the conference heard the \nresults of a survey of adults in Hawaii's workforce-- beneficiaries of \nHawaii's education system. Although those taking the survey correctly \nanswered an average of 13 in 20 questions, many did not have a clear \nunderstanding of basic concepts such as what constitutes a budget \ndeficit and what is the significance of the stock market. Furthermore, \nthe University of Hawaii department of economics unveiled a paper \nshowing a steady increase then sharp decline in economic education in \nHawaii in 1999. Thus, in the State I know best, despite a clear \ncommunity interest in economic and personal finance education, we have \na long way to go toward serving our children in these important \nsubjects.\n  Furthermore, students are not receiving this education at home, with \nonly about 1 in 4, or 26 percent, of 13- to 21-year-olds reporting that \ntheir parents actively taught them to manage money. I am not advocating \nfor government to be assuming this role in lieu of parents doing so. \nHowever, many Americans begin their roles as parents without having \nreceived adequate economics and personal finance education themselves, \nand thus lack the tools to provide their children with sound advice or \nthe ability to steer them to useful resources.\n  With this point made, let us turn the spotlight on state education \nsystems. How are they doing in this area? I am sad to say not as well \nas they could be doing. According to the third biennial survey of \nStates by the NCEE, the number of States having economic standards grew \ndramatically. In 1998, 38 States included economics in their standards. \nIn 2000 and 2002, ten more States adopted economic standards. However, \nthe percentage of States with standards who required them to be \nimplemented dropped from 75 to 71 percent from 2000 to 2002. \nFurthermore, only one in four States tested students' economics \nknowledge in 1998. The current economics testing picture is in the \nchart behind me, where you can see only a marginal improvement to 27 \nStates testing students, with four others--Indiana, Nebraska, Oregon, \nand Utah--in development. Hawaii is included in those States not \ntesting students. Again, with the upcoming 2006 NAEP, although we are \npresently unsure which students will be tested, it would behoove States \nto begin assessing where their students are in terms of understanding \neconomics.\n\n  Measuring the presence of personal finance in State standards \nproduces a picture even more bleak, with ground lost in key measures. \nAccording to NCEE, the number of States including personal finance in \neducation standards grew from 21 to 40 from 1998 to 2000, but then fell \ndramatically to 31 States in 2002. The status of standards \nimplementation is even worse, but slowly improving, from 14 States in \n1998 to 17 in 2002. Regarding testing, although personal finance is \noften part of another subject test such as economics, only eight States \nconduct personal finance testing, with another two States with tests in \ndevelopment. As you can see in my next chart, testing is currently \nrequired in Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, \nNorth Carolina, and Rhode Island, with tests planned or in development \nin Oregon and Utah. The bright spot there is that this is a significant \nincrease from 1998, when only one State tested student achievement in \npersonal finance.\n  In a related testing matter, Triple-E funding would be an important \nhelp at the State and local levels as school districts are facing the \nchallenges of meeting Annual Yearly Progress requirements under the No \nChild Left Behind Act. We must provide States the opportunity to \nexplore the possibility that math and reading scores could be \nincreased, if economics and personal finance are integrated into these \nother basic subjects. We all know children who may not easily be able \nto add apples and oranges but can instantly arrive at an answer to a \ncalculation involving dollars and cents.\n  In fact, this type of integration in teaching economics and personal \nfinance was discussed at length at a roundtable sponsored on May 16, \n2002, by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, involving the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, education groups such as the Council of Chief \nState School Officers and National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals, and economic and financial literacy organizations such as \nthe National Council on Economic Education, Junior Achievement, and the \nJump$tart Coalition. The roundtable resulted in a white paper which \nsays that if we dedicate ourselves to integrating financial concepts \ninto reading and mathematics curricula, we can teach children the \nbasics of financial education via several access points. Modes of entry \ninclude developing standards of financial education, creating tests \nthat correspond to the curricula taught in classrooms, cooperating with \npublishers of textbooks and other instructional materials to stress the \nincorporation of financial concepts into their products, promoting the \nuse of ``off-the-shelf financial education curricula'' distributed by \ncommunity\n\n[[Page S10950]]\n\ngroups dedicated to financial education, and training those most \nresponsible for conveying these valuable lessons to students--our \neducators.\n\n  It is also noted in the white paper that States requiring students to \ncomplete financial education courses produce graduates who have higher \nsavings rates and net worth, as a percentage of earnings, compared with \nthose who graduate from schools in States with no such requirement. \nSociety as a whole benefits from higher levels of savings and \ninvestment, which drive economic activity.\n  All of this provides the broad context of why I am offering my \namendment today. The Triple-E will ensure that vital resources will go \nto the national, State, and local levels to provide a needed boost to \neconomic and financial literacy. The Triple-E Act would work to do this \nby awarding a competitive grant to a national nonprofit educational \norganization that exists primarily to improve student understanding \nabout economic and financial literacy through the classroom. The \norganization would distribute 75 percent of funds to State and local \npartnerships for teacher training, assistance to school districts \ndesiring to incorporate economics and personal finance into curricula, \nevaluations of the impact of economic and financial literacy education \non students, related research, and school-based student activities. The \nnational organization would use the rest of the grant for the \nstrengthening of relationships with State and local entities, teacher \ntraining, research on effective teaching practices, assessment \ndevelopment, and material development and dissemination.\n  Furthermore, the intent of the approach in the Triple-E, due to a \nfederal match requirement, is to help existing and new programs to be \nself-supporting and involve the entities that should be on the front \nlines advocating financial and economic literacy; that is, banks, \ncredit unions, businesses, and private industry. They are the very \nentities that benefit from a well-educated citizenry that knows how to \ntake advantage of opportunities for savings, borrowing, and investing, \nand avoiding financial mistakes such as misusing credit or having to \nfile for bankruptcy. In general, these entities want the very best \neducation for the next generation of managers, entrepreneurs, business \nleaders, and consumers so that sound financial decisions can be made, \neconomic growth can continue, and Americans can be good consumers who \npay their bills on time and remain personally financially independent. \nAs Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted in a recent speech to \nthe Jump$tart Coalition, ``Building bridges between community \norganizations, our educational institutions, and private businesses \nwill be an essential aspect of our efforts to increase familiarity with \nnew technological and financial tools that are fundamental to improving \nindividual economic well-being. And the success of such efforts will \nbear significantly on how well prepared our society is to meet the \nchallenges of an increasingly knowledge-based economy.'' A cooperative \napproach is necessary to help current efforts thrive, which is the type \nof effort supported by the Triple-E Act.\n  I would like to note at this time that this body already expressed \nsupport for the type of education advocated by the Triple-E Act when it \npassed my resolution designating April 2003 as Financial Literacy for \nYouth Month. I am pleased that the other body followed suit by passing \na similar version of my resolution, both of which contributed to the \neffort to raise awareness for financial literacy. This effort is also \nsupported by various organizations, many associated with the Jump$tart \nCoalition for Personal Financial Literacy. For example, America's \nCommunity Bankers stated, `` . . . we are strong supporters of \nfinancial literacy initiatives because ACB believes that informed \nconsumers--including young consumers--are better able to make wise \ncredit and other financial decisions.''\n  Another letter from the North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation states:\n\n       As a majority of Americans have become investors, there is \n     an obligation to ensure individuals have a basic \n     understanding of the principles of savings and investing, as \n     well as preserving their accumulated wealth. Every day, it \n     becomes more apparent that there is a population of investors \n     who are ill equipped to make critical financial decisions for \n     their lives.\n\n  One could only read the names of entities and organizations that are \na part of the Jump$tart Coalition to understand how broad the base of \nsupport is for financial and economic literacy.\n  Many States are echoing these supportive statements, including my \nState of Hawaii. I was delighted that the Hawaii State Legislature \napproved a resolution similar to my Senate resolution and Governor \nLinda Lingle signed a proclamation for Financial Literacy for Youth \nMonth. Furthermore, I have been working closely with the Hawaii Council \non Economic Education, which supports funding for the Triple-E. I ask \nunanimous consent that a support letter from the Council be printed in \nthe Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. Hawaii Council member John Knox in the letter relays a \npersonal story about his son, who is now a history major at American \nUniversity. When John's son was a senior in high school, his son told \nhim that he was ``angry that I wasn't offered economics till this year. \nI feel cheated, because most of the history courses I've taken didn't \ntalk much about economics, and now I can tell that I just wasn't \ngetting the full story.'' We must fund the Triple-E to help to expose \nmore students to economics and personal finance education early in \ntheir school years, before they feel cheated out of the ``full story.''\n  Referring again to the Hawaii conference that I cosponsored with HCEE \n2 weeks ago, the issues of integrative versus modular teaching in \neconomic and personal finance education and challenges to fit these \nsubjects within the demands of the No Child Left Behind Act were of \ntremendous interest and debate. One of the main strategies produced by \nthe education discussion, which featured participants from the Federal \nand State Departments of Education and other interested parties in a \nseparate breakout session, was to provide teachers with more support, \nsuch as meaningful professional development and related incentives, in \norder to provide them with the tools that they need to teach economics \nand personal finance. The Triple-E Act is a good starting point for \nteacher support, and it must be funded so that we can meet real needs \nthat are faced by teachers and schools on the non-Federal levels.\n  To conclude my remarks, we all face a professional and personal \ncalling to support economic and personal financial literacy for all \nAmericans. Professionally, as policymakers, advocates, and educators, \nwe want to enable individuals and families. We want to give them access \nto the tools and knowledge that they need to make sound financial \ndecisions. And we want to begin that education at a young age, ideally \nwhen they are first learning the look and feel of money, or learning \nhow to work with limited resources. Personally, each of us should be \nliterate in this area, and try to encourage our family and friends to \ncheck their credit reports annually, understand economic trends, or \nincrease their financial and economic literacy in other ways.\n  Funding the Triple-E is an important step in fulfilling our \nprofessional obligation to financial and economic literacy, so that we \ncan help others to meet their personal obligations in this area, for \nthemselves and their families. I hope that something can be worked out \nwith the managers of the bill before us, but if we are unable to do so, \nI will ask for a recorded vote at that time. Again, I hope that we can \nwork something out before that occurs. Otherwise, I urge my colleagues \nto support my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 Hawaii Council on\n\n\n                                           Economic Education,\n\n                                      Honolulu, HI, July 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the students and teachers \n     in Hawaii served by the Hawaii Council on Economic Education \n     (the Council), I am writing to express our strong support for \n     the Excellence in Economic Education Act (EEE Act). Congress \n     approved the EEE Act as a part of the No Child Left Behind \n     Act, but has not yet funded this important program. The EEE \n     Act\n\n[[Page S10951]]\n\n     provides resources for teacher training, assistance to school \n     districts looking to incorporate economics and personal \n     finance into curricula, evaluations assessing student \n     understanding, research, and school-based student activities.\n       The Hawaii Council on Economic Education was organized in \n     1965 to promote and improve the teaching of economics in \n     Hawaii's public and private schools and increase the economic \n     and financial literacy of Hawaii's students and residents. \n     The Council is an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit, \n     501(c)3 educational organization that focuses on the teacher \n     as the key to Hawaii's economic literacy. Over the span of a \n     teacher's career, he or she can influence over 3,000 \n     students. This impact is truly significant.\n       The Council commends you on your tireless effort to educate \n     the public and your peers on the importance of economic and \n     financial literacy and we support your amendment to the FY \n     2004 Labor-HHS, and Education Appropriations bill which would \n     fund the EEE Act, which will provide vital local, state, and \n     national resources to boost economic and financial literacy \n     in America.\n       Several Council Members have asked me to pass on their \n     messages of support.\n\n       ``This is to encourage the Senate to accept the \n     principles--and to fund the activities--embodied in Senator \n     Akaka's Excellence in Economic Education Act. For more than \n     15 years, I have been an active volunteer and donor \n     supporting economic education, as has my company, Alexander & \n     Baldwin, Inc. We believe that citizens in a democracy can \n     participate more thoughtfully in its processes if they have a \n     basic understanding of economic principles. Regretfully, \n     tightened local school budgets are reducing, rather than \n     expanding, the chances for youngsters to have an early \n     exposure to economics. Among other benefits, federal \n     recognition and support of economic education would serve to \n     ratify and strengthen our arguments about its value on the \n     local level. As a former educator, Senator Akaka has a \n     special appreciation of this need, and we urge you, his \n     respected colleagues, to acknowledge and support his \n     sensitivity to this issue.''\n     --John B.

The ability to understand and \n     make sound economic decisions is a basic survival skill that \n     will enable students--our future employees, business people, \n     and government leaders--to effectively cope with the economic \n     uncertainties affecting all our lives.\n       Without a serious demonstration of support for economics \n     and personal finance, State and local support for these real-\n     world subjects could disappear in the face of budget cuts and \n     new requirements under the No Child Left Behind Act.\n       Thank you for leading the charge to equip students well \n     with the tools that they need to become heads of households, \n     members of the workforce, entrepreneurs, business leaders, \n     and voting citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Kristine Castagnaro,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                             Hawaii Council on Economic Education.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset I thank the Senator from \nHawaii for coming forward at an early time to offer an amendment. And \nin thanking him for offering the amendment at an early time, I urge my \ncolleagues who have amendments which they intend to present to come to \nthe floor and offer the amendments.\n  There are more than 40 amendments which have been suggested. How many \nof them will reach fruition to be offered we are not yet sure. But we \nhave proceeded for almost 2 hours without having a quorum call. And if \nwe are to proceed to complete this bill at an early date, hopefully \nnotwithstanding the difficulty even this week, we are going to have to \nproceed with other amendments.\n  If there is staff available to inform the managers' staff as to what \namendments may be in a position to be offered later this afternoon, \nthat would be helpful. If we can get an idea as to what Senators may be \narriving in town later today--we understand the absence of a vote will \nenable Senators to come to town without the pressure of a vote, but if \nstaffers could tell us whether Senators will be in town for offering \namendments later today, that would be very helpful so the managers can \nplan their activities.\n  With respect to the amendment offered by the Senator from Hawaii, I \nthink there is a real merit in what has been proposed to have \ninformation to promote economic and financial literacy among all \nstudents in kindergarten through grade 12. This item, although \nauthorized, was not subject to funding by the subcommittee. Because of \nlimitations in overall funding, the decision was made not to fund any \nnew programs.\n  I note that the U.S. Departments of Treasury and Education released a \nreport which identified a number of options for incorporating financial \neducation into schools, some of which would include financial concepts \nto material being asked on tests, urging textbook publishers to include \nmore financial educational content, incorporating financial educational \nmaterials into classroom lessons, and training teachers on the \nimportance of financial education.\n  I think it is very significant to know that there are funds available \nfor States, some $345 million, for innovative educational State grant \nprograms which could accomplish precisely what\n\n[[Page S10952]]\n\nthe Senator from Hawaii seeks to accomplish. Those $345 million in \ninnovative educational State grants could well incorporate the ideas \nfor which the Senator from Hawaii asks. In addition, there is already \nan appropriation of $2.850 billion in teacher quality State grant \nprograms which could be used for this purpose.\n  So in opposing the amendment by the Senator from Hawaii, it is not \nbecause we do not think it seeks a worthwhile objective, but there are \nfunds available in other lines which could fund this program. So it is \nwith reluctance that I am constrained to say that our rule not to fund \nnew programs because of overall limitations of funding would not have \nan exception for this amendment. Once we start to make exceptions on \nnew programs, we obviously cannot adhere to that exclusionary rule.\n  To repeat: There are funds available from other programs, funds \navailable from other appropriations which could accommodate the ideas \nof the Senator from Hawaii.\n  I note no other Senators on the floor seeking to offer amendments. In \nfact, I note no Senators even on the floor not seeking to offer \namendments. We have a cozy twosome, Mr. President, the Senator from \nWyoming and this Senator.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues, among a list of some 40 prospective \namendments, to come to the floor to offer amendments.\n  In the absence of any Senators who are coming to the floor to offer \namendments, this is an appropriate time to return to the opening \nstatement which I interrupted to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia who offered an amendment.\n  In addition to the categories already identified, this bill provides \nfor biodefense to continue the Nation's efforts to address \nbioterrorism, a very important subject, in the amount of $3.6 billion. \nOn this subject, it is worth noting that during the August recess, I \ntraveled to many fire departments and locations of first responders in \nmy State of Pennsylvania to see the level of preparedness of many of \nthe fire departments. We have allocated in Pennsylvania alone some $68 \nmillion for first responders and some $77 million in grants are \navailable.\n  In visits to many communities, there was a very refreshing sign of \nvoluntarism in the volunteer fire departments but really a need for \nmore volunteers. In Sunbury, PA, the suggestion was made that the \nschools might incorporate in the curriculum a program for seniors, \nmaybe even for juniors, which would provide high school education on \nbeing a first responder and might even inculcate a spirit among high \nschool students of a desire and an interest in volunteering, going back \nto the statement widely quoted of President John F. Kennedy: Ask not \nwhat your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country, \nto try to bring high school students into the first responders line. We \nare going to be exploring in this bill the possibility of an earmark \nwhich might be devoted to an educational program in high schools to \nencourage students to become volunteers in fire departments or other \nfirst responder units.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to come to the floor to offer amendments. \nThere is no Senator on the floor to offer an amendment. With some \nreluctance, having passed 2 hours and 5 minutes without a quorum, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that the amendment \npending is the Byrd amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Akaka amendment is pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1543\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. The amendment offered this morning by Senator Byrd is an \namendment dealing with the issue of funding the requirements of the No \nChild Left Behind Act. I will talk about the Byrd amendment which \nprovides additional funding for the Title I program, a major part of No \nChild Left Behind.\n  The No Child Left Behind law passed the Congress with very wide \nsupport. It was proposed by the President. It was embraced by people on \nthe left and the right in Congress. It had strong bipartisan support. \nBut there are significant issues and problems attached to it, one of \nwhich is being addressed by this amendment offered this morning by my \ncolleague. I come to the floor to support that amendment.\n  I begin by saying that I am a little weary of people trashing public \nschools in this country. We have a wonderful educational system. We \nhave significant challenges. There is no question about that. But we \nhave a great educational system.\n  We are one of the few countries in the world that early on started \nwith a basic notion that every young child ought to be able to go \nthrough a classroom door and learn and become whatever their God given \ntalents allow them to become. Through it all, we have had wonderful \nyoung men and women move from classrooms to experiments in research, to \nbusiness, to academics, and to create in this country quite a \nremarkable record of achievement.\n  I recall a story I have told my colleagues many times but it is worth \ntelling again whenever I talk about education. The oldest man in \nCongress when I arrived was a man named Claude Pepper, the Congressman \nfrom the State of Florida. He was then in his late eighties. When I \nwent to see him to say hello, because I knew a lot about him, behind \nhis chair in his office on the wall were two interesting pictures. One \nwas of Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight. It \nwas autographed to Congressman Pepper, by Orville Wright before he \ndied, a picture of his first flight: To Congressman Claude Pepper, with \ngreat admiration, Orville Wright.\n  Beneath it there was a picture of Neil Armstrong standing on the \nMoon, autographed to Claude Pepper. I thought about the distance \nbetween those two framed photographs, the first person to fly and the \nfirst person to walk on the Moon. December 17, 1903, for 59 seconds, \nOrville Wright left the ground and flew. And then in 1969 Neil \nArmstrong walked on the surface of the Moon.\n  What is the distance between those two photographs framed on one \nCongressman's office wall? The distance is education, learning, \nknowledge. It did not happen in a European country. It did not happen \nin an African or Asian country. It happened in this country.\n  Our system of public education gives every young child every \nopportunity to be whatever their God given talents allow them to be, \nwhich has spawned remarkable opportunities and challenges and \nremarkable achievements. Those achievements, the first person to leave \nthe ground and fly and the first person to fly to the Moon and walk on \nthe surface of the Moon is an achievement of technology, science, and \nknowledge.\n  There are so many others. We could talk about, for example, Dr. Jonas \nSalk and the development of the Salk vaccine that prevents polio. There \nare so many other examples that I should not even begin to list them.\n  The point is that all of this stems from America's public schools. \nYes, we have some great private schools as well, but public education \nhas been the way we have educated the large majority of American young \npeople.\n  I come from one of those schools, a very small rural school in a very \nsmall town with a senior high school class of nine students, a high \nschool with four grades--freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior--\ntotaling 40 students. We didn't have foreign languages in that high \nschool. We had a library the size of a coat closet. Disadvantaged? \nProbably. But did I get a great education? You bet your life I did. \nBecause the school board members in that town cared about that school \nand made sure it was a good school.\n\n  Let me talk just a bit about where we are today. I talked about where \nI went to school. We still have a lot of rural schools. I visited many \ncommunities in August in my home State of North Dakota and talked with \neducators, talked with school administrators, talked with parents about \nthe schools in their hometowns. We have many small community schools \nand\n\n[[Page S10953]]\n\nthey do a remarkable job of educating their kids.\n  We passed a piece of Federal legislation that the President described \nas No Child Left Behind. I think it makes sense. I agree with President \nBush. It makes sense to have accountability in education. \nAccountability is important. We spend a lot of money on schools and on \neducation. We give report cards to kids for a reason--so that child and \nthat child's parents understand how the child is doing in school. That \nis the report card. There is nothing at all wrong or inappropriate with \nus deciding we ought to have report cards on our schools as well, \nbecause some schools do better than others.\n  The question is why. Why shouldn't a child walking through a \nclassroom door in one State have the same opportunity at a quality \neducation as a child walking through a classroom door in another State \nor another county or another city?\n  Accountability is fine. We spend a great deal of money on education \nin this country. Public funding for education is important. We commit a \ngreat deal to it, so let's hold schools accountable. That is the \nphilosophy behind this law, No Child Left Behind. The title itself \nsimply begs the question: Would you want to leave a child behind? The \nanswer is no, of course not. Has anyone proposed legislation here in \nthe Senate that says: Let's leave children behind? Has anybody here \nsaid: My bill says leave children behind? Of course not. No Child Left \nBehind is a title. We all agree with that. It is a slogan, and an \nimportant slogan, I might say: No Child Left Behind.\n  What is important, however, is what we do at the Federal level to \ncreate opportunities to improve our education system and, yes, to \nprovide more accountability for how the resources are spent and how our \nschools are doing. It is very important for us to have passed this \nlegislation and now to do what is necessary to make it work.\n  I regret to tell you that at least my observation is that in two \nareas we are setting this law up for failure, which then means we are \nsetting up for failure those children and the teachers and the parents \nand the school administrators who are a part of this large, wonderful, \nimportant industry called public education.\n  The two areas are as follows. No. 1 is funding. There was an implied \npromise by everyone when this legislation was passed imposing mandates, \ncertain requirements on school districts and schools in this country, \nthat we would provide the funding for those mandates. In fact, when \nPresident Bush signed the law, he said:\n\n       And a fourth principle is that we are going to spend more \n     money, more resources, but they'll be directed at methods \n     that work. We're going to spend more on our schools, and \n     we're going to spend it more wisely.\n  Beyond this quote, the implied promise by the President and by \nMembers of Congress, the bipartisan consensus, was that we will impose \nthese mandates and we will provide funding to make them work. \nRegrettably, that has not happened. Providing the funding is the goal \nof this amendment that has been offered and it is one I support. The \nink of the President's signature on this bill was hardly dry when the \nnext Presidential budget was sent to the Congress that did not fully \nfund the authorized requirements in No Child Left Behind. In fact, the \nPresident's proposal cut some funding initially. The Fiscal Year 2003 \nOmnibus Appropriations Act fell about $7.2 billion short of the \nauthorized level for No Child Left Behind programs.\n  Some will make the case that authorization bills are different from \nappropriations bills. It is not unusual that we authorize more than we \nactually appropriate, and I agree with that. That certainly is the \ncase. But it is also the case with No Child Left Behind that we \nembarked on a new and aggressive education policy in this country that \nsaid we will seek accountability but we will also provide the resources \nto make that happen. Regrettably, the President has not requested those \nresources. His requests have fallen far short of that which I believe \nwas promised. Also, the Congress has not provided the resources above \nthe President's request. We have provided some additional resources but \nnot sufficient resources to do what I believe we need to be doing.\n  The second area I think will set this up for failure unless some \nchanges are made is the issue of flexibility. This ought not and cannot \nand should not be a one-size-fits-all public policy. You simply cannot \nput the same template over a school with nine high school senior \nstudents as you do over a school in midtown Manhattan. They are \ndifferent schools with different resources, different needs, different \ncircumstances. So you have to have some flexibility to recognize that.\n  If this law is administered with flexibility and with the sensitivity \nand understanding that you have different parts of the country with \ndifferent needs, different school districts, different kinds of \nschools, different challenges with different kinds of students--if you \nunderstand that and are sensitive to it in the rules and regulations \nadministered by both the Department of Education and the State \neducation agencies, then this can work.\n  But if this policy says to a small school in a small town: You have a \nteacher and that teacher has been teaching geography in your school for \n12 years, and he or she is, by all accounts, a wonderful teacher, loved \nby the students, teaches a wonderful course in geography, and produces \nfrom that course students who know that subject cold--by all accounts \nan all-star teacher, but that teacher is teaching in his or her college \nminor, not major if, because of this--legislation and the way it is \ninterpreted in the rules and regulations at the Federal Department of \nEducation and the State education authorities, you say to that teacher \nand that school: By the way, you are not highly qualified and therefore \nyou are not eligible to teach that course in geography that you have \ntaught so well and with such excellence for 12 years, then I say this \nlegislation is destined to fail.\n  We must recognize, and the legislation we passed does recognize, that \nthere are alternatives and opportunities for teachers of the type I \njust described. Some, however, who administer this law, at both the \nFederal and State levels, say what we demand, then, is that teachers \nteach only in their major because that is the only teacher who is \nhighly qualified. Nonsense. Total rubbish. There are teachers who teach \nin their minor who do a wonderful job and have developed the \nexperience, the skill, and the capability to be wonderful teachers.\n\n  If someone is going to say, especially to rural schools in this \ncountry: You must teach only in your major, and if you are teaching in \nyour minor, you are not highly qualified and therefore you are not \neligible to teach, then the question is, Who is going to come up with \nthe extra money to fund all that? You are going to have teachers going \nthrough our colleges getting trained as teachers getting double majors? \nThey have to stay in school longer. It is going to cost more money.\n  We have States that do not pay teachers very much money. The fact is, \nthey spend most of their day with our kids. Yet we do not, apparently, \nvalue that profession significantly enough to pay it the kind of money \nthat is necessary to keep teachers in the profession.\n  I think two things are at work here. First, if this is not funded, it \nis destined to fail. You cannot have an implied promise that we will \nimpose the mandate and fund the mandate and then not fund it. And, \nsecond, if we do not have flexibility in how this is administered by \nboth Federal and State education departments, it is destined to fail as \nwell. I don't want it to fail. I want this law to succeed, and I want \nthis to recognize with some significant abundance of common sense that \nthere is a way to hold schools accountable. There is a way for us to \nestablish national aspirations and goals, to demand accountability, \nwithout being foolish about it and without telling a fair number of \nteachers, wonderful teachers, the best and brightest with standards of \nexcellence by all accounts, that, somehow, you are no longer capable of \nteaching. That makes no sense at all. That is absurd.\n  I want this to succeed, but the two areas I mentioned are two areas I \nthink will destine this law to fail unless remedies are taken that will \nresolve both: No. 1, adequate funding and, No. 2, the implementation of \nthis legislation in a way that recognizes the need for flexibility; the \nimplementation ought to\n\n[[Page S10954]]\n\nrecognize that ``highly qualified'' is a description that ought to \napply to all teachers who do an excellent job everywhere in this \ncountry. That is who highly qualified ought to apply to.\n\n  All of us come from schools that gave us opportunities. I mentioned \nthat my high school senior class was in a really small community in \nsouthwestern North Dakota with nine students. I had a couple of \nteachers, one especially who I think helped me a great deal. Teachers \nlive with you the rest of their lives. In fact, when I was elected to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives, my English teacher from high school \nwould still from time to time send back to me newsletters I would send \nout to North Dakota constituents. She would edit them for grammar and \nmistakes and send them back. English teachers never leave you, of \ncourse. But there are wonderful teachers. They blessed my life and \nblessed the lives of so many American kids who have graduated from our \nschool system.\n  I come today to support the specific Byrd amendment that would \nprovide the funding that is necessary to increase funding for title I \nto the $18.6 billion level that was authorized by law. Title I is the \nlargest program funded by the No Child Left Behind Act, the major \nFederal aid program serving disadvantaged students--those students most \nin danger of falling behind. This amendment is the same amendment \nSenator Byrd offered during the appropriations committee markup, which \nwas regrettably rejected on a party-line vote.\n  We hear these days of teachers buying their own supplies for their \nclassrooms because the school district doesn't supply them. We hear \nabout states on the west coast where teachers worked the last 10 days \nof the year for free, without salary, because the school district \ndidn't have the money to pay them. We hear all of these stories about \nwhat is happening with respect to the financial crunch both at the \nState and local governments. That applies to school districts as well.\n  The question of whether we are going to allow this to succeed and \nmake accountability something that really does work is I think a \nfunction of whether we are willing to put our money where our mouth is. \nIf we are going to impose mandates, how are we going to fund those \nmandates? The implied promise was that we were. Regrettably, the \nhistory of this in the last couple of years is that we are not going to \nmeet that promise. This amendment is one more opportunity to do what we \nsaid we were going to do.\n  Second, I simply want my comments today to send a statement to those \nwho are engaged both at the Federal level and at the State level in \ndeveloping these definitions that if these definitions and the \nimplementation of this legislation is done without common sense, once \nagain this is destined to fail. We must have some common sense in how \nthis is implemented. It can work. It should work. I hope it will work. \nBut this law called the No Child Left Behind Act simply will not work \nunless these two conditions are met.\n  I introduced a resolution a couple of months ago that would suspend \nthe enforcement of the No Child Left Behind Act until full funding is \nprovided and that called for flexibility in the implementation that \nwill allow this law an opportunity to work.\n  I see that the Senator from Pennsylvania, the manager of the bill, is \non the floor. I was intending to say just a few words on a separate \nsubject on the issue of trade, but I don't want to interrupt the \ndiscussions with respect to education. So let me ask my colleague if he \nwas intending to speak on the bill at this point. If that were the \ncase, I would defer.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I appreciate the invitation of the \nSenator from North Dakota, and I would like an opportunity to comment \nupon what he has had to say about the amendment by the Senator from \nWest Virginia and also on the flexibility issue. Then I would defer to \nthe Senator from North Dakota to speak additionally about trade.\n  When the Senator from North Dakota calls for adequate funding, I \nwould suggest to him that the determination of ``adequate'' doesn't \nnecessarily turn on having an opportunity which meets the full level of \nauthorization. Some of this I had submitted when Senator Byrd had \noffered the amendment, but I think it would bear just a little \nrepetition. Perhaps the Senator from North Dakota didn't hear it, or \nperhaps there might be even somebody listening on C-SPAN who wasn't \nlistening earlier, or perhaps there might be somebody on C-SPAN \nlistening. But just because the appropriations bill figure is not up to \nthe level of authorization does not necessarily mean it is not \nadequate.\n  My preference would have been to have had a larger allocation for \nthis subcommittee report and have had a larger allocation for \neducation. But as Senator Byrd said earlier, and Senator Harkin said \nearlier, this appropriations bill goes about as far as you can. Senator \nHarkin and I had commented earlier this is a bipartisan bill. We have \nworked out the appropriations process in a bipartisan way.\n  I became chairman in 1995, and Senator Harkin has been chairman \nintermittently and I ranking, and reverse. As we have frequently said, \nit has been a seamless transfer of the gavel. But as Senator Harkin \nnoted, this appropriation bill did as well as you could, and Senator \nByrd, the ranking member of the full committee, agreed with him. The \nquestion of what is adequate is a fair subject for debate. I repeat \nthat it has always been desirable to have more funding on education. \nBut just because the approprations is not up to the authorization \nlevel, it does not mean there has been a dereliction by the Bush \nadministration.\n  I refer the Senator from North Dakota and others to the fact that \nwhen the No Child Left Behind bill was enacted in January of 2002--and \nthe appropriation followed a few days later--the authorization for \ntitle I was $13.5 billion but the appropriation was $10.35 billion, and \nthat was when the Senate was controlled by the Democrats. So the \nappropriation was $2.85 billion under the authorization.\n  On another aspect of the No Child Left Behind bill, improving teacher \nquality, the authorization was $3.175 billion, the appropriation was \n$2.85 billion. So the appropriation, under the Democrats' control, was \n$325 million under the authorization.\n  On another aspect of the No Child Left Behind bill, the 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Centers, the authorization was $1.25 billion and the \nappropriation was $1 billion. So it was $250 million under the \nauthorization.\n  I commended Senator Harkin, who was chairman of this subcommittee at \nthat time, and Senator Byrd, who was chairman of the full committee. \nBut the fact is the authorization was higher than the appropriation, \nwhich is customary.\n  As is reasonably well known, we have two committees, the authorizers \nand the appropriators, and the authorizers characteristically put up a \nhigher figure than the appropriators may be able to manage.\n  There has also been some question as to whether President Bush has \nadequately funded education. As I said earlier--and again I think this \nis worth repeating--if you take a look at what President Bush has \nrequested in the President's budget, which is the determination as to \nwhat the President wants on education funding, in the year 2002, the \nfirst year President Bush submitted a budget, it was for $44.54 \nbillion, which was about a $4.5 billion increase over 2001, and if you \ncontrast the 3 years of the request on the budget by President Bush, \nthe figure has gone from $40 billion to $53.3 billion, which is an \nincrease of about 33 percent.\n  If you take a look at the request by President Clinton from 1996 \nthrough 1999, the figure went from $26 billion to $32 billion, or an \nincrease of about 23 percent. No one said President Clinton had \nshortchanged education. If you take a look at the 3 high years for \nPresident Clinton--1999, 2000, and 2001--the budget increased from \n$29.5 billion to a little over $40 billion. That is about a 33 percent \nincrease, a little over $10 billion. So whereas President Bush, in the \n3 years cited, had $13 billion and President Clinton, in the first of \nthe 3 years cited, had $6 billion, and $10 billion in the second, I \nthink President Bush's increases compare very favorably.\n  Again, it would be nice to have more funding, but on the question of \nwhat President Bush has done by way of his request, I think it is a \nvery strong showing.\n  When the Senator from North Dakota makes reference to the issue of\n\n[[Page S10955]]\n\nflexibility, I quite agree with him, there is a need for flexibility.\n  If I might have the Senator's attention. When he talks about a one-\nroom schoolhouse, that resonates with this Senator. My younger sister \nShirley taught in a one-room schoolhouse located about 6 miles from \nRussell, KS, when I was, I think, a senior in high school. And when the \nSenator from North Dakota talks about a rural school, where a teacher \nhas to teach a number of grades, I recollect that very well. I would \nnot take an oath to this, but I think she had about four different \ngrades from first to eighth. The intervening grades, I wouldn't be too \nsure.\n\n  But it was tough teaching in that country day school in a couple of \nrespects. The first thing was there was no transportation. My father, \nwho had a junkyard in Russell, KS, had to take time off to drive her to \nschool and to pick her up from school. But that was what fathers did in \nabout 1946 when she had this country day school.\n  Also, the word problems for the eighth grade were very difficult. My \nolder sister Hilda was living with us at the time. Her husband was \nfighting in World War II and was in the South Pacific. Hilda was a \ncollege graduate and I was a senior in high school, both of us \nsubstantially beyond the eighth grade, and we would sit for hours at \nthe kitchen table working over these word problems.\n  So when the Senator from North Dakota talks about the need--\noccasionally we got the word problems, too. I don't want to leave that \nhanging. Occasionally we got them. We did not always get them. You \nknow, the question: If X starts at point 1, and goes 20 miles an hour, \nand travels for 2 hours and 30 minutes, and B starts at point zero, and \ngoes for 4 hours with deviation, et cetera, et cetera, who arrives at \npoint Q first? Those are fairly tough questions.\n  The question I would have for the Senator from North Dakota is \nwhether these standards, which do not have to be met for a few years \nyet, require modification now. Each State has to submit a plan to the \nDepartment of Education for approval. Of course, each State knows what \nthey are dealing with. The State director of education knows how many \none-room schools he has in North Dakota or how many he has in Kansas. \nMaybe there are some even in between in South Dakota and Nebraska.\n  The question I have for the Senator from North Dakota is: Has there \nbeen insufficient flexibility in the approvals given by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education on these plans submitted by the various States, \nif the Senator from North Dakota is familiar with that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say, Mr. President, to the Senator from Pennsylvania \nthat I am aware that the Secretary of Education at one point talked \nabout being very ginger with respect to waivers and the kind of \nflexibility I think is necessary. I do not have his quotes in front of \nme.\n  But the point I was trying to make is that as States determine what \ntheir specific needs are, of course the State education authority is \ngoing to be in touch with the Department of Education to determine how \nthe Department of Education is going to send down the rules, how they \nare going to enforce this.\n  My understanding, at least, is that the Department of Education has \nindicated it is not going to be very anxious or interested in waiver \npolicies. So the point I was trying to make--and I don't think I \nmentioned one-room schools. I mentioned small schools.\n  Mr. SPECTER. You can't get any smaller than a one-room school.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But the point I was trying to make is, if we do not have \nflexibility and therefore describe wonderful teachers as not highly \nqualified, and you have to hire additional teachers in small schools so \nthey are all teaching in their major, then the question is: Who is \ngoing to come up with the money for that?\n  First of all, I do not think it would be smart to do that because you \nare telling some wonderful teachers they are not qualified. But second, \nif you do embark on that strategy, it is going to cost all of these \nschool districts more money, and that becomes the mandate. And the \nquestion is: Who is going to fund the mandate?\n  Those are the questions I raised that are related to both funding and \nalso flexibility. I hope an abundance of common sense might well be \napplied to all aspects of this legislation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my response is that I agree with the \nSenator from North Dakota, there has to be flexibility. I am not \nconversant with what is going on in Kansas rural schools today, but I \ncan become conversant. And perhaps the Senator from North Dakota is \nconversant on what is going on with rural schools in North Dakota.\n  But if they still have a small school, where a single teacher is all \nthere is in a one-room school, and they have four students to teach in \nfour different grades, I don't think it is realistic to bring four \nteachers in with specialties. You might have to have more than four \nbecause they teach arithmetic, geography, English, and history, and \nmany subjects.\n  What I intend to do is to find out what is going on there.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania to yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The point is not just a one-room school or one teacher \nteaching four kids. The point is, for example, a school of the type I \ndescribed with four grades and 50 students and four teachers. Those \nfour teachers are having to teach outside of their major. They are \nteaching in their minor and major, several different classes, and in \nmany cases are wonderful teachers who produce great students. They know \ntheir subjects, and the demonstration of being good teachers is that \nthey turn kids out of that classroom having completed their course, and \nthese kids know the subject as well. In those circumstances, a school \nlike that couldn't possibly hire another four teachers because they \nwouldn't have the money.\n  The question is, are you still going to continue to keep those \nschools open and allow those teachers to teach in their major and minor \nprovided they are good teachers?\n  Unfortunately, I believe we are headed toward a time when the \ndefinition of who is highly qualified will exclude many of those great \nteachers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my question to the Senator from North \nDakota, precisely stated: Does he know of any situation where there is \nany such school, where the State head of education has submitted that \nissue to the U.S. Department of Education for a waiver and had it \nturned down?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, as the Senator from Pennsylvania notes, we are not \ndown the road far enough at this point to understand exactly what the \nU.S. Department of Education is going to do in terms of allowing States \nto deal with their specific needs. I can tell you, having dealt with \nmany Federal agencies for a long time--I know the Senator has as well--\nhaving watched some of these statements coming from the Department of \nEducation, we will at some point be on the floor talking about these \ncircumstances because we will have Federal Rules imposed by the \nGovernment in a way that simply does not match the needs or interests \nof the small local school districts.\n  I will be happy to work with the Senator as we proceed so that if he \nindicates--and he did earlier--he believes flexibility is the hallmark \nand a watchword, you have to have flexibility and common sense, then he \nand I need to be very vigilant in making sure that both the State plans \nbut also especially and most importantly the Federal Rules with respect \nto how those plans are evaluated give us the opportunity for some \ncommon sense and flexibility.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if we are not far enough down the road to \nknow how it is going to work out, I don't think we are far enough down \nthe road to criticize it. I think we are far enough down the road to \nmake inquiries. But I think it is premature to criticize this bill for \nlack of flexibility, premature to criticize this bill for lack of \nfunding to accommodate more flexibility until we see that the U.S. \nDepartment of Education has denied an application by North Dakota or \nKansas or some rural State, which has a good educational system and has \nit taken care of, that is being turned down on the flexibility request.\n  The issue has been raised. I think it is an important issue. As the \nchairman of the subcommittee, I will make inquiries to see how the \nflexibility rule is being carried out to date or how it is proposed to \nbe carried out, to have\n\n[[Page S10956]]\n\nhearings, if necessary, in the subcommittee. We ought to anticipate the \nproblem, but it is too soon to criticize.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Pennsylvania will \nyield once again.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. DORGAN. First of all, it is not so much a criticism as a \ndetermination of what is necessary to make this legislation or make \nthis new law work. The State plans that were submitted to the \nDepartment of Education for approval deal almost exclusively with how \nstates measure yearly progress for the school districts themselves. \nThese plans that have been approved do not deal with the definition of \n``highly qualified'' teachers.\n  If you take a look at what has been discussed and described, \nincluding the discussions around the provisions in the underlying law \nitself, there is enough to cause concern that ought to require us to \ntalk about it at this point. Because if we don't do that, we will head \ntowards 2005 and 2006, when the deadline exists with respect to the \nissue of highly qualified teachers, and we will find we have put in \nplace a bureaucratic juggernaut that will cause chaos in school \ndistricts all across the country.\n  It is very important for us to discuss this now.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree it is important to discuss. The \ninformation handed to me at the staff level represents that since the \nact was passed in 2001, funding for high quality professional \ndevelopment for teachers and school administrators has been increased \nby 32 percent during the Clinton administration in the seven years \nfollowing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act authorized in \n1994, which also called for set standards to develop and implement \nassessments. The total increase provided for title I grants to LEAs was \n$2.4 billion or 38 percent. In contrast, at the level proposed in this \nbill, the total increase since the passage of the No Child Left Behind \nProgram in 2001, would be $3.6 billion or 41 percent. So I think the \nfunding in this bill is providing for improvements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I don't disagree at all with the data. I did not talk \nabout Clinton versus Bush and so on. I didn't make that reference. The \ncircumstances are dramatically different than they were previously. We \nembarked on a new, different, aggressive education policy called No \nChild Left Behind in which we imposed for the first time significant \nenforceable standards in order to measure accountability. That was my \npoint.\n  I like the work the Senator from Pennsylvania does. He and I have \nworked on a lot of things together. Notably, I was one who, along with \nthe Senators from Pennsylvania and Iowa and others, worked to try to \ndouble the amount of funding in the National Institutes of Health, and \nthe dividends that will pay for the American people in the future are \nsignificant. I like the work the leadership of this subcommittee does, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa. I appreciate \nworking with them. He indicated this is the best we can do on funding. \nHe would probably wish to do more. I think I heard him suggest that. I \nsit back and try to figure out what are our priorities as a country. \nWhat are the priorities? Then I see stories.\n  For example, in the middle of all of this, I was visiting schools and \ntalking about funding that might or might not happen under these \nmandates. And at that time, we were simultaneously having a situation \nwith Turkey this year. They would not let us use their bases or allow \nour troops to cross their borders into Iraq. So Mr. Wolfowitz was sent \nto Turkey and came back with a deal to provide $26 billion to Turkey. I \ncalled around to find out where that money was coming from. I found out \n$6 billion was to be in the form of direct grants and $20 billion in \nguaranteed loans. I am thinking, maybe I should change my name to \nTurkey. The old John Paxon song, I am changing my name to Poland.\n  I think the issue for all of us is what are the priorities? What \nrepresents the significant priorities including national security, \nnational defense, homeland security? Those are significant. But when \nyou talk about education, it is also the case that education is our \nfuture. I want this law to succeed. I want it to work. The only point I \ncame to talk about is, I don't think it can or will work unless, A, \nadequate funding exists to pay for the mandates we impose on local \nschool districts and, unless, B, there is a reservoir of common sense \nused on how these rules apply to schools.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is traditional in the State of Nevada \nthat the congressional delegation speak to the State legislature. In \nNevada, the State legislature only meets every other year. This past \nFebruary, I had the honor and pleasure of speaking to our State \nlegislature. I spoke about a number of things, but one of the things I \nspoke about was the Leave No Child Behind Act, where I related to the \nrecently convened Nevada State Legislature that I was terribly \nconcerned about what was happening from a fiscal standpoint in the \nState of Nevada because I believed the Leave No Child Behind Act was \nleaving lots of kids in Nevada behind.\n  When I gave that statement, there were some who said, I think the \nSenator from Nevada is a little bit off, that Leave No Child Behind is \ngoing to work out just fine, that it will not have any impact on the \nState.\n  The State of Nevada, as with many States in the Union, went through a \nterrible fiscal crisis this year. The matter in Nevada had to finally \nbe resolved in the courts. The State legislature was at an impasse. The \nGovernor called several special sessions. As I indicated, he finally \nhad to sue the State legislature and go to the Nevada Supreme Court. \nFollowing that, the supreme court ruled that certain parts of the \nmethod of obtaining money were unconstitutional, but the court did rule \nthat education came first. The No. 1 requirement in the State of Nevada \nfor the legislature was education.\n  The Leave No Child Behind Act is legislation that is extremely \nimportant, and the law has all the markings of being good legislation \nthat we initiated here if, in fact, it is funded properly. But it has \nnot been. As a result of that, Nevada and other States are in a \ntremendous bind.\n  It was 2 years ago that this Congress and the President made a \npromise to the children of America. We promised that every child would \nhave an opportunity to get a good education and realize his or her \ndreams. We promised that teachers and schools would be held accountable \nfor achieving results, but we promised extra help to those children who \nneeded it the most so they would not get left behind.\n  I think we all felt pretty good about that promise. There was a nice \nbill signing ceremony at the White House and the new law was hailed as \na great bipartisan achievement. That was 2 years ago.\n  Today, the children of America are keeping their part of the bargain. \nIn the State of Nevada, as well as all over the Nation, kids have \nreturned to school this month with their backpacks full of books, their \nhearts full of hope, their minds full of dreams. Our children are eager \nto learn and their teachers are eager to teach. Teachers are doing \ntheir part. As part of our promise to America's children, our teachers \nare accepting a higher standard of accountability. They understand that \nwhen a promise is made to somebody, they are accountable for keeping \nthat promise.\n  I believe we should hold teachers accountable for getting results, \nbut I think the American people should hold us accountable for keeping \nour promise that we made 2 years ago. That is why I have difficulty \nimagining that anyone would not support Senator Byrd's amendment. In \neffect, it is a commitment to fulfill our promise, the commitment that \nwe already made to title I, the program that helps those children who \nneed help the most. This amendment would mean a lot to the children of \nNevada. It would provide more than $31 million for hard-strapped school \nsystems that serve our neediest students. It would mean smaller \nclasses, more training for teachers, and more educational materials.\n  In April of 2002, I held a hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee \nin Las Vegas to find out about the impact of title I programs on the \nchildren of Nevada. We learned a lot. One of our witnesses was a woman \nnamed Tammie\n\n[[Page S10957]]\n\nCarter who had a child enrolled in the title I pre-K program at Kermit \nBooker Elementary School. Mrs. Carter told us how important title I \nprograms are to her family. She told us how much our promise to all of \nAmerica's children means to her own child.\n  We should not break our promise, even to that one child, let alone \nmillions across America. We should live by the words we uttered 2 years \nago. We must be held accountable. So I hope this amendment, which will \ntake 60 votes--60 percent of the Senate will vote to allow this \neducation measure offered by the senior Senator from West Virginia to \ngo forward.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on \nanother subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          International Trade\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know some of my \ncolleagues want to speak as well.\n  Yesterday was Labor Day. I noticed this morning that there was a \nspeech given by the President, which I welcome, in which he talked \nabout increased attention to international trade issues, particularly \ntrade deficits and the jobs that are flowing overseas. The story \nspecifically talks about the difficulties we have in the manufacturing \njobs that have left. I wanted to make a couple of points about that.\n  I have talked before about the trade deficit. We have the largest \ntrade deficit in human history. It is now over $470 billion. Let me \njust show a chart that shows this trade deficit, although the red marks \non this chart really should read ``jobs.'' When your trade deficit goes \nto $470 billion, that means jobs that used to exist here exist \nelsewhere--in China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Mexico, Canada.\n  I want to make a point about this because I am heartened by the fact \nthat the President talked about China. The Administration is talking \nabout currency fluctuations, which is a separate issue. I have spoken \nabout that many times. Having trade agreements with other countries and \nnot having a shock absorber to adjust for currency fluctuations makes \nno sense at all. It never has. We negotiate with Mexico for a trade \nagreement and you ratchet down 10 and 15 percent tariffs to 5 percent \nand 2 percent. And then Mexico devalues its currency by 50 percent. You \nare 35 percent worse off.\n  It has never made any sense to deal with trade agreements on tariffs \nand not worry about currency fluctuations. That is what we are finding \nwith China. China is manipulating its currency values in a way that \ncontinues the trade deficit with China which is now $103 billion a \nyear. They send us all their trinkets and trousers, tennis shoes, you \nname it. They produce it and send it here to go on our store shelves in \nLaramie, WY, Fargo, ND, Denver, CO for our consumers. Guess what. Try \nto send the Chinese some North Dakota wheat and see what you find out. \nThe trade isn't two way. We don't really have a two-way trade agreement \nwith China and Japan. We don't have an adequate trade agreement with \nMexico, Canada, Korea, and Europe.\n\n  The Senate will soon consider a Commerce-State-Justice bill, which \nfunds the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce is a \ncrucial agency when it comes to international trade, because it has a \nMarket Access Compliance program responsible for knocking down foreign \ntrade barriers.\n  Do you know how many people the MAC program has to deal with trade \nbarriers in China? Just 19. And we have a $103 billion deficit with \nChina.\n  Now, the Commerce Department is involved in the issue of knocking \ndown trade barriers in other countries. We have a $70 billion trade \ndeficit with Japan. Do you know how many people at the MAC program deal \nwith Japan? Ten people.\n  We have a $13 billion deficit with Korea and we have two-and three-\nquarters people working on market access issues in Korea. I don't know \nhow three-quarters of a person works on this; there must be a new, \nnovel way to do that in Commerce.\n  We have an $82 billion trade deficit with Europe and just 15 people \nworking to open up those European markets and enforce trade agreements \nwith Europe.\n  This makes no sense at all because this relates to jobs. When I asked \non Labor Day what happened to manufacturing jobs, I will tell you what \nhappened. They have gone. Paul Craig Roberts, an economist in the \nReagan administration, wrote an op-ed piece recently saying that this \nis not a jobless economic recovery. Yes, the country is beginning to \nshow economic growth. No, we don't have additional jobs. We have lost \nseveral million jobs. Jobs are not being created in this country; they \nare being created elsewhere. That is the problem. Part of it, in my \njudgment, is simply enforcement, demanding that other countries own up \nto their responsibilities to us in our trade agreements.\n  I have used this example often--and I will again briefly--with \nrespect to Korea because it is such an appropriate example. Do you know \nthat last year we imported from Korea very close to 680,000 vehicles \ninto this country; 680,000 Korean cars came into the United States. \nDoes anyone know how many American automobiles we were able to export \nto Korea? Just 2,800. So it was 680,000 to 2,800. Why? Because our \nmarkets are open to their cars. Good for us. Their market is largely \nclosed to our automobiles. We don't do much about it. We just do not do \nmuch about it. Don't we care? I don't know. Nobody cares much, it seems \nto me, to begin to say to the South Koreans, with respect to automobile \ntrade: If you want to sell cars in the U.S., open your markets wide to \nAmerican vehicles. If you don't, then go sell your cars in Zambia, or \nin Libya, but not in our marketplace, until your marketplace is open to \nus.\n  While I am on the subject of cars, in the last trade agreement we did \nwith China--a country with a $103 billion surplus with us--our \nnegotiators agreed, for reasons I would never understand, that with \nrespect to future trade between the United States and China in \nvehicles, automobiles, we would agree, after a long phase-in, that we \nwill have a 2.5-percent tariff on any Chinese automobiles that would \neventually be sold in our country, and China would be allowed to have a \n25-percent tariff on any U.S. automobile sold in China.\n  So our negotiators sat down with a country that has a very large \ntrade surplus with us, and said we will agree, after a phase-in, for \nyou to have a tariff that is 10 times higher in China on U.S. \nautomobiles going to China than we would have on Chinese automobiles \ncoming into the United States. I don't understand how people think when \nthey do that. They undercut our marketplace and throw away our jobs.\n\n  Look, I am for expanding trade. I think expanded trade is good but it \nmust be fair trade. If it is not fair and in our mutual best interests \nin bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, then we need to rethink \nit.\n  We face a circumstance in this country when we talk about the need \nfor additional jobs. What happened to the 3 million jobs that used to \nexist here that no longer exist here? They exist elsewhere, where they \ncan hire children at age 12 and put them in a manufacturing plant that \ndoesn't have to be a safe workplace because you don't have OSHA; they \ncan dump chemicals into the air and water because that country doesn't \nhave an EPA, and it can pay 12-year-old children 20 cents an hour and \nwork them 14 hours a day, and it is perfectly legal--by the way, a \nmanufacturing plant that can prevent them, because their country \nprevents them, from organizing as a labor force.\n  That is where the jobs are going. Too many are going in that \ndirection, and too many American families who used to have decent jobs \nwith decent pay and benefits now have to look at those jobs existing in \nother countries that didn't fight for the last century for the kinds of \nthings that we did, such as safe workplaces, child labor laws, fair \ncompensation, and a requirement that you not pollute streams and the \nair.\n  Our country is losing ground, not gaining ground. If you look at the \nocean of red ink on this chart in international trade, and at the loss \nof jobs, and if you look at what this translates into with respect to \nthe weakening of our basic core manufacturing in this country, you \nsimply must be concerned.\n  I don't want to sound like someone who is a ``classic protectionist'' \nwho doesn't believe in trade; I believe in\n\n[[Page S10958]]\n\ntrade. I believe in the doctrine of comparative advantage, when a \ncountry can produce something in a manner that is much more efficient \nthan ours because of the resources they have, because of natural \nadvantages they have, then it makes more sense for us to buy from them \nand sell to them that which is in our best comparative advantage. But \nit is not part of the doctrine of comparative advantage to have a \ncountry that says we are going to hire kids and pay them pennies and \ndump sewage in the streams and the air. That is not a doctrine of \ncomparative advantage; that is a political imposition that creates \ncircumstances by which we lose manufacturing jobs to other areas of the \nworld and then have them produce the products and ship them back into \nour marketplace. We have the products, perhaps at a lower price, and \nwhat we also have is an economy that is losing jobs and steam. That is \nwhy we have to be concerned about this.\n  I welcome the President's statement yesterday that he is going to \nhave someone in the Administration dealing with this issue of China and \ndealing with the issue of the currency fluctuations. But there are far \ngreater problems in international trade than just currency \nfluctuations. That is one of them but it is by no means the most \nsignificant.\n  I will not spend more time going on and on about the specifics of \npotato flakes to Korea at a 300-percent tariff. I can spend time \ntalking about these continuing trade barriers, such as beef to Japan, \nwhere 15 years after the beef agreement with Japan every single pound \nof American beef is set to have a 50-percent tariff on it. Fifteen \nyears after our agreement with Japan--a country with a $70 billion \nsurplus with us--for us to allow that to happen is shameful. I will not \ngo further, except to say I will speak at greater length on trade and \njobs, which are related in a significant way, because we must--\nRepublicans, Democrats, the administration, and Congress--tackle this \nissue in a significant way if we are going to preserve a strong, \nvibrant manufacturing base in this country and begin building jobs--\ngood jobs that pay well with decent benefits once again.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I can remember when my friend, the Senator from North \nDakota, first started coming to the floor with charts indicating the \ntrade deficits. I can remember back in 1996 and 1997 when I thought: \nThe trade deficit is going up, but not very much; it is $170 billion. \nIt went up $10 billion, and that sounds like a lot of money. Maybe \nthere is something that can be done about that situation.\n  Now I think there is no way to rationalize what is happening. It was \n$170 billion in 1996, and we are over double that in just a few years. \nI say to my friend, I take pride, even though I have received a lot of \ncriticism, in that I have not voted for a single trade agreement. I \nthought they were shortsighted and bad for our country, and I think \ntime is proving I was right and the twisting of arms to get votes for \nthese programs saying it would help was simply wrong.\n  I say to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, these are more \nthan just statistics on a map or a chart or a graph. I have one \ndaughter. My oldest child is a daughter. She is married to a wonderful \nman who was raised in Kannapolis, NC. I never heard the word \n``Kannapolis'' until they fell in love and were married. I now have \nthree grandchildren as a result of that union.\n  I have been to Kannapolis visiting with their family. Kannapolis is \nthe sight of Cannon Mills where they make towels, sheets--all kinds of \nthese products. It is a famous place in American manufacturing history \nand a very important part of North Carolina industry. Last week, Cannon \nMills announced they were closing. The Cannon Mills plant in Kannapolis \nwill be gone.\n  Kannapolis used to be a factory town where everyone who worked in \nKannapolis worked for Cannon Mills. Thousands of people were employed \nat that factory. Cannon Mills has sent notice to everyone that the \napproximately 5,000 people who are at the Kannapolis plant will no \nlonger have a job.\n  That is what Senator Dorgan's graph represents to me: Actual people \nsuch as Melvin Berringer, my daughter's father-in-law, a wonderful man \nin his eighties who spent his entire life working for Cannon Mills in \nKannapolis. People who followed in his footsteps no longer work in \nKannapolis. They are all through as a result of the trade policy of \nthis country.\n  I have heard my friend from North Dakota in the past try to describe \nwhat the trade policy is. Is it unreasonable? Yes. Is it unrealistic? \nYes. Is it unfair to us? Yes. There isn't a word one can come up with \nthat adequately describes how the world's only superpower would put \nitself in the position where we have a $470 billion trade deficit. And \nwe had the President yesterday saying: I think what we are going to do \nto solve the problem is appoint an assistant secretary of Commerce. \nThat should handle the problem. Instead of having 19 people working on \nthe $100 billion trade deficit with China, we can now have somebody \ncalling once in a while to see what they can do to help the program. We \nwill have an assistant secretary. That should solve all the problems if \nwe appoint an assistant secretary of Commerce to solve the $470 billion \ntrade deficit. That should solve the problem quite well.\n  I acknowledge, I appreciate, I compliment the Senator from North \nDakota for being one of the few who understands trade policy and \nfrequently speaks out, bringing it to our attention. It is something \nabout which more should be speaking.\n\n  This is a problem that is only going to get worse unless this country \nchanges what is happening. I repeat, I do not apologize to anyone for \nvoting against every one of those trade agreements which I think were \nunfair because they dealt with those countries with environmental \nstandards much different than ours, working conditions much different \nthan ours, and employment standards much different than ours, making it \nunfair to American business.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Nevada that the \nmost recent free trade agreement we voted on in the Senate was the \nSingapore Free Trade Agreement. It is an example of everything that is \nwrong with our trade policy.\n  The Singapore Free Trade Agreement was negotiated in secret, as are \nall trade agreements, and then they are unveiled with great fanfare, \nand we are told: Here is the agreement. And because the Congress \ndecided it would vote itself a set of handcuffs so that when a trade \nagreement comes to the floor of the Senate we cannot offer any \namendments--that is called fast track--when the Singapore Free Trade \nAgreement came to the Senate, it had a provision in it that had nothing \nto do with the Singapore Free Trade Agreement--nothing at all. It had \nto do with immigration, and it said we will grant special visas to \n5,400 people from Singapore to come into this country to take American \njobs. All of the folks on the committee who deal with immigration were \napoplectic. They had apoplectic seizures on the floor of the Senate. \nWhat did we do? We constructed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that \nsaid to the Administration: Next time, you better watch it. What a \nwonderful piece of public policy. Why couldn't anybody offer an \namendment to take out the 5,400 jobs that will be taken in this country \nby the special visas given in that bill? Because we cannot offer any \namendments to the trade bill. And so they negotiated this Singapore \nFree Trade Agreement. It has other problems with it, I should say, but \nthey negotiated it with this little provision, and we could not take it \nout. That is so symbolic of what is wrong with our trade policies.\n  The minute you speak of this, as is always the case, the Washington \nPost, for example, which simply will not allow an op-ed piece on my \nside of the issue--you almost never see an op-ed piece talking about \nthe requirement for fair trade because the Washington Post and most of \nthe largest newspapers have the same view and that is: Free trade, free \ntrade. It is like a mantra. We ought to put them in robes on a street \ncorner and let them chant for a while, to get it out of their system, \n``free trade, free trade.'' The only thing that matters, it seems to \nme, is whether trade is fair and whether the engagement we have with \nother countries is mutually beneficial.\n  After the Second World War, our trade policy was exclusively foreign\n\n[[Page S10959]]\n\npolicy for 25 years because we wanted to help other countries. So we \ndid all kinds of concessional trade strategies with other countries \nthat were fine. It was our foreign policy. It was a way for us to help \nthem, and it did not matter because we could beat any country under any \nset of circumstances in the job market with one hand tied behind our \nback. We knew that. We were the biggest, the best, and the strongest. \nWe had an economy that could compete with anybody with one hand tied \nbehind our back. So for 25 years, our trade policy was exclusively \nforeign policy run out of the State Department.\n\n  Twenty-five years after the Second World War, we began to see the \nemergence of some pretty tough, strong international competition--\nJapan, Europe, others, now China. Our trade policy is still, in most \ncases, soft-headed foreign policy. Instead of saying, Let us make sure \nthat as a strong economic power, the world's preeminent economic \nsuperpower, that we retain a basic core manufacturing base--because we \nwill not long remain an economic superpower without a manufacturing \nbase--instead of saying that, what we are saying as a country in our \npolicies is we do not care what remains. If we have a complete \ndecimation of the manufacturing base in this country, so be it, that is \nthe way the world economy was intending it to be. That is so shallow \nand so fundamentally devoid of caring about this country's national \nsecurity. Yet, I am telling you, there are people out there who believe \nthat. They just say: Let's have whatever happens happen and no \ncomplaining.\n  What bothers me the most about this situation, when we talk about \nthese jobs, is we have set up the American workers to compete in a way \nthat is fundamentally unfair because our country will not stand with \nits workers. We say to our workers: If you do not want to lose your \njob, then you better be prepared to compete. What does that mean? If \nyou do not want to lose your job, you better take a pay cut. If you do \nnot want to lose your job, you better be prepared not to get any \nbenefits in the future. If you do not want to lose your job, be \nprepared to compete with that 12-year-old kid making 12 cents a day \nworking 12 hours a day in an unsafe factory.\n  When did that become the admission price of the American marketplace, \nthe only marketplace of its type in the world, the most lucrative \nmarketplace in the world? When did we decide the admission price is do \nanything under any circumstances and allow your goods to come onto our \nshelves? When did that become something we accepted as a matter of \ncourse?\n  What about a sense of fairness in which this country says our workers \nwill compete? The American workers are the finest in the world. We will \ncompete anytime anywhere with anybody under any circumstances provided \nwe understand that which we fought for a century in this country \nrepresents a value system by which we measure jobs. One ought to be \nable to have the right to organize as workers. One ought to be able to \nhave the right to work in a safe workplace. One ought not to have to \ncompete with 8-, 10-, and 12-year-old kids because they ought to have \nchild labor laws. One ought to have some fair compensation capability. \nWe fought for those issues for years. In fact, there are people who \ndied on the streets in this country fighting for the right to organize.\n  I thought we had gotten through all those issues and said, Here is \nwhat the American marketplace is about, but now there are executives of \ncompanies who say: Let's fly around in our jet and look at various \nplaces in the world where we might produce, where we pole vault over \nthose questions. We do not have to answer questions about hiring kids. \nWe do not have to answer questions about paying 12 or 20 cents an hour. \nWe do not have to answer to an OSHA or EPA. We, in fact, are going to \nmove our production to Bangladesh or Sri Lanka.\n  Here is the result: A little story I read recently about producers in \na manufacturing plant far away from here, in a portion of Asia, making \nbaseball caps. Those baseball caps have 1\\1/2\\-cent labor in each \nbaseball cap, and they are sent to the bookstore of an Ivy League \ncollege to be sold for $17. One-and-a-half-cent labor by a young Asian \nworker in a plant far away to produce a baseball cap that is then sold \nfor $17 in the bookstore of an Ivy League college. I suppose that used \nto be a job in this country, to make baseball caps. It used to be we \nmade shoes, shirts, and trousers, too.\n  One day when I was speaking in the Senate Chamber, Fruit of the Loom \ndecided it was gone. Fruit of the Loom made a big announcement that \nthey were moving to Mexico. I said: It is one thing to lose your shirt, \nbut I mean Fruit of the Loom, once they leave . . . Just think of the \njobs that used to exist here, that supported families, are going \nelsewhere.\n  I could understand that if it represented the doctrine of comparative \nadvantage where one country had a specific resource or some specific \nadvantage in which they produce something in a much more attractive and \na much less expensive way than we do, provided that advantage is not \nsome politically imposed advantage by a government that says you cannot \norganize, you do not have to have a safe workplace, you can pay \npennies, and you can hire kids.\n  That is not part of the comparative advantage. That is a political \nwill and a political system that says let's take jobs from those \nindustrialized countries that have already settled those issues.\n  I hope to speak on trade at greater length later this week. It was my \nintention to mention the effort that was discussed yesterday in the \nnewspapers about China and specifically about trade and jobs. I think \nthis is a critically important issue. A recovery without jobs is not \nthe kind of recovery we need in this country. We need a recovery that \nproduces decent jobs that pay well, that have good benefits. We \nspecifically need to pay attention to and understand that a world \neconomic superpower will only remain a world economic superpower if \nthey have a strong manufacturing base. That is critical to any economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The matter before the Senate is the appropriations bill \nthat is being managed by Senators Specter and Harkin; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to reply \nbriefly to the comments by the Senator from Nevada. It is very \nimportant to move on education in America; the legislation on Leave No \nChild Behind is very critical legislation on that important subject. \nBut as we have heard the discussion move forward, there is a lot more \ncommentary on President Bush than on the American schoolchildren. I \nsuppose that is to be expected in the political context with a \nPresidential election coming next year, but the real focus, I suggest, \nis on the issue of adequacy of the funding.\n  The program for funding the No Child Left Behind legislation has been \nmoving on with substantial increases in funding. Earlier today, the \nargument was made that the funding has resulted from the action of a \nCongress which was under the control of the Democrats. I suggest that \nignores the recommendations and the budget requests President Bush has \nmade and the budgets which he has submitted to the Congress of the \nUnited States which have been acted upon with both Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  When we look at the requests of the President to meet the legislation \non No Child Left Behind, on the three budgets which he has submitted \nrequests for fiscal year 2002, fiscal year 2003, and fiscal year 2004, \nthere has been an increase in what he has asked for of some $13 \nbillion-plus, moving from $40 billion to more than $53 million. If you \ntake the 3-year period from 1996 to 1999 with the fiscal years 1997, \n1998, and 1999, the funding increased from some $26 billion to about \n$32.5 billion, which was an increase of 23 percent. If you take the\n\n[[Page S10960]]\n\nlast 3 years prior to the budget submitted by President Bush, you have \nthe funding from $29.700 billion to $40 billion, an increase of a \nlittle over $10 billion--there again, a 33-percent increase. So even \nwhen the Democrats controlled the Congress, the appropriations made \nwere under the authorized amount which is a commonplace occurrence.\n  If we focus on what has been done to increase funding for education \nand what has been done to move along the legislation on Leave No Child \nBehind, President Bush has made a showing at least comparable and \nsuperior to that which President Clinton undertook, and no one ever \nsaid that President Clinton underfunded education. Perhaps the focus \nought to be on what is the adequacy of the funding as opposed to the \nconsistent critique of President Bush for political purposes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come for a couple of minutes this \nafternoon to reflect on both the recent holiday yesterday as well as my \nexperiences in South Dakota over the last 4 weeks.\n  We celebrated Labor Day yesterday with parades and celebrations \naround the country. We have been doing so now for 120 years. Peter \nMcGuire was a carpenter and a labor organizer who brought 20,000 \nworkers to march in New York for better working conditions some 120 \nyears ago. Still today it is a day to honor our working people and \ntheir contribution and to recommit ourselves to advancing their rights \nand protections.\n  I spent the August recess driving through South Dakota, as I do every \nyear, without schedule or staff, talking to South Dakotans about the \nconcerns they have. We have 66 counties in our State. I get into all 66 \nevery year. I went to just under 30 counties during the month of \nAugust. Driving as I did, talking to working men and women, families, \nbusiness people, farmers, and ranchers, I heard a great deal about \njobs, about health care, about the state of agriculture.\n  Joblessness in our country has now reached 9.1 million people; 3.2 \nmillion private sector jobs have been lost since January of 2001. That \nis a 50-percent increase. Another 5 million, we are told, are \nunderemployed, forced to take part-time work because they cannot find \ngood jobs.\n  As I traveled the State, I talked to people who are unemployed, \npeople who had good jobs. Surprisingly, large numbers of white-collar \nworkers, people whose incomes exceeded $20,000 or $30,000, are now out \nof work. They expressed to me their concern for the state of the \neconomy and the great difficulty so many South Dakotans are facing. \nThat is true in small towns as well as large towns.\n  There is more bad news for working families as they consider the \nimplications of higher deficits on the interest rates we are now \nexperiencing. It is harder to buy a home, to pay for college, invest in \nbusiness, in part because, as we have predicted, as the budget deficit \nincreases, so do long-term interest rates. The CBO has now projected we \nwill see a $400 billion deficit in 2003, $450 billion if you eliminate \nthe impact Social Security trust fund surpluses have had on the budget, \nand over $650 billion in fiscal year 2004. We expect to add $1.3 \ntrillion of additional debt, not to mention the higher increases in \ninterest rates that everyone will be forced to pay, offsetting whatever \nmarginal value to most working families the tax cuts have had now over \nthe course of the last 2 years.\n  I spent the bulk of my time talking to South Dakotans about health \ninsurance. As I do my travels each year, normally it is to listen to \nothers. It is my home. In so doing, I have the opportunity to listen to \nSouth Dakotans express themselves on whatever issues may be of interest \nand concern to them and I can come back with a better understanding as \nwe consider the issues in the Senate.\n  This year I asked more questions about health care, talked a good \ndeal about health insurance to South Dakotans. We have over 100,000 of \nover 700,000 South Dakotans who at some point through the year do not \nhave health insurance.\n  I was at a barbecue early in August talking to a number of South \nDakotans about the issues and about health care in particular. There \nmust have been 300 or 400 people there. After I spoke, about half of \nthem, I suppose, lined up to say hello. It took a couple of hours to \nsay hello to those who had come. As I said my final farewell to the \nlast person who had waited in line, I noticed over on a park bench \nthere was an older man--older; I would say probably in his early \nseventies--who had waited all this time just to talk to me. He told me \nwhat had happened in his own circumstances. He said he and his wife had \nsaved over $350,000 over their entire lives. About 6 months ago, his \nwife learned she had terminal cancer. She was too young for Medicare so \nthey began spending their savings. They spent $200,000 and John's wife \nfinally told him: ``I would rather die than have you spend the final \n$150,000. Let me die.'' She did.\n\n  That was my first story that I recall, over a month of stories. I \ntalked to Florence, who lives in Sioux Falls, SD. She drives all the \nway. She is 72 as well--early seventies. I can't recall now if it is 72 \nor 73. She just got a job about a month ago because she can't afford \nthe $400 she pays every month for prescription drugs. Every 3 months \nshe goes to Canada because she can't afford to buy them in the United \nStates. She saves $300 every 3 months on that trip to Canada. She is a \nwoman who now has been forced to go back to work at her age, just to \npay for the drugs she needs.\n  I talked to Alicia at the Brown County Fair. Alicia has diabetes, \njuvenile diabetes. She was just kicked off her family's insurance rolls \nbecause she is now over 18. She doesn't have insurance and can't get it \nbecause the insurance companies won't sign her up. She asked them what \nto do. They said: Go look for a job where they have group health \ninsurance. Alicia broke down when she was telling me she hasn't taken \nthe diabetes medication as regularly as she should because she can't \nafford it.\n  I could take the rest of the afternoon talking about the stories I \nheard, about the crisis we face in health care today. I don't know \nabout you, but when you are out there, outside of this town, and you \nare allowed to clear your mind, you wonder, with the positions we hold, \nhow it is that year after year, session after session, these problems \ngo by and in most cases continue to worsen. We come back and it just \nseems business as usual.\n  I don't know how we solve the health care problem. But I must say I \nthink it is the most pressing, most serious, most vexing, most \ntroubling problem that most South Dakota families face, at least. All I \nhad to do was ask the first question, and one after another came \nforward with their own nightmare about the crisis that they or their \nfamily are facing.\n  So I learned a lot. I think I am far more aware today of the \nextraordinary problems and complications our South Dakota families are \nfacing, but none like what they are facing with health care. We have to \ndo something.\n  Our first opportunity of course is to deal with this Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. We are going to redouble our efforts to see \nif we can find some solution, but I will say I am very concerned and \ntroubled by the lack of progress we made at the staff level in the \nmonth of August. There is a lot of work that needs to be done.\n  I will continue to go home of course and talk to South Dakotans. I \nwill always remember the conversations and the willingness on the part \nof so many to open up, to share their private stories, to share their \nnightmares, to plead with me that Congress do something to address \nthose concerns. Whether it is John, Florence or Alicia, they are \nwatching, they are waiting, and they are hoping.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Steel Tariffs\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader has \ntalked about jobs. Most of us in August talked to constituents who were \ntalking about jobs. The President of the United States yesterday, in a \nLabor Day speech in Ohio, talked about jobs,\n\n[[Page S10961]]\n\nand specifically manufacturing jobs. As he usually is, he was very \nstraightforward about what is going on in our country. He said the \neconomy is getting better, and I will give him some credit for that. He \nalso said the jobs aren't coming along as fast as he would like. He \npledged to work harder on that. He talked about appointing a sort of \nmanufacturing job czar in the Commerce Department, which I would \nwelcome.\n  Over the past several weeks, the administration has held 19 different \nround tables with manufacturers in this country to try to understand \nfrom them what Government policies could be that would make it easier \nfor us to keep our manufacturing jobs.\n  I believe the President focused yesterday in his Labor Day speech on \nperhaps the greatest economic challenge we have before us in these very \nfortunate United States of America, and that is, how do we keep our \nmanufacturing jobs from going overseas over the next 10 years as we \nparticipate in a global marketplace. We faced that before, with Japan, \n20 years ago. I can still remember how everybody thought Japan was \ngoing to drown us, and they didn't. Now we are faced with China as well \nas others. China is bigger--not as prosperous as Japan, but bigger. We \nhave a terrific challenge in how do we keep our manufacturing jobs from \nmoving overseas.\n  On September 15, Commerce Secretary Don Evans is expected to announce \nmore about President Bush's plan to save manufacturing jobs and to keep \nthem from going overseas. The Secretary is scheduled to speak in \nDetroit on September 15. I have a respectful suggestion for what \nSecretary Evans might say in his speech in Detroit on September 15 \nabout saving manufacturing jobs.\n  He will be there at the home of the American automobile industry, and \nI believe the most helpful thing he could say for the working men and \nwomen of America, especially in the automobile industry, is that we \nwill end the steel tariffs now.\n  I don't want to simplify this. Ending the steel tariffs that were \nimposed in March of 2002 will not by itself stem the loss of \nmanufacturing jobs in the United States of America. Manufacturing jobs \nhave been going away from our country for a number of years. They were \ngoing away a long time before President Bush became President.\n  Manufacturing jobs have been leaving for a variety of reasons. The \nfirst is we have become more productive. When the Saturn and Nissan \nautomobile plant came to Tennessee, they employed 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 \npeople at very good paying jobs. But if those plants were being built \ntoday, instead of employing 5,000 or 6,000 or 7,000 people, they would \nhave to employ 25,000 or 30,000 people to make the same number of cars. \nSo we are still doing plenty of manufacturing in America as well as in \nTennessee. We are just not hiring as many people to do it because we \nare so much more productive.\n  Then there are other reasons manufacturing jobs are under pressure. \nThe Chinese currency is too low. Secretary Snow was in China today, \nworking on that problem--we hope with some results.\n  Another reason we have difficulty with our manufacturing jobs is that \nour international intellectual rights and copyrights aren't being \nrespected or protected.\n  Then the other reason, which every manufacturer in America knows, is \ncost. Every American manufacturer lives on the edge. It is always a \nbattle with costs. If some unexpected cost comes along, the \nmanufacturer cuts one or two jobs in order to stay in global \ncompetition. If too many costs come along, they go out of business or \nmove their plants overseas.\n  What are those costs? The cost of labor, the cost of health care, the \ncost of environmental control, the costs of runaway lawsuits. All of \nthese costs are the costs we hear about as we talk to men and women who \nare manufacturing in America.\n  But the cost I want to talk about today is a new cost that was added \nin March 2002 to manufacturers all across America, and that is the cost \nof the steel tariff. The President decided in that month, March 2002, \nto impose a tariff of up to 30 percent on imported steel, including \nhot- and cold-rolled steel, the kind used to make cars and trucks in \nour country. The idea was a noble one and a well-intentioned one. It is \nhard to argue with it. The idea was to protect steel-producing jobs, of \nwhich there are about 12,000 in Michigan where Secretary Evans will be \nmaking his address on September 15. The trouble is the steel tariff has \nbeen destroying steel-consuming jobs of which there are nearly 800,000 \nin Michigan, including 300,000 at auto assembly or auto supplier \nplants.\n\n  Let me do that math again.\n  In Michigan, there are about 12,000 steel-producing jobs, about \n800,000 steel-consuming jobs, and 300,000 of them are in the auto \nindustry. This is true all across America. There are nearly 13 million \nsteel-consuming jobs, 2.1 million of which are automobile-related jobs. \nBut the United States has only a fraction of that number in steel-\nproducing jobs--about 230,000 steel-producing jobs. Even West Virginia \nand Pennsylvania combined have at least 10 times as many steel-\nconsuming jobs as steel-producing jobs.\n  On top of all of this, the World Trade Organization has ruled that \nthe steel tariffs imposed in March of 2002 are in violation of the \nglobal trade rule. As a result, the European Union has announced its \nintention to impose $2.2 billion in retaliatory sanctions on American \nimports sold in Europe, from footwear to fruits and vegetables. These \nsanctions will destroy yet another batch of American jobs.\n  Here is the sad story of the steel tariff.\n  In 2002, the automobile industry was purchasing only about 5 percent \nof its steel from overseas. But as soon as the steel tariff was placed \non, it imported 5 percent, and 95 percent of steel produced in our \ncountry also raised prices. Suddenly, auto parts suppliers and other \nsteel-consuming businesses, such as microwave oven makers, as an \nexample, were paying up to 30 percent more for steel, which is \nsometimes their most important raw material.\n  Because auto suppliers couldn't raise prices to cover costs, they \nsuffered losses and began to lay off employees. In a few instances, \nwhole plants closed. Jobs began to move overseas where parts suppliers \npay a global price for steel. These parts can be made in South Korea, \nin Germany, in Mexico, in Canada, and all around the world. They don't \nhave to be made in Michigan and Tennessee.\n  Let me put this in a little more personal terms. In my first year as \nGovernor of Tennessee--1979, nearly 25 years ago--our State was the \nthird poorest in the country at 80 percent of national average family \nincome. In some counties at that time, about one-third of our \nmanufacturing jobs were in the textile mills. Tennessee at that time \nwas making no cars and no trucks, and we had only about 2 dozen auto \nsuppliers. Then the auto industry began to move south--not just into \nour State but all around us. Tennessee became the fourth largest maker \nof cars and trucks. Nine hundred auto parts suppliers followed with \nbetter paying auto jobs. These are jobs that are $30,000, $40,000, or \n$50,000 a year, replacing low-paying textile jobs. Our families' \nincomes grew faster than any family incomes in America. They jumped to \nalmost 100 percent of the national average family income by 1990.\n  Today, one-third--or at least 100,000--of all Tennessee's \nmanufacturing jobs are automotive jobs. These are the good jobs that we \nare glad to have.\n  On January 21, 2003, ArvinMeritor closed its sunroof and seat plant \nin Gordonsville eliminating 317 of these good-paying jobs. It reduced \nby 100 the jobs at its Pulaski plant. It did this because after the \ntariffs its steel prices rose between 13 and 40 percent.\n  That is not all. The Dana Corporation, which employs 3,000 \nTennesseans making axles and brakes, watched its steel prices increase \n20 to 50 percent since the tariff.\n  The Dura Corporation, which employs 176 at five facilities in my \nState, was purchasing all of its steel from United States producers \nwhen the tariff was imposed in March of 2002. As a result of the \ntariff, Dura lost money in 2002 and is considering moving to overseas \nproduction which is very bad news for 765 Tennessee families in \nGordonsville, Greenbriar, Lawrenceburg, Milan, and Pikeville.\n  I ran for the Senate last year to support President Bush, and I have \nproudly done that. I think he is on the right track with our economy. I \nbelieve our\n\n[[Page S10962]]\n\neconomy is beginning to move after a series of blows that no other \neconomy in the world could have withstood. I support this President. \nBut I also said in my campaign last year that I believe the steel \ntariff was bad for Tennessee and bad for American working families, and \nI still believe that.\n  This fall the President will have an opportunity to review his \ndecision to impose the steel tariffs. Shortly after Secretary Evans' \nspeech in Detroit on September 15, the International Trade Commission \nwill report on what the consequences of the tariffs have been. This is \na welcome opportunity for the President to make a mid-course \ncorrection. I hope that he will decide he has made a good-faith effort \nto save steel jobs, but that the effort has lost almost as many steel-\nconsuming jobs as exist in the steel-producing industry in the United \nStates. That it is the wrong policy, and that the right thing to do is \nto end the steel tariffs. The best thing Secretary Evans could do in \nhis September 15 Detroit speech is to announce the President has \ndecided to save thousands of jobs for working men and women in \nMichigan, in Tennessee, in America, in the automobile industry and in \nother steel-consuming plants by ending the steel tariffs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we need to have clear what numbers \nwe are working with here. My friend--and I consider him a friend--the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, the comanager of this \nbill, has spoken about the good things that have happened by virtue of \nthe President of the United States, George Bush, and his requests for \nadditional moneys for education.\n  But very seriously, that has to be tongue in cheek because the \nPresident has requested almost nothing as it relates to education. The \nPresiding Officer has not only been a distinguished Governor but also \nthe Secretary of Education. I would ask that he and others look at what \nwe are dealing with here. For example, in fiscal year 2003, the \nPresident of the United States requested an increase of $.4 billion. In \nthe previous year, he requested $2.3 billion.\n  The increases that have come that my friend from Pennsylvania has \nspoken about have come as a result of pressure placed on this \nPresident, this administration, this Congress, by Democrats. As a \nresult of that, we have gotten an extra $8.2 billion. All you have to \ndo is look at what this President has requested. This isn't some kind \nof mathematical genius who comes up with these numbers.\n  In black and white, you see what the President requested. Those \nrequests were an increase for fiscal year 2002 of $2.3 billion; for \nfiscal year 2003, $400 million. Fact. But as a result of work we have \ndone here we were able to squeeze out additional moneys, an additional \n$8.2 billion. In fact, even for those we had to fight the \nadministration.\n  Now, for fiscal year 2004, the President of the United States has \nrequested $26 million for education. That is .05 percent over fiscal \nyear 2003. And those fiscal year 2003 moneys were moneys that we forced \nupon the President. It is a .05-percent increase when States such as \nthe State of Nevada are struggling for money, at a time when schools \nare struggling to meet the mandates of the No Child Left Behind Act. \nBut what this President is doing is leaving lots of children behind.\n  So let's not talk about, on this Senate floor, the increases that \nPresident Bush has obtained on leaving no child behind. We have \nobtained $8.2 billion more than he has requested, and we had to \nstruggle to do that.\n  I repeat, this year, the President requested $26 million, a .05-\npercent increase over fiscal year 2003. For fiscal year 2004, he has \nasked for $.4 billion. Now, we were able to do a lot more than what he \nrequested, and the children of America should thank us every day for \ndoing that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to comment for a few minutes \non an issue that I think is part of the appropriations bill before us \nand certainly one of the real issues that all of us are concerned about \nand that is health care and how we begin to deliver health care in a \nway that is more workable than what we have had in the past.\n  The Senator from South Dakota has spoken for a moment or two about \nhealth care in his State. Of course, Wyoming and South Dakota are rural \nStates, and there are some unique things about the delivery of rural \nhealth care. But I think more than anything, we do have a situation \nwith health care that has to do with access. It has to do with the \navailability of services wherever we are in the country. And it is \nbecoming more and more evident that access is also a function of being \nable to afford those services. We find generally that it is becoming \nmore and more difficult for most Americans to afford the services that \nare there, and therefore they are not as accessible or available as we \nwould like them to be.\n  Clearly, it is one of the most difficult issues we have before us. It \nis a complex issue. If you can afford a Cadillac, that is fine. I live \nwith a Ford, and we are happy about that. But we all want ``Cadillac'' \nhealth service. I understand that. Most of us live, in many ways, in \nthe market as to what we can afford, but health care has more demands \nbecause we all have problems with our health and it is very costly to \ndeal with that.\n  We talk about the issue a great deal, as we should, but, frankly, I \nthink it is time for us to talk a little more about solutions than we \ndo about the problem. And we have tried to do that.\n  During the last month in Wyoming, I held a seminar on health care, \nparticularly rural health care, because we are a rural area of the \ncountry. We asked the people on the panels, who were very good, by the \nway, to talk about solutions, to talk about the problem, which, of \ncourse, we have talked about a number of times.\n  Now, what do we do about it? That is a challenge and one with which I \nthink all of us need to deal. Some of the areas we spoke about, that I \nthink we need to talk about, are, first of all, the Federal programs. A \ngood many people in this country, although fewer than you normally \nthink--I think in Wyoming about 13, less than 14 percent of Wyoming \ncitizens are enrolled in Medicare. Sometimes it seems as if it would be \nhigher than that but, nevertheless, it is a sizable amount. In addition \nto that, of course, the Federal Government has Medicaid. We have the \nkids program and others.\n  So the Federal program is a substantial part of our health care. Some \nof the things we need to do there are to have programs that do pay the \ncosts. I know we have to have some limits. I know it is easy to have \nthings happen in the delivery of health care which we have to guard \nagainst so we do not waste money. But the point is, if procedures cost \na certain amount, then the Federal Government programs need to pay \nsubstantially what that amount is. Otherwise those of us who have \nprivate insurance have to pick up the cost, or the lack of it, that is \npaid for by Government programs and, of course, the uninsured. So we \nhave that problem.\n  We have been working on and I have enjoyed being chairman of the \nrural health caucus, and I have been joined by many people. It is \ninteresting, in the West when we talk about endangered species or \npublic lands, you have the support of about eight or nine States that \nare involved. When you talk about rural health care, every State has \nsome rural areas with rural health care needs. I think New York has \nsome of the most rural areas.\n  So we have made some progress. But what we have found is that \nbasically rural hospitals, rural health care clinics, and so on, have \nnot been paid equally with urban facilities. There is no equality \nthere. Well, we say, my gosh, that is because the costs of living in a \ncity are more than in a rural area. I think the fact is that to provide \nhealth care in low numbers, low volumes, perhaps is more expensive than\n\n[[Page S10963]]\n\nproviding it where there is high volume.\n  All of us want the best care so we want the expensive equipment, much \nof which now has become very much a part of medicine. It costs millions \nof dollars. But if there are not very many people using it, then the \ncost per user is much higher. So we have made some success in looking \nfor some equity.\n  By the way, the large movement in that direction is in the Medicare \nbill that is now in the conference committee. We hope it will stay \nthere and come out of there.\n  A very large percent, almost half, of Medicare money is spent on a \nvery small percent of the patients. They are the ones, of course, who \nhave chronic diseases. They are the ones seriously ill. We have not had \nenough emphasis on seeking to treat people before and to avoid some of \nthe illnesses that are so expensive.\n  Those are some of the problems we have. We are beginning to have more \nand more problems with the service personnel, the number of nurses. \nThere are shortages almost over the whole country. Part of that, I \nsuppose, is the difficulty in training, not so much the capacity of the \nuniversities and the schools that do it but apparently a difficult time \nin having instructors who are available to do the costs on Medicare. If \nthat is the case, in a market system where you have a shortage of \nsomething that is resulting in less volume, you do something about it. \nYou change it so you can create that volume. We need to be doing that.\n  Another reason, one of the ladies stood up--she was chairman of the \nhospital board--and said, it isn't so much the training. The job is not \nvery attractive because of the hours, because of the time that has to \nbe spent, because of the atmosphere, and those kinds of things. Lots of \nnurses who are trained are not doing nursing care, partly because the \nwages are too low. These apparently are some of the problems that exist \nthere.\n  The same is becoming more true with physicians. At least in some of \nour States, the cost, for instance, for health care liability insurance \nhas gotten so expensive that we have people, OBs, who are no longer \npracticing in the area. Many times they were the only OB/GYN in the \narea. But when their costs for liability insurance get up to $55,000, \n$65,000, $75,000, as much as $100,000 a year, they say: I am not going \nto do that anymore. They either don't practice that particular \nprocedure or they drop out entirely.\n  Of course, in our State the average age of physicians is fairly up \nthere, fifties and so on. These folks are going to be retiring. So that \nis one of the problems we have, ways to do that.\n  Certainly another that is difficult is the uninsured. We have \nmillions of people in this country who are uninsured. Well, they \nprobably don't get as much treatment as if they were insured but they \nget treated. They go to emergency rooms. They go to public health \nfacilities and they are treated. They are unable to pay the costs or \nare unwilling to pay the costs. So those who have insurance end up \npaying the cost. You also have an insufficient amount of health care \nfor people who are uninsured. I suppose young people, all kinds of \npeople, simply can't afford it.\n  We had a rancher testify that for his family it costs $12,000 a year \nfor health insurance. That is tough. In town meetings we had some time \nago, that is the issue that came up most often--the cost of health \ninsurance.\n\n  Obviously, there is a relationship between the cost of health care \nand health insurance. Nevertheless, that is what people see, the health \ninsurance costs. That is part of the problem we need to resolve.\n  Pharmaceuticals and drugs, of course, have become a very high \npercentage of the increase, and particularly if combined with the new \nequipment, and so on. We are dealing with that now for Medicare. I hope \nwe will come up with something for Medicare.\n  We also have to deal with the costs for everyone else, whether there \nis overutilization, whether we ought to be using more generics, whether \nthere is too much advertising going on, whatever. There is a problem \nthere that we need to resolve.\n  These are some of the areas with which we have to deal. Certainly, \nagain, the Senator from South Dakota saying that that is what he heard \nthe most about, I think for most of us, when we go to town meetings, \nthat is what we hear the most about. All we hear about are the \nproblems. I think it is up to us to work with the professionals, to \nwork with others. We have an opportunity to do something about the \nliability costs. I don't know whether we can do it. Some will say that \nisn't going to solve the problem. Certainly it isn't going to solve all \nthe problems but it is an opportunity to solve a part of the problem. \nThere is evidence that it does by those States that have done something \nabout limiting the noneconomic damages.\n  There is a great challenge here and a great opportunity to do some \nthings. Part of it will be right here with this appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I returned this past Friday from a 10-day \ntrip to southern Africa with Majority Leader Bill Frist as well as \nSenator Warner, Senator Enzi, Senator Coleman, and Senator Alexander. \nWe traveled to South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, and Namibia. We \ntraveled there to assess each of the HIV/AIDS crises in these \ncountries. We wanted to see where things are now and where we need to \ngo in the future to help them deal with the terrible crisis they face.\n  The fact is we are in a critical stage in this attempt to help them \nand other countries fight this global AIDS battle. We passed the global \nAIDS authorizing legislation a few months ago and shortly we will pass \nthe appropriations bill to fund these programs. As we start to plan how \nto spend this significant amount of money, we are now at a critical \nstage. We are at a critical stage because it is so very important that \nthis be done right, that it be done correctly, and that it be done \nquickly, because millions of lives are at stake.\n  All four countries we visited have, of course, been designated by the \nPresident and now by Congress to be recipients of our global AIDS \nassistance. So these Members of the Senate wanted to find out how we \ncould most effectively and efficiently give this assistance to these \nnations, how we could make sure our money would be well spent. In doing \nso, we wanted to know specifically what these countries' respective \ngovernments were doing. We wanted to know what the nongovernment \norganizations, the NGOs as they are referred to, are currently doing; \nwhat the church groups--we refer to them as faith-based groups--are \ndoing; and what the businesses, the private sector groups, are doing as \nwell.\n  We wanted to know what was the state of the health infrastructure, \nthe public health sector in each of these countries. We also wanted to \nassess where our own Government was. We wanted to talk to our embassy \nofficials and see how their planning was coming along.\n  Finally, and certainly most important, we wanted to ask the leaders \nof these countries--we wanted to talk to their health professionals and \nsocial workers, actually the people out in the field in these nations--\nwhat their needs were, what they thought they needed. We asked them: \nWhat do you need from us? What can we do to help you do your job to \nhelp save lives? We went to the very people who every single day watch \nthe AIDS victims die--the people who try desperately to treat, to help, \nand to save them, and the people who try to prevent people from coming \ndown with AIDS.\n\n  We have some answers.\n  The spread of HIV/AIDS in poor countries is, as we know, rampant. It \nis a grave human tragedy. When it comes to the HIV/AIDS crisis, the \nsheer numbers are staggering. We can't let these numbers numb us. We \nhave to keep reminding ourselves that these are statistics; that behind \neach one of these statistics are human beings; and that these \nstatistics represent real people, real mothers, real fathers, children \nand babies. These are real people and real lives.\n\n[[Page S10964]]\n\n  The statistics are unbelievable. In South Africa, 5 million people \nare HIV positive. In Mozambique, 13 percent of the people have HIV or \nAIDS. The disease has created by some estimates 370,000 to 425,000 \norphans, and by the year 2010, it is estimated that in Mozambique the \nlife expectancy is estimated to plummet to only 39 years. There are \nonly 524 doctors in the whole country, a country of 18.6 million \npeople.\n  In Botswana, a nation of 1.7 million people, there is a 38.8-percent \nHIV rate among those between the ages of 15 and 49. It is a staggering \nfigure. There are 330,000 people, it is estimated, HIV positive, and 18 \npercent of the deaths in that country are the result of AIDS. Thirty-\nfive percent of pregnant women are HIV positive. By the year 2010, it \nis projected that the life expectancy rate will be 31.6 years, if \nnothing is changed, if the situation is not changed, and if there is no \nintervention.\n  The next country we visited was Namibia, a nation of 1.8 million \npeople. Twenty-two percent of the adult population has AIDS or are HIV \npositive. Twenty-three percent of pregnant mothers are HIV positive. By \nthe year 2010, the life expectancy rate is expected to be 39.6 years of \nage.\n  We know the statistics. We certainly can learn from them. We can see \nthe victims and we can talk to them and talk to those who care for \nthem. We can do all of these things and still not comprehend the \ngravity of this human tragedy.\n  One of Africa's great leaders is Graca Machel, a woman we met within \nMozambique. We had a delightful meeting with her for over an hour. She \nis one of the most articulate persons I have ever met with in my life. \nWhen we met with her in Mozambique, she was talking about a country \nthat she loves so well. This is what she said:\n\n       I can know the statistics, but I don't really understand \n     what it means to have 13 percent of my people HIV positive * \n     * *. [Our countries] are facing extinction * * * and we still \n     face the worst.\n\n  The mind cannot comprehend the gravity of this tragedy. This \ncertainly was for me, and I am sure for all of my colleagues, a deeply \ntroubling, gut-wrenching trip. But it was a very productive trip.\n  We were accompanied on the trip by President Bush's AIDS adviser, Dr. \nJoseph O'Neal. His experience and his expertise proved invaluable to us \non our trip. Our ability to talk with him, share ideas, go back and \nforth and compare notes of what we had seen was very valuable.\n  Each one of us on the trip, I am sure, has come back with different \nimpressions but with a lot of the same impressions. This afternoon I \nwould like to take a few minutes to share with my colleagues some of my \nthoughts. They are, of course, my thoughts and my thoughts alone. I \nwould guess that there will be a lot of similarities between my \nthoughts and other colleagues'. But these are mine. These are my \nimpressions and my thoughts from this trip to Africa.\n  First, time is clearly not on our side. It is not on the side of \nvictims in Africa nor on the side of victims of these four countries. \nWe don't have time. We don't have much time. We don't have time to \nwait. Facing this global AIDS crisis cannot be business as usual. It \ncannot be bureaucracy as usual. We cannot treat this crisis the same \nway we have done with others. We don't have the luxury of time. For \neach moment that we delay, obviously people die. People are dying as we \nspeak today. They die every moment.\n  We saw groups in each country, and organizations and individuals, \nthat are ready now to receive our money and our assistance and our \nhelp and who are ready to go into action to deal with the problem. We \nneed to get them the money and allow them to get about the business of \nsaving lives. That is good news. And it was heartwarming to talk to \nthem, to see them.\n\n  These are groups that have a proven track record. These are groups \nthat are already doing good work. We just need to give them more \nresources so they can expand what they are already doing.\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, as we do this, we cannot be \ntimid. Quite frankly, we need to take chances. We need to be willing to \nsay that once in a while we will fail with some of these groups, so we \nneed to say to our own bureaucracy: Do not be afraid of failure. There \nwill be some failures. There will be some foul-ups. But we need to move \nforward. Lives are at stake. And we will hold you--those of us in the \nCongress--accountable for being timid. Do not be timid. Move forward.\n  We need to find these groups that can move forward. We saw many of \nthem on our trip. We need to find these groups, these individuals. We \nneed to fund them, and we need to move on.\n  For example, Dr. Donny McGrath, who is with the Africa Centre, is \nready to go. He has a plan for a 5-year program to establish a model \nHIV/AIDS treatment prevention program in a rural part of South Africa. \nHe has the structural support necessary to pull off this program that \ncould deliver and will deliver care and treatment to this remote area. \nWe met with him. I think everyone was impressed. And he has the \nstructure of the Africa Centre behind him.\n  Dr. Tammy Meyers, we met with her. She would like to begin providing \ntreatment for children with AIDS out of South Africa's biggest hospital \nin Johannesburg. We were told actually it is the biggest hospital in \nthe world. The tragedy is, today they are not--with the exception of a \nhandful of kids--giving kids treatment because they do not have the \nresources to do it. We are told that in the area of Johannesburg, South \nAfrica, there are 6,000 or 7,000 children who right today are dying, \nchildren who should be on treatment for HIV, children who have AIDS, \nwho could be receiving treatment but yet cannot get these drugs. Dr. \nTammy Meyers would like to move forward. We need to get her that help. \nWe need to give that hospital that help.\n  The Salvation Army is also doing great work in many of these \ncountries. We were so impressed when we went into a Salvation Army \norphanage that was providing drug treatment for children they had under \ntheir charge in that orphanage. As an organization, the Salvation Army \nhas a proven track record. As I said, they are involved in many of the \ncountries in the world where HIV is a problem, where AIDS is running \nrampant. We need to say to groups such as the Salvation Army, who have \na proven track record: Tell us what you need. What are the resources \nyou need? Tell us what you can do. Let's work together. Let's save \nlives.\n  So there are many things we can do, and we can do quickly, and we \nneed to do it. We need to save lives.\n  Second, in all four nations we visited, when we asked what the No. 1 \nneed was, almost invariably, no matter who we asked, the answer we got \nback was: We need training. From the doctors to the nurses, when we \ntalked to people who were delivering services right down at the \ngrassroots level, people pled with us: Give us more training. Train our \ndoctors. Train our nurses. Help us.\n\n  The fact is, AIDS treatment and prevention is a specialized field of \nmedical care. We need to put more and more specialists in place, \ndoctors who can train other doctors to fight this disease and provide \ntreatment.\n  Now, I do not have all the answers as to how to do this, but we need \nto think about it. And as we do the things we can do quickly and \nrelatively easy--as I said before, plug into the existing groups, the \nexisting organizations that are ready to go right now--at the same \ntime, we have to look at what we do in the long run over the next year, \n2 years, 3 years, 4 years to deal with this crisis, to answer the call \nof these countries when people say: We need doctors, specialists. We \nneed the training.\n  So we need to develop a cadre of doctors. Do we use our Peace Corps? \nMaybe we use our Peace Corps to do this. Maybe we use the U.S. Public \nHealth Service Corps, revamp it in some way to do this. Maybe what we \ndo is take residents, when they finish their residency in this country, \nand work out some way so that it is advantageous to them to interrupt \ntheir career, in a sense--or really maybe a better way of looking at it \nis enhancing their career--and give them the opportunity to go and \nspend a few years working in these African countries, specializing in \nthis area, taking that specialization then and training doctors in \nthese countries--the multiplier effect--so that these countries will \nthen have trained specialists of their own who will stay in their \ncountries and we will help save lives.\n\n[[Page S10965]]\n\n  That is the type of multiplication and training of doctors we are \ngoing to have to think through and figure out over the long run as to \nhow we are going to help them answer that call that we heard time and \ntime again: How are we going to get the training? That is the long run.\n  No. 3, clean water. On our trip it became very clear just how \nessential clean water is to fighting AIDS, and also it is essential \njust to save lives. It is essential to keeping young children alive \nworldwide. Some 60 percent of all infant mortality worldwide is linked \nto infectious and parasitic diseases, most of them water related. \nFurthermore, diseases from dirty water are killing more than 5 million \npeople each year--that is one figure, and I think other estimates, \nfrankly, are much higher than that--while an additional several billion \npeople get sick from unclean water each year.\n  In just one country, Mozambique, for example, diarrheal diseases are \nthe third largest cause of death in children under 5 years of age. That \nis the equivalent of 55 deaths per day. Potable water is accessible to \nonly 26 percent of the rural population in Mozambique. Imagine that. \nGet outside the city, and only one in four of the population has good \nwater, and only 40 percent of the urban population in Mozambique.\n  The reality is that we cannot effectively treat and fight AIDS \nwithout clean water supplies. In impoverished nations, up to 90 percent \nof AIDS patients suffer from chronic diarrheal diseases, which \ncontribute to an increase in these deaths. One of the complications of \nAIDS is the development of thrush, which can be alleviated by drinking \nsufficient quantities of water. Caregivers need to be able to wash \ntheir hands before and after caring for an infected person. Mothers \ninfected with HIV/AIDS may choose to use formula to feed their infant \nchildren and would need clean water to mix formula.\n  Providing access to clean water is about the most cost-effective use \nof our AIDS money because it would provide a double benefit. Digging \nwells in a village provides the whole village with clean water, not \njust those stricken with HIV or AIDS.\n  Providing clean water is a cheap thing to do, and good groups are \nalready doing it. We saw some of those groups during our trip. For \nexample, Lifewater International, a group that we saw, is a partnership \nof U.S.-based organizations working globally to improve drinking water \nsupplies, hygiene, and sanitation in Third World nations. They are \nmaking a difference, and they can do more if we just give them the \nresources they need. This is a simple and cost-effective strategy, and \nit is the right thing to do. There are groups such as this all over the \nworld. All we need to do is to take some of these resources, plug into \nthese groups, let them multiply already what they are doing, and we \nwill save hundreds of thousands of lives.\n  No. 4 of the thoughts I have: Care for the dying. As we focus on \nsaving and prolonging lives, we must not forget the millions who, \ndespite our best efforts, will surely die. Precious little is being \ndone to help them die with dignity. We talked with people who deal with \nthese individuals. We talked with people who see them die. We talked \nwith people who watch them die every day. Those people whose job it is \nto deal with the dying looked us in the eye and pled with us; they \nsaid: Give us the tools, the drugs to allow these people who are dying \nnot to suffer so much and to die with dignity.\n  The global AIDS bill we passed this May allows us to do this. There \nare groups out there ready to help, groups capable of helping. We \nshould give them the ability to help the suffering and to help the \ndying.\n  No. 5, let me just talk for a moment about government attitude and \npolitical leadership in regard to the issue of AIDS. We visited four \ncountries. The governments of Namibia, Mozambique, and Botswana are all \nfully engaged in this struggle against AIDS. That political leadership \nis essential in the battle against AIDS. We can only hope the recent \npublic statement by the fourth country, South Africa, in favor of the \nuse of antiretroviral drugs will be followed by an aggressive \ngovernment attack on the problem.\n  For those who have not followed this, this is a change in policy. The \ngovernment in the past had not embraced the use of antiretroviral drugs \nto treat the AIDS problem. So this has been a change. We can only hope \nthis is a profound change. We can only hope the Government of South \nAfrica will now become much more aggressive in this endeavor.\n  Some local units of government from South Africa have been \naggressive, but unfortunately the tragedy is the central government has \nnot been as aggressive. And while we talked to many people in South \nAfrica who are doing wonderful things, unfortunately there are some \npeople in the South African Government who still would appear to be in \na form of denial about this problem. It would appear that progress is \nbeing made. We would hope progress will continue to be made.\n  The sixth point I would like to make is the killing power of stigma. \nWe cannot underestimate the killing power of stigma, people's feelings \nof shame and disgrace with this disease. Stigma kills. Stigma prevents \npregnant women from getting tested for HIV/AIDS. Stigma prevents people \nfrom getting treatment. Stigma prevents us from dealing with this \ncrisis head on. There is tremendous denial. People hide the fact they \nare sick, even if that means risking their lives or even if it means \nrisking the lives of their unborn children.\n  On our trip we heard doctors speak of women with AIDS who were told \nthey could take drugs that might prevent their child who was about to \nbe born from testing HIV-positive, drugs that could reduce the odds of \nthe children being born with AIDS by 50 percent. Yet despite hearing \nthis news, we heard about some women who left the clinic never to \nreturn because of the stigma attached to having AIDS, never to return \nbecause of the ridicule their husbands, their family might inflict upon \nthem. That is a horrible tragedy--a stigma so powerful, so powerful \nthese women would risk the lives of their unborn children, something it \nis hard for us to understand.\n\n  I heard a story that was also hard to understand. I talked to a \ndoctor in South Africa who was intimately involved in drug treatment, \nwho had set up a program of drug treatment. He told me a story about a \nwoman who worked in his house. She had worked there for some time. One \nday she left, disappeared. He couldn't figure out where she had gone. \nThe days went on. Then the weeks went on. After about 7 weeks, he \ndecided he was going to go look for her. So he got in his car and drove \nto her village. It turned out it was a drive of 7 hours. He drove and \ndrove and got to her village. When he got there and started asking \nabout her, he found that she had died the day before. This is a woman \nwho died from AIDS, a woman who died rather than acknowledge she had \nAIDS, who worked for a doctor who was treating people with AIDS. As the \ndoctor said to me: I would have paid for her drugs. I would have taken \ncare of her. I would have done anything. But she wouldn't tell him.\n  That is the power of the stigma that is attached to this. It kills \npeople. She preferred to die alone, hiding her disease.\n  What is the solution? I don't know that we have a solution, but there \nare some things we know. First, in these nations, wherever it occurs, \nwe need to educate people, whether it is in this country or any other \ncountry. We need to educate people about AIDS. Second, political \nleaders need to talk openly about the disease. Leaders in Botswana and \nNamibia and Mozambique have been forthright and up front and open to \npublic discussions about the disease.\n  Third, we need to have treatment available so people have hope. No \none is going to get tested for HIV/AIDS if there is no treatment and \nyou are told to just go home and die. As Graca Machel said: There is \n``no effective prevention without treatment.''\n  People must be able to see that they are getting something \nthemselves. By treating people, it offers hope, and it offers incentive \nfor more and more people to get tested. That, by itself, will save \nlives. That is the reality, Mr. President.\n  My seventh thought has to do with children. In the four nations we \nvisited, really we are just barely getting started in providing \ntreatment for children who are HIV positive or who already have AIDS. \nThere are--and it is a good news story--some mothers-to-children \ntransmission preventive programs in\n\n[[Page S10966]]\n\nthe early stages. We have heard from people who are very thankful to \nthe United States, people who are thankful to President Bush, thankful \nto us and our country, about these programs. Some of these programs are \nprograms we put in place.\n  We heard some very good success stories about many of these programs. \nThey show very promising results. With these programs and the drugs \nthey provide, we are seeing HIV/AIDS transmission rates from a mother \nwho has AIDS to a child about to be born, and then born, drop from 30 \npercent to 5 to 10 percent. What do we mean by that? Well, the doctors \ntell us that if a mother is HIV positive and she is not treated, the \nodds are approximately 30 percent that she is going to give birth to a \nchild who will be HIV positive. In these developing countries, with \ntreatment--and usually a fairly simple treatment and it costs about \n$3--we can reduce those numbers to about 5 to 10 percent. That is a \ndramatic drop in the number of children who would be born HIV positive. \nIf given the proper medication, the odds go dramatically down.\n  The challenge, of course, is getting these mother-to-child \ntransmission programs going and then getting the pregnant women into \nthe program.\n  We also have to face the challenge of treating children who do \ndevelop AIDS. That is a different ball game, a different problem. \nTreatment for these kids is, as I said when I referenced South Africa--\nand it is true of all the other three countries--is virtually \nnonexistent, just like the treatment for adults.\n  In Johannesburg, to take one example--and you can replicate these \nnumbers or use similar numbers across all of Africa, or at least all \nthe countries where HIV is prevalent--there are 6,000 to 7,000 kids in \nneed of antiretroviral treatment, yet fewer than 100 kids are getting \nany treatment at all. The good news is that there are good people in \nthe hospitals who are ready now to treat these kids. Dr. Tammy Meyers \nis ready now to start a program to provide drug treatment for these \nchildren.\n  In conclusion, on this trip we saw the human face of Africa. We saw \nthe human face of AIDS. I have seen this face before in Haiti and \nGuyana. That human face will remain with all of us who went on this \ntrip after all the specific statistics have faded.\n  I will always remember Graca Machel telling us about her going out in \nthe rural area visiting a grandfather and his two wives. He is 83 and \nhis wives are 73 and 76. They lost their eight children. They saw them \ndie one by one, each one claimed by AIDS. Now these elderly people are \ncaring for their 30 grandchildren after having lost each 1 of these 8 \nchildren. I will remember that.\n  I will remember watching a young teenager as he described losing his \nparents to AIDS and then having to go from home to home to home, \nrelative to relative, to see others of his relatives die of AIDS, being \nhanded from one family to another.\n\n  I will remember an HIV-positive mother describe giving birth to a \nchild who developed AIDS, a little baby, who died shortly after birth. \nI will remember watching her describe that child as that child died.\n  I will also remember an HIV-positive mother who described getting the \nhelp she needed, having someone reach out to her, getting the drug \ntreatment she needed before giving birth to her child, and described \nthe joy she felt to know her child was not HIV positive, that her child \nwas a healthy child. We listened to her joyfully describe that child \nand the future that child now has. Her baby was born HIV free. Her \nstory doesn't need to be the exception.\n  With our HIV/AIDS money, more and more babies can be born free of \nAIDS. We need to move quickly. Time is not on our side. We need to move \nnow. We need to invest in the people who are ready to go and in the \nprograms that already work. We need to do all we can to address the \nhuman tragedy of global AIDS. We have the ability to ease this \nsuffering, and it is our moral obligation to lead this fight. We are at \na critical time in world history. I believe history will judge us well \nby what we are doing today. It is our obligation at this critical time \nto make sure that we not only begin this fight--and we have--but that \nwe carry it out, that we stay with it, that we do it effectively, that \nwe do it correctly, and that we stay with it day after day after day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak of an American \npatriot.\n  Jim Pitts was my classmate during my 4 years at Basic High School in \nHenderson, NV. I have fond memories of Basic, and one reason is because \nI also have fond memories of my friend, Dr. Jim Pitts.\n  I remember when Jim and I were chosen to go to Reno as members of \nBoys State. We headquartered at UNR. For two young men from Henderson, \nwhere there is almost no greenery, it was almost unreal to see the \ngreen grass, the clear flowing water of the Truckee, and even Manzanita \nLake.\n  Boys State is an experience I will always remember. And again, my \nmemories of that experience will always include Jim Pitts.\n  I also recall our senior prom, Nancy Niece, a junior, was the prom \nqueen . . .  and Jim Pitts was president of the senior class. Jim and \nMike O'Callaghan, who was one of our teachers and later served as \nGovernor of Nevada, got the idea to bring in some flowers for the \ndance. It is an understatement to say we had flowers--they were \nliterally everywhere! They were flown in from Hawaii. How they were \npurchased, I will never know. But what a prom Jimmy put together--\nmemories are made of this.\n  In high school, Jim was one of the smart kids. He was good at math, \nand he even liked science. So it was only natural that the faculty \nrecognized his potential. With the support of his teachers and his \nfamily, he enrolled at the University of Oregon in Eugene. He graduated \nwith honors, then went on to medical school at the University of Oregon \nin Portland.\n  Jim began his residency program to become a surgeon in Fresno, CA. \nBut after 2 years, duty called, and Dr. Pitts joined the United States \nArmy. He volunteered to become a paramedic. In lay terms, this is a \nmedical doctor who parachutes out of airplanes to care for those who \nare injured in combat.\n  He served with the 101st Airborne Division during the bloodiest years \nin Vietnam, 1967-68. In Vietnam, Jim received the Bronze Star, the Army \nAccommodation Medal, and the Combat Medic Badge. His medical training \ngave him the skills needed to save lives. He was a hero.\n  After coming home from Vietnam, Jim returned to Fresno and completed \nhis residency in general surgery. Dr. Pitts then moved back to Nevada, \nbut this time he settled in the north, in Carson City. He has made his \nhome in Carson City ever since, performing miracles and saving lives at \nthe Carson-Tahoe Hospital.\n  In 1989, Dr. Pitts was honored as Distinguished Physician of the Year \nby the State Medical Association. He obviously passed his talents as a \nsurgeon along to his son, Todd, who has been serving in his father's \npractice for the past 6 years.\n  But Dr. Pitts is not just a talented surgeon, he is also a great \nfriend and a gentleman, a caring person who has made a tremendous \ndifference in his community. And he passed these traits to his daughter \nKathy, who teaches school here in Carson City. I know Jim and Carol are \nvery proud of both of their children. And I know they, in turn, are \nboth proud of their parents.\n  Since our high school days, Jim and I have rarely been able to spend \nmuch time together. He went his way, and I went mine. We have had an \noccasional dinner, and even went shooting together, but not often \nenough.\n\n[[Page S10967]]\n\n  In spite of our limited contact, and the passage of 45 years, our \nfriendship has never wavered. I am so proud of Jim and his \naccomplishments.\n  I recently wrote Jim a letter, expressing sympathy at the passing of \nhis dear father. Little did I know when I wrote the letter that Jim was \nill himself. As soon as I learned of his condition I called him, after \nworrying the entire weekend about my high school buddy.\n  When I called, I hoped I would be able to perk him up. But just the \nopposite occurred. Jim, always the physician, cheered me up.\n  He said, in effect, I am so fortunate to have the life I have, a \nwonderful family, and time to plan for the future.\n  I am sorry I can't attend the event to celebrate Jim's outstanding \ncareer, and at the same time--this sounds just like Jimmy Pitts--raise \nmoney for the Cancer Treatment Center at Carson-Tahoe Hospital.\n  Jimmy, may you know from your old boyhood friend of my love and \naffection.\n  Thinking of you, I am reminded of the old Jewish saying: ``Who finds \na faithful friend, finds a treasure.''\n  Fifty years ago, I made a friend, and I found a treasure. Jimmy Pitts \nhas truly been a blessing in my life.\n  Thank you, Jimmy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/02/senate-section/article/S10967-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CHANGES TO H.

Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nrecognize a fine public servant who just retired this past August from \nthe Congressional Research Service. David Ackerman is a sterling \nexample of the expertise we in the Congress can call upon to assist us \nin our legislative responsibilities. I know Senator Biden joins me \nrecognizing Mr. Ackerman for his splendid accomplishments during his \ncareer at CRS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of \nMr. Ackerman's career be included in the record as part of my remarks. \nMr. Ackerman devoted nearly 30 years to supporting Congress in his role \nas legislative attorney for the American Law Division of CRS. His areas \nof expertise were international law, foreign affairs and first \namendment church-state issues and he applied a keen legal mind and \nsensitivity for balance and nonpartisanship in providing Congress with \nthe informed and objective analysis we need. Dave Ackerman joined CRS \nin 1974 after graduating with distinction from Georgetown University \nLaw School. Prior to his legal career, after graduating magna cum laude \nfrom Knox College, he worked on Capitol Hill in the Washington office \nof the National Council of Churches. At CRS, Dave quickly established \nhimself as an attorney with the legal analytical skills necessary to \nprovide Members and committees of Congress with high level support on \nsome of the most complex questions facing them in their legislative and \noversight roles. He did this with the professionalism, objectivity, and \ndevotion to client support that we in the Congress value in CRS. Dave's \ncareer saw numerous awards and recognition for outstanding performance \nby CRS as well as expressions of commendation by congressional clients. \nHis work was referred to and reprinted widely during congressional \ndeliberations and in a variety of congressional publications. Among the \nmost notable of the latter, are his contributions over the years to the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Print, ``Treaties and Other \nInternational Agreements: The Role of the United States Senate,'' a \nseminal work and invaluable reference resource on this important topic. \nMr. Ackerman's work ranged over many of the controversial issues faced \nby the Congress and the country over the last 30 years. In the \ninternational/foreign affairs law area, Dave wrote extensively on the \nrespective roles of Congress and the executive in waging war and \nconducting foreign affairs. Both Gulf wars and the Somalia, Kosovo and \nAfghanistan conflicts raised their own issues of presidential power and \ncongressional prerogatives and Dave was an invaluable source of legal \nanalysis for the Congress, assisting it in understanding this complex \ninterplay. Mr. Ackerman also provided Congress with sophisticated \nanalyses of such issues as the legal implications for treaties of the \nbreak-up of the Soviet Union, the termination of the ABM treaty, NATO \nenlargement, the Kyoto protocol and the International Criminal Court. \nRecently, Mr. Ackerman has written extensively on the legally--and \npolitically--complex issue of suits over terrorist acts in United \nStates courts. Both the courts and Congress have struggled to develop \nsolutions to this problem, balancing justice for victims with delicate \nforeign policy concerns. A remarkable aspect of Mr. Ackerman's career \nwith CRS was his ability to range over a number of areas of law. Dave \nwas also a recognized expert on the separation of church and state. The \nfirst amendment's commands regarding the establishment of religion and \nthe free exercise of religion have produced some of the most heated \ndebates in the courts and Congress, whether it be prayer or the Pledge \nof Allegiance in the schools or government aid to religious \ninstitutions. Dave was able to write on these issues with a clarity and \nacumen that enabled Congress to understand the ever-changing law of \nchurch and state in its legislative deliberations. In the finest \ntraditions of CRS, Mr. Ackerman brought objectivity and even-handedness \nto an area that invariably elicited strong emotions and heated \nargument. Congress and CRS will miss the expertise of David Ackerman. \nHe represented the best of what we have come to expect from CRS. \nFortunately, a body of work remains that will inform the Congress for \nyears to come. We wish Dave and his family all the best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/02/senate-section/article/S10967-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10967-S10968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an Iowan who has \ngiven his life in service to his country. PFC David Kirchhoff suffered \nheat stroke in Iraq and was evacuated to a base in Germany where he \ndied. His wife Brooke was with him when he passed away. Private \nKirchhoff is the fifth Iowan and the first member of the Iowa Army \nNational Guard to be killed since the start of military operations in \nIraq. David Kirchhoff graduated from Metro High School in Cedar Rapids, \nIA and lived most recently in Anamosa. In addition to his wife Brooke, \nDavid leaves\n\n[[Page S10968]]\n\nbehind his parents, Larry and Nancy Kirchhoff, and two children. \nNothing I can say can alleviate their sense of loss, but they remain in \nmy thoughts and prayers. The death of a fellow Iowan brings home the \nincredible cost of war for me and for other Iowans. David Kirchhoff \nserved his country honorably and was a dedicated soldier, but it is \nimportant that we remember him also as a husband, a son, a father, and \na friend. Many Iowans are getting to know David Kirchhoff through news \nstories. We can identify with him and I know many people feel his loss \nwhether they knew him or not. As we honor his tremendous sacrifice, we \nalso honor his life and his memory lives on.\n  Mr. President, I also come before the Senate today to pay tribute to \na fellow Iowan, PVT Michael J. Deutsch. On July 31, 2003, while serving \nour country in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Private Deutsch was killed when \nan explosive round hit the armored personnel vehicle in which he was \nriding. A 2000 graduate of Dubuque Senior High School, Michael Deutsch \njoined the U.S. Army in 2002. He served with the 1st Squadron, 1st \nArmored Cavalry Division in Budingen, Germany before being deployed to \nIraq. I would like to express my deepest sympathy to his parents, Wayne \nand Ilene Deutsch, as well as the rest of his family, his friends, and \nhis community during these difficult times as they cope with their \nloss. All of America mourns its fallen sons and daughters, yet we feel \nan overwhelming sense of appreciation for those who risk their lives \nfor our sake. It's soldiers like Michael that protect our country \nagainst those who wish to steal what generations of Americans have \nworked so hard to maintain--our freedom.\n  After leaving for the Army, Michael wrote these words to his father:\n\n     When changes come we're never ready.\n     Always thinking of what we should have done.\n\n     But I am strong.\n     You have seen to that.\n     As I move on I carry with me that which you have given to me, \n           your love.\n\n  It is always a tragedy when a young life is ended prematurely, but \nPrivate Michael J. Deutsch's legacy of bravery and ultimate sacrifice \nis one for which we, as Americans, will forever be in his debt.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, at a time when our country's security \nis challenged on so many fronts, there are those among us who lament \nthat this generation is too inward looking and too selfish to stand up \nto the task that has befallen them. But they are wrong.\n  There are Americans, who, raised in a cold conflict with a foe now \nlong past and used to the privilege of liberty and justice, still \nchoose to define themselves by their service to their countrymen and to \nmen and women the world over whom they have never met but for whose \nfreedom they would lay down their lives in sacrifice.\n  Army SSG Richard S. Eaton Jr. of Guilford, CT, was one such man, and \nit is in his honor that I rise to speak today.\n  Sergeant Eaton, who was assigned to the Army's 323rd Military \nIntelligence Battalion, Fort Meade, was a mere 37 years old when he \ndied in Ramadi, Iraq, on August 12 of this year.\n  Of poor consolation to his family and friends is that Sergeant Eaton \ndied while doing what he loved--soldiering in the service of his \nNation.\n  Soldiering and service defined this young man's life and were in his \nblood; he had many relatives who had served in the U.S. military, \nincluding Civil War GEN Amos Eaton, William Eaton, who helped reinstate \nthe deposed leader of Tripoli and rescue American captives in the early \n1800s, and both of Sergeant Eaton's grandfathers, who were veterans of \nWorld War I and World War II, respectively.\n  Sergeant Eaton learned about a soldier's life from the stories that \nhis grandfathers told about their own service and the service of their \nancestors, and in that retelling, a young Richard Eaton Jr. found \nsomething that transfixed him, some quality of honor, of humility, of \nservice. He decided he wanted to be a soldier.\n  In this goal, Sergeant Eaton succeeded like few soldiers ever do, and \nfor his valor he will be posthumously awarded the Bronze Star for \nValor. According to his friends, family, and colleagues, Sergeant Eaton \nserved capably, honorably, and humbly. He never bragged about his \nnumerous citations and commendations, which he only accidentally \nunveiled to his family when on leave from active duty in Honduras.\n  When his nearly decade-long tour of duty with the Army was over, \nSergeant Eaton went to work at the Pentagon for a military contractor. \nStill a member of the Army Reserves, he was activated for service this \nwinter and reported for duty to Iraq.\n  Through his service, Sergeant Eaton demonstrated the best ideals of \nthe American people: service in the face of adversity, a striking \nunselflessness, and sacrifice not only for his own countrymen, but also \nfor a people whom he had never met.\n  And so today, I join the senior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, \nGovernor Rowland, and the people of a grateful State and Nation in \npaying my most sincere condolences to Sergeant Eaton's family, and my \ndeepest respects to the departed sergeant himself.\n  Our hearts and prayers go out to his parents in their time of grief.\n  Know that your son's contributions and ultimate sacrifice will not \nsoon be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/02/senate-section/article/S10968-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO E.W. DENNISON\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to E.W. \nDennison, the Murray State University Athletic Director. Mr. Dennison \nis an outstanding leader under whose guidance Murray State University \nhas achieved an important balance between athletics and scholarship.\n  In the 6 years since Mr. Dennison assumed his position as athletic \ndirector, Murray State University has seen a marked improvement in its \ngraduation rate for student athletes. According to the Chronicle of \nHigher Education's 2003-2004 Almanac issue, Murray State University \nranks first for having the highest graduation rate among NCAA Division \nI institutions in Kentucky. This is the second straight year Murray \nState University has led Kentucky's State-funded institutions in \ngraduation rates of athletes. Prior to Mr. Dennison's tenure as \nathletic director, it had been several years since Murray State \nUniversity graduated a senior basketball player. This year Mr. Dennison \nboasts the readiness of several senior basketball players to graduate.\n  Additionally, Mr. Dennison has set high standards for academic \nachievement. The grade point average (GPA) for student athletes at \nMurray State University is as high as the GPA of the larger student \nbody. Mr. Dennison stresses the importance of good study habits and \nhigher learning and his athletes will graduate with a preparedness for \nmore than just athletics.\n  Murray State University's athletics programs are poised for a record-\nsetting year on the playing field this year. The balance of academics \nand athletics that Mr. Dennison has achieved has not come at the \nexpense of either discipline. Rather, Murray State University student \nathletes are excelling in the classroom and on the playing fields.\n  Mr. Dennison is a paragon of leadership in Kentucky's institutions of \nhigher education, and his leadership is one that should be emulated \nacross this country. He is a tribute to Kentucky. I thank the Senate \nfor allowing me to honor this remarkable man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/02/senate-section/article/S10968-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10968-S10969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in \nWashington, D.C. On August 16, 2003, Elvys Augusto Perez, 25, was shot \nand killed. Mr. Perez was an immigrant from Guatemala who dressed and \nlived as a woman. Police have classified the first-degree murder as a \nhate crime.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement\n\n[[Page S10969]]\n\nEnhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance.

Bush and \n     Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to place this treaty, the \n     United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination Against Women, in the highest category of \n     priority, in order to accelerate the treaty's passage through \n     the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the \n     full United States Senate, with the goal of the United States \n     Ratification; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this Legislative Body exhort the United \n     States Foreign Relations Committee to pass this treaty \n     favorably out of Committee; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this Legislative Body strongly urges the \n     Senate of the United States to ratify the United Nations \n     Convention's continuing goals; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution, suitably \n     engrossed, be transmitted to President George W. Bush, \n     Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, President of the Senate \n     Richard B. Cheney, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and all members of the New \n     York State Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-257. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to Homeland Security costs; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the tragic events that occurred on September 11, \n     2001 resulted in a horrific loss of thousands of lives as \n     hijacked planes crashed into the Pentagon, into a field in \n     the countryside of Pennsylvania and into both towers of the \n     World Trade Center in New York City, resulting in their total \n     collapse; and\n       Whereas, these planned assaults on our nation were \n     perpetrated by terrorists who sought to harm us, our freedoms \n     and our way of life, but ironically the events of September \n     11, 2001 have resulted in a national unity not seen since \n     World War II; and\n       Whereas, funded by deep pockets overseas, the terrorists \n     were able to take advantage of us by infiltrating and \n     accessing our airports, towns and cities to plan their \n     attacks and have shown us clearly that there are enemies of \n     our way of life both at home and abroad; and\n       Whereas, to protect our citizenry, our infrastructure, our \n     cities and our highways and to keep our free society, we need \n     to change certain security measures in many parts of our \n     nation on a day-to-day basis; and\n       Whereas, new guidelines of security all across the country \n     are being planned, such as increased security personnel and \n     equipment, increased public safety response, heightened \n     surveillance and intelligence gathering, improved medical \n     preparedness, shelter improvements and improved emergency \n     medical staff; and\n       Whereas, the costs for hour homeland security have already \n     begun to take their toll on states' budgets across the nation \n     with added marine security costs, higher expenses in human \n     services and bureaus of health and increased transportation \n     and public utility costs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge \n     that the Federal Government be responsible for these \n     increased costs that the states are bearing; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and \n     the President of the United States Senate and to each Member \n     of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/02/senate-section/article/S10970-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of July 29, 2003, the \nfollowing reports of committees were submitted on August 26, 2003:\n\n       By Ms. Snowe, from the committee on Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship, with amendments:\n       S. 1375.

A bill to authorize the expansion of the pilot program of \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs on assisted living for veterans to \ninclude three additional health care regions of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to support an expansion of an existing Department of \nVeterans Affairs assisted living pilot program.\n  Currently, 35 percent of veterans are 65 or older, which translates \ninto 8.75 million people. Of that, about 640,000 are 85 and older--\nthose most in need of long-term care. VA estimates that the numbers \nwill more than double to about 1.3 million in 2012.\n  The assisted living pilot program is designed to help this massive \ngroup of men and women who either need long-term care now or \npotentially will need it in the future. The pilot program was first \nestablished through The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits \nAct, which gave VA clear authority to furnish an assisted living \nservice, including to the spouses of veterans.\n  For my colleagues who do not know--and I doubt there can be many--\nassisted living is a form of institutional care for those who need help \ncaring for themselves but who do not need to be in a nursing home. By \ngiving them the option of assisted living in an assistive facility, we \nallow our elderly veterans to retain their independence. The existing \npilot has also provided VA a way to offer long-term care without having \nto house the program within its hospitals, reducing some of the burden \nto increase its number of beds.\n  The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act allowed for only \none pilot program. After an extensive application process, on January \n9, 2001, the Northwest Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN 20) \nwas selected as the pilot site. Though the panel which selected the \nwinner felt that other applicants, including the second place proposal \nfrom Florida's VISN 8, warranted funding, they were tied by the law's \nlimit of one program.\n  Since its inception, the VA assisted living pilot program in VISN 20 \nhas placed a total of 181 veterans in assisted living facilities. The \naverage veteran selected for the pilot is a 69-year-old unmarried male \nwho was referred from an inpatient hospital setting. The average \nveteran enrolled in the pilot also typically shows significant \nfunctional impairment and a wide variety of physical and mental health \nconditions.\n  Initial findings show the average cost of the program is comparable \nto that of private assisted living--even costing less than some offered \nin Boise and Portland, two cities that are hosting the program. The \naverage contract facility used for the pilot has 25 rooms.\n  Another valuable facet of the program is its use of a computerized \ndatabase that makes it extremely efficient for components such as \nrecruitment, processing of payments, high quality data collection, and \ndata analysis for ongoing management feedback and evaluation.\n\n[[Page S10973]]\n\n  Clearly, VA needs to do more in the area of long-term care. On May 22 \nof this year, at the request of the Senate and House Committees on \nVeterans Affairs, the General Accounting Office (GAO) issued the report \nVA Long-Term Care: Service Gaps and Facility Restrictions Limit \nVeterans' Access to Noninstitutional Care. GAO found that ``VA's lack \nof emphasis on increasing access to noninstitutional long-term care \nservices has contributed to service gaps and individual facility \nrestrictions that limit access to care.'' The report made several \nrecommendations to VA, including that they ``refine current performance \nmeasures to help ensure that all VA facilities provide veterans with \naccess to required noninstitutional services.''\n  In fiscal year 2002, VA served about 36 percent of its long-term care \nworkload in non-institutional settings, yet, that same year, non-\ninstitutional care accounted for just 9 percent of VA's long-term care \nexpenditures. Clearly a move from traditional institutional care is \nwise. The assisted living pilot program goes far in helping VA address \nthese problems and meet the goals set out for them by GAO.\n  While the assisted living pilot in VISN 20 does not expire until \nOctober 2004, I am convinced that veterans in that part of the country \nare benefitting from the approach. The legislation I introduce today \nwould expand the pilot program to three additional networks, for three \nadditional years. Why should the rest of the Nation be prevented from \nreaping the benefits of such a practical, cost-effective program?\n  Both veterans and VA employees affiliated with the program have \npraised what it has to offer. They believe that it fills an important \ngap for those who require care but do not need nor want to go to a \nnursing home. We must expand this program that provides such deserved \ncare to our Nation's veterans, allowing them to maintain both their \nhealth and their self-respect.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1572\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

McGHEE, KEEPER OF THE STATIONERY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 218, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 218) commending Michael J. McGhee, \n     Keeper of the Stationery, United States Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to recognize a \nfaithful, long-serving member of our Senate family. Mike McGhee--our \nKeeper of the Stationery--retired this past 29th day of August, after \nserving the Senate for almost 30 years.\n  Mike began his Senate career in July 1974 as a sales clerk when the \nstationery room operation was located in the basement of the Russell \nBuilding. He worked his way up in the stationery room to become the \n17th Keeper of the Stationery. It is interesting to note that the \nSenate Stationery Room has been in existence since the very first \nCongress assembled in Federal Hall in New York City. Since that time--a \nperiod of 230 plus years--there have only been 16 other Keepers of the \nStationery, a very exclusive group of people indeed!\n  During Mike's almost three-decade career, he has developed life-long \nprofessional relationships with many Senate employees. Indeed, most \nSenate staff and members know him and know that they can count on Mike \nto provide the help they need.\n  Of special note is Mike's ``beyond the call of duty'' response to the \nanthrax attack and related closure of the Hart Building, including the \nStationery Room. Under Mike's leadership, the Stationery Room continued \noperations throughout the response period, fulfilling the countless \nrequests for supplies under a most challenging atmosphere. Mike and his \nstaff helped keep the work of the Senate rolling.\n  Mike's family--his wife Kathleen, son Luke, and daughter Molly--are \njustly proud of their husband and dad, respectively, for his many \ntireless efforts and the significant contributions he has made to the \nSenate and our country.\n  As Mike leaves the Senate family, the Senate will miss him. On behalf \nof all my colleagues and our entire Senate family, I thank Mike for his \ndedicated service and wish him and his family God-speed in retirement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to add my congratulations to Mike \nMcGhee on his career here in the Senate and to wish him well on his \nretirement. His rise, over nearly a 30-year span, from clerk in the \nStationery Room to become the 17th Keeper of the Stationery shows the \ndedication and hard work that everyone has come to expect from Mike. \nThe stationery office serves the entire Senate community and involves \nmanaging over a $4 million budget. He has accomplished this task both \nefficiently and effectively. His commitment to public service has been \nexemplary. I wish him and his family all the best in the years to come, \nand I congratulate him on a job well done.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to; that the preamble be agreed to; that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements \nrelating to this resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 218) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 218\n\n       Whereas the Senate recognizes that its Keeper of the \n     Stationery, Michael J. McGhee, retired on August 29, 2003;\n       Whereas Michael J. McGhee became an employee of the Senate \n     in August 1974, and since that date has ably and faithfully \n     upheld the high standards and traditions of the Senate for a \n     period that included 16 Congresses;\n       Whereas Michael J. McGhee has served with distinction as \n     Keeper of the Stationery, and at all times has discharged the \n     important duties and responsibilities of his office with \n     dedication and excellence; and\n       Whereas Michael J. McGhee's exceptional service and his \n     unfailing dedication have earned him the esteem and affection \n     of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends Michael J. McGhee for his exemplary service to \n     the Senate and the Nation;\n       (2) wishes to express its deep appreciation for his long, \n     faithful and outstanding service; and\n       (3) extends its very best wishes upon his retirement.\n       Sec. 2.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol to the Treaty of \nFriendship, Commerce, and Navigation Between the United States and \nDenmark of October 1, 1951, signed at Copenhagen on May 2, 2001. I \ntransmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State with respect to this protocol.\n  The protocol will establish the legal basis by which the United \nStates may issue treaty-investor (E-2) visas to qualified nationals of \nDenmark, by supplementing the U.S.-Denmark friendship, commerce, and \nnavigation (FCN) treaty to allow for entry and sojourn of investors, a \nbenefit provided in the large majority of U.S. FCN treaties. United \nStates investors are already eligible for Danish visas that offer \ncomparable benefits to those that would be accorded nationals of \nDenmark under E-2 visa status.\n  The United States has long championed the benefits of an open \ninvestment climate, both at home and abroad. It is the policy of the \nUnited States to welcome market-driven foreign investment and to permit \ncapital to flow freely to seek its highest return. Denmark also \nprovides an open investment climate. Visas for investors facilitate \ninvestment activity, and thus directly support U.S. policy objectives.\n  I recommend that the Senate consider this protocol as soon as \npossible, and give its advice and consent to ratification of the \nprotocol at an early date.\n                                                      George W.

Mr. President, Senators and Representatives are now \nreturning to Washington, D.C., from their sojourns to their home \ndistricts. With the turn of a page on a calendar, the dog days of \nsummer draw to a close, and our Nation's Capital City returns to life \nfrom its annual slumber. The business of government is set once more to \nspring into high gear as the oppressive heat of August turns to the \ncooler days of September.\n  Many of those who carry out the work of the American people were \nfortunate to escape the worst days of the oppressive Washington summer. \nBut as policy makers return to their hectic schedules, we must remember \nthat there are many thousands of Americans on the other side of the \nglobe who were not afforded any relief from sweltering temperatures or \nallowed any bit of relaxation from their life-threatening missions.\n  There was no summer vacation for the 136,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, the \n34,000 soldiers in Kuwait, or the 9,600 personnel in Afghanistan. These \nAmericans sweated through all 31 days of August under their Kevlar \nhelmets and heavy bulletproof vests. Many had no opportunity to enjoy \nthe luxury of air conditioning or even a simple glass of ice water, for \nthey were kept on high alert during every waking moment watching for \nsnipers, booby traps, and assassins.\n  As the cost of our occupation of Iraq continues to grow, it is \nincreasingly apparent to the American people that the White House has \ngotten the United States more deeply involved in Iraq than the \nadministration's pre-war rhetoric would ever have led us to believe.\n  As of Friday, August 29, we have lost 282 Americans during the \ninvasion and occupation of Iraq, and nearly 1,400 have been wounded \nduring that time. The news today is of two more soldiers killed in a \nroadside bomb attack. The number of American lives lost is quickly \napproaching the total number of Americans killed during 1991's \nOperation Desert Storm, when 292 troops lost their lives to hostile \nfire and accidents.\n  The dangers of Iraq have shown no signs of abating. The August 19 \nbombing of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad claimed the lives of 23 \ninternational aid workers, and the August 29 bombing of a mosque in \nNajaf appears to have killed more than 80 worshipers.\n  Only a handful of Iraqi leaders who are pictured on the military's \nmost-wanted deck of cards remain at large, but the perpetrators of the \nattacks seem to be broadening their set of targets. It appears that the \nviolence is not just perpetrated by Iraqis, but that Iraq is becoming a \nnew stage for terrorists to strike at the United States. The top Army \nofficer in charge of ground troops in Iraq, General Ricardo Sanchez, \nspoke in July describing our occupation forces as a ``terrorist magnet, \nwhere America, being present here in Iraq, creates a target of \nopportunity.''\n  While the sons and daughters of America continue to patrol the \nshooting gallery in Iraq, progress toward bringing reinforcements from \nour friends and allies has proceeded at a miserable pace. For every \nforeign soldier in Iraq, there are nearly nine American troops. Other \ncountries with sizable militaries, such as France, Germany, and India, \nhave flatly refused to participate in the occupation of Iraq without a \nU.N.-authorized peacekeeping mission. Turkey, our staunch ally on the \nnorthern border of Iraq, has announced that it will delay a vote on \nsending peacekeepers until some time in October.\n  Does it really come as a surprise to anyone that many of our allies \nare reluctant to commit their own troops to the aftermath of a pre-\nemptive war, considering how the Administration tried to bully them \nduring our headlong rush to war against Iraq? While the White House was \nfuriously trying to twist arms in Berlin, Paris, Ankara, and Moscow to \ngain acquiescence to a war in Iraq, millions took to the streets to \nprotest the President's policy toward Iraq.\n\n  According to polls released by the Pew Research Center on March 18, \n2003, the day before the war began, opposition to a war in Iraq was at \n69 percent in Germany, 75 percent in France, 86 percent in Turkey, and \n87 percent in Russia. Yet the White House scoffed at this opposition \nand belittled the need to unify the world in confronting Saddam \nHussein. Could it be that our troops are now paying the price for the \nAdministration's bullheaded rush to war without the broad and active \nsupport of the international community?\n  But even if more international troops arrive under the \nAdministration's plans, Americans should not be lulled into thinking \nthat the threat to our troops will be over. Pentagon planners are now \nworking to divide the occupation of Iraq among the British, an \nunidentified foreign force, and U.S. troops.\n  It appears that this plan will continue to have American troops bear \nthe responsibility of patrolling the ``Sunni triangle,'' where the bulk \nof the guerrilla attacks have been occurring. Our men and women in \nuniform will continue to walk through the dangerous back alleys of \nBaghdad, Tikrit, and Fallujah, facing daily attacks. For so long as \nU.S. troops continue to carry the overwhelming bulk of the occupation \nmission in Iraq, our troops will remain overburdened and under fire.\n  Let there be no doubt, our troops are stretched thin. On June 24, \n2003, I requested a study by the Congressional Budget Office on how a \nprotracted mission in Iraq could affect our military readiness. In \nparticular, I asked how many troops our armed forces can devote to a \nlong-term occupation of Iraq, what stresses this might place upon the \nNational Guard and the Reserves, and what costs and risks may be \nassociated with the strain upon our forces.\n  The results of the CBO study, which will be released tomorrow, is \nquantified evidence that the long-term occupation is straining our \nforces close to the breaking point.\n  According to the advance copy of the CBO report that was delivered to \nmy office today, if we are to rely primarily on the active duty Army to \ncarry out the occupation of Iraq while maintaining our presence in \nKorea, Afghanistan, the Balkans, and elsewhere, we can only maintain \n38,000 to 64,000 soldiers in Iraq and Kuwait over the long term.\n  Even if the Pentagon takes extraordinary measures, such as depending \non large deployments of the National Guard and the Reserves and using \nMarines as peacekeepers, the CBO report estimates that we could still \nonly sustain 67,000 to 106,000 troops in Iraq for the long term. The \nannual incremental cost for a continuing deployment of this size, \nassuming that the security situation becomes stable, could be up to $19 \nbillion per year.\n  Some have suggested that the strain on our soldiers in Iraq could be \nrelieved by adding 2 new Army divisions to the existing 10. The CBO \nreport estimates that this option would cost up to $19.4 billion in \none-time costs, would add another $9.5 billion to $10.1 billion to the \nannual defense budget, and would take from 3 to 5 years to field those \ntroops.\n  The CBO report also analyzes how a large commitment of troops to Iraq \nwould affect the ability of our armed forces to respond to a crisis \nelsewhere in the world, such as a North Korean invasion of South Korea. \nNot surprisingly, the larger the commitment the U.S. maintains in Iraq, \nthe fewer troops we would have ready to respond to other threats. The \nstatistics contained in the CBO report prompts more questions about the \nreadiness of our military during a sustained occupation of Iraq.\n  The CBO also reports that our troop levels in Iraq will have to start \ndeclining by March 2004 if we hope to preserve readiness in our armed \nforces. Indeed, the Army has already drafted a plan to start rotating \nunits in and out of Iraq by that time. But this plan also anticipates \nthat foreign troops will arrive to take up the slack in the occupation \nmission created by a declining number of U.S. troops. So far, however, \nadministration efforts to line up countries to join in this mission \nhave been less than impressive.\n  That the White House failed to prepare the American public for the \ndemands of post-war Iraq on our troops is painfully evident.\n  Now there are rumblings that the administration may be ready to \nswallow\n\n[[Page S10989]]\n\nits false pride and seek a new U.N. resolution to encourage foreign \nparticipation in the occupation of Iraq. This would be a positive \ndevelopment, one that the administration should have embraced a long \ntime ago.\n  We have heard grandiose claims of international cooperation from this \nadministration before. On April 8, 2003, President Bush promised a \n``vital role'' for the U.N. in rebuilding Iraq. When pressed about what \nhe meant, the President responded:\n\n       When we say vital role for the United Nations, we mean \n     vital role for the United Nations in all aspects of the \n     issue.\n\n  Let us hope that reality begins to match rhetoric.\n  I sincerely hope that the talk of a rapprochement with the U.N. is \nnot more rhetoric or posturing by the administration. Our sons and \ndaughters cannot be asked to bear the heavy burdens in Iraq essentially \nalone. The report that will be issued by the Congressional Budget \nOffice tomorrow demonstrates that even our overwhelming military \ntechnology cannot offset the toll of maintaining a huge commitment of \ntroops in Iraq for the long haul.\n  We can no longer afford to deliberate on whether to put a formal \nrequest for peacekeepers before NATO and the United Nations Security \nCouncil.\n  Every day frittered away by the administration is another day that \nour troops will bear the staggering burden of the dangers of occupation \nvirtually alone.\n  Every month that goes by without more help from our friends and \nallies means billions more taxpayer dollars spent on our occupation of \nIraq, and most sadly, more grieving American families.\n  For the sake of the brave men and women who serve our country in \nuniform on the dangerous streets and in the back alleys of Iraq, the \nadministration should do now what it failed to do before the war. The \nUnited States must ask for the support of NATO and the United Nations \nto share not only the burdens but also the decisions regarding post-war \nIraq. That appeal must be genuine and must be made now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/02/senate-section/article/S10989-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TOMORROW AT 9:30 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
