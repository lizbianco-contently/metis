Mr. President, this morning the Senate will conduct a \nperiod of morning business for up to 60 minutes. Following morning \nbusiness, we will resume consideration of the class action fairness \nbill. Last night we had a series of opening statements, and therefore \ntoday we hope to make progress on that bill.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, the issue surrounding class action has been \nthoroughly debated before the Senate. This bill has bipartisan support. \nI continue to hope we can reach an agreement to consider relevant \namendments to the underlying legislation. I believe we should debate \nand vote on any class action amendments and allow the Senate to \nultimately vote on passage of the legislation after a fair time for \nconsideration.\n  Having said that, I am concerned about all the reports in the various \nperiodicals with regard to this bill being used as fly paper, as a \nvehicle to carry all kinds of unrelated issues. I just simply hope that \nwill not be the case and that we can stay on the bill with relevant \namendments. The legislation is too important to become mired down in a \nmyriad of completely unrelated issues. Therefore, I believe in order \nfor the Senate to pass the class action bill, we should reach an \nagreement as to how best to proceed. It is not my intent to cut off any \nMember's right to offer amendments; however, I do believe we should be \nclear that the amendments will be related to the underlying bill. I \nwill continue to talk to the other side to find a path by which we can \ncomplete this bill, and I will have more to say on the schedule \nfollowing the period of morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/07/senate-section/article/S7689-6", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF THE ASSISTANT MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Before the distinguished majority leader leaves the Senate \nfloor, I wanted to alert him and the two managers of the bill that \nafter morning business, we have a number of Democratic Senators, both \nfor and against the legislation, who wish to make opening statements on \nthe bill. I have six Senators who have contacted me, and the time they \nwill consume will probably take us until at least the noon hour on just \nopening statements on the bill. I have not heard from anyone else, but \nI wanted the managers to know that. I have heard--I am not sure this is \nthe case--that the managers are going to first look to a Republican to \noffer an amendment, and then how we normally do things is to go back \nand forth. There is certainly no rule that that needs to be the case, \nbut we do, after morning business, have a number of Senators who wish \nto make statements on this bill. Under what we have done in the past, \nthat certainly is appropriate. No one has taken an inordinate amount of \ntime.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am sure the managers will shortly be \naware of that. It is important that people are heard on a very \nimportant bill. We began the bill late yesterday, and we need to have a \nvery productive day today and possibly into tonight to continue \nprogress on the bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when the distinguished Presiding Officer \nmakes a statement as to our going into morning business, I would ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Lincoln be recognized on the Democratic \nside for 15 minutes and Senator Harkin for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on a matter of utmost importance to the \nnational security of the United States, I want to point out that it has \nnow been almost a full year since the identity of a covert CIA agent \nwas revealed in print by columnist Robert Novak. In fact, it has been \n359 days, 1 week short of a year. Next Wednesday will be 1 year \nexactly. It has been 10 months, exactly 285 days, since the Washington \nPost reported that a senior administration official said that two \n``senior White House officials called at least six Washington \njournalists and disclosed the identity of a covert CIA agent.''\n  We still do not know the identity of those ``senior White House \nofficials'' responsible for this destructive leak. It is simply \nastounding to me that as I stand here, the person or persons \nresponsible for destroying the 20 years and millions of dollars \ninvested in this agent and for jeopardizing the lives of other agents \nin the field could at this very moment still be exercising a senior \ndecision making role in this administration.\n  In late December, I welcomed the appointment of Patrick Fitzgerald, \nthe U.S. attorney for Illinois, as a special prosecutor to investigate \nthis matter. I don't understand why it took almost 6 months for this \nappointment to be made, but from all reports I have heard, Mr. \nFitzgerald has been conducting a very aggressive investigation over the \npast 190 days. But what I still don't understand is how this \nadministration can claim to be cooperating with this investigation when \nthe only public statement the President has made on this matter was to \nsay:\n\n       I don't know if we're going to find out [who] the senior \n     administration official [is].\n\n  Of course, that statement was an obvious wink and a nod to the leaker \nor leakers. The subtle message seems to be, don't worry. Sit tight. We \ncan stonewall this and get it behind us.\n  So while I welcome the investigation of the special prosecutor, I \nfind it hard to believe that the President and the administration are \nserious about getting to the bottom of this grave breach of national \nsecurity. If they were serious, they would have resolved this matter \nimmediately, without the aid of a grand jury, subpoenas, experienced \nprosecutors, polygraphs, and, most likely by now, millions of dollars \nof expense.\n  The President has never demanded answers from his White House staff. \nI remind my colleagues that the pivotal Washington Post article was \npublished on a Sunday in late September. On Monday morning, the \nPresident could have, and should have, demanded answers from his staff. \nHe could have, and should have, called his senior staff members into \nthe Oval Office, put them under oath, and asked them one by one if they \nwere involved in the leak of the CIA agent's name to the media. He \ncould have, and should have, laid down the law and resolved this matter \nimmediately. Indeed, that is exactly the way a President who truly \nwanted to identify the leakers would have acted. But President Bush \ntook no such action.\n  Instead, the President joked about the leak with reporters. Judging \nfrom his statements, he doesn't seem all that eager to find and punish \nthe people responsible. He said he has no idea whether the leakers will \never be identified.\n  The disclosure of the identity of the agent, Valerie Plame, as a \ncovert CIA operative represents an extremely damaging breach of \nnational security. In her 20-year career, we now know, she operated \nwith ``nonofficial cover,'' meaning she had no diplomatic immunity. \nEffectively, her only defense was a painstakingly created and \nmaintained cover. She worked gathering human intelligence, the kind of \nintelligence we have heard over and over since September 11, 2001, is \nso critical to fighting terrorism. She ran agents and worked closely \nwith other undercover operatives and contacts. These people were also \npotentially placed in jeopardy and exposed to danger by the disclosure.\n  One publication reported that after reading of her own blown cover, \nMs. Plame immediately had to make a list of all of the contacts and \nassociates of hers who could be in jeopardy. I only hope when Mr. \nFitzgerald discovers the identity of the leaker, that person is forced \nto see this list and be confronted with the full extent of their \nbetrayal--yes, betrayal--of this country and its citizens. That is what \nit is.\n  More important, Mr. Fitzgerald needs to discover how the information \non Ms. Plame's status came into the hands of these leakers, or senior \nWhite House officials. Is someone in the CIA responsible for \nidentifying Ms. Plame as a means of discrediting her husband, former \nAmbassador Joseph Wilson? Is someone in the National Security Council \nresponsible?\n  We cannot stop at identifying the individual or individuals who \nleaked her identity and her status to the press. We also need to \nidentify the person or persons who gave this classified information to \nthe leakers in the first place. This is about discovering those in our \nGovernment who have so little respect for the value of our intelligence \nassets that they are willing to use those assets as political weapons.\n  Both the President and the Vice President have been questioned by the \nspecial prosecutor's office in this matter, but almost a year after the \nleak we still don't know who is responsible.\n  Valerie Plame was a seasoned covert operator, we are told. She \nperformed the kind of human intelligence gathering that is crucial to \nour national security. So why was her identity compromised? Why was the \nidentity of a valuable intelligence asset treated so cavalierly and \nrecklessly by senior officials in the White House? Was it done as part \nof an ongoing effort to discredit and retaliate against critics of the \nadministration--especially anyone who dared to suggest that the \nintelligence used to justify the war in Iraq ranged from flawed to \nfabricated?\n  Let me recap. Since 2002, the administration's top officials, \nincluding Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, National \nSecurity Adviser Rice, and the President himself, have all claimed \nSaddam Hussein was actively developing weapons of mass destruction, and \nthat he tried to buy uranium from the nation of Niger. These claims \npersisted despite conflicting intelligence reports, including one by \nAmbassador Joseph Wilson. Ambassador Wilson, we later learned, is \nValerie Plame's husband.\n\n  Ambassador Wilson was sent on a fact finding mission by the CIA to \nNiger. After an investigation, he found no evidence to support the \nclaim that Niger had sold uranium to Iraq.\n  Still, the President made the Niger claim in his State of the Union \nmessage. A few months later, the New York Times published Mr. Wilson's \nop-ed piece, which questioned the President's assertion and indeed \nrefuted the President's assertion that Niger had sold uranium to Iraq. \nIt was after that--at least in this Senator's opinion--that in order to \ndiscredit and punish Wilson, two senior White House officials leaked to \nthe press the identity of Wilson's wife and the fact that she was a \ncovert CIA operative. In doing so they broke the law and undercut our \nnational security in time of war.\n  One day Ms. Plame was a valued human intelligence asset; the next day \nshe was political fodder.\n  What guarantees does any other intelligence agent have he or she \ncould not be next? It is not enough to find out who leaked the names; \nwe have to find out how senior White House officials were given the \nclassified information about Valerie Plame's status as a covert CIA \nagent. Who did this dastardly deed? Who betrayed our country and our \nintelligence asset?\n  It is not only Ms. Plame, it is all of the other CIA agents we have \nwho do not have diplomatic immunity and are operating undercover, \ncollecting human intelligence for the safety of\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\nour country. What is there to give them assurance they are not the next \nValerie Plame? What is there to give them the assurance they won't be \nfingered at some time in the future?\n  What happened here is not only confined to Ms. Plame, bad enough as \nthat is. It sends all of the wrong signals to our CIA operatives that \nthey could be next. Some future administration could finger them if \nthey disagree or if their husband or wife, brother or sister, or maybe \na friend, disagreed with official administration policy; they could be \noutted.\n  And what does it say to all of the contacts these people we have \ndeveloped and nurtured over years and years, in countries where their \nlives would be at risk if they were identified as giving intelligence \nto our CIA people? What assurance do these networks have they won't be \nuncovered similarly at some time in the future?\n  I have waited, and we have all waited to get answers; 359 days is too \nlong. One year is too long for this to drag on. It is time for the \nadministration to come clean. It is time for those who leaked Ms. \nPlame's identity to be identified and to suffer the consequences. It is \nalso time to find out who gave them this highly classified information, \nhow it was they came to have the name of Ms. Plame.\n  Only a thorough airing of this, only prosecuting those who were \ninvolved, finding out who gave this name to these people in the White \nHouse, making sure they no longer have positions, wherever they are, in \nthe National Security Council or in the CIA--only then will we send a \nclear signal we are not going to let this happen again. We must send a \nclear signal to those who would betray this country in order to get \npolitical retribution against somebody who disagreed with an \nadministration's position. Only then will we be able to send a clear \nsignal that these kinds of actions will never be tolerated.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator succinctly state what harm was done, or \ncould have been done, as a result of divulging the name of this woman?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his question.\n  Succinctly, what was done and what more could be done--Ms. Plame had \na number of assets and contacts, people in other parts of the world who \nwere giving her information valuable to our national security. These \npeople have been put at risk.\n  Mr. REID. And these people, I interrupt the Senator through the \nChair, did not know--her friends, neighbors, people around America--she \nwas a spy; is that right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct. As I understand it, she operated----\n  Mr. REID. And the people supplying her information certainly did not \nwant the world to know the information they were giving to this woman \nwas information being given to a CIA operative; is that true?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely. Their lives would be at risk, and their lives \nare at risk, I believe. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nevada, \nthat is the damage that has been done. But think about the damage that \nwill be done in the future if we do not resolve this matter. Because \nother CIA operatives who operate without diplomatic immunity, like \nValerie Plame, will have this cloud hanging over them. They will fear \nthat they, too, could be outed in the future; that their name could be \nmade public if their husband or wife or someone such as that disagreed \nwith official administration policy.\n  To me, that is the real damage. The leak has undermined the human \nintelligence assets we have developed over years and years. I am told \nit takes over 10 years of CIA training to develop a good covert \noperative such as Ms. Plame. There are over 10 years of training and \nseasoning and intelligence gathering before they are a solid source of \nintelligence. So when we think of that, we think about all of this \nthrown away because someone had a vendetta against Mr. Wilson, her \nhusband.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada, it was a vicious act, political \nintimidation and retribution, and I think it is a clear pattern that we \nhave seen over 359 days of coverup, concealment, and contempt for the \ntruth by this administration. It is time to resolve this issue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the time under the quorum call be \ncharged against Senator Lincoln to whom I, through the Chair, yielded \n15 minutes.

Mr. President, there is a lot of talk across this country \nabout the important issues in this Presidential campaign. Some people \nare going to try to define those issues on the floor of the House and \nSenate in the weeks ahead, but the issues in this campaign will not be \ndefined in Washington, not on Capitol Hill. Those issues will be \ndefined in homes across America where families will decide what is \nimportant, and they will listen to the candidates for Congress--the \nHouse and Senate--and those who are running for President and Vice \nPresident. They will listen to hear whether those candidates are \nresponding to their real concerns.\n  There will be an effort here to manufacture issues to try to divert \nAmerican families from their real concerns. In just a short time, I \nsuspect we will have this rush of proposed constitutional amendments \ncoming to the floor of the Senate. It is suggested one will be on the \nissue of marriage and one on the flag. Quite honestly, it is very \napparent why they are being brought to the floor. I personally think we \nshould pass one law--and do it quickly--which says no one can propose a \nconstitutional amendment in a Presidential election year, certainly not \nwithin 6 months of an election. Such proposals are automatically \nsuspect and clearly political.\n  In this case, the Republican leadership is going to bring \nconstitutional amendments to the floor in the hopes that they can \ndivert the attention of American families from the issues they care \nabout to some new set of issues. Why would the Republican leadership \nwant the American people to look at issues other than those they take \npersonally? Because, frankly, they do not have many answers to the \nquestions most families ask.\n  The families in Illinois and across America with whom I talk are \nworking families concerned about their inability to keep up with costs.\n  Not surprising, take a look at this chart as an illustration. What \nhas happened to real earnings over the past year in America? For \nfamilies, average weekly earnings have gone down, but for corporate \nprofits, they have gone up dramatically. There is a disconnect. We want \nbusiness to be successful. Of course, we do. Successful business means \nmore people working and more good jobs in America. But what is wrong \nwith this picture? Why did corporate profits go up so dramatically and \nyet working families fell behind so much? The obvious reason is because \nthere are elements in the budget of most families that are not being \naddressed in Washington.\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\n  What is causing this middle-class squeeze across America that is \nbasically denying families their weekly earnings? Why won't the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate and the House address the middle-\nclass squeeze? Why won't we address issues with which people are \nconcerned? Let's be more specific about what that squeeze consists of.\n  Look at this chart which shows real growth during President Bush's \nadministration. Average weekly earnings have gone up 1 percent since \nPresident George W. Bush has come to office--1 percent. What about \ncollege tuition costs? They have gone up 28 percent; gas prices, 28 \npercent. And here is one, this is the killer for business, labor, and \nfamilies: family health care premiums.\n  One can say to oneself: What in the world can Congress do about these \nissues that are raising the cost of living for working families? The \nanswer is, ``plenty.'' What have we done? Nothing, absolutely nothing.\n  What we have done, unfortunately, is to ignore the real issues facing \nfamilies. We have ignored the issues they are coping with on a regular \nbasis. College tuition costs: My colleague, Senator Schumer of New \nYork, when we were discussing tax cuts, said the most important tax \ncuts for working families and for our future include the deductibility \nof college education expenses.\n  Well, that is obvious. What do I hope for for my kids, for the kids \nof my colleagues, and for all who are following this debate? A chance \nfor a good education. What stands in the way? Well, certainly their own \nachievement--they have to do a good job in school to be eligible to go \nto college--but then the cost. My colleagues know what I am talking \nabout. How many college graduates today face college tuition costs \nwhich are absolutely crippling?\n  Senator Schumer and others said if we are going to talk about tax \ncuts to help working families, why do we not allow them to deduct the \ncost of college education expenses? We offered that amendment. It was \ndefeated by the Republicans. They said, no, the tax cuts should go to \nthe highest income individuals and they will decide what to do with \nthat extra income and they will ultimately help working families.\n  Gasoline prices----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield in just one moment.\n  Gasoline prices are another illustration. These prices have gone up \ndramatically in the State of California and in the State of Illinois. \nWhat has this administration done about it? Nothing. A cost to \nbusiness, a cost to families, a cost out of the bottom line of the \npaycheck people bring home, and this administration refuses to confront \nOPEC about fair gasoline prices.\n  Why do family health care premiums continue to be the No. 1 issue \nacross America, ignored by the Bush administration, ignored by the \nRepublican leaders in this Congress? Because the leaders in this \nCongress and the Republican Party refuse to confront the health care \ninsurance industries, the pharmaceutical companies, and those that are \ndriving up the cost of health care. Those special interest groups are \nsacred cows in this town, and because the Republican leadership will \nnot confront them, American families are being victimized by them.\n  These are the issues that families care about. They are the ones we \nare going to bring to this Presidential campaign, and they are the ones \nthe Republican leadership wants to ignore. They want us to rush off and \ndebate at length constitutional amendments that, frankly, are going \nnowhere.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague from California for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I came to thank the Senator for bringing out that chart, \nif he would keep it up there for a minute, and for making this point to \nour colleagues and anyone else who might be listening. It is one thing \nfor us to critique the administration and say they are not addressing \nthe real issues. When I go home, people say this administration cares \nabout everybody else in the world; there is money for everybody else in \nthe world; we are going to help everybody else; we are going to help \nthe people of Iraq. Fine, but they are going to have universal health \ncare and we are not? They are going to have their classrooms built and \nwe are not? And it goes on.\n  So what I believe our people want us to address is what is happening \nto them, and what my friend has done in a most eloquent way, as he \nalways does, is to point out this middle-class squeeze that is hitting \nour people.\n  These are the problems I care about. I say to my friend, we have a \nbill about reforming class action. I have taken a look at some class \naction lawsuits, and I have realized that is one tool to help middle-\nclass families who may be harmed by products that are not safe. So I do \nnot know why they are running off to do that and they are ignoring all \nof these other things.\n  I guess my question to my friend is, As we debate the Presidential \nelection and we have a point of view that this administration is \nignoring this middle-class squeeze, do we not find that happening right \nhere with the Republicans who are in charge of this Senate? Are they \nnot ignoring this middle-class squeeze? The best way to prove the point \nis what they bring up before the Senate. Are they bringing up anything \nto deal with college tuition and giving tax breaks to those folks who \nso desperately need it? Are they doing anything at all to help with gas \nprices, health care premiums, or prescription drugs, or are we going to \nface, after this class action debate, these constitutional amendments \nmy friend referred to that I have to say in all honesty and frankness I \nhave never had one person in California come up to me and say: Senator, \nthe most important thing facing us is gay marriage. That is just \nruining my life. Take that up. Ban it because that is what I think \nabout night and day. No. They tell me they are worried about paying \ncollege tuition; they are worried about filling up their gas tank; they \nare worried about not being able to afford prescription drugs.\n  So my question to my friend is, Could we not do more to implore this \nleadership to take up some of the issues that are really affecting the \npeople we all represent?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California for her question. The \nanswer is clear to all of us. This Congress, under the Republican \nleadership and this administration, has decided that the special \ninterest groups are more important than these issues that are facing \nworking families. They have decided that giving tax cuts to the \nwealthiest people in America is more important than giving working \nfamilies the deductibility of college education expenses. They have \ndecided that giving breaks to oil companies is more important than \nconfronting those oil companies and OPEC to bring down gasoline prices. \nThey have decided that the pharmaceutical companies and the health \ninsurance companies in America are more important, their bottom line \nprofits are more important than the cost of health insurance to \nbusinesses, to labor union members, and to families across America. \nThey have caved in time and time again to special interest groups, and \nthey refuse to listen to the real concerns of America.\n  That is why Americans are saying, by a margin of almost 2 to 1, that \nwe are headed in the wrong direction as a nation. They want leadership \nin Washington that responds to the real issues, the family room issues, \nthe kitchen table issues families face every single day. This \nadministration has refused to do it. Frankly, this Congress has refused \nto do it. They want to divert attention. They want to have the old \nsleight of hand. Let us talk about constitutional amendments. Let us \nnot talk about things that deal with the real issues facing families.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Illinois yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to my distinguished friend from \nIllinois, also the two constitutional issues, gay marriage and flag \nburning, no matter how strong someone may feel about each of those, \nwould the Senator acknowledge they have no chance whatsoever of \npassing, so we are not only taking up issues that may be secondary to \nthe vast majority of the American people, but also they have no chance \nof passing? All they are doing is bringing these up to try to satisfy a \nsmall number of people in this country to divert attention from the \nreal pocketbook\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\nissues the American people deal with every day. Would the Senator \nacknowledge that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Democratic \ntime has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Democratic time has expired, the \nChair has not properly advised the minority. I yielded 25 minutes this \nmorning to Senators Lincoln and Senator Harkin, leaving 5 minutes. So \nwhere has the 5 minutes gone?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Harkin asked for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. I should never step off the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Which completes the Democratic time.\n  Mr. REID. No problem. I should never step off the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that each side have an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my colleague from the State of Nevada, he is \ngoing to find out in the rollcall votes, in the ultimate vote, that \nthese constitutional amendments are not going to pass. This is a \npolitical grandstand. Frankly, we should pass a law that says a \nconstitutional amendment cannot be proposed within 6 months of a \nPresidential election. That is what this is all about. It really \ndemeans this great Constitution we have sworn to uphold that we are \nplaying games by bringing issues like the gay marriage amendment to the \nfloor of the Senate without even a markup in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Why? Frankly, it should not be done. Maybe one or two times in the \nrecent history of this body have we brought an amendment to the Senate \nfloor without a markup in the Judiciary Committee--I think Senator \nHollings, through unanimous consent, discharged a proposed \nconstitutional amendment from committee. So they are not taking it \nseriously. It is just a record vote to put Members on the spot and to \ntry to gas up the special interest groups that feel strongly on this \nissue. That really does not address the issues working families care \nabout.\n  If this Senate is going to be relevant to the people we represent, we \nought to speak to the issues they care about. Whether the people are \ncoming to this gallery or watching the proceedings by television, they \nknow what working families care about. It is the cost of health \ninsurance. It is the fact that one may have a dollar an hour more in \ntheir contract this year and do not have a penny more in take-home pay \nbecause health insurance has gone up. It is the cost of sending your \nkids to college. Your child works hard and has good grades, gets into a \ngreat college, and look at the cost: I'm sorry, you can't go to school; \nwe can't come up with $20,000 a year.\n\n  It is the cost of gasoline which is killing small businesses and \nfamilies alike.\n  These are issues we ought to be talking about and these are issues \nthis Republican leadership consistently ignores.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is also the cost of prescription drugs, I \nadd to my colleague from Illinois. I will tell you of the riveting \nexperience I had last week as I was doing townhall meetings in my State \nof Florida, where a senior citizen, a lady, broke down crying in the \nmiddle of a jam-packed townhall meeting as we were talking about the \nissues of the day such as Iraq. She said: I cannot afford a roof over \nmy head and the cost of prescription drugs. She said: I don't have any \nchoice; I have to provide a home. That means I cannot buy prescription \ndrugs.\n  Yet what did we do in this Senate? The Senator from Illinois and I \ndid not vote for the prescription drug bill because it said Medicare \ncould not negotiate by using bulk purchases, negotiating the price of \ndrugs down as does the Veterans' Administration.\n  It is inexcusable. It is unexplainable, except that it rewards \nspecial interest politics to the neglect of senior citizens and allows \nthose prescription drug prices to stay as high as they are so seniors \ncannot afford them.\n  Would the Senator reflect on that experience I had in my townhall \nmeeting?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Florida, he will hear the \nsame response in Illinois, in California, in Nevada, in South Carolina. \nPeople can't afford prescription drugs. They can't afford college \ntuition. They can't deal with health insurance costs. They can't deal \nwith these rising gas prices.\n  Here is the problem. We need to create a special interest group \ncalled Working Families in America. Wouldn't it be great if they had a \nlobby here? Wouldn't it be great if we walked out in that hallway and \nmen in three-piece suits and Gucci loafers were representing working \nfamilies in America? There are plenty out there for the drug companies, \nplenty out there for the health insurance companies. But this Senate \nand this Congress only responds to special interest groups and those \nare groups such as the pharmaceutical companies that have record \nprofits at the expense of consumers across America.\n  When are we ever going to address issues that real families care \nabout? If we are not here to address those issues, then, frankly, we \nought to just close up shop and go home, and I don't think we should. I \nthink we have a responsibility to stay here and work and make certain \nthat we deal with the issues real families care about instead of all \nthese special interest groups that come in.\n  Now they want to get rid of class actions. They have said class \nactions, that is a dirty phrase. We should not say that in America \nbecause the people who go to court and sue on behalf of a large group \nof people have no business doing it. They are frivolous lawsuits. They \nare unproductive.\n  Then take a look at those class action lawsuits. Those end up being \nlawsuits by consumers across America who may have just lost $100 \npersonally, but when aggregated turn out to be a large group of people \nwho have created a great profit for a company that didn't deserve it.\n  Those are ways that Americans speak to the issues that concern them. \nThose are opportunities which the Republican majority wants to silence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it has been interesting to hear some of our \nDemocratic colleagues this morning make the charge that the Republican \nleadership is somehow diverting attention from the real problems of the \nday by scheduling a vote on an issue which, when I was back home this \nlast weekend, was certainly on the minds of a lot of my constituents, \nand that is this question of whether judges in America are going to \nredefine what they have always understood to be their definition of \nmarriage.\n  To take 1 day, or perhaps as much as 3 days, to debate that issue and \nget that issue resolved in the Senate does not seem to me to be too \nmuch to ask, in terms of conducting our business.\n  With respect to the claim that it is diverting us from attention to \nthe economic issues that are of most concern to Americans, I have two \nresponses. First, Americans seem to be concerned about more than one \nthing. They are concerned about raising their families; they are \nconcerned about a good home for their children; they are concerned \nabout a good economic future for their children. All of these are \nwrapped up in the totality of the things that were expressed to me over \nthis Fourth of July break.\n  I don't think it is either fair or accurate to say there is only one \nthing Americans are concerned about and that is their economic future. \nBut to the extent that is an issue and it becomes an issue in the \nPresidential campaign this year, I think some facts are worth pointing \nout.\n  I realize that sometimes facts get in the way of arguments. One of \nthe main arguments of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle is \nthat this is a bad economy. The Democratic Presidential candidate has \ntalked about the Depression and the worst economy since--I don't know, \nHoover, I guess. But the facts belie that claim. So perhaps this \nmorning we should take a little time to discuss some facts, some actual \nstatistics, some reality about the economy and not just the economy in \ngeneral but the economy as it affects the average American.\n\n  On the question of jobs, one of the criticisms has been--originally \nthe idea was there was no economic recovery. Then the economic recovery \nbecame undeniable. Then the claim was\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\nit is a recovery in every sense except the creation of jobs. Then for \nseveral months in a row we began creating record numbers of jobs. Then \nthe argument became: But they are not really good jobs.\n  There are some people you can never please, of course. In an election \nyear, the party that is on the ``out'' has to criticize the party that \nis on the ``in.'' It is just that it is becoming harder and harder to \ncriticize the Republicans because the economy has rebounded so well, \nlargely because of policies that have been pursued by the Bush \nadministration.\n  Let's examine the specific claim about employment and about wages and \nabout what kinds of jobs Americans have and how the economic recovery \nis positively impacting the average American. Look at the June \nemployment figures, which are the latest numbers we have. They \ndemonstrate several things.\n  First, the quality of new jobs is rising. Nearly 80 percent of the \nnew jobs created in June were in industry categories that pay an \naverage hourly rate in excess of the overall average hourly rate in the \nprivate sector. So these new jobs in manufacturing pay a higher wage \nthan the average. The inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings have \nincreased 2.224 percent during the first 3.5 years of the Bush \nadministration, compared with only a .13-percent increase during the \nsame period of the first Clinton administration.\n  People say, What about disposable income? Not just wages but \ndisposable income. Per capita aftertax disposable income, adjusted for \ninflation, has increased 7.1 percent, since President Bush took office, \nwell above the 5.2-percent increase during the same period of the first \nClinton administration.\n  It doesn't much matter how you look at it, statistics in every \nrespect are superior to the Clinton administration statistics. They \nrepresent economic growth. They represent real return in terms of wages \nand inflation-adjusted wages for the average American as well as the \nAmerican working in manufacturing.\n  Since the start of the Bush administration, full-time employment has \naveraged 82.56 percent, nearly a full percentage point higher than \nfull-time employment during the same period of the first Clinton \nadministration. So, again, no matter what comparison you make, \nAmericans individually are better off today. It is not just a matter of \nthe economy performing better, but they are individually better off \ntoday in terms of employment, in terms of jobs, in terms of earnings.\n  In the past year, the number of full-time positions has increased by \nnearly 1.3 million. I mention that because some make the argument that \nsome of these are called ``McJobs''--a play on McDonald's--that they \nare just hamburger-flipping kinds of jobs. No. We are talking about \nfull-time positions. And I talked about manufacturing jobs earlier.\n  More than 81 percent of part-time workers in June indicate they have \nchosen part-time employment for noneconomic reasons. The point is that \nwhile full-time jobs are increasing, those who are working part time \nare primarily working part time according to their own testimony for \nreasons that do not have anything to do with economics.\n  I also mention the fact that temporary jobs in June represented only \n2.225 percent of all payroll jobs in the private sector.\n  I make all of these points not to suggest that we can't do better. In \nfact, the President has said we will not rest until everybody who wants \nto work can find a job.\n  When you look at some of the counties in Arizona, for example, in \nPima and Maricopa Counties where the employment rate is 4.1, 4.2, or \n4.3 percent, something in that order, and when you look at an area \nwhere there is a substantial amount of illegal immigration with the \npeople working in sectors that Americans have not wanted generally to \nwork, you can see this is the closest thing to full-time employment we \ncould possibly have in this country.\n  Let me give some more statistical data because part of the problem in \nthe debate has been claims by one side and facts on the other side. I \nknow that sometimes people's eyes glaze over when they hear too many \nnumbers, but the reality is that numbers tell the story here. They are \nlike pieces of a puzzle. They are reality. When you put them together, \nwhat they represent is not just a strong economy but an economy that is \nhelping individual families provide more income and more security for \ntheir work situation.\n  The employment data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nearlier this month demonstrate this strong job growth. In June, nonfarm \npayroll employment increased by 112,000 net new jobs. So far this year, \nnearly 1.3 million net new payroll jobs have been created, and over 1.5 \nnew payroll jobs since last August. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics' current population survey, which is the household survey, \nthe unemployment rate remains steady at 5.6 percent, which is well \nbelow the peak of 6.3 percent in June of 2003. In other words, more \nAmericans are working than at any time in the country's history--139 \nmillion individuals. I think that is a record we can be proud of.\n  I make this point: There is a certain sense in which talking down the \neconomy creates a psychology in the market and becomes a self-\nfulfilling prophecy. I notice there has been criticism in the past by \nMembers on the other side when Republicans have, during the Clinton \nadministration, noted certain problems with the economy. They said \ndon't talk down the economy, that it will have an effect itself on \nconfidence in the market and confidence among consumers.\n  This is what disturbs me about some of the rhetoric from the other \nside. Every measurement of the economy is improving and every \nmeasurement with respect to individuals within the economy is improving \nsubstantially and is better than the comparable times during the \nClinton administration, yet you hear people constantly talking it down. \nThere is a point at which this itself can have a negative impact.\n\n  I would like to quote from a Wall Street Journal commentary that sort \nof describes this phenomenon I am talking about. Here is the Wall \nStreet Journal:\n\n       Here's a quick primer on how to track an economic recovery. \n     When the media fret that the U.S. is heading for a decade of \n     stagnation like Japan, that means profits and investment are \n     picking up. When you hear that profits have risen but we're \n     stuck in a ``jobless recovery,'' businesses have started \n     hiring. And finally when a cry goes up that American workers \n     can find only low-paying menial jobs, that's the tip-off that \n     the economy is booming.\n       Congratulations, America. The return of ``McJobs'' rhetoric \n     signifies that an expansion is in full swing.\n\n  Of course, the Journal goes on to detail a lot of the statistical \ninformation I have been talking about.\n  By focusing on the quality of the jobs that are being created, the \npessimists are once again counting on the public to overlook the facts \nwe have been talking about here. As I have indicated, the facts \ndemonstrate that the U.S. economy is not only producing a steady stream \nof jobs, but the new positions are well paying and they are industrial \njobs. So whether you are talking quality or quantity, it is very hard \nto deny that this economic recovery is helping all Americans.\n  One of the concerns has been about manufacturing. There is no \nquestion that there are shifts occurring all around the world to an \ninformation technology kind of economy, and a lot of the old industrial \nbase of this country has been affected by that. But there are also some \nstatistics that I believe give hope with respect to manufacturing in \nthis country, which is still the No. 1 country for manufacturing in the \nworld.\n  In June, nearly 80 percent of the new jobs were created in major \nindustry categories which pay an average hourly rate in excess of the \noverall average hourly rate in the private sector of $15.65. In June, \n39,000 new professional and business services jobs were created in an \nindustry with an average wage of $17.38 per hour--11 percent more than \nthe overall average hourly wage; 19,200 new transportation and \nwarehousing jobs were created in an industry with an average wage of \n$16.50--7 percent above the overall average. In contrast, because some \nspeak about the leisure or hospitality industry where wages are less, \nthe average wage there is $8.86. That only accounted for 6 percent of \nthe new jobs created.\n  Again, for those who say there are new jobs being created but they \nare in\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\nthe lower paying categories and not in the industrial categories, the \nstatistics simply belie that. They say that is not true.\n  The point is, very broadly speaking, the employment figures in June \nare consistent with an upward trend of well-paying industries creating \nvaluable jobs, and this has been occurring for more than a year.\n  In June, the average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory \nworkers increased at an annualized rate of 1.2 percent, the sixth \nconsecutive monthly increase. Importantly, the growth in hourly \nearnings was broad based, with wages increasing in 9 out of the 11 \nmajor industry sectors and unchanged in 3 sectors since June.\n  Since the beginning of the Bush administration, real average hourly \nearnings--that means adjusted for inflation --have increased by 2.224 \npercent compared to the Clinton administration. In the first Clinton \nadministration, real average hourly earnings grew by only 1.3 percent. \nMoreover, in the 2\\1/2\\ years following the 1990-1991 recession, real \naverage hourly earnings fell .66 percent. So the current increase \ndemonstrates that earnings are outpacing inflation to the benefit of \nAmerican workers and their families--again, in sharp contrast to the \nClinton years.\n\n  Finally, using the broader measure of ``compensation,'' which \nincludes both wages and benefits, the earnings picture improves even \nmore. Between the first quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of this \nyear, compensation paid to workers in the private industry has \nincreased a total of 12.18 percent. Specifically, wages have grown by \n9.44 percent, and employment benefits, including health and pension \nbenefits, have increased by 18.98.\n  No matter how you look at this, individual employees are doing better \nin terms of the kind of jobs they have, what those jobs are paying both \nin terms of compensation and in terms of money, as well as compensation \nin terms of other benefits. There is no way to look at the economic \ngrowth and its impact on individual families and workers without seeing \nthe good news. As I said, the only explanation I have for pessimistic \ntalk is the reality of politics.\n  If you are going to try to replace somebody in an office, you have to \ncomplain about something. In this case, however, I think those who are \ncomplaining about the economy and are somehow suggesting that President \nBush and the Republican administration have not done enough to improve \nthe economy for working families basically have not been looking at the \nfacts. The facts have demonstrated quite clearly that this economic \nrecovery is helping a very broad spectrum of people in this country, \nfrom industrial jobs to all other kind of jobs.\n  Disposable income is another measure by which you can determine \nwhether families are better off--dollars left after taxes. Here is \nwhere the Bush administration has really made big strides because of \nthe tax cuts we passed, which some on the other side of the aisle would \ntake away.\n  In the first 12 quarters, the Bush administration's per capita \naftertax income increased by 12.5 percent, in large measure as a result \nof the individual tax rate reductions we enacted in 2001 and 2003 that \nwere part of the Bush tax reduction programs which he signed into law \nand is asking us to make permanent. With that kind of improvement in \nper capita income--this is disposable income, dollars left over after \nyou pay the taxes that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nought to be joining in making the tax cuts permanent and not that the \ntax cuts should be eliminated--per capita aftertax disposable income in \nreal, meaning inflation-adjusted, terms has increased 7.1 percent since \nPresident Bush took office. That is a significant improvement over the \n5.2-percent increase during the same period in the first Clinton \nadministration.\n  In a courtroom, I would say I rest my case. By every conceivable \nmeasure of how Americans have been affected by this economy and the \neconomic growth spurred by the position of the President and the action \nof the Republican House and Senate in support of the administration, by \nevery measure, Americans' lives have improved. We ought to count that \nas good news, whether we are Democrats or Republicans, regardless of \nwhat economic strata we are in. It represents the best in this country, \nthe opportunity we all have, the kind of idea that President Kennedy, \nall the way through President Reagan, talked about.\n  When the economy is improving, everyone in this country is better \noff, and we should be grateful. We should understand the causes. We \nshould support those legislative policies that represent those causes \nand not denigrate an economy which is helping the American public.\n  It is time to be a little bit more optimistic about our future. This \nis a great country. It is a great country because of the people who \ncreate the jobs and who do the work. We should give them a lot more \ncredit than some people on the other side of the aisle have, credit for \nhelping this country to become everything it can become for the benefit \nof American families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I will talk about good economic news, the \noptimism that my friend and colleague from Arizona has discussed. I \nhave always been a believer in looking at the cup half full rather than \nhalf empty. This cup is pretty full right now and is filling every day. \nIt tastes good to drink from it. There is good news out there and we \nneed to talk about that.\n  We used to have an expression that politics ends at the water's edge. \nWe did not allow debates between candidates to confuse the way foreign \npolicy was conducted abroad. There is something akin to that with the \neconomy. Certainly the issue of jobs and economic growth are \nappropriate for political discussion. No doubt about that. I worry when \nit reaches a point that the volume and nature of the debate is actually \nhurting the economy.\n  Maybe we have gone too far. So much of our economic activity is based \non the way we perceive the direction of the economy. Perception does \nhave some impact on reality. Those who try to shape the negative \nperception for political ends should reflect a little more on that. It \nis the political season, the Presidential race is coming up, but the \nvolume of negative statements in absolute denial of what is happening \nwith this economy is a little disconcerting.\n  I am concerned about those who are tempted to believe good economic \nnews is bad political news, and bad economic news is good political \nnews. We should be better than that. It reminds me of the Lutheran \nChurch in Minnesota that got their first female pastor. Some of the \nolder guys in the congregation were skeptical. They thought she would \nnot be able to preach. After her first sermon, they were very \nimpressed.\n  Then they said, Well, she will not work very hard. But after she \nbalanced the congregation's books, organized the church picnic, and got \nthe Sunday school on track, they were impressed.\n  Then they thought, Well, she will not relate to guys like us. Then \nshe asked if she could go fishing with them. They did not like the \nidea, but they could not say no. After a couple of hours on the water, \nthe pastor said: Guys, I need a restroom. A little annoyed, they \nstarted pulling up their line. She said: That's okay, and stepped out \nof the boat and walked on water to the shore. And one of the guys said: \nFigures, she can't even swim.\n  For those who continue to be skeptical about the progress of this \neconomy, I am beginning to think they would be discouraged even if it \nwalked on water. I read an estimate that the economy will grow at a \nrate of 4.8 percent this year. That sounds good. It would be the \nhighest growth in two decades. This is an economy that is carrying on \nits back a war on terror, the aftermath of September 11, the corporate \nscandals, the uncertainties of a Presidential campaign. The economy is \nnot just walking on water, it is running.\n  Economic growth is at a 20-year high. Work and productivity rose by \nalmost 4 percent last quarter and remains above its historic average as \nbusinesses continue to utilize technology in a more efficient manner. \nWe are increasing productivity at the same time. We are growing jobs. \nThe manufacturing sector on balance has grown since the beginning of \nthe year as factories have\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\nboosted employment to meet strong consumer demand.\n\n  Why do we have strong consumer demand? Because we cut taxes, because \nwe put more money in the pockets of moms and dads. And when moms and \ndads spend that money on a good or service, the person producing that \ngood or service has a job.\n  That makes it more likely, more profitable, easier for small business \nfolks to reinvest in their business. By cutting capital gains, \nproviding bonus depreciation, you increase expensing, opportunities and \noptions for small business. They invest in the business and they grow \njobs. The manufacturing employment index is pointing to an expansion in \nhiring.\n  The National Association of Business Economics, at its quarterly \nsurvey on business conditions, shows that 41 percent of the respondents \nexpect their companies to increase employment over the next 6 months, \nup from 34 percent 3 months earlier.\n  Consumer and producer confidence remains solid. In fact, consumer \nconfidence got a huge boost last week, reaching a 5-month high. \nConsumers are optimistic. The politicians who benefit, unfortunately, \nseem to think they benefit from bad news. They are the pessimists.\n  The reality is, this economy is moving forward. The consumers \nunderstand that. Unfortunately, my friends on the other side of the \naisle seem to find it difficult to accept that, difficult to admit \nthat, difficult to recognize that there is consumer and producer \nconfidence today. That is good for the economy. That helps grow jobs. \nThe housing market is strong. The national home-ownership rate in sales \nof new homes are at a record high.\n  My friend from Arizona talked about per capita, aftertax disposable \nincome; in other words, the amount of money people get to spend \nthemselves after they pay taxes. It has increased 7.1 percent. This is \nhigher than it was after the first 4 years of the Clinton \nadministration during this boom period that folks talk about. Last \nmonth, 112,000 jobs were added to the economy. In the past 4 months, \npayrolls have grown by almost 1.1 million, a pace of more than 3 \nmillion jobs annually.\n  It is fascinating that although the amount of jobs increased last \nmonth by 112,000, the pessimists will say that is less than what was \nprojected, as if that is a negative. Over 1.1 million jobs in the past \n4 months. I remind the pessimists that in every year of the job boom of \nthe late 1990s, it included at least 1 month where payroll growth fell \nbelow 150,000 and in a few instances it went even negative. This is the \nebb and flow of the economy. Everyone can forecast but no one can \nguarantee economic growth.\n  The trends are clear, the movement is clear. It is like you have a \nchance to do a little fishing over the break. You kind of watch that \nstream and it is moving in a direction. The economy is moving in the \nright direction.\n  There was an article printed in USA Today a couple weeks ago by \nformer Labor Secretary Robert Reich, author of ``Reason: Why Liberals \nWin the Battle for America.'' He wrote this at the request of the Kerry \ncampaign. What is the title? ``Gloom Is Reality for Citizens.'' Senator \nKerry talks about misery indexes. Robert Reich, ``Gloom Is Reality for \nCitizens.''\n  That is not the reality of what is happening in the economy today. \nPart of this discussion Reich talks about is saying, well, we have a \nlot of jobs. They recognize there is an increase--1.1 million jobs--but \nthey talk about the quality of jobs. They talk about wages that are \nstagnant.\n  If you look at, again, the facts--look at the facts, the facts, \nma'am, the facts--three-quarters of the new jobs created in May were in \nindustry categories that pay an hourly average rate in excess of the \noverall average hourly rate in the private sector. Inflation-adjusted \nhourly earnings have increased 2.3 percent during the first 3\\1/2\\ \nyears of the Bush administration, compared with only a 0.13-percent \nincrease during the same period of the first Clinton administration.\n  I mentioned before that the aftertax disposable income is way above \nwhat it was during the Clinton administration.\n  Then the pessimists say: Well, these aren't full-time jobs. They are \na lot of part-time jobs, but ``jobs'' they call it. Again, as I said \nbefore, three-quarters of the new jobs created in May were in industry \ncategories that pay an hourly average rate in excess of the overall \naverage hourly rate in the private sector.\n  Since the start of the Bush administration, full-time employment has \naveraged 82.57 percent, nearly a full percentage point higher than \nfull-time employment during the period of the first Clinton \nadministration. In the past year, the number of part-time positions has \ndeclined about 240,000, while full-time positions have increased by \nmore than a million.\n  More than 80 percent of part-time workers in May indicated they have \nchosen part-time employment for noneconomic reasons. Some people choose \nto work part time. But, again, the number of full-time jobs is \nincreasing at an all-time high. The number of unemployed is decreasing.\n  In Minnesota, a few months ago, the drop in the rate of unemployment \nwent from 4.8 percent to 4.1 percent in 1 month. That .7 percent drop \nwas the largest monthly drop since we began keeping records in over 20 \nyears. That is significant. Does that mean there are people out of \nwork? Absolutely. As long as one American is out of work, then we have \nto do something about it.\n  That is why, by the way, we have to pass the class action bill. It is \nbeing filibustered. That is why we have to pass an energy bill. It is \nbeing filibustered. That is why we have to get a highway bill through \nthis Congress. We have to get some things done, but we are moving in \nthe right direction.\n  And again, in Minnesota--back at home--the President's tax relief led \nto the creation of 7,200 new jobs in May. Over the months of April and \nMay, Minnesota gained almost 20,000 new jobs, leading to the highest 2-\nmonth gain in the last 5 years.\n  Both the construction and manufacturing sectors in Minnesota continue \nto improve. Construction employment grew by 2,200 in May, building on \nApril's 2,800 new jobs, and 1,600 new manufacturing jobs were created \nin May, while 7,400 manufacturing jobs have been created in the last 10 \nmonths.\n  The employment outlook for the third quarter for Minnesota employers \nis the strongest in more than 25 years; 30 percent of Minnesota \nemployers expect to hire more employees.\n\n  There is an article in today's Minneapolis Star Tribune talking \nabout: ``Analysts expect excellent economy.'' I will read from the \narticle:\n\n       The economy appears headed for a banner year despite a \n     springtime spike in energy prices and a recent increase in \n     interest rates.\n       In fact, many analysts are forecasting that the economy, as \n     measured by the gross domestic product, will grow by 4.6 \n     percent or better this year, the fastest in two decades.\n       There were strong 4.5 percent growth rates in 1997 and \n     1999, when Bill Clinton was president and the country was in \n     the midst of a record 10-year expansion.\n       But if this year's growth ends up a bit faster than that, \n     it will be the best since the economy roared ahead at 7.2 \n     percent in 1984, a year when another Republican President--\n     Ronald Reagan--was running for re-election.\n\n  A survey of top economists showed further optimism:\n\n       Ninety-one percent said they expected the economy to grow \n     at an annual rate of anywhere from 2 to 5 percent in the \n     second half of this year . . .\n       Forty-one percent said they expected stepped-up hiring in \n     the next six months . . .\n       ``By almost any measure--output, employment, profit \n     margins, capital spending--this economy is strong,'' said \n     Duncan Meldrum, the association's president and the chief \n     economist for Air Products and Chemicals Inc.\n\n  The reality is the economy is moving forward. More needs to be done. \nI do hope we get class action passed here. A report by the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers found that domestically imposed costs, \nincluding tort litigation, reduced America's manufacturing cost \ncompetitiveness by 22 percent in the world market. There is no doubt \nabout it, our legal system puts American jobs at a competitive \ndisadvantage with foreign firms. Money it has spent fighting frivolous \nlawsuits should be spent back in the business growing jobs and growing \nthe economy.\n  So instead of making speeches downplaying the positive economic \nnumbers, instead of casting about with doom and gloom, instead of \nwriting articles about gloom being reality for Americans, instead of \ntalking about misery indexes, let's celebrate what we have. Let's \ncommit to keep moving forward. Let's get the class action bill passed. \nLet's get the Energy bill\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\npassed. Let's get the highway bill through. And let's keep doing the \nthings we are doing. Let's make permanent the Bush tax cuts that \nincrease particularly the low and middle class, the per-child tax \ncredit, get rid of the marriage penalty, make sure we make permanent \nthe expansion of the 10-percent bracket, do those things that put money \nin the pockets of moms and dads so when moms and dads spend that money, \nthe economy grows.\n  If we do that, if we keep moving forward and we get some stuff done, \nand put the politicking aside, we put the election-year politics aside, \nand we put the doom and gloom and negativity aside, this country can be \nall that it is and all we know it to be: the greatest country in the \nworld, the economically strongest country in the world.\n  But we have to keep moving in the right direction. We are committed \nto doing that. Let's stop the pessimism. Let's stop the gloom and doom. \nWe have a job to do, and I hope we can work it in a bipartisan way, to \nfinish the work we need to do.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2062, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2062) to amend the procedures that apply to \n     consideration of interstate class actions to assure fairer \n     outcomes for class members and defendants, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are on the Class Action Fairness Act of \n2004.\n  Smart progrowth fiscal policy is helping lead job creation in the \nNation, and I am optimistic we will continue to see the improvement we \nhave seen over the last 6 months of last year. Economic reports show \nthe economy is continuing to experience growth but not in a manner that \nwould create an unsustainable boom/bust-type scenario. Indeed, \nemployment growth has been positive for the 10th straight month with \nthat report from June. In fact, 1.2 million jobs have been created \nsince the 1st of the year and almost 1.5 million jobs since a year ago.\n  As we all know from recent reports, consumer confidence is high. Last \nTuesday the conference board reported the largest monthly gain in \nconsumer confidence in years. Confidence has not been this high in over \n2 years.\n  In spite of all this positive economic growth and job creation, there \nare structural problems this body needs to address if we are to make \nsure our Nation remains competitive in the global economy. One of those \ncritical areas is the bill we are considering today. The focus of that \nbill is class action reform. Over the last decade, class action \nlawsuits have grown exponentially. One recent survey found State court \nclass action filings skyrocketed by 1,315 percent over the last 10 \nyears.\n  The result of this glut of claims is to clog State courts, to waste \ntaxpayer dollars, to inhibit the innovation and entrepreneurship that \nis so crucial to job creation in this country. Often all the purported \nvictims ever get in this sordid process is a little coupon. That is one \nexample. There are numerous examples we heard on the floor last night \nand yesterday. We have heard it in the past as we brought this to the \nfloor.\n\n  In Alabama, the court approved a class action settlement against a \nbank on the grounds they overcharged their clients. The settlement \ngranted $8 million in fees to the plaintiffs' attorneys, but awarded \nonly $8.76 to each plaintiff. Worse, the settlement deducted up to $100 \nfrom many of those plaintiffs' accounts to pay for the attorney fees, \nleaving some plaintiffs with over a $90 dollar loss versus the $8 \nmillion in fees to the plaintiffs' attorney. We have had numerous \nexamples that have been brought to the floor. It is not only large \nbusiness; it is small business as well.\n  Why do the small businesses get dragged into all of this? In order to \navoid going to Federal court, the class action legal team in many cases \nwill rope in a number of small local businesses as codefendants to get \nthe case decided in a favorable county or favorable State. Once that \nwindow during which the real class action target can remove the case to \nthe Federal court closes, that unlucky mom-and-pop small business that \nhappened to be in the wrong town at the wrong time is dropped from the \ncase, but not until they have spent considerable money defending \nthemselves.\n  These frivolous lawsuits are hurting the economy. They are hurting \ntaxpayers. They are hurting the justice system, and they are hurting \nthe practice of the law.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act of 2004 is a remedy to this problem. \nFor the sake of our Nation's economy and faith in our system of \njustice, I do encourage my colleagues to act in a bipartisan nature and \npass commonsense, meaningful class action reform.\n  As I mentioned this morning and yesterday, I want the debate to be \nfair and full on this bill. Over the last week a whole slew of \nunrelated, nongermane amendments have been brought forward. It has been \nwritten about. People have called the floor saying they want the \nopportunity to offer an amendment which has absolutely nothing to do \nwith class action reform.\n  We only have about 33 legislative days left. We have the \nappropriations bills to do and a whole range of issues to address. That \nis why when we take up a bill such as class action, we need to stay on \nthat particular bill and handle relevant amendments and debate them in \na fair and timely way. Relevant amendments can improve the underlying \nbill. I want this full and fair debate to occur, to achieve this goal, \nand to have the appropriate management tool by which we can consider \nthe relevant amendments. I will be offering a unanimous consent request \nat this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, with respect to the \npending class action bill, there be five relevant amendments to be \noffered by each leader or his designee; provided further, that they be \nsubject to relevant second-degree amendments. I further ask that, in \naddition to the relevant amendments, it be in order for each leader or \nhis designee to offer an amendment related to minimum wage, again \nsubject to relevant second degrees; provided further, that following \nthe disposition of the amendments, the bill be read the third time and \nH.R. 1115, the House companion measure, then be discharged from the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate proceed to its consideration, all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 2062, as \namended, if amended, be inserted in lieu thereof; provided further, \nthat the bill be read the third time, and the Senate then proceed to \nvote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate.\n  Finally, I ask that the Senate then insist on its amendment, request \na conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will object to this request.\n  We have only been on the bill now for a matter of a couple of \nminutes, literally. We just went to it this morning. The bill has only \nbeen laid down. This legislation has not been the subject of one \nhearing, one amendment in committee. There hasn't been any thoughtful, \ncareful committee consideration on this legislation whatsoever.\n  I am surprised and very troubled by the unanimous consent request \nmade by the majority leader. He knows the minority has been very open \nin expressing our interest in having a full debate about this \nlegislation, indicating from the very beginning that we will have \nrelevant and nonrelevant amendments. We have been the ones who have \nattempted to keep the majority on track with regard to committing to \nbringing the bill before the Senate at all.\n  As people may recall, there have been a number of occasions where the \nmajority has chosen not to bring up the bill, even though that was the \nregular order, and it was at our insistence time and again that we \nbring this bill before the Senate because we made a commitment to a \nnumber of our colleagues, even though I don't particularly support the \nbill, and I will get into that in a moment.\n  We would be denying the right of every single Senator to offer \namendments, in the truest tradition of the Senate, to say that now, \neven though this bill has not been the subject of any hearings, has not \nbeen the subject of a markup, even though this is the very first moment \nwe have had an opportunity to amend the bill, we are already going to \nsay to all Senators that you have to limit yourself to relevant \namendments.\n  We have said from the beginning--in fact, I said it on the floor and \nat a news conference again yesterday--that it is not our intention \nto filibuster this legislation. It would be our intention to work with \nthe majority to complete debate on this bill, with the understanding, \nof course, that we would have an opportunity to offer amendments.\n\n  This is not the way to get this legislation passed. In fact, I would \nargue that this is probably an absolute guarantee that it will never \nget passed, because we will never get cloture on a bill that denies \nSenators their right to offer amendments regardless of the subject \nmatter. So I strongly object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to clarify--because I know the unanimous \nconsent request was long--what was objected to were five relevant \namendments on our side, five relevant amendments on the other side, \nplus addressing the minimum wage issue on both sides, plus going to \nconference.\n  In light of that objection, I will modify the unanimous consent \nrequest to allow for 10 relevant amendments on our side and 10 relevant \namendments on the other side, again, in addition to the minimum wage \nissue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader knows \nthat it is not the question of numbers that matters; it is the question \nof relevancy. He is already violating his own request by suggesting \nthat we can do nonrelevant amendments on minimum wage. If we can do \nthat, why have any conditions about relevancy at all? We have already \nindicated our willingness to work with the majority to complete the \nwork on this bill. Nobody has any desire to filibuster, to artificially \nextend debate for an indefinite period of time.\n  The majority leader made a comment recently about the dwindling \nnumber of days. If he wants to finish this legislation, the only way we \nare going to do that is by working together.\n  The Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Massachusetts have a very \nimportant amendment having to do with temporary workers in this \ncountry. I think it is a critical debate. We have already agreed to a \nvery limited time. Why the majority leader would preclude the Senator \nfrom Idaho and the Senator from Massachusetts from offering this \namendment with an expectation that we can resolve it in a very short \nperiod of time is a question I cannot answer. But the majority leader \nhimself has said that, obviously, nonrelevant amendments have their \nplace on this bill. He is advocating two nonrelevant amendments as it \nis.\n  Let's get beyond relevancy and just recognize the importance of \nallowing Senators the opportunity to debate. I will commit to him an \neffort to try to resolve this legislation in a meaningful way and in a \nperiod of time I think could accommodate Senators, but also would \naccommodate his goal of completing work in the regular order.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the purpose of the unanimous consent \nrequest is simply to address the issue of class action reform, a \nbipartisan bill that does have support--not overwhelming but more than \n60 votes of support on the floor of the Senate, but to do it in such a \nway that we can consider one amendment at a time--a relevant amendment \non class action with the objective of taking this bill on class action, \nwhich we absolutely know will have an impact across this great country, \nin a positive way that addresses fairness and equity and improves the \neconomy indirectly, but in a fairly great way creates jobs--to stay on \nit and be focused on it.\n  I have offered 5 amendments on either side and then 10 amendments on \neither side, both with minimum wage. I would be happy to propound a \nrequest without minimum wage, if that would accommodate people.\n  I will keep it in for now. I will propound one more request to drive \nhome the point that we want to stay on class action with relevant \namendments that can improve or modify the bill. Right now, I am not \nrequesting any limitation on the debate. We can stay on it and consider \neach one. That is up to the managers. Let's have the relevant \namendments come through, but let's have an unlimited number of relevant \namendments on class action and finish this and get it to conference and \nalso include minimum wage.\n  Therefore, I ask the other side if they would be agreeable to an \nagreement allowing for unlimited--unlimited--relevant amendments, in \naddition to the minimum wage issue, and an agreement to go to \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will simply offer a counterproposal. I \nask the majority leader if he would be prepared to allow the Senate to \nconsider this legislation with 5 nonrelevant amendments and 10 relevant \namendments. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard, and it is your serve. \nObjection is heard in the Senator's capacity. Is there objection to the \nmajority leader's unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object, but I repeat the request that \nthe Senate consider 10 relevant and 5 nonrelevant amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor. Will the \nmajority leader modify his request to accommodate the minority leader's \nrecommendation?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would be happy to modify the request, and \nI object to the request. The purpose is to stay on the class action \nbill, to stay focused on it. I have already offered unlimited \namendments as long as they are relevant amendments, and that has been \nobjected to.\n  I am disappointed by my colleague's refusal to accept what I consider \na fair offer if our goal is to complete the bill. I do think we may \nwell be able to reach an agreement on the terms for debate on this \nbill. In the meantime, I will be sending amendments to the desk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3548\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Before I yield the floor, Mr. President, I want to make \nclear where we are. We are prepared to consider relevant class-action-\nrelated amendments. We are willing to set aside the pending amendments \nin order to make progress on the bill. However, we are not prepared to \nhave this bill become a magnet for every unrelated issue that is \nbrought to the floor. I encourage Members to come forward with their \nrelevant amendments. We can work on time agreements on those relevant \namendments, and we will allow the Senate to work its will on the issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time between now and \n2 p.m. today be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I modify that unanimous consent request to, \ninstead of 2 p.m., 2:45 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask, what is the majority afraid of? \nThis clearly is not a question any longer of time because the majority \nleader, in one of his many unanimous consent requests, proposed an \nunlimited number of amendments, as long as they are relevant. We can \ncome up with 100 relevant amendments to a bill this controversial and \nof this complexity.\n  Let's understand what we are doing. This is a sham. This is a sham. \nThe majority leader, for some reason, wants to deny his own caucus and \nthe minority the right to offer legitimate amendments in the Senate. \nThis may be the first time this majority leader has acquiesced to \npressures within his caucus to do this, and that is unfortunate. This \nhappened on many occasions in previous years, and I think if anyone \ntalks with those who have served in his capacity before, I think the \nlesson learned is that it was to no avail, and it was actually \ncounterproductive. It did exactly the opposite of what the majority \nattempted to do.\n  For us now to find ourselves in this situation seems a little bit to \nme like deja vu all over again. We have tried this, and it is going to \nbackfire on this majority and this majority leader, just as it has in \npast circumstances.\n  So let's be clear, this has nothing to do with finishing this bill. \nWhy, given all of our cooperation to get to this point, the majority \nwould try to shove this down our throats is unclear. But that is \nexactly how I perceive it. It is a sham. This almost guarantees this \nbill will not get done, and why they would want to do that is unclear \nto me.\n  We were prepared, as I said, to limit the number of nonrelevant \namendments and the time to debate in the interest of time. No one on \nthis side has a desire to extend debate indefinitely, but let's make \nsure everybody understands: I have to go home and explain to the people \nof South Dakota, if this legislation passes, why if in a case where 98 \npercent of the people who are adversely affected are from my State, the \naction occurred in my State, and was taken by, let's say, a corporation \nthat may be in violation of South Dakota law cannot go to court in \nSouth Dakota. That is basically what this bill does. Why should the \npeople harmed in my State, if 98 percent of those adversely impacted \nare from South Dakota, and if the law was violated in South Dakota, be \nforced to go to Federal court, a court that could be located in some \nother State, to resolve a serious legal question?\n\n  I find it amazingly ironic that those on the other side who claim to \nbe advocates of States rights would say, no; not in this case. In this \ncase, we are going to take away the rights of the States; we are going \nto put them at the Federal level.\n  There is a new trend happening on the other side. When it is \ninconvenient for States to have the power, they seem to find it just \nfine to move to the Federal level. That is what we are going to be \ntelling the people of this country. Forget about States rights, forget \nabout civil rights, forget about workers' rights.\n  This is special interest legislation at its worst, and it deserves a \nfull debate in the Senate, not the sham that we are going to have under \nthese circumstances filling trees. We have been through that. We have \nlearned the lesson the hard way. We ought to have learned it this time, \ntoo. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my good friend, the Democratic leader \nsaid: What are we afraid of? Let me answer the question.\n  Back on May 21, the distinguished majority leader was trying to make \nprogress on the Defense authorization bill, which we began on May 17, \nand our good friend from Nevada, the assistant Democratic leader, said \non May 21: I would say that we take about 10 days on this bill \nnormally. We don't think this bill will take that much time.\n  That was the Defense authorization bill, and on May 21, having been \non the bill five days already, our good friend from Nevada said it \ntakes typically about 10 days to finish the bill. We finished the bill \non June 23, almost a month later, having spent 18 legislative\n\n[[Page S7700]]\n\ndays on it. Clearly, what the majority leader is concerned about is \nthat this bill not only be taken up but that it be finished.\n  It is absolutely clear from the observations of our good friend, the \nDemocratic leader, he does not want the bill to pass in any event. In \nfact, he said on several occasions and repeated several times this \nmorning he is against the bill. It is clear what he would like to do is \nstructure a way of dealing with this bill that allows his party to get \nthe vote on all of its favorite issues and we never pass the bill in \nany event.\n  So the majority leader, to his credit, is trying to structure a way \nto proceed on this bill on the Senate floor that does two things: No. \n1, guarantees that it be brought up, and No. 2, guarantees that it will \nbe finished by structuring it in such a way that the amendments we deal \nwith are related to the bill. That is not an unusual request. It is not \nan outrageous request and not an unprecedented request--in fact, a \nnormal request.\n  So it is perfectly clear, it seems to me, that there are those on the \nother side and maybe even a few on this side who would like to use this \nbill for other purposes. The majority leader is right on the mark in \noffering this perfectly reasonable way, a game plan for taking up and \nfinishing this important legislation. I am sorry that at the moment, at \nleast, it looks as if there is not a will. Even though we keep hearing \nthere are over 60 Senators who are in favor of this bill, there have to \nbe 60 Senators in favor of the bill who are willing to also support a \nprocedure that guarantees we can finish it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have watched an unusual process this \nmorning that a good many of us in a bipartisan spirit are reacting to, \nand I am one of those who do not appreciate what the majority leader \nhas now just done. I understand why he has done it. I support the \nunderlying legislation, S. 2062, but I also recognize that Senators, \nunless effectively blocked by a procedural action that has just \noccurred, do have the right to offer amendments, germane, relevant, and \nnonrelevant.\n  I am bringing to the Senate floor one of those amendments. It is \nbipartisan. It has 63 Senators as cosponsors, and it is widely received \nby not only this body but by all of the communities of interest at \nlarge.\n  I have approached the leadership time and again, been as courteous as \nI should be to my leader but assuring him that I and the Senator from \nMassachusetts would limit the time, that this was not to drag the bill \nout, that we would expedite it because we believe, with 63 Senators, \nDemocrat and Republican, that this bill's time has come. It deals with \nimmigration. It deals with a near crisis in American agriculture at \nthis moment that now finds itself having to employ nearly 80 percent of \nits workforce as illegals, undocumented foreign nationals, in order to \nget the crops out of the field.\n  We should have learned our lesson post-9/11 that we have failed \nmightily at the border, that we have not effectively built immigration \nlaws that work. In a post-9/11 environment, we have learned there may \nbe between 8 million and 12 million undocumented--in other words, \nillegal--foreign nationals in this country. We ought to be expediting \nevery way possible to identify them, to do background checks on them, \nto control them first at the border and those who are in country in-\ncountry, and to build effective law enforcement tools, as some Senators \nand I are working on, to build a total package.\n\n  The reason I am bringing this amendment to the Senate floor is that \nits time is ready. Our time is limited because we have mighty few days \nremaining until the end of this session.\n  There are now 400 organizations and groups across America supporting \nthe legislation I bring to the Senate floor as an amendment today. It \nis S. 1645. We call it ``ag jobs,'' and it only deals with a small \nsegment--1.4 million to 1.5 million--of that total universe of nearly \n12 million undocumented, illegal foreign nationals in our country. We \nhave worked on the House side and the Senate side, Democrat and \nRepublican alike. We have spent 5 years crafting this legislation, and \nI am extremely disappointed this morning that we do not have the \nopportunity to offer it, that my leader has blocked me from doing so.\n  As kindly as I can say to my leader, ag jobs will be voted on this \nyear. As our side has recognized the need to offer the other side the \nopportunity to vote on minimum wage, this issue's time has come, and \nthis is an issue that I will stay on the Senate floor with and I will \noffer it unless the leader proposes in every legislation that comes to \nthe floor the strategy he has just handed out. That is not a way to \nallow this body to work and work effectively, and we know it.\n  He has been reasonable and our discussions have been substantive, but \nthere are some who do not want immigration as an issue voted on this \nyear. This bill is ready to be voted on. This bill has 63 cosponsors. \nIt has 26 Republicans, 37 Democrats. It is vastly bipartisan. It has \nbeen worked on for 5 years, and 9/11 now emphasizes the importance of \nus doing substantive immigration reform. This is a small piece of the \ntotal picture but a critical piece to a very important segment of \nAmerica's economy: agriculture. Yet we are suggesting now, by \ncontrolling our borders as tightly as we must, that we are creating a \ncircumstance that is driving some agricultural employers and producers \nout of business because they cannot find the workforce.\n  This fall, harvest should not rot in the fields of America, but in \nsome instances it might if a viable workforce cannot be found, or if it \nis not this body's will to send a message to the American agricultural \ncommunity that we are going to solve this problem and solve it timely, \nresponsibly, and appropriately.\n  We are not going to be allowed to do that today. Maybe tomorrow or \nmaybe the next day or maybe next week, but I say to my leadership as \nkindly and as responsibly as I can, before we sine die the 108th \nsession of the U.S. Congress, we will deal with this issue. Its time is \nnow. Its time is ready.\n  Let us--the Senator from Massachusetts and I--bring this to the \nSenate floor, get a limited amount of time to deal with it and adequate \ntime for those to come to the floor of the Senate to discuss it, to \noppose or to support it. That is what a responsible, deliberative body \ndoes, and that is what we must do in this instance.\n  So I hope that at some point the message I am delivering at this \nmoment registers with my leadership that we will vote on this issue \nthis year. It is important that we do so and send a message to the most \ncritical segment of our economy that we are going to work with them to \nget legal employees, that we are going to legalize a process, control a \nprocess, do the background checks, get the bad actors out of the system \ninstead of simply turning our back again and again.\n\n  Our President wants reform. He has spoken openly and boldly about it. \nIt is important we bring this reform. I agree with my President. Its \ntime has come. Let us deal with it.\n  I will be back on the Senate floor today, tomorrow, next week, or the \nbalance of this month, until this issue is debated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate, and I \nwould first like to respond to the concerns raised by some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle about the majority leader's \ndecision to fill the amendment tree. First, I commend the leader for \ntaking this unfortunately necessary step because it significantly \nminimizes the mischief that will in all certainty occur if this bill is \nleft open to amendments that have absolutely nothing to do with the \nsubject of class action.\n  These are amendments that are offered to score political points in an \nelection year and that, at the end of the day, will obliterate any \nchances that class action reform will become law. That is exactly what \nis involved, and we all know it. We know that if some of these \namendments are added to this bill, it will kill the bill.\n  We thought we had an agreement last November, of 62 people. As I have \nalways interpreted it, when you get an agreement to support a bill, \nthat means support it against all amendments unless those who made the \nagreement agree otherwise. My colleagues on the other side say that was\n\n[[Page S7701]]\n\nnot the agreement. That has been the agreement every time around here, \nwhere you know that mischief is going to occur and we just continue on \nand on.\n  By filling the tree, the leader has effectively protected key \nbipartisan legislation from the same procedural pitfalls that faced the \nDOD authorization bill, FSC/ETI, and the Internet tax bill, just to \nname a few.\n  To be sure, the current move to protect the bill from nonrelevant or \nnongermane amendments is nothing new, as former majority leaders have \ninvoked this prerogative with other important pieces of legislation in \nthe past. The ranking member from Vermont even admitted on the floor \nlast night that S. 2062 was probably the last amendable vehicle to be \nconsidered by the Senate this year. While this bill has legs to move \nout of the Senate--that is why it is the last amendable bill in his \neyes--I can assure you it will go nowhere if it is bogged down with \nextraneous amendments that peel votes in the Senate.\n  That is the game here and everybody knows it. Everybody on the \noutside should know it, too. We made a deal; we had 62 people agree to \nthe language in this amendment. Now we have people peeling off from the \nlanguage in this amendment by wanting to be able to vote for nongermane \nand nonrelevant amendments which will kill the bill.\n  Assuming the bill goes out of the Senate with controversial \namendments, what is going to happen in the House after they alter the \nbill? I seriously doubt we will have enough time this year to resolve \ndifferences in conference. Indeed, I think the chances are pretty slim, \nespecially since the minority leader has threatened to oppose the \nappointment of conferees for the rest of the year.\n  How do we get it done if we put nonrelevant amendments on this very \nimportant bill that we have worked on for 6 years to get to this point? \nA lot of decent people on both sides have worked very hard, but we know \nwe are going to have to have 60 votes to vote on this bill.\n  The minority leader himself has threatened to oppose the appointment \nof conferees for the rest of the year. How do you get this bill if \nthese nongermane, nonrelevant amendments are added? It is apparent some \nof them might be. Even if you could, how do you get it by the House? \nEven if you get it by the House, how do you get it by the conference?\n  Then, when those amendments are taken off, also if they were taken \noff in conference--assuming we would be given the privilege of being \nable to hold a conference, something that has not been denied to my \nrecollection before this year--we may not have time to get this bill \ndone anyway.\n  S. 2062 embodies the bipartisan deal we reached in good faith last \nNovember, Democrats and Republicans, 62 of us reached in good faith. We \nreached a compromise because I thought the end goal was to get a class \naction bill passed into law. I can say, in all certainty, that my \nagreement to further moderate this bill was certainly not premised on \nletting it become a Christmas tree for unrelated measures so people can \nscore political points on the floor of the Senate--people who never \nwould vote for this bill to begin with.\n\n  If the supporters of the underlying bill really want class action \nreform, I see no reason why they should not support the leader's \naction. No one is denying Members from offering amendments that are \ngermane to the bill, although I would recommend we even vote those down \nunless the people who agreed in a bipartisan way agree to allow those \namendments to pass. That is what we usually do on legislation around \nhere. But now we have all new rules here that suddenly spring up.\n  No one is denying Members from offering amendments that are germane \nto the bill, amendments that Members, in their view, believe will \nimprove the bill. If they will, we can agree on those. I see no reason \nwhy we cannot give these amendments an up-or-down vote. In fact, the \nleader explicitly made this offer to the other side when he tendered a \ntime agreement to consider several key amendments, including a vote, a \nvote on a nongermane, nonrelevant amendment, Senator Kennedy's \namendment on the minimum wage measure which he has been trying to get \nup for quite a while. That is how far the majority leader went. But, \nno, they want a lot of other buzz amendments that are political in \nnature, that they think they can pass, that will kill this bill. \nAnybody with brains knows the game.\n  This was a good-faith offer by the leader. We have heard for some \ntime how important a minimum wage amendment is to my colleagues and to \nthe country. I don't know of anybody on our side objecting to \nconsideration of the minimum wage amendments and any amendment also to \nit. What we do object to is a never-ending moving of the goalposts \nwhere more and more amendments are added, especially nongermane and \nnonrelevant amendments.\n  Because the Democrats objected to this very generous unanimous \nconsent request, the leader had no choice other than to protect the \nclass action bill from this open season of political amendments that \nwill kill it anyway.\n  That is what it comes down to. Either we are going to vote for this \nclass action bill, the 62 of us who have agreed it should pass--and I \nthink more would vote for it in the end--or it is going to be killed. \nBecause that is the choice. We made a deal last November to pass class \naction reform and that is the direction our leader is taking us today.\n  When it comes to nongermane amendments that appear to be offered to \nscore political points in an election year, I want no part of that on \nthis bill, and neither does the leader, and for good reason. We know \nthe games around here.\n  There are a significant number of Democrats who do not want this bill \nunder any circumstances because the No. 1 hard money funder to \nDemocrats happens to be the personal injury lawyers in this country. \nThe No. 1 funder of the Presidential campaign happens to be personal \ninjury lawyers in this country, for the Democrats. The No. 1 opponents \nagainst this bill happen to be some of the personal injury lawyers. Not \nall, because the really good lawyers can go to Federal court and get \nbig verdicts. They don't have to have false mechanisms to be able to \nget good verdicts on behalf of their clients. They don't have to play \ngames with magnet courts that are, if not corrupt, so close to being \ncorrupt in some of these special jurisdictions in this country where \nthey have had a field day.\n  Regarding the jurisdictional test in S. 2060, the minority leader \nmade the point they cannot get their cases tried in South Dakota if \nthis bill passes. That is total poppycock. You know, the jurisdictional \ntest in S. 2062 moves only larger interstate class actions to Federal \ncourt, including large cases where there are more than 100 class \nmembers and more than $5 million in amount in controversy.\n\n  If they fit that jurisdictional category, then they will have to go \nto Federal court. But as somebody has tried a lot of cases in both \nFederal and State courts, I have to say we used to love to get to \nFederal court because people know it is a more important case. The \nreason some of these attorneys want to go to some of these State \ncourts, such as Madison County, is that is where it is a field day for \nplaintiffs' lawyers whether they have a good case or not--and they know \nit, and they have been milking this system and hurting people all over \nthis country in ways that are unseemly and, frankly, wrong. S. 2062 \nalso has exceptions to keep local controversies in State courts. We \nhave these exceptions.\n  To make a long story short, I have heard my colleagues on the other \nside--some of the people who have agreed to be cosponsors of this bill, \nwho have agreed to be in the 62 who have supported this bill which \nwould make up enough to be able to invoke cloture on this bill--now \nmoaning and groaning they want a right to bring up nonrelevant, \nnongermane, political amendments to score points. That is not the way I \nhave operated around here, and that is not the way most Senators have \noperated around here, but that is what we are faced with here.\n  Either we are going to invoke--probably we will have to file cloture \nin order to end another filibuster. I hope the 62 people who said they \nwould be for this bill will vote for cloture. If they are not, then \nthis bill is going to be dead and 6 years of honest work, 6 years of \nbipartisan effort, is going to go right down the drain.\n\n[[Page S7702]]\n\n  We all know what the game is around here. It is by those who have \nnever wanted this bill to pass anyway, some who want to play both sides \non this thing, who basically want to have the right to foul up the bill \nwith amendments they know the House won't take and they know if we have \nto go to conference we are probably not going to be able to get \nconferees.\n  That is what is involved, and it is a game. It is a bad game at that. \nI have been known to stand up for the trial lawyers when they are \nright. I have taken a lot of grief for it from some people on our side \nwho are wrong, too. I am going to stand up for them when they are right \nbecause trial lawyers do a lot of good in our society when they stand \nup and fight for those who are downtrodden and not treated properly in \nour society.\n  What has been going on for years in this area is the abysmally \ndishonest forum shopping to local areas where they can get huge \nverdicts that shouldn't be gotten because they don't get them in their \nown jurisdiction. That is wrong. I think a lot of trial lawyers are \nstarting to get upset about it because it is giving all trial lawyers a \nbad name because of the few who milk the system like this to the \ndetriment of consumers, to the detriment of the little people, to the \ndetriment of those who can't make it. That is what is involved, and \neverybody knows it.\n  To play this political game and bring up nongermane and nonrelevant \namendments that we know will kill this bill is a terrible thing.\n  All I can say is there comes a time when you have to vote. There \ncomes a time when you have to stand up and do what you said you would \ndo. If you do not do it, then shame on you. All I can say is, that is \nwhat is involved, and anybody who says otherwise, it seems to me, is \nwrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my distinguished friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky, who is my counterpart, indicated that on May 20 or 21--I \nindicated at that time publicly that we could finish the Defense \nauthorization bill in 10 more days. He didn't go on to say that is what \nwe did. That really is not quite true. We took 11 days. So my statement \nwas 1 day off. Of course, it was interrupted by President Reagan's \nfuneral and a few other things. When we came here and we told the \nmajority they could finish the Defense authorization bill in 10 days, \nwe were 1 day off. So no one should make a big deal out of the fact \nthat the time was more than 10 days because, unfortunately, President \nReagan died.\n  I want the record to be spread with the fact that I am a trial \nlawyer. I am a proud trial lawyer. I graduated from law school, and I \nwent back to Nevada and tried lots of cases. I have had over 100 jury \ntrials. I have tried murder cases, and I have tried robbery cases. \nThere was a period of about 4 years of my life where I defended \ninsurance companies. I have tried cases as a plaintiff's attorney in \nslip-and-fall cases. I have tried automobile accident cases where some \npeople were injured severely and some were killed. I have done \nliability litigation. I did an antitrust case, and I didn't know enough \nabout it. Shell oil company drowned me with depositions all over the \ncountry. I settled for a fraction of what it was worth. That was the \nlast antitrust case I took. But I took one in San Francisco with \ncocounsel who knew what he was doing in my first antitrust case.\n  I have never done a class action lawsuit. But there are attorneys who \nspecialize in class action lawsuits. Are these people who specialize in \nthese lawsuits a bunch of bums who are cheating the system and doing \nillegal things?\n\n  As my friend from Utah has said, it may not be fraud, but it is close \nto it--or words to that effect.\n  Lets talk about a few issues that I know of which were class action \nlawsuits. A lot of us have had the experience of receiving a telephone \nbill when we didn't sign up with AT, but they are on our bill. It is \ncalled ``slamming.'' They put their product on your bill without your \npermission. People had to pay these bills. We didn't do anything \nlegislatively to stop it. An attorney filed a class action against AT \nsaying don't do that. Why? Because people were being charged $8 to $10 \na month for a product they didn't ask for. This was stopped as a result \nof a class action lawsuit. They were enjoined from doing it and had to \npay the people they cheated with actual dollars.\n  One of the great movies I watched--because it was true--was called \n``Erin Brockovich.'' Erin Brockovich--just to recount what she did, for \nlack of a better word--was a paralegal but not one who was really \ntrained to be a good paralegal. But she was trained and wanted to go \nhelp people. She went around and dug up information like one of the \nsleuths you hear about in a good mystery novel, or watch on \ntelevision--a private detective. She went around and did some sleuthing \nand came out with the fact that the ground water was being contaminated \nwith pollutants from a company. She got a friend, a lawyer of hers, to \nfile a lawsuit, and sure enough they won. They found the ground water \nwas being contaminated.\n  As a result of this class action lawsuit, Erin Brockovich became a \nhero. People had been killed as a result of this company, and no one \nelse had to die or become sick.\n  That was a class action lawsuit. Is there anything wrong with that? I \nthink not.\n  We all know all about the big tobacco cases. A lot of people do not \nknow about a tobacco company that started advertising a light \ncigarette, and you smoked as much as you wanted--no problem. That was \nthe advertising. They were lying. They were cheating. It wasn't true. \nHow was that resolved? We didn't stop it here in the National \nLegislature. It was stopped as a result of a class action that was \nfiled. Sure enough, light cigarettes were gone.\n  Lots of environmental cases have been decided by class actions. \nCompanies were doing awful things to the environment, and people asked \nabout the detriment being created. They went to the Government, and the \nGovernment did nothing. As a last resort, who do you go to? You go to a \nlawyer.\n  We have a big class action pending now--Wal-Mart, big, fat Wal-Mart. \nThe initial evidence indicates that they have been discriminating \nagainst women from the day they became a company. There is a big class \naction lawsuit against Wal-Mart. We didn't do anything about it here \nlegislatively. But this class action lawsuit, I have been told, is \nalmost a slam dunk--that Wal-Mart is going to lose that and the women \nthey have discriminated against will be made whole.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Not right now. I will finish my statement. I know my friend \nis an avid supporter of this legislation. I admire him. We came to \nCongress together. I am going to finish my statement. I have been \nwaiting 2 days to do this, and I want to finish my question.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. CARPER. The Senator raises the question of the issue of the class \naction case against Wal-Mart. The class action has been certified so it \ncan go forward. Does the Senator know whether it was certified in \nFederal court or State court or county court?\n  Mr. REID. I don't know. I talked to some attorneys today involved \nwith the case. I did not ask them that.\n  Mr. CARPER. It has been certified in Federal court in California.\n  Mr. REID. I ask a question to my friend, certified in State or \nFederal court?\n  Mr. CARPER. Federal court.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend asking the question \nwhich, as far as I am concerned, at this stage is meaningless.\n  Class action is an important part of our legal system. It has done a \ngreat deal to help people work their way through the process. The fact \nthat I as a trial lawyer have not taken a class action lawsuit does not \nmean I didn't like class action litigation. It is a specialty. As with \nthe example I gave dealing with antitrust litigation, you better know \nwhat you are doing before you get into the class action litigation.\n  We all know what took place with tobacco litigation. Attorneys \ngeneral from all over America joined in that. The State of Nevada has \nbenefited from that class action litigation dealing with tobacco. We \nhave a program a Republican Governor in the State of Nevada initiated \nthat is very popular. It\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\nis called the Millennial Scholarships. If you graduate from a Nevada \nhigh school--any place in Nevada; there are 17 counties--with good \ngrades, you get to go to school with your tuition paid for by tobacco.\n  That is what this is all about. It is about people having the \nopportunity to go forward with litigation, when normally these people \nwould be totally unprotected. When we do things legislatively, it is \nrare that people who have been harmed get their money back. That is an \neffect of class action.\n  As we speak about attorneys general, I received in my office \nyesterday a letter from the attorney general of the State of New York. \nI have never met Eliot Spitzer. I know him by reputation. He is one of \nAmerica's great attorneys general. The State of New York has been--I \ndon't want to say ``blessed,'' but for lack of a better word, New York \nhas received a great deal from that man who has taken on big companies, \nto his detriment on many occasions. We have a letter from him sent to \nSenator Frist and Senator Daschle. The letter is three pages long. I \nask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         State of New York, Office of the Attorney General, The \n           Capitol,\n                                        Albany, NY, June 22, 2004.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader and Mr. Minority Leader: On behalf \n     of the Attorneys General of California, Illinois, Iowa, \n     Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New \n     Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Vermont, and West Virginia, we \n     are writing in opposition to S. 2062, the so-called ``Class \n     Action Fairness Act,'' which reportedly will be scheduled for \n     a vote in the next few weeks. Although S. 2062 has been \n     improved in some ways over similar legislation considered \n     last year (S. 274), it still unduly limits the right of \n     individuals to seek redress for corporate wrongdoing in their \n     state courts. We therefore strongly recommend that this \n     legislation not be enacted in its present form.\n       As you know, under S. 2062, almost all class actions \n     brought by private individuals in state court based on state \n     law claims would be forced into federal court, and for the \n     reasons set forth below many of these cases may not be able \n     to continue as class actions. All Attorneys General \n     aggressively prosecute violations of our states' laws through \n     public enforcement actions filed in state court. Particularly \n     in these times of state fiscal constraints, class actions \n     provide an important ``private attorney general'' supplement \n     to our efforts to obtain redress for violations of state \n     consumer protection, civil rights, labor, public health and \n     environmental laws.\n       We recognize that some class action lawsuits in state and \n     federal courts have resulted in substantial attorneys' fees \n     but minimal benefits to the class members, and we support \n     targeted efforts to prevent such abuses and preserve the \n     integrity of the class action mechanism. However, S. 2062 \n     fundamentally alters the basic principles of federalism, and \n     if enacted would result in far greater harm than good. It \n     therefore is not surprising that organizations such as AARP, \n     AFL-CIO, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, \n     Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NAACP and Public \n     Citizen all oppose this legislation in its present form.\n       1. Class Actions Should Not Be ``Federalized''.\n       S. 2062 would vastly expand federal diversity jurisdiction, \n     and thereby would result in most class actions being filed in \n     or removed to federal court. This transfer of jurisdiction in \n     cases raising questions of state law will inappropriately \n     usurp the primary role of state courts in developing their \n     own state tort and contract laws, and will impair their \n     ability to establish consistent interpretations of those \n     laws. There is no compelling need for such a sweeping change \n     in our long-established system for adjudicating state law \n     issues. Indeed, by transferring most state court class \n     actions to an already overburdened federal court system, this \n     bill will delay (if not deny) justice to substantial numbers \n     of injured citizens. The federal judiciary faces a serious \n     challenge in managing its current caseload, and thus it is no \n     surprise that the Judicial Conference of the United States \n     has opposed the ``federalization'' of class action \n     litigation.\n       S. 2062 is fundamentally flawed because under this \n     legislation, most class actions brought against a defendant \n     who is not a ``citizen'' of the state will be removed to \n     federal court, no matter how substantial a presence the \n     defendant has in the state or how much harm the defendant has \n     caused in the state. While the amendments made last fall give \n     the federal judge discretion to decline jurisdiction in some \n     cases if more than one-third of the plaintiffs are from the \n     same state, and place additional limitations on the exercise \n     of federal court jurisdiction if more than two-thirds of the \n     plaintiffs are from a single state, even in those \n     circumstances there are additional hurdles that frequently \n     will prevent the case from being heard in state court.\n       2. Many Multi-State Class Actions Cannot Be Brought in \n     Federal Court.\n       Another significant problem with S. 2062 is that many \n     federal courts have refused to certify multi-state class \n     actions because the court would be required to apply the law \n     of different jurisdictions to different plaintiffs--even if \n     the laws of those jurisdictions are very similar. Thus, cases \n     commenced as state class actions and then removed to federal \n     court may not be able to be continued as class actions in \n     federal court.\n       In theory, injured plaintiffs in each state could bring a \n     separate class action lawsuit in federal court, but that \n     defeats one of the main purposes of class actions, which is \n     to conserve judicial resources. Moreover, while the \n     population of some states may be large enough to warrant a \n     separate class action involving only residents of those \n     states, it is very unlikely that similar lawsuits will be \n     brought on behalf of the residents of many smaller states. We \n     understand that Senator Jeff Bingaman will be proposing an \n     amendment to address this problem, and that amendment should \n     be adopted.\n       3. Civil Rights and Labor Cases Should Be Exempted.\n       Proponents of S. 2062 point to allegedly ``collusive'' \n     consumer class action settlements in which plaintiffs' \n     attorneys received substantial fee awards, while the class \n     members merely received ``coupons'' towards the purchase of \n     other goods sold by defendants. If so, then this ``reform'' \n     should apply only to consumer class actions. Class action \n     treatment provides a received ``coupons'' towards the \n     purchase of other goods sold by defendants. If so, then \n     this ``reform'' should apply only to consumer class \n     actions. Class action treatment provides a particularly \n     important mechanism for adjudicating the claims of low-\n     wage workers and victims of discrimination, and there is \n     no apparent need to place limitations on these types of \n     actions. Senator Kennedy reportedly will offer an \n     amendment on this issue, which also should be adopted.\n       4. The Notification Provisions Are Misguided.\n       S. 2062 requires that federal and state regulators be \n     notified of proposed class action settlements, and be \n     provided with copies of the complaint, class notice, proposed \n     settlement and other materials. Apparently this provision is \n     intended to protect against ``collusive'' settlements between \n     defendants and plaintiffs' counsel, but those materials would \n     be unlikely to reveal evidence of collusion, and thus would \n     provide little or no basis for objecting to the settlement. \n     In addition, class members could be misled into believing \n     that their interests are being protected by their government \n     representatives, simply because the notice was sent to the \n     Attorney General of the United States and other federal and \n     state regulators.\n       Equal access to the American system of justice is a \n     foundation of our democracy. S. 2062 would effect a sweeping \n     reordering of our nation's system of justice that will \n     disenfranchise individual citizens from obtaining redress for \n     harm, and thereby impede efforts against egregious corporate \n     wrongdoing. Although the Attorneys General of California, \n     Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, \n     Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Vermont, and West \n     Virginia oppose S. 2062 in its present form, we fully support \n     the goal of preventing abusive class action settlements, and \n     would be willing to provide assistance in your effort to \n     implement necessary reforms while maintaining our federal \n     system of justice and safeguarding the interests of the \n     public.\n           Sincerely.\n     Eliot Spitzer,\n       Attorney General of the State of New York.\n     W. A. Drew Edmondson,\n       Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this letter Eliot Spitzer wrote, joined by \nthe attorneys general of California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, \nVermont, and West Virginia, says the legislation now before this body \nright here today, now before the Senate, is inaptly named Class Action \nFairness Act.\n  I will begin by reading excerpts from a letter the Senate Republican \nand Democratic leader recently received from Attorney General Spitzer. \nThe letter was sent by Spitzer, as I have said, in opposition to this \nlegislation. Joining in the letter are the attorneys general I \nmentioned from other States.\n  There are a number of Members of this body who have been attorneys \ngeneral in the past. The one that comes to my mind is Senator Bingaman. \nSenator Bingaman is representative of the people who become attorneys \ngeneral. He went to undergraduate school at Harvard College, he \ngraduated from Stanford Law School, two of the finest educational \ninstitutions in the world, and\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\nhe was an attorney general. He understands, as well as any, that \nspecial weight should be given to the authors of the letter. It is an \nattorney general's job to prosecute violations of the law.\n  These attorneys general begin by stating:\n\n       We strongly recommend that this legislation not be enacted \n     in its present form.\n\n  The letter goes on to explain that under the bill:\n\n       . . . almost all class actions brought by private \n     individuals in State court based on state law claims would be \n     forced into federal court . . . and many of these cases may \n     not be able to continue as class actions.\n\n  I say to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the \nexample he used with the State of South Dakota, 100 plaintiffs and $5 \nmillion, there is not a class action case that you would not have at \nleast 100 plaintiffs and at least $5 million in damages. That is pretty \neasy to do. As Senator Daschle said, that case would likely not occur \nin South Dakota.\n  The reason attorneys general say almost all class actions brought by \nprivate individuals in State court based on State claims would be \nforced into Federal court, and many of these cases may not be able to \ncontinue as class actions, the reason this is important, the letter \nexplains:\n\n       All attorneys general aggressively prosecute violations of \n     our states' laws through public enforcement actions filed in \n     state courts. Particularly in these times of state fiscal \n     constraints, class action provides an important ``private \n     Attorney General'' supplement to our efforts to obtain \n     redress for violations of state consumer protection, civil \n     rights, labor, public health, and environmental laws.\n\n  That is, class actions help ensure that violations of these important \nlaws do not go without punishment. The threat of such enforcement helps \nensure compliance with these laws.\n  The authors of this letter note that some reform may be appropriate, \nan argument I do not disagree with. They find that:\n\n       However, S. 2062 fundamentally alters the basic principles \n     of federalism, and if enacted would result in far greater \n     harm than good.\n\n  Joining in their opposition to this bill are the AARP, AFL-CIO, \nConsumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Leadership Council and \nCivil Rights, NAACP, and Public Citizen, to name a few.\n  The attorneys general letter also spells out the particular problems \nwhich arise from this legislation's broad expansion of Federal court \njurisdiction.\n\n       This transfer of jurisdiction in cases raising questions of \n     state law will inappropriately usurp the primary role of \n     state courts in developing their own laws and will impair \n     their ability to establish consistent interpretation of those \n     laws.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       There is no compelling need for sweeping change in our \n     long-established system for adjudicating state law issues.\n\n  Most importantly, the attorneys general note that:\n\n       . . . by transferring most state court actions to an \n     already overburdened federal court system, this bill will \n     delay (if not deny) justice to substantial numbers of injured \n     citizens.\n\n  This is the case, they note, because the class actions this bill will \nstop are important ``mechanisms for adjudicating the claims of low-wage \nworkers and victims of discrimination, and there is no apparent need to \nplace limitations on these types of actions.''\n  They conclude their letter by reminding this body, the Senate:\n\n       Equal access to the American system of justice is a \n     foundation of democracy. S. 2062 would effect a sweeping \n     reordering of our nation's system of justice. It will \n     disenfranchise individual citizens, while retaining redress \n     for harm and thereby impede efforts against corporate \n     wrongdoing.\n\n  In recent months, events here and abroad should remind us of the \nimportance of this last remark and the consequences. Our justice system \nis fundamental to sustaining our democratic values as a nation. This \nbill takes too broad a strike at the heart of the system and undermines \nthese very values.\n  I know the majority leader has a very difficult job. He has to \nbalance what we do and what we do not do. I don't in any way denigrate \nthe difficulty of his job. But I also remind my distinguished friend, \nthe Senator from Tennessee, the Senate is going to be ongoing long \nafter he leaves this body and long after I leave this body. We have had \napproximately 1,750 Senators who have served in this body. During those \nperiods of time, there have been some who have done things that delayed \npieces of legislation. We have done things over the years that have \nmade this body appear not to be as coordinated, as efficacious as the \nHouse. That is right. That is the way we are. The Senate is that way. \nWe will continue to be that way.\n  We are not a House of Representatives that has absolute dominance \nwith the party that rules. The party that is in power in the House is \nlike the British Parliament. The distinguished Presiding Officer served \nin the House of Representatives for a time, as did I.\n  That Rules Committee is an aggravation. They determine on every piece \nof legislation how long the debate will be, if they are going to allow \namendments, and how long you can debate those amendments.\n  But the chairman of the Rules Committee and the members of the Rules \nCommittee are chosen by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \nand they do what he wants done. I accept that system. That is the way \nthe House works. It is a large body of 435 people. They can work more \nquickly than we can. If they did not have the Rules Committee, they \nwould not get anything done.\n  The Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, set up this system of the \nlegislature where you have one body such as the House of \nRepresentatives that is in touch with the people every minute of their \n2-year existence, and they can rush things through that body now as \nthey did 200 years ago.\n  The Founding Fathers wanted, as we have been told numerous times, a \nsaucer that would cool the coffee. That is what we are. And no matter \nhow inconvenient the Senate is to that party in power--and we have been \nin power on occasion--no matter how the Senate rules slow us down, \ncause us problems, we have to be the Senate.\n  I respectfully suggest to the majority leader he is making a big \nmistake here in not allowing the Senate to be the Senate. We have only \na few days left--32 days left--and some of those days are Mondays and \nFridays, and we do not get a lot done around here anymore on Mondays \nand Fridays. Thirty-two days.\n  We have a lot to do, and I recognize that. That is why the Senator \nfrom Idaho and the Senator from Massachusetts have every right in the \nworld to offer this nonrelevant, nongermane amendment because, as the \nSenator from Idaho said, we have a season coming, farm season. Crops \nare growing now. Crops are going to have to be taken from the ground in \na few weeks.\n  This legislation is so important, during the Fourth of July Members \nof Congress were working on this amendment, and I received calls at my \nhome in Searchlight, NV, of legislators interested in this legislation, \nseeing if there was something I could do to help them move it along. I \nsaid: We have a piece of legislation coming up. The debate on your \namendment is not going to take very long. This is an appropriate \nvehicle to do it.\n  That is what the Senate is all about. We should not fill the tree. \nWhat this means is for the legislation now before this body, no one \nelse can offer an amendment. They cannot offer a relevant amendment. \nThey cannot offer a nonrelevant amendment. They can do nothing because \nit has been filled up. We on this side are not going to allow that.\n  I know the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut likes this \nlegislation. I am sure it is not perfect. I know he has worked on it \nfor years. But I have every confidence--he being a more senior \nlegislator in the Senate than I am--I have no doubt that he does not \nlike what took place here in a parliamentary fashion today. He believes \nin the Senate. He believes the Senate should work as the Senate and \nthat we should not bring a piece of legislation here--no matter how \nimportant the majority feels it is, you cannot bring a piece of \nlegislation before this body and say: This is more important than other \nthings and we are not going to allow any amendments on it. That \nis wrong, absolutely wrong.\n\n  I know my friend from Connecticut. I do not know of anyone in the \nSenate who is a better orator than the Senator from Connecticut. There \nis no one in the Senate who can better express himself than the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. But I say that even someone\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\nwho is a proud sponsor of this legislation cannot go along with what \nthe majority leader is trying to do. I have talked to him. I know the \nSenator from Connecticut. We cannot allow this to happen. We may have \nsome disagreements on this legislation, as I have outlined how I feel \nabout it. I do not think it is necessary. I think it is improper. I \nthink we need to do some things to improve class action, but this isn't \nit.\n  But the majority has shot themselves in the foot. This is \nfoolishness. We have wasted all day. We could have a couple, three \namendments already debated.\n  So I say to my friend, the manager of this bill, I am no neophyte \nhere. Cloture is going to be filed today and we will have a vote on \ncloture on Friday morning, and we will have to see how the cards stack \nup Friday morning. But if I were a betting man--and I do not bet on \nanything--I would say cloture will not be invoked on this legislation \nFriday morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I know some of my colleagues on the other \nside want to speak. I have much more to say about this issue, and \nespecially after the distinguished minority whip has chatted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my good friends have been waiting all \nmorning to speak. I wonder if the Senator from Utah would allow a \nunanimous consent agreement that they could speak next in order, the \ntwo Senators from Massachusetts and Connecticut.\n  Mr. HATCH. That would be fine. Do we know how long they would speak?\n  Mr. REID. I do not know how long they would speak.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can we get some idea?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Ten minutes at this time. And I see my colleague, the \nSenator from Connecticut, in the Chamber.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator from Massachusetts needs \nabout 15 minutes and the Senator from Connecticut about 30 minutes; is \nthat right?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no problem with that.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts be recognized for 15 minutes, followed by the \nSenator from Connecticut for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before I leave the floor, I express my \nappreciation to the Senator from Utah. I know he would like to respond \nto what I said and he will want to respond to what the Senator from \nMassachusetts says, but I appreciate his courtesy here, as usual.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, first of all, I commend our \ndistinguished Democratic leader, the Senator from South Dakota, for the \nway he has addressed the Senate earlier today on the proposals by the \nmajority leader to limit the debate on this very important subject \nmatter.\n  As the Senator from South Dakota pointed out, this legislation is \nbroad, wide sweeping. It affects not only the business community, but \nit affects, in a very important way, workers, workers' rights, \nenvironmental rights. It affects the issues on civil rights. It affects \nthe rights and the needs of many of our fellow citizens. It is an \nextremely serious piece of legislation that deserves debate.\n  We have a set of rules in the Senate, and if the majority leader and \nhis colleague from Kentucky want to alter or change those rules, let's \nhave a debate on altering or changing the rules. But, effectively, what \nthe request and the action of the majority leader today is, is to \nbasically circumvent the rules of the Senate. Those are rules that have \nbeen accepted. They are rules that have been altered to some extent--\nmost significantly, the rule on cloture, since I have been here for 42 \nyears--but they have worked pretty well for this institution \nhistorically. They work pretty well.\n  Part of the rules of the Senate are if a bill is authorizing \nlegislation, we have an opportunity to bring amendments on that \nauthorization bill. If those who are opposed to it are able to vote \nagainst it, that is the way the process works.\n  The majority has both the right and the privilege to raise the \npriorities they believe are the most important. A number of us have \nserious differences with the priorities our Republican colleagues have \nraised. They have raised the issue of class action.\n  I support the efforts of the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, who is \ntrying to focus on a particular problem that may not make a great deal \nof difference in many parts of the Nation, but makes an extraordinary \ndifference to this country because it deals with an agricultural issue \nthat has been a painful one for this Nation for the 40-odd years I have \nbeen in the Senate.\n  When I first came to the Senate we had what was called the bracero \nissue, where many temporary workers came to the United States, and they \nwere exploited in the most dehumanizing way that we could possibly \nimagine. Articles were written about it. In a bipartisan way, we freed \nthis Nation from that particular issue.\n  But there has been, obviously, tension between those individuals who \nperform the hardest work in America and those who are working in the \nfield of agriculture and are paid the least, which happen to be these \nworkers. A great percentage of them are undocumented workers who put \nthe food on the table which benefits American families. It is a \nnational tragedy that is taking place. Seventy percent of the over 1 \nmillion workers are undocumented.\n  The Senator from Idaho, myself, and 63 Members of the Senate in a \nbipartisan way are reflecting an expression of the workers and \nagribusiness, which is the first time that those groups have come \ntogether to help solve a very important issue that affects hundreds of \nthousands of individuals and their families and to do it in a very \nbrief time period. There is strong support for this over in the House \nof Representatives as well. We could do it in a bipartisan way and get \nsomething done for justice and fairness that has been a thorn in the \nside of this country for some time.\n  The Senator from South Dakota talked about maybe even having five \namendments. There are many of us who, with all due respect to the \nmajority leader and the Republican leadership, feel if we could get \nthat done in a short period of time, that would be a major step for \nprogress. That would be a major step for progress and justice and \nfairness for so many of these families who have been exploited over \ntime.\n  There are probably several other issues. I know Members on their side \nhave their choice issues. But the idea that we don't have mental health \nparity here in the United States is a greater priority at least for me \nand I would say for millions of families in this country--I know it is \nfor the Senator from New Mexico--than having the class action \nlegislation that is before us.\n  We have seen an expression where we have had in excess of 60 votes. I \nbelieve it was close to 70, 72 votes in the Senate. Why not have a \nshort time period on something that has strong bipartisan support and \ncan make a difference to families and try to work out a time limit? \nThat certainly seems to me to be a matter of importance. It seems to me \nto be a matter of consequence, something we could do in a bipartisan \nway in the Senate.\n  They have mentioned the minimum wage. For 7 years we haven't given an \nincrease in the minimum wage to the hardest working Americans at the \nlowest rung of the economic ladder. They say: We will permit you to \nvote on it. That is all well and fine. After 7 years and after the fact \nthat we have seen the Senate increase its own salary five different \ntimes, it won't increase the minimum wage for hard-working Americans, \nthe majority of whom are women, a great percentage of them are \nAmericans who are working hard, trying to provide for their families \nand falling farther and farther behind on the economic ladder. Now we \nare saying, as sort of a gratuity, we will let you have a debate. Don't \nget all so excited about that. We will grant you that. That is not the \nU.S. Senate I know. That is not the U.S. Senate our Founding Fathers \nfought for.\n  Those are just three. We could go on. We could go on to try to deal \nwith the issue of prescription drugs. There is not a family in this \ncountry who doesn't have a senior member, a parent or grandparent, who \nis not today\n\n[[Page S7706]]\n\nthinking about the cost of the increase in prescription drugs, \n50 percent in the last 4 years. And they are wondering today whether \nthey can afford the next batch of prescription drugs. It seems to me \nthat could be on a list of four. We have bipartisan support on the \nissue on reimportation. That seems to this Senator to be more \nimportant. It could make a difference in the lives of people if we \npassed it today, if we were able to get the House of Representatives to \ngo along with that. That seems to be a higher priority.\n\n  We are not even asking that we make it a higher priority. All we are \nasking is for our day in court and an accounting on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate on the people's agenda.\n  We have been closed out by the majority from getting action on those \nmatters until now. If you want to make a unanimous consent request, we \ncan make it and let you object to it about getting a time definite to \nvote on each and every one of those. We know what the answer would be \nbecause we have made the requests. The majority leader is not here, and \nI would not do so now without notifying him, but we know what the \nanswer is.\n  We want to be able to express the people's view in a short time limit \non a series of issues that have strong bipartisan support, and we are \nbeing told no.\n  We are also being told that we should pass this legislation. The \nChief Justice of the United States has told us not to pass this bill. \nThe National Association of State Chief Justices has told us not to \npass the bill. And we are being denied to even debate these kinds of \nexpressions by the Chief Justice, who is not known to be a Democrat, a \nliberal, or any of the other names. He is cautioning us. But no, we \ncan't. No, no, we know better. The other side says: We know better. We \nare not going to let you debate it or offer any amendments to it. We \nmay let you, if we want, if we make up our mind, let you have a \nparticular amendment if we decide that it is OK.\n  That is not the Senate I was elected to. That is the expression that \nwas said so well by our Democratic leader. That is my concern with the \nlegislation. I would certainly follow those who feel that with a fair \nopportunity to have an expression on the kinds of proposals that our \nDemocratic leader had proposed, which was the 5 nongermane, the 10 \nother kinds of amendments, and then go to final passage. Even though I \nhave reservations about it, I would support that proposal and move \nahead. That was not an unreasonable request. We should not diminish the \nrole of any Member of the U.S. Senate by agreeing to anything less.\n  I will address the underlying issue in terms of class action, \nparticularly as it affects issues on civil rights, particularly as it \naffects workers' rights. There has been no case that has been made in \nthe Judiciary Committee that there needs to be this action to deal with \nthe abuses in terms of the workplace, in terms of workers' wages; yet \nthey are included. There has been no case that has been made that we \nought to try and change the whole approach in protections for civil \nrights, although it has been included. That case has not been made. And \nyou will deny under this legislation the opportunity for States such as \nmy own that have passed genetic antidiscrimination legislation so that \nyou cannot discriminate in the workplace based upon your genetics--the \ngreat protection of that is for women because under the DNA now there \nare so many kinds of tests that would indicate the possibilities of \nwomen developing breast cancer. We have prohibited that in \nMassachusetts, and effectively you are wiping that kind of protection \nout.\n  Maybe it will be heard in some distant Federal court, but why should \nour citizens in Massachusetts who have taken a position on this have to \nrely on that? We have issues of substance on this, and we will have a \nchance, hopefully an opportunity to debate these matters and to come to \nsome conclusion on it.\n  I thank our Democratic leader for his courageous action. It is one I \nsupport completely. I think if our majority leader followed his \nadmonition, we would make progress in advancing the interests of this \nbody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I want to take some time to describe what \nwas a very lengthy and worthwhile effort some 10 months ago to come up \nwith a compromise proposal which is the substance of S. 2062, the \nlegislation now before the Senate. I will do that in a moment.\n  Before doing so, I want to express my great disappointment at the \nprocess which the majority Leader has chosen. As my colleagues know, we \nworked very hard last October and November trying to come up with a \ncompromise to give the class action reform bill an opportunity for \nconsideration before the Senate. It is now the middle of July. In fact, \nthis bill initially was to be brought up as the first item of business \nin January. For one reason or another, over the past number of months, \nthis bill has not been brought forward until now.\n  I regret that deeply. Having served here for over a quarter of a \ncentury, I know that in a Presidential election year, the likelihood of \ngetting something done becomes less and less. So those who set the \nagenda have to bear some responsibility, in a sense, for the situation \nwe now find ourselves in procedurally.\n  Having worked on this very hard for a long time, and now finding \nmyself in a situation where we are being told at this hour that the \nonly amendments we can consider are ones that will be approved by the \nmajority, is highly offensive to me and it ought be to any Member of \nthis body.\n  This measure is very important. There are a lot of other important \nmeasures that the Senator from Massachusetts mentioned, all of which I \nsupport and with which I agree. But in this legislative body that the \nFramers founded some 220 years ago, the idea that we are not going to \neven agree to a process that would allow for a limited number of \ngermane and nongermane amendments to be offered, is to in effect deny \nthe Senate the opportunity to work its will.\n  Even before a single amendment has been offered, the Majority Leader \nhas decided to fill up the amendment tree. In effect, he has precluded \nall Senators from offering amendments unless he deems them worthy to be \noffered. That includes, of course, Republican Senators as well as \nDemocratic Senators. I also add that the Majority Leader has done this \nwithout any basis. As I have said, not a single amendment has yet been \noffered. This tactic is like a doctor prescribing a remedy for a \nperfectly healthy patient.\n  Last evening, I looked at the number of amendments filed. There were \nsome 13 amendments filed. Most of them are germane amendments. There \nwere several nongermane amendments. The Democratic leader offered a \nproposal of 10 germane amendments and 5 nongermane amendments on either \nside, with time limits. I am quite confident the authors would be \nwilling to agree to a time agreement. I suspect that with a universe of \n30 amendments, about half of them maybe would fall even before being \noffered. But the idea that we could not set parameters around the \nconsideration of a bill this important I find rather breathtaking. \nAfter all, this how the Senate operates.\n  I floor managed with the Senator from Texas a number of years ago the \nsecurities litigation reform bill, which was another so-called tort \nreform bill. We spent 11 days on the floor of the Senate. Numerous \namendments were offered to that piece of legislation. The then-majority \nleader, Senator Dole, threatened on a couple of occasions to file a \ncloture motion but never did. He allowed the Senate to work its will on \nthat legislation. That is what ought to be done here as well. The fact \nthat there has been an offer to limit the amount of time and the number \nof amendments ought to be embraced by the Majority Leader, not rejected \nby him.\n  I am a cosponsor of this bill and I care about it. If I am going to \nbe confronted with voting on cloture Friday and cutting off debate, \nthen take me off the bill right now. If you want to kill the bill, you \ncan do it today, if that is the intention of the majority. I spent \nalmost a year helping to write this bill, but I will not stand here \ntoday and deny Members of this body, under limited time agreements, to \noffer some ideas that the Senate can either accept or reject and move \nforward.\n\n  This is an important piece of legislation, but it is not so important \nto this\n\n[[Page S7707]]\n\nMember that we would deny this institution the right to be able to do \nits business under the rules and procedures that have been provided for \nmore than two centuries ago.\n  Obviously, there are problems. Some of these nongermane amendments \nmay be adopted. Maybe germane amendments would be adopted that would \ncause some of us not to be able to support the bill. That is the risk \nyou run in a legislative body. There are 100 of us, as coequals, who \nhave the right to offer our ideas to legislation. Unlike in the other \nbody down the corridor, nongermane amendments can be offered in the \nSenate. That is how the Senate functions.\n  There is a risk, obviously, that this bill will get complicated. But \nthe idea that we are going to shut off the possibility of these ideas \nbeing offered ought to be offensive to every Member, even those who \nsupport the legislation. If it can happen here, it can happen on a bill \nyou support or oppose for one reason or another.\n  I am terribly disappointed that I am looking at a procedural \nsituation that I warned about, which is that if you didn't provide \nadequate time for Members to be able to offer amendments--even \namendments not particularly helpful in the eyes of some of my \ncolleagues--you run the risk of undercutting the legislation. Maybe \nthat is what the majority wants to do anyway, on the assumption that \nthose groups outside who support the underlying bill will blame those \nof us who are willing to shut down the debate and, if not, give us an \nopportunity to let the Senate work its will. That is a false hope. I \nbelieve people are much smarter than that. They understand that if you \ndon't let the Senate work its will, even under time constraints and \namendments that are being limited in number, you do a great bit of \ndamage to this institution.\n  It is late in the year, but I believe we have a good bill here. I \nwant to describe it briefly, if I may. We have worked on an excellent \ncompromise that a majority of colleagues here can support.\n  First of all, I am a very strong supporter of class action as a \nprocedural device. Class action lawsuits have provided individuals of \nmodest means the ability to band together to achieve systemic change \nwhen they could not have done so individually. In fact, important legal \ndevelopments in such areas as civil rights, sex discrimination, and \nenvironmental protection have been the result of class action lawsuits.\n  But there is considerable evidence from courthouses across the \ncountry that class actions are being abused. Procedural rules that are \ndesigned to decide fair and just outcomes for individual plaintiffs and \ndefendants are not being followed in too many cases. As a result, the \nclass action system is not working, in my view, the way it was \nintended, and justice is not being served.\n  Madam President, I am also one who has supported and opposed various \ntort reform measures. I suggest that what we are talking about here is \nmore court reform than tort reform.\n  For example, I opposed medical malpractice reform, not because I \ndon't think we ought to do something about it, but it was a poorly \ncrafted bill.\n  I also opposed liability protection for gunmakers. By the way, most \nmanufacturers of firearms reside in my State, but the idea that we are \ngoing to exclude an entire industry from litigation was highly \noffensive to me.\n  I opposed liability protection for manufacturers of the so-called \nMTBE, which pollutes ground water. I supported a patient's right to sue \ntheir HMOs and insurance companies, which are a major industry in my \nState. Obviously, I helped write and helped to support the securities \nlitigation reform, uniform standards, Y2K legislation, and the \nterrorism insurance bill.\n  So I don't fall into a category here of being for whatever is titled \n``tort reform,'' supporting it or opposing it. I have a record that I \nbelieve is one of balance and support of those ideas and efforts that \ntruly were designed to try to improve a litigation system. That is the \nbackground of my own voting record.\n  I will give you a history in terms of this compromise. On October 22 \nof last year, the Majority Leader sought to proceed to an earlier class \naction measure, S. 1751. The vote on that motion to proceed was 59 to \n39, which is 1 vote short of the required number to invoke cloture.\n  At the time of that legislation, I voted no on invoking cloture, and \nI did so with some reluctance. I noted that, while I supported some \nreform of class action procedures, I could not support S. 1751. I also \nexpressed concern about whether there would be any meaningful \nopportunity for Senators to negotiate changes in that bill in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  I told colleagues in October of last year that reaching an agreement \non class action reform required us to roll up our sleeves to get it \ndone. Many long hours of painstaking negotiations were ahead of us. As \nan author of the securities litigation reform bill, the uniform \nstandards legislation, terrorism insurance, and the Y2K bill, I know \nthat principled compromise could be reached on class action reform as \nwell.\n  I argued at the time, and my sentiment still holds true today, that \n``the American people deserve better. We are not working together as \noften as we should on critical questions. If we do not do it, then we \ndo a great disservice to the American people.''\n  Subsequent to the vote in October 2003, I joined with three of my \ncolleagues in sending a letter to the Majority Leader on November 14. \nIn that letter, we outlined the specific policies that we believed \nneeded to be addressed in a class action bill that would garner the \nnecessary votes to pass in this body.\n  In November of last year, Senators Schumer, Landrieu, and I entered \ninto discussions with Senators Frist, Hatch, and Grassley. Those \nnegotiations resulted in the compromise that is before us today.\n  I do believe this legislation is a significant improvement over the \nearlier bill considered by the Senate last year. When Senator Schumer, \nLandrieu, and I sent our letter to the Majority Leader, we asked for \nfive changes in that legislation:\n  No. 1, we wanted to ensure that the jurisdictional provisions keep \ntruly local cases in State courts.\n  No. 2, we wanted provisions on mass tort actions to be as precise as \npossible.\n  No. 3, we wanted to prevent the potential for repeated removal and \nremand between State and Federal courts, the so-called ``merry-go-round \neffect.''\n  No. 4, we wanted to provide appropriate compensation to those \nplaintiffs who take the risk of coming forward.\n  And No. 5, we wanted stronger provisions on abusive coupon \nsettlements.\n  We got those changes and more. In fact, we asked for those 5 changes, \nand yet we got 12 improvements to the bill as originally proposed.\n  I am pleased to say that the compromise we reached last year is a \nmeasured, bipartisan response that fixes many aspects of our broken \nclass action system. In addition, it strikes the appropriate balance \nbetween protecting Americans' access to the courthouse while ridding \nthe class action system of its most egregious abuses.\n  I want to emphasize at the outset that this bill is a fragile, \ncarefully-crafted compromise. There are some who will argue the bill \ngoes too far, and others will tell you it does not go far enough. I \nhappen to believe it achieves the right balance. It may not be perfect, \nbut I think it is a good balance overall.\n  Having entered into a good-faith agreement with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, I want to see the compromise preserved both on the \nSenate floor and in conference. No statement has been made by the \nDemocratic leader that he is opposing the appointment of conferees on \nthis bill. Part of the agreement was that the compromise we reached in \nthe Senate would be the one approved by the House in conference. If \nthat was not the case, then those of us who agreed vote on the motion \nto proceed would reserve the right to filibuster the conference report. \nWe certainly continue to hold that view.\n  S. 2062 reforms the current class action system in a number of \nmeaningful ways. Let me go through them if I can rather quickly.\n  First, it addresses the issue of coupon settlements which constitutes \none of the greatest abuses in our courthouses today. Here the \nplaintiffs receive coupons, or a token payment, for a discount off \ntheir next purchase while\n\n[[Page S7708]]\n\ntheir attorneys pocket millions of dollars in fees.\n  It is not only the plaintiff attorneys who benefit from these coupon \nsettlements, but the defendants benefit as well. For example, the \naverage redemption rate in a settlement involving food and beverage \ncoupons have been between 2 and 6 percent. As a result, the purpose of \nthese coupon settlements has changed. They no longer serve class \nmembers but defendant and plaintiff attorneys instead.\n\n  The original class action bill brought to the Senate last year in \nOctober only provided for greater judicial scrutiny of such coupon \nsettlements. Senators on the Judiciary Committee who opposed the bill \nrightly argued that ``reforms with real teeth were needed to end \nworthless coupon settlements in class action cases.''\n  We agreed with their view. The compromise does a much improved job of \nreining in these coupon settlements by pegging the lawyers' fees to the \nvalue of the coupons actually redeemed by class members or on the \nreasonable value of the legal work actually performed by the counsel in \nthe litigation. As a result, there will be a strong incentive to resist \neasy settlements and fight for an outcome that is truly fair and \nequitable to the plaintiffs.\n  Another important consumer protection enshrined in the compromise \nbill concerns the payment of so-called bounties. The earlier \nlegislation included a provision that prohibited settlements that allow \none member of a plaintiff class from receiving a higher settlement \naward than other members of that class.\n  On its face, such a provision might seem innocuous. After all, it \nappears to confirm the notion that all plaintiffs should be treated \nequally and fairly. However, the bounties provision in the original \nbill would have unintentionally created a significant problem. While it \nmakes sense for all plaintiffs' class members to be treated equally in \nmany cases, in some other instances it is more appropriate for some \nclass members, particularly class representatives, to receive larger \nawards than others in the same class. For example, in a class action \ndesigned to prevent the wrongful discharge of employees, it would be \nappropriate for those who have already been fired, for instance, to \nreceive larger settlements than those who are merely threatened with \nbeing fired.\n  Furthermore, in many cases, the named plaintiffs--the people whose \nnames appear on the papers filed with the court--are subjected to \nharassment, angry phone calls, hate mail, even death threats. Anybody \nwho has seen Julia Roberts' movie ``Erin Brockovich'' or the earlier \nMeryl Streep movie about the life and death of Karen Silkwood will \nrecall that being a named plaintiff in a lawsuit against a company that \nemploys many people can be a very unpopular thing to do. It often takes \ncourage to stand up for what one believes is right, and unfortunately \nthose who have the courage to do the right thing are sometimes \nattacked, ridiculed, and ostracized.\n  If the bounty provision in the earlier bill were to have remained in \nthe compromise, it would have simply stripped away any incentive for \nindividuals to come forward and protect the rights of the class. Under \ncurrent Federal law, a class representative in a successful class \naction can be rewarded for taking the initiative to fight unlawful \ndiscrimination. Most class members choose to sit on the sidelines and \nreap the benefits of the case when it is finished. Class \nrepresentatives, on the other hand, take an active role in their cases, \nand they do so not only for themselves but to obtain justice for others \nin similar situations. Under the earlier bill, the courts would not \nhave been able to recognize the special efforts or contributions made \nby class representatives.\n  We have listened to the civil rights community which was strongly \nopposed to the bounties provision in the original bill. The compromise \ndeletes this provision, which will ensure that the courtroom doors \nremain open for those plaintiffs willing to serve as class \nrepresentatives.\n  The compromise bill also responds to the concerns of the Federal \nJudicial Conference and others about the class settlement notice \nprovisions in the earlier measure. The provision in the original \nlegislation was intended to provide clear and simpler notices to class \nmembers regarding proposed class settlements. However, we heard from \nthe Federal Judicial Conference that the notice requirements, while \nwell intentioned, would have actually been too burdensome and too \ncomplicated to implement.\n  According to the Judicial Conference Rules Committee, these notice \nrequirements would have ``undermined the bill's stated objectives by \nrequiring notices so elaborate that most class members [would] not even \nattempt to read them.'' In addition, they would have conflicted with \nthe December 1, 2003 amendments to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, which are similarly intended to guide the form and \ncontent of settlement and certification notices provided to class \nmembers. The compromise, therefore, deletes the confusing notice \nprovisions in the earlier bill and simply enacts the recommendations of \nthe Judicial Conference. Yet another compromise in this legislation.\n  At the very heart of the compromise are provisions concerning when \ninterstate class actions can be removed to Federal court. Under Article \nIII of the U.S. Constitution, out-of-State litigants are protected \nagainst the possibility of prejudice of local courts by allowing for \nFederal diversity jurisdiction when the plaintiffs and the defendants \nare from different States.\n  Title 28, section 1332(a) of the United States Code specifies the \ncurrent requirements that must be met for an out-of-State litigant to \nclaim Federal diversity jurisdiction and have his or her case heard by \na Federal court. First, every member of the class must be seeking \ndamages in excess of $75,000, including interest and costs. Second, \nthere must be complete diversity; that is, every named member of the \nclass must be a citizen of a different State than every defendant in \nthe same litigation.\n  Walter Dellinger, the former Solicitor General during the Clinton \nadministration, noted that when Congress first drafted the diversity \njurisdiction statute, the class action system as we know it today did \nnot exist at all. In the years since its enactment, however, the law \nhas been interpreted to exclude most nationwide class actions from \nFederal court.\n  For example, Dellinger remarks that the requirement for complete \ndiversity can easily be avoided by the simple expedient of including at \nleast one named plaintiff and defendant that share a common State \ncitizenship.\n  With regard to the amount in controversy requirement, Mr. Dellinger \ncontends that a class action can easily be configured to ensure that at \nleast one class member does not satisfy the minimum amount, or by \nseeking $74,999 in recovery on behalf of each and every plaintiff and \nclass member.\n  As a result, attorneys bringing class actions can manage to avoid \nFederal court all together, and have the case tried in a State court, \noften in the county of their choosing, even though the total amount at \nstake might exceed hundreds of millions of dollars and have true multi-\nState national implications. This practice is commonly known as \n``forum-shopping.'' While it is in concept a long-standing part of our \nlaw, it has become a growing problem in the United States.\n  Under S. 2062, the bill now before us, the current rules for \ndiversity jurisdiction are carefully adjusted so that certain large \nmultiparty cases, namely, those that are truly nationwide in scope, \naffecting many or even all States at once, will be litigated in the \nFederal courts rather than in the courts of just one State or county. \nIn other words, the compromise would bring the class action process \ncloser to the Framers' intent by allowing cases that are multi-State or \nnational in scope, where the risk of local biases are the greatest, to \nbe heard in Federal court and not in State court.\n  Specifically, the Federal district court will have original \njurisdiction over any class action with more than 100 members if the \nfollowing two requirements are met. First, the aggregate claims must \nexceed $5 million, rather than each and every class member must exceed \n$75,000 in alleged damages. Second, rather than requiring every member \nof a class be a citizen of a different State than every defendant, S. \n2062 allows for Federal jurisdiction if any class member is a citizen \nfrom a\n\n[[Page S7709]]\n\ndifferent State from any defendant. Again, the purpose of these changes \nis to ensure that more substantial multi-State class actions are heard \nin Federal court.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. Could I finish? I only have a limited amount of time, and I \napologize, and I will get through this statement.\n  These moderate changes to the Federal diversity statute were included \nin the original legislation that came before the Senate last October. \nUnder the compromise, however, we further refine these provisions to \naddress two important concerns that were not fully taken into account \nin the earlier bill. I want to especially commend Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia for her leadership in helping to clarify these issues, both \nduring the Senate Judiciary Committee's consideration of the earlier \nmeasure and in the discussions that led to this compromise.\n  First, the compromise responds to concerns that the original bill did \nnot adequately address the handful of small, rural State courts that \nhave increasingly become a magnet for more and more nationwide class \nactions. Such ``magnet jurisdictions'' have tended to have lax class \ncertification requirements, and have been less than rigorous in \nreviewing proposed settlements. In fact, one of the most flagrant \nabuses of the current class action system occurs when lawyers ``forum \nshop'' that is, invent an injured class and then file a national class \naction in a ``magnet jurisdiction'' where the judges are more likely to \nlend a sympathetic ear.\n  Perhaps the most famous of these so-called ``magnet jurisdictions'' \nis Madison County, IL. According to a 2001 study in the Harvard Journal \nof Law and Public Policy, the per capita rate of class action filings \nwas almost twice that of the second-ranking jurisdiction in the United \nStates. In recent years, the study found that class action filings in \nMadison County increased by 1,850 percent during the period between \n1998 and 2001.\n  Although the population of Madison County is only 250,000, it ranks \nthird nationwide in the number of class actions filed each year, behind \nonly Los Angeles County, CA and Cook County, IL.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am limited on time, I say to my colleague. When I get \nthrough this, I will be glad to respond.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is talking about Illinois. I wanted to ask a \nquestion or two about Illinois.\n  Mr. DODD. I will come back to the Senator.\n  Even more astounding is the data reported in the January 11, 2004 St. \nLouis Post-Dispatch, which discovered that in anticipation of Congress \nreforming class action procedures, the number of class actions filed in \nMadison County Circuit Court rose to an all-time high.\n  Yet it is not only the sheer numbers of filings in Madison County \nthat is so astonishing. What is so surprising is that many of these \nclass actions have little connection to the county. In fact, sometimes \nonly a few class members actually came from that particular \njurisdiction. Even the Illinois Supreme Court has noted the congested \ndockets in this court and declared ``the congestion is aggravated by \nthe presence of [nonresident] cases that have little or no connection \nto Madison County.''\n  For example, a recent case that found its way to Madison County \ninvolved a purported class action on behalf of 30 million customers who \nclaimed to be injured by Sears in connection with an allegedly \ndeceptive tire balancing service. Only one plaintiff, a Madison County \nresident, was named, and only one Sears automotive repair shop was \nactually located in Madison County. The class action, however, sought \nto certify a nationwide class, allegedly subject to the Illinois \nConsumer Fraud Act, despite the fact that the vast majority of class \nmembers and the vast majority of Sears locations have no connection to \nIllinois at all, much less to Madison County.\n  Madison County has especially been a magnet for asbestos cases. In \nfact, Madison County led the Nation 2 years ago in the number of \nmesothelioma cases filed. In most of these cases, however, the \nplaintiffs did not live in Madison County, were not exposed to asbestos \nin Madison County, and were not treated for any asbestos-related \nillnesses in Madison County.\n  For example, in a recently decided case, an Indiana resident claimed \nthat he was exposed to asbestos at the U.S. Steel plant in Gary, IN. He \nsued U.S. Steel, which is based in Pennsylvania, in Madison County. \nDespite the total lack of connection to the local forum, the case \nproceeded to trial and a Madison County jury awarded him $50 million in \ncompensatory damages and $200 million in punitive damages.\n  Clearly, such practices need to be curtailed in any meaningful reform \nof the class action system.\n  Again, I emphasize I am a strong supporter of class action. Class \naction litigation is critically important, but when these things get \nout of control, then we have to get them back on track again.\n  There are many more examples of national class actions implicating \nhundreds of millions if not billions of dollars being decided by \nMadison County judges because of its reputation as a magnet court. That \nmeans that the laws of Madison County, Illinois on everything from \ninsurance policy to consumer fraud to environmental protection are \nbeing imposed on the residents of the other 49 states, despite the fact \nthat many of those States have adopted different legal views.\n  The compromise bill specifically addresses this serious problem. It \nincludes language not in the earlier bill to clarify when a Federal \ncourt can exercise its jurisdiction if between one-third and two-thirds \nof the proposed class members and all primary defendants are citizens \nof the same State.\n  Specifically, the compromise authorizes Federal courts to consider \nany ``distinct nexus'' or connection between the forum where the action \nwas brought and the class members, the alleged harm, or the defendants. \nThe purpose of this provision is to require Federal judges to consider \nwhether the interstate class action has any relationship to the \njurisdiction where it is brought. If there were no such connections, as \nin the case of many of the class actions filed in Madison County, the \nFederal judge would then have the discretion of moving the case to \nFederal court. Such a provision would therefore rein in the blatant \nforum shopping that is so prevalent in Madison County and other magnet \njurisdictions today.\n  The other improvement to the Federal diversity statute that the \ncompromise bill makes concerns the so-called ``local class action \nexception.'' The purpose of this exception is to ensure that State \ncourts can adjudicate class actions that are truly local in nature, and \nthey should have that right.\n  Under the original bill, Federal jurisdiction would not have been \nextended to those cases in which two-thirds or more of the members of \nthe plaintiff class and the primary defendants were citizens of the \nState in which the suit was filed. Such cases would have remained in \nState court, since virtually all of the parties in such cases would \nhave been local, and local interests therefore presumably would have \npredominated.\n  There were concerns raised in the earlier bill, however, that class \nactions with a truly local focus may be moved to Federal court because \nof the presence of an out-of-State defendant necessary to prosecuting \nthe action.\n  The compromise responds to these concerns by further refining the \ncriteria as to when a class action is to remain in State court. First, \nunder our proposal, there must be a primarily local class--that is, \nmore than two-thirds of the class members should be citizens of the \nforum State. Second, there must be at least one real local defendant. \nThird, the principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or \nrelated conduct of all of the defendants must have occurred in the \nforum State. Finally, there must be no other class actions having been \nfiled in the previous 3 years based on the same or similar allegations \nagainst any of the defendants. Again, these provisions respect State \nsovereignty by ensuring that class actions of a truly local nature are \nkept at the State level, while complex class actions with nationwide \nimplications are heard in Federal courts.\n  I want to briefly respond to some of the concerns raised about the \njurisdictional provisions in the bill. Critics of\n\n[[Page S7710]]\n\nthis legislation have claimed that the measure would sweep most if not \nall State class actions into Federal court, where overburdened and \nunsympathetic judges would let them wither and die.\n  I believe that such concerns are largely misplaced. First, as I noted \nearlier, we included provisions in the compromise to ensure that State \nprerogatives are respected. These provisions--namely, the ``local class \naction exception'' and the ``distinct nexus'' language--are intended to \nkeep truly local cases in State court.\n  In fact, the compromise leaves in State court a wide range of class \nactions, such as those in which all the plaintiffs and defendants are \nresidents of the same State; those with fewer than 100 plaintiffs; \nthose involving less than $5 million; those in which a State government \nentity is the primary defendant; those brought against a company in its \nhome State in which two-thirds or more of the class members are also \nresidents of that State; and shareholder class actions alleging \nbreaches of fiduciary duty.\n  What the compromise does target for Federal jurisdiction, however, \nare those nationwide or multistate class actions that are filed in \nmagnet courts such as Madison County, IL. While I respect the views of \nthose who assert that State courts are appropriate forums for such \ncases, I must respectfully disagree. In my view, such large, multistate \nor nationwide class actions are precisely the kinds of cases that are \nmost appropriately tried in Federal court. I believe that the \nprovisions we included in the compromise are quite discriminating about \nwhich class actions will be removed to Federal court and which will \nremain in State court.\n  Second, critics of the legislation have argued that Federal courts \nare so overburdened that they do not have the resources to handle class \nactions formerly assigned to State court judges. Again, these concerns \nare unfounded. The real workload issues are not in the Federal courts \nbut in the State courts, where the average State court judge is \nassigned three times as many cases as his or her Federal counterparts. \nAccording to the Court Statistics Project, State court judges are \nassigned over 1,500 new cases each year. In contrast, the \nAdministrative Office of the United States Courts finds that each \nFederal court judge was assigned an average of 518 new cases during the \n12-month period ending September 30, 2002.\n  Third, I also want to be perfectly clear on one further matter. There \nis absolutely nothing in this legislation that would alter any \nindividual's right to seek redress for his or her injury. It does not \ngrant defendants any new defense. Consumers can bring the same exact \nclaims as they are bringing now. Civil rights, environmental, and \nemployment claims are in no way precluded. The only issue that this \nbill would address is whether it is more appropriate for a State or \nFederal court to adjudicate those same rights, and I believe that we \nhave struck the appropriate balance in making this determination.\n  I want to now return to the other provisions in the compromise that \nrepresent significant improvements over the earlier legislation.\n  We have clarified the date when the plaintiff class could be \nmeasured. The compromise makes clear that citizenship of the proposed \nclass members is to be determined on the date plaintiffs filed the \noriginal complaint. If there is no Federal jurisdiction over the first \ncomplaint, however, citizenship is to be determined when plaintiffs \nserve an amended complaint or other paper indicating the existence of \nFederal jurisdiction.\n  The original bill had been silent on when class composition could be \nmeasured, which caused some concern that a court would have to \nconstantly reconsider jurisdiction as the contours of the class \nchanged. I believe that the compromise has adequately addressed this \nmatter, and has provided much needed clarity to determining class \ncomposition.\n  Another provision in the earlier bill that caused great difficulty \nwould have required Federal courts to dismiss class actions if the \ncourt determined that the case did not meet Rule 23 requirements. The \nbill provided that the class action complaint may be amended and \nrefiled in State court, but that the new complaint would be subject to \nremoval again if it met Federal jurisdictional requirements. Thus, even \nif a State court subsequently certifies the class, it could be removed \nagain and again, creating a judicial merry-go-round between Federal and \nState court.\n  The compromise stops the merry-go-round altogether. It eliminates the \ndismissal requirement, giving Federal courts discretion to handle Rule \n23-ineligible cases appropriately. Potentially meritorious suits will \ntherefore not be automatically dismissed simply because they fail to \ncomply with the class certification requirements of Rule 23.\n  The original bill would have also allowed the removal of a case at \nany time to Federal court even if all other class members wanted the \ncase to remain in State court. In June 2003, 106 professors of \nconstitutional law and civil procedure wrote to Majority Leader Frist \nand Minority Leader Daschle expressing their concerns over this \nprovision. They argued that:\n\n       [It] would give a defendant the power to yank a case away \n     from a state-court judge who has properly issued pretrial \n     rulings the defendant does not like, and would encourage a \n     level of forum-shopping never before seen in this country. \n     Moreover, this provision would allow an unscrupulous \n     defendant, anxious to put off the day of judgment so that \n     more assets can be hidden, to remove a case on the eve of a \n     state-court trial, resulting in an automatic delay of months \n     or even years before the case can be tried in Federal courts.\n\n  We listened to the concerns of the law professors and deleted the \nprovision in the original bill allowing plaintiffs to remove class \nactions. We also retain current law permitting individual plaintiffs \nfrom opting out of class actions. The compromise would therefore make a \nreal difference in curbing abuse of the removal process by various \ncounsel.\n  Two further improvements in the compromise are also worth mentioning.\n  First, we responded to concerns that the ``mass actions'' provisions \nin the original legislation were too broad. The earlier bill would have \ntreated all mass actions involving over 100 claimants as if they were \nclass actions.\n  Under the compromise, only more substantial claims in a mass action--\nnamely, those that would meet the normal jurisdictional amount \nrequirement of $75,000 for individual actions--will be subject to \nFederal jurisdiction.\n  In addition, we change the ``single sudden accident'' exception to \nexclude from Federal jurisdiction mass actions in which all claims \narise from an ``event or occurrence'' that happened in the State where \nthe action was filed and that allegedly resulted in injuries in that \nState or in a contiguous State. The purpose of this change is to allow \na much broader range of truly local cases to remain in State courts.\n  The compromise also clarifies that there is no Federal jurisdiction \nunder the mass action provision for claims that have been consolidated \nfor pretrial purposes.\n  Second, the original bill would have allowed defendants to seek \nunlimited appellate review of Federal court orders remanding cases to \nState courts. If a defendant requested an appeal, the Federal courts \nwould have been required to hear the appeal and the appeals would have \ntaken months or even years to complete.\n  The compromise would obviate the potential for workload problems and \nlong delays in two important ways. First, it would give the appellate \ncourts the discretion to conduct reviews at their discretion. \nPresumably, Federal courts would refuse to hear an appeal unless it \npresented novel issues or where a district court has clearly abused its \ndiscretion. Second, it requires such appeals to be heard on an \nexpedited basis by establishing tight deadlines for completion of any \nappeals so that no case can be delayed more than 77 days, unless all \nparties agree to a longer extension.\n  Finally, the compromise is in no way retroactive--that is, it will \nnot upset or alter in any way cases filed before enactment, should in \nfact the bill be signed into law. Unlike other litigation reform bills \nconsidered by this Congress on guns, medical malpractice, and MTBE, the \ncompromise does not shut the courtroom door on anyone. Instead, it will \njust direct them to a Federal rather than a State courthouse.\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\n  These changes I have discussed represent a fair and a balanced \ncompromise. They constitute a significant improvement over the earlier \nclass action reform legislation brought before the Senate last October.\n  I want to reemphasize my long-held view that a strong class action \nsystem can ultimately serve as a force for good. It can be used to hold \ncompanies accountable for significant violations that may result in a \nsmall monetary charge for one victim. It can also be harnessed to allow \nlarge groups to seek redress for civil rights and other harms where \nthey could not have done so individually. In short, the class action \nsystem is the great equalizer in the American judicial system.\n  Yet nobody can deny that the class action system is being seriously \nabused. As The Washington Post editorialized last year:\n\n       No area of the United States civil justice system cries out \n     more urgently for reform than the high stakes extortion \n     racket of class actions.\n\n  In addition, an excellent Newsweek article published last December \nentitled ``Lawsuit Hell: How Fear of Litigation is Paralyzing our \nProfessions'' noted that such lawsuits are:\n\n     . . . changing and complicating the lives of millions of \n     American professionals in ways that confound common sense and \n     cast a shadow over a system that can, at its best, offer \n     people relief and redress from legitimate grievances.\n\n  Even former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger commented that such \nevidence of class action abuses in State and county courthouses:\n\n     . . . gives me great concern that the rights of truly injured \n     individual plaintiffs, as well as the rights of corporate \n     defendants, have fallen victim to manipulation, and even \n     evasion, of settled rules--rules that, no less than financial \n     disclosure laws, are intended to ensure openness and \n     accountability, as well as fundamental fairness, in the \n     judicial resolution of major disputes with national \n     consequences.\n\n  Ultimately, the real losers of a broken class action system are not \nbusinesses or consumers. Rather, it is the American public's overall \nconfidence in the legal system that will suffer unless a sensible class \naction reform package, such as that contained in the compromise, is \nenacted into law.\n  Bipartisan legislation addressing the class action system's most \negregious abuses is long overdue. This carefully balanced compromise \nthat is now before the Senate will make a real difference in reducing \nthe abuse and manipulation of the class action system. It would restore \nclass actions to their original noble purpose as a force for positive \nchange in society, and I urge my colleagues not to let this golden \nopportunity be squandered.\n  I know time is getting short. My colleague from Illinois was here, \nand he would like to be heard on this matter.\n  Let me return to where I started. I spent a lot of time on this \nmeasure. I think we have written a very good bill. I would not claim \nthat this bill is perfect. There are some colleagues who fundamentally \ndisagree with me on this issue, and I respect their views.\n  What I cannot tolerate, however, is the procedure under which this \nbill is going to be considered. I say to my friends on the other side \nof the aisle with whom I worked very closely, if you constrain this \ninstitution's ability to offer either nongermane or germane amendments \nto this bill, then this Senator will not be able to support the motion \nto invoke cloture.\n  We failed to invoke cloture by only one vote last October. Although I \ncare about this bill very much, I care far more about the Senate and \nhow we do our business. It is going to disappoint me terribly to have \nto vote against cloture. But if you constrain the ability of Members of \nthis body to offer specific amendments, then this Senator is going to \nhave to wait for another day to fully consider this measure.\n  There are many people across this country who believe we put together \na good compromise, but I am not going to vote for a compromise that \ndoesn't allow the Senate to work its will on this important matter.\n  I realize my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Did the Senator have enough time? Is the Senator finished? \nI would certainly grant him more time.\n  Mr. DODD. I am.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I appreciate much of what the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut has said with regard to this \nbill. He is right on. I do not agree with him that he should not vote \nfor cloture on this matter because he knows, we all know, if we do not \nget cloture, this bill is not going to make it.\n  The Senate is used to having nongermane, irrelevant--nonrelevant \namendments foreclosed in order to get legislation passed. We all know \nunless we foreclose that, this legislation is never going to see the \nlight of day. That is what we have been putting up with now for 6 \nyears.\n  To come on the floor today, as some have, and indicate that the \nSenate is going to be broken if we proceed on this bill in a way that \npermits only germane amendments and with one nongermane amendment which \nthose on the other side have wanted for months, and which I think the \nmajority leader was willing to give them, is not shooting straight, as \nfar as I am concerned. As everybody knows, we have worked 6 years on \nthis bill; 62 people signed off on this bill as prime cosponsors. We \nlost on cloture by one vote last time, one solitary vote. If we get \nonly one of the three who agreed to go ahead with this bill, knowing it \nwould cut off the extended debate or the filibuster, which is what we \nagreed to, then this bill is going to go forward and we will only have \nto deal with germane amendments and not a whole proliferation of \nnongermane, political, politicized amendments, which is what the \nmajority leader would like to foreclose.\n  All of the holier than thou ``we must preserve the Senate'' comments \nare meaningless in this context. If this were the first time this bill \nhad ever been considered, if it had not had extensive debate through at \nleast four hearings through the years, if it hadn't had an extensive \ninternal debate as we agreed to accept a whole raft of amendments by \nthe three who came on this bill back in November of last year with the \nunderstanding that we are going to invoke cloture--if we had not gone \nthrough all that, then I might see some reason for the comments made \nhere today, but those comments should not see the light of day if you \nlook at the facts and you look at what has gone on here.\n  Let me mention my support of S. 2062, the Class Action Fairness Act \nof 2004. I appreciate Senator Reid's impassioned defense of trial \nlawyers. It is a profession I proudly belong to and share with him. But \nthis bill is not about attacking trial lawyers. It is about correcting \ncertain grotesque abuses of our judicial system by a handful of class \naction lawyers who are giving all the other trial lawyers a bad name. \nOn this point the evidence is clear and undeniable.\n  Furthermore, I would like to note that the Erin Brockovich case, \nwhich my Democratic colleague from Nevada mentioned, would have \nremained in State court. There is no question about that. The suit of \nAnderson v. PG, known as the Erin Brockovich case, was brought in \nCalifornia by California residents against a California company.\n  There is no question that if they wanted to stay in State court they \ncould. Under this bill, the case would not have been eligible for \nremoval under diversity jurisdiction principles. Our concern is to \nremove truly national actions to Federal court and not local \ncontroversies like this one.\n  The evidence is clear and undeniable. The well-documented abuse of \nthe class action litigation device victimizes plaintiffs--the very \npeople that class actions are supposed to benefit. These abuses cheat \nmillions of consumers who unwittingly have their legal rights \nadjudicated in local courts thousands of miles away. They deny the due \nprocess rights of defendants who are relentlessly hauled into a handful \nof small county courts where the playing field is unfairly tilted in \nfavor of the plaintiffs' bar. And if that were not enough, class action \nabuses are eroding public confidence in our civil justice system.\n  To give the class action problem some perspective, I want to consider \nthe effect of this litigation in just one locale--Madison County, IL, \nwhich the Senator from Connecticut mentioned. There we find a case \nstudy in the rampant misconduct within the class action system, its \ncorrupting effect on the courts, and the desperate need for reform. \nThis small town in the Southwestern part of that state provides all\n\n[[Page S7712]]\n\nthe evidence necessary to convince anyone that the legal system is \ncurrently being exploited by shameless and self-seeking plaintiffs \nlawyers.\n  Madison County, IL is a rural county. I imagine that it is the type \nof place where Abraham Lincoln first got his start as a young lawyer \nand advocate for justice. In some notes taken in preparation for a Law \nLecture around 1850, Lincoln set the ideal for his profession, a \nprofession practiced by many in this Chamber.\n  No. 1: Discourage litigation. Point out how the nominal winner is \noften the real loser in fees, expenses, and waste of time.\n  No. 2: Never stir up litigation. The worst man can scarcely be found \nthan the one who does this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who \nhabitually overhauls the register of deeds in search of defective \ntitles and stirs up strife to put money in his pocket. The moral tone \nought to be infused into such a profession which should drive such man \nout of it.\n  No. 3: An exorbitant fee should never be claimed.\n  That was Abraham Lincoln. These words were uttered during a time when \nbeing a lawyer carried a title of honor, integrity and trust. \nUnfortunately, these words no longer carry such meaning for the lawyers \nwho descend on Madison County. In the ``Land of Lincoln,'' the rule of \nlaw has been corrupted almost beyond recognition by self-interested \npersonal injury lawyers, plaintiffs, and public officials without any \nsense of shame.\n  Unscrupulous personal injury lawyers go forum shopping to find \nfriendly jurisdictions such as Madison County. Then the judges in those \njurisdictions are frequently compromised by campaign contributions from \nthe very same law firms arguing in their courtrooms and certify these \ncases with the proverbial rubberstamp, even though they don't deserve \ncertification.\n  Finally, sympathetic local juries trying out-of-state corporations \nbestow unjustified and sometimes outrageous awards.\n  This pattern of behavior is not only an affront to the due process \nright of the defendants, but it breeds disrespect for the rule of law \nitself.\n  Let me refer to this chart. ``Honest Abe'' would be ashamed, and I \nwould say anyone else would be ashamed who studied his life. The ``Land \nof Lincoln'' has become the land of lawsuits. Madison County has become \nthe principal place where they bring these frivolous lawsuits and where \nthey bring them because they are forum shopping. They know they can \ntake unfair advantage. It is easy to see. They hire the attorneys right \nthere in Madison County who have helped to support the judges who sit \non the bench. The juries in that county don't care what the rule of law \nis or what reasonable approaches to the law really may be.\n  The courthouse in Madison County, IL is now described as ``magnet \ncourt,'' always on the lookout to find suitable venues for enriching \nitself. Entrepreneurial plaintiffs' lawyers or personal injury lawyers, \nmany who practice in the field of personal injury, are sucked into its \norbit.\n  The numbers alone tell the story. Over the last 5 years, the number \nof class actions in the county has increased by 1,000 percent.\n  Let me repeat that so this astronomical figure can sink in: a 1,000-\npercent increase. It almost defies logic. In 1998, there were only two \nclass actions filed in the county. In 2000, that number rose to 39. In \n2001, there were 43 new class actions.\n  One year later, the bridges leading to the riches of Madison County \nwere clogged with carpet-bagging lawyers as word hit the street that \nthe local court there was giving away money like it was Christmas \nMorning. Enterprising plaintiff's lawyers looking to make a quick buck \nknew that Madison County was the place for business. This includes \nmillions of people. In 2002, 77 class action suits were field. In 2003, \nthere were another 106. Between 1998 and 2003, the number of class \nactions in the county rose from 1 to 106.\n  In the classic American musical The Music Man, a con man came to take \nadvantage of a small Midwestern town. In today's revival, a marching \nband of lawyers has descended on Madison County, with tall tales of \njackpot justice and the dream of getting something for nothing. Only \nthis time the judges of that Midwestern town have joined hands with the \ncon-men to take all of America for a ride. Even when the purveyors have \nlaw degrees on their walls, snake oil is still snake oil.\n  Just in the last 3 years, the lawyers who flocked to Madison County \nsucceeded in having the following classes certified:\n  All Sprint customers in the entire Nation who have ever been \ndisconnected on a cell phone call in a suit in Madison County; every \nRotoRooter customer in the country whose drains might have been \nrepaired by a non-licensed plumber; and all consumers who purchased \nlimited edition Barbie dolls that were later allegedly offered for a \nlower price elsewhere.\n  Those are just three examples of how ridiculous this was getting. If \nit were not so tragic, it would almost be easy to laugh at these cases. \nWe laugh at the thought of small county courthouse in Illinois \nadjudicating cases against national companies, involving various State \nand Federal regulations, and involving millions if not billions of \ndollars in settlements--but where neither the plaintiffs nor the \ndefendants are typically residents of the county. These locally elected \njudges, with the close assistance of interested plaintiffs' attorneys, \nmerrily continue to set policy for the entire nation, defying the \nprinciples of self-government on which our Federal system is based.\n  This situation is a mess and a few plaintiffs' lawyers are exploiting \nit to the hilt. The same five firms appeared as counsel in 45 percent \nof all cases filed between 1999 and 2000. Of the 66 firms appearing in \nthese cases, 56 of them--85 percent--had office addresses outside of \nMadison County.\n  In this small county, with a population of 259,000, there are somehow \nmore mesothelioma claims from asbestos exposure than in all of New York \nCity, with its population of 8 million. On 9-member firm with an office \nin Madison County claims to handle more mesothelioma cases than any \nfirm in the country.\n  And who benefits form all this litigation? One Madison County judge \napproved a $350 million settlement against AT and Lucent for \nallegedly billing customers who leased telephones at an unfair rate. \nWhat did the lawyers get? Forty-four lawyers from our firms will split \n$80 million for legal fees and $4 million for expenses. And the \ncustomers? They actually lost money. After their legal fees, the \naverage class member got hit for $6.49. That is outrageous.\n  Lincoln's example is a distant memory in Madison County and clearly \nsomething is rotten in middle America. The Washington Post has \nsuccinctly described the situation. ``Having invented a client, the \nlawyers, also get to choose a court. Under the current absurd rules, \nnational class actions can be filed in just about any court in the \ncountry.'' And those lawyers are picking Madison County. They're \npicking it because it is what some call a magic jurisdiction.\n  Dickie Scruggs happens to be a friend of mine. He made this comment. \nDickie is one of the most wealthy and successful trial lawyers in the \ncountry. But he said this regarding Madison County and the ``magic \njurisdictions.''\n\n       What I call the ``magic jurisdictions'' . . . is where the \n     judiciary is elected with verdict money. The trial lawyers \n     have established relationships with the judges that are \n     elected; they're state court judges; they're populists. \n     They're what got large populations of voters who are in on \n     the deal, they're getting their [piece] in many cases. And \n     so, it's a political force in their jurisdiction, and it's \n     almost impossible to get a fair trial if you are a defendant \n     in some of these places. The plaintiff lawyer walks in there \n     and writes the number on the blackboard, and the first juror \n     meets the last one coming out the door with the amount of \n     money. The cases are not won in the courtroom. They're won on \n     the back roads long before the case goes to trial. Any lawyer \n     fresh out of law school can walk in there and win the case, \n     so it doesn't matter what the evidence or the law is.\n\n  This was Dickie Scruggs talking to Asbestos for Lunch, in May 2002. I \nthink Dickie Scruggs has been very honest and accurate. I don't think \nanybody can deny what he is saying.\n  What makes it so magical? In a magic jurisdiction, the supposedly \nobjective judge and jury both stand to gain from the settlement. \nMadison County is, the Chicago Tribune noted, a jackpot jurisdiction \nwhere local newspapers ``sport advertisements looking for the local \nplaintiff who can provide a convenient excuse to file.''\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\n  This choice of venue might have something to do with the fact that \nthe elected judges of the circuit court of Madison County receive at \nleast three-quarters of their campaign funding from the lawyers who \nappear before them in these class action suits. Unbelievably, since it \nso obviously smacks of corruption, this is an increasingly common \noccurrence all over the country. It is all enough to make an honest \nperson cringe.\n  As a fellow attorney, who has taken an oath to support justice and \nthe law, this story of juries and judges in the back pockets of those \narguing before them, turns my stomach. Magic jurisdiction? Judicial \nblack hole is more fitting.\n  In a simpler time, a State court would only certify a class if there \nwas a substantial local connection. The judges of Madison County have \ncreated an environment, however, where a lifetime resident of \nWashington State, who worked in Washington, was allegedly exposed to \nasbestos in Washington, never received medical treatment in Illinois, \nand had no witnesses in Illinois to testify on his behalf, actually \nthought it was worth a shot to bring suit in a strange town halfway \nacross the country. What was his connection to Madison County? He \nvacationed in Illinois for 10 days with his family nearly 50 years ago.\n  In this case, the court did the right thing and refused to certify \nthis man's claim. But that a lawyer would even consider bringing it \nshows how far gone Madison County is. So far that the Illinois Supreme \nCourt took the extraordinary step of rebuking it. As legal ethics \nProfessor Susan Koniak of Boston University School of Law explains, \n``Madison County judges are infamous for approving anything put before \nthem, however unfair to the class or suggestive of collusion that is.''\n  This isn't justice. This is a travesty. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, \none of this Nation's great newspapers, has followed this epidemic of \nlitigation closely, and they describe the run on the Madison County \ncourthouse as resembling ``gleeful shoppers mobbing a going-out-of-\nbusiness sale.'' Due process itself is corrupted by this circus. What \nis going on in Madison County too closely resembles blackmail for my \ntaste. The deck is stacked against these companies hauled to Illinois \nto answer these charges. The cases are heard on an expedited basis that \nbarely gives the defendants a chance to respond. Under these pressures, \nthey are typically given an offer they can't refuse, and they settle \nregardless of the merits of the case. These ultimatums offered by \nlawyers in cahoots with judges are better suited to an episode of The \nSopranos than to a supposedly impartial justice system.\n  Let's be clear. These are not local disputes. S. 2062 does nothing to \nremove local suits from local courts. These are suits brought on behalf \nof a nationwide class of clients against corporations that do business \nin every state. Madison County is not chosen as the venue because of \nits quaint scenery. It is chosen because it is a sure thing, a sure \nbet. The fix is in. If it was a sport, we would say the game was \nthrown. Defendants in these class actions do not get a fair shake in \nMadison County.\n  This is not a triumph of federalism and local decisionmaking. It is \nthe evisceration of federalism. One of the bedrock principles of a \nFederal government is that states are largely free to regulate their \nown particular affairs. To allow one State to legislate for another is \nto violate an important principle of self-government that this country \nis built upon. In the case of Madison County, a trial bar that knows \nfew limits, coupled with a ready and able courthouse, is in fact \nimposing the will of a small few on the entire Nation. Madison County \nhas been flooded with class action claims and now the Nation is \ndrowning in them. This is a classic case for Federal intervention. In \nfact, this is a case study for the type of intervention in Federal \naffairs the Constitution was meant to allow.\n  Let me refer to what happens in Madison County and how it affects the \nwhole country. As this chart shows, the white dot in the middle is \nMadison County. The overwhelming majority of class actions filed in \nMadison County are nationwide lawsuits in which 99 percent of the class \nmembers live outside of Madison County. As a result, decisions reached \nin Madison County courts affect consumers all over the country. The \ncounty's elected judges effectively set national policies on important \ncommercial issues. They do it in a way that is basically dishonest.\n  There is a place for personal injury law in the American justice \nsystem. Americans have a sacred right to take their case to court when \nthey are harmed by a person or a product. I will stand up for those \nrights against anybody and everybody, if necessary. Yet this right is \nendangered by a seriously compromised class action regime, not just in \nMadison County but in other jurisdictions throughout this country. To \nhelp resecure it we must enact this reform.\n  Today's lawyers do not take cases that come to them, they invent \ncases. They behave like entrepreneurs who find an issue before they \nfind a plaintiff. They act like businessmen, the CEOs of Trial Lawyers \nIncorporated.\n  The problem is their business plan makes hash of our system of \nimpartial justice and mocks our Federal arrangements. Much of this has \noccurred once the Supreme Court allowed attorneys to advertise. The \ngreat lawyers never advertise. It is only those who are in business to \nrake off the top of the crop. To be honest, I personally would be \nashamed to advertise. If I was not good enough to get clients without \nadvertising, I would be ashamed. Now, it is legal under our system, but \nsince that happened, this is what is happening throughout the country.\n  It simply defies belief that the small county courts are the proper \nvenue, much less a capable one, for complex multijurisdictional \nlitigation. The plaintiffs bar has put its business model into motion \nin Madison County. First, find sympathetic judges, then bankroll their \ncampaigns, and to seal the deal rush defendants into court without \ngiving them an opportunity to investigate the claims against them. \nJustice demands fairness, but our system of decentralized class action \nlitigation is fundamentally unfair to defendants, to plaintiffs, and \nthe average American who ends up footing the bill for the unjustified \nbillion-dollar settlements.\n  I thought we would compare this to Monopoly. Let's play Class Action \nMonopoly. Go. Come up with an idea for a lawsuit. Find a named \nplaintiff to pay off. Make allegations, no proof is needed. Get out of \nrule 23--which is an appropriate rule--get out of rule 23 free. \nConvince your ``magnet'' State court judge to certify the ``class,'' \neven though it is not certifiable. File copycat lawsuits in State \ncourts all over the country. Sue as many companies in as many States as \npossible, even if they have no connection to the State.\n  Who gets the money? Columbia House case: $5 million for lawyers, \ndiscount coupons for plaintiffs. Blockbuster case, $9.25 million for \nlawyers, free movie coupons for plaintiffs. And they were not very many \nof those, at that. Bank of Boston case, $8.5 million for lawyers. Some \nplaintiffs even had to pay out of their own pockets to pay for this, \neven though they were the ones for whom the suits were allegedly \nbrought.\n  You ought to ask yourself, What happens to me? Your employer takes a \nhit, maybe lays you off. Your health and car insurance premiums go up \ndramatically, which we have been seeing. The lawyers win; you lose.\n  Almost everything in society goes out of sight and goes up in cost \nbecause of what is happening in these jurisdictions and in these cases \nthat really should never have been brought to begin with. The Class \nAction Fairness Act is a modest reform. It is not a great big change. \nIt does not deprive substantive legal rights to any American in this \ncountry. All it does is make it easier to put these national cases \nwhere they belong; that is, in our national courts. According to one \nstudy, 98 of the 113 class actions filed in Madison County from 1998 to \nearly 2002 could have been moved to Federal court under this \nlegislation.\n  Justice demands that we act. Those who are injured will get their day \nin court. By voting for S. 2062 we will help make sure they get it in a \ncourt where justice can be dispensed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank you very much for recognizing me.\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\n  I rise today to express my extreme disappointment, along with the \nSenator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, with the actions of the majority leader \nin preventing the consideration of amendments, including amendment No. \n3547, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2004. \nSenator Inouye and I filed this amendment in an effort to have our \nlegislation considered by the Senate.\n  We have been working to enact this legislation now for the past 5 \nyears. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs has favorably reported \nthis bill for the past three Congresses. Our legislation enjoys \nwidespread support in Hawaii, and nationally also. We consider this a \nbipartisan measure. Our Governor supports it, our State legislature \nsupports it, and a majority of our constituents support it. For 5 years \nwe have worked to enact this bill which has effectively been blocked \nfrom Senate consideration by a few of our Senators who refuse to \nacknowledge native Hawaiians as indigenous peoples.\n  We have the votes to pass this legislation. In fact, I am confident \nthat we have the votes to succeed on a motion to proceed to S. 344. I \nmust at this point say that S. 344 has been cosponsored by my colleague \nwho preceded me, my colleague from Utah, who is cosponsoring S. 344 as \na freestanding version of my amendment.\n  Because of the kind of support we have here on both sides of the \naisle, we are trying to have it considered. This is why we sought to \nhave our legislation considered today--because we knew we could debate \nit quickly and pass it. I join my other colleagues in expressing my \ndisappointment, again, with the procedural maneuvering that has \noccurred today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I salute my colleague and friend \nfrom Hawaii. I am honored to be a cosponsor of his bill. Senator Akaka \nand Senator Inouye are two of our very best Members in the U.S. Senate. \nIt is rare, if ever, that they ask their colleagues for a helping hand. \nIn this situation, Senator Akaka and Senator Inouye have shown \nextraordinary leadership to make recognition of a situation in their \nhome State that deserves our help. I am more than happy to join the \nSenator.\n  I am disappointed, as Senator Akaka is, that we are not going to have \na chance, apparently, to vote on this amendment. As I understand it \nnow, Senator Frist has come to the floor of the Senate and has used a \nprocedural device called ``filling the tree,'' which means he has filed \nso many amendments that no one else can file an amendment. So we are \njust stopped.\n  The underlying bill, the class action bill, is an important and \ncontroversial bill, and now Senator Frist has stopped any amendments to \nit. Among those that have been precluded is the amendment by the \nSenator from Hawaii, which has bipartisan support, a good amendment, \nand I hope we can get to it and get to it soon.\n  I see our Democratic leader in the Chamber, Senator Daschle. I know \nhe has spoken to this issue many times. I would like to address the \nclass action bill, but I will at this point yield to the minority \nleader and then ask to be recognized after he has spoken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois.\n  As I was on the Senate floor, I noticed he was calling attention to \nthe amendment that was contemplated by the two Senators from Hawaii. \nThey both spoke powerfully and eloquently about a month ago before the \ncaucus and at that time expressed the hope that the caucus could \nsupport their efforts to deal, once and for all, on the issue of \nHawaiian recognition.\n  This is a very important issue for them. I think I can say without \nequivocation or concern for contradiction that our caucus was ready to \nstand unanimously in support of their effort. But it is the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Hawaii that illustrates the point we were \nmaking earlier today.\n  There is, I am told, one person in the entire body who has an \nobjection to the amendment offered by the Senators from Hawaii--one \nperson. One person is holding up the effort made by the two Senators \nfrom Hawaii courageously and persistently to deal with this question. \nAnd they came to us for advice: What do you think we should do? My \nsuggestion was: Well, given the fact that we are in this situation, \noffer it as an amendment to the next vehicle.\n  This happens to be the next vehicle. They said: We don't need a lot \nof time. We could probably resolve this matter, given the fact there is \noverwhelming support for it, in a few minutes. I said: I will tell you \nthis: Once we get on the bill, you will have the first amendment on our \nside. And that is exactly what the case was going to be.\n  We heard already from the Senator from Idaho. He, too, has been \nworking diligently with the Senator from Massachusetts. He, too, said: \nThis is not going to take a lot of time, but there is a very critical \nquestion of temporary workers and their status today, legally, and if \nwe don't address this problem, we are going to be facing increasingly \ndifficult legal questions. And it is a crime that this--he did not use \nthe word ``crime.'' That is my word. It is a crime. It is a shame that \nwe are precluded from addressing the temporary worker issue.\n  But that goes to the heart of the situation we find ourselves in \nright now. In the first instance I can recall, the majority leader has \nnow done something I thought we would never see under his leadership. \nHe has filled the tree. He has precluded all Senators from offering \namendments. We recognized in those dark days in the late 1990s, when \nthis was done with some frequency, what a counterproductive effort that \nwas. Now we find ourselves in exactly the same situation.\n  Well, I was told this morning. I was very troubled by this action. \nNow I am told that maybe one of the reasons it was done is because \nthere are those on that side who do not want this version of class \naction passed. So in an effort to preclude this version of class action \nbeing passed, they knew if they filled the tree they would never get to \nfinal passage and they could, without fingerprints, kill this version \nof class action, knowing there would be unanimous opposition to this \nprocedural approach, just as there has been on every occasion when it \nwas done in the past.\n  So whatever the motivation was, it is counterproductive, it is a real \ndisservice to the Senators of Hawaii and Idaho and others who simply \nwant their day in court, their opportunity to present their issues, who \nhave not had that opportunity, with the calendar pages turning and the \nclock ticking and the time running out.\n  It is very unfortunate. I had told the majority leader that we would \nbe willing to work with him and I offered to have a limited number of \nnonrelevant amendments--five. He objected. So given our circumstances, \nwe are left without recourse.\n  But, again, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his kindness in \nyielding the floor for me to make a couple comments.\n  I tell the Senator from Hawaii that we will continue to find an \nopportunity for him to present his case to the Senate, and we will \nsupport him when his legislation reaches a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle, for explaining the situation. Perhaps I am mistaken or maybe \neven naive, but it strikes me that the business of the Senate is to \ndebate and amend and consider important legislation. When we reach a \npoint where there is an effort to stop the process, to stop the debate, \nor to stop an amendment, it is pretty clear the underlying bill is not \nlikely to pass. I don't understand Senator Frist's strategy, but I \nleave it to him to explain.\n  I would like to speak for a moment to the merits of the bill before \nus. It has a title anyone would fall in love with, ``Class Action \nFairness Act of 2004.'' Probably most people following this debate \nwonder why we are debating it and what it means. If you ask people if \nthey are a member of a class, they will say: Not since I graduated from \nschool, unless you mean the middle class. But this is different.\n  These are lawsuits that are brought by more than one individual in a \nparticular complaint against a certain\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\ncompany, for example. It might be all the people who did business with \na certain company who believe that they have been wronged, that they \nare entitled to some sort of compensation. It might be all the people \nliving in a community who have been victimized by the pollution of air \nor water by a certain company. So instead of filing individual lawsuits \nagainst the company or the individual responsible for the wrongdoing, \nthey come together as a class, a group of plaintiffs, and bring many \nlawsuits into one.\n  Of course, this is a challenge to bring together a class of people \nwho have a common interest. It is also difficult many times to have \nthese classes certified. In most lawsuits when you file, the first \nthing the court asks is, Do you have the right to file this lawsuit \nunder the laws of the State or jurisdiction in which you are filing?\n  When it comes to a class of plaintiffs, a group of people filing a \nlawsuit, the first thing the court asks is, Is this a legitimate legal \nclass under the law? It is the first step in the process.\n  My colleagues from Connecticut and Nevada have come to the Senate \nfloor to talk about one county in my home State of Illinois, Madison \nCounty, about the incidence of class action lawsuits in that county. \nThey have told interesting stories but not the complete story. We have \ndone an analysis of class action files in Madison County. We started in \n1996. Since 1996, through February of this year, there have been 306 \nclass actions filed. Some have said this sets a national record. It \nmay. It certainly is near the top in terms of the number of cases filed \nin this 8- or 9-year period of time. But it doesn't tell the whole \nstory.\n  The next question is, How many of these cases in Madison County, IL, \nhave been certified; that is, approved by the court to go forward? \nRemember the earlier reference I made. You file the complaint, a class \naction, and then the defendant says to the judge: I challenge the \nclass. I don't think it is a legal class under Illinois State law or \nthe law that is being applied. Then the judge has to look at the \nplaintiffs, look at the complaint, and make the decision whether he \nwill certify the class.\n  So of the 306 class actions filed in Madison County over this 8-year \nperiod of time, how many have been certified; that is, gone forward \nwith the lawsuit, over 8 years? Mr. President, 39 certified cases in 8 \nyears, fewer than 5 cases a year.\n\n  It is because of this county, obviously, that we have decided we need \nto amend the law of America because five class action cases are filed \nand certified on average each year in one county in Illinois. That \nstrikes me as curious, that we would respond with a national law \nbecause five cases a year on a class action basis are being filed in \nMadison County, IL. The Senators from Connecticut and Nevada, time and \nagain, say this is the reason.\n  Let me say in all honesty, there are some cases filed in Madison \nCounty, IL, that I don't think should be certified, some that are \nnothing short of harassment. But that is what the court system is for. \nThe court system is for a judge--in some cases, a jury--to decide that \nquestion. Is there a legitimate class action? Could there be a class \naction lawsuit filed on behalf of a group of people in America that \nshould be heard in a State court? That is the underlying question \nbecause if this bill passes, sadly, we are going to make it difficult, \nif not impossible, for State courts to try lawsuits involving classes, \nclass action lawsuits.\n  Let's use an illustration. Let's assume I own a company that I have \ndecided to incorporate in the State of Delaware, which is a common \nthing, and that I sell a product. Let's assume I sell a pharmaceutical \nproduct, a prescription drug. I want to do business in Illinois. \nAlthough I am incorporated in Delaware, I want to sell my prescription \ndrug in Illinois.\n  One of the things I have to do is register my corporation in \nIllinois. In my State you have to go to the Secretary of State's \noffice, Index Division, and register--Corporations Division today--the \nname of your corporation, where it is located, and who can be served \nwith process.\n  In other words, I have to identify a person in my corporation who \nwill accept a subpoena if my pharmaceutical company is ever sued. That \nis one of the laws in Illinois. Almost every other State has the same \nlaw. You want to do business as a corporation in Illinois, you comply \nwith the laws of Illinois. The laws of Illinois require this filing so \nyou know who is doing business, and it is also an acknowledgment that \nyou are bound by the laws of the State in which you are doing business.\n  Now, let's assume the pharmaceutical my Delaware corporation is \nselling in Illinois causes a serious problem. Let's assume many people \nget sick after they have taken my drug, and instead of each individual \nperson wanting to file a lawsuit against my pharmaceutical company, the \ncustomers who purchased this pharmaceutical decide to come together as \na class and bring a lawsuit against my company.\n  So all of the Illinois consumers and customers who bought my \npharmaceutical drug and were injured by it decide to file a lawsuit \nagainst my company because I have sold a dangerous product in their \nState.\n  Do you know what this class action fairness bill says? This bill says \nthat customers of my company--registered to do business in Illinois, \nhaving acknowledged the fact that it is bound by the laws of the State \nof Illinois, selling its product in Illinois, having injured consumers \nin Illinois--cannot file a class action lawsuit in the State courts of \nIllinois. Why? Why would we say in that circumstance all of the injured \nparties, residents of the State, the product is sold in the State by a \ncorporation licensed to do business in the State, can't be sued in the \nState of Illinois or any other State for that matter with similar \ncircumstances?\n\n  This legislation says the lawsuit must be brought in the Federal \ncourt system. We have two different court systems, two major court \nsystems. There are other courts but two major court systems. Each State \nhas a court system, and then there is the Federal court system which, \nof course, applies to us as a nation with its district and circuit \ncourts, and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Why would the people who wrote this bill want to take that case that \nI have just described out of the courts of Illinois and put it into a \nFederal court, even in Illinois? Why?\n  I think the reason is obvious. First, they are trying to create an \nenvironment and circumstance where that group of people who bought that \nproduct and were injured by it cannot bring a lawsuit. They want to \nmake it more difficult for them to bring a lawsuit as a class of \ncustomers who have been wronged and injured. They put it in Federal \ncourt because they know Federal courts are already extremely busy with \ncriminal prosecutions and existing civil cases, so the likelihood that \nthe Federal courts will take on a new class action case is limited. \nThey also know that these Federal courts, when it comes to figuring out \nwhich laws to apply, are very strict, much stricter than many State \ncourts.\n  So those who are arguing that we are changing this law, moving cases \nfrom State court to Federal court so we can get a more efficient \noutcome, I don't think are being candid with the people following this \ndebate.\n  The underlying reason for this bill, the so-called Class Action \nFairness Act of 2004, is to limit and restrict the number of class \naction lawsuits that can be brought across America. That is why the \nbusiness interests in this town have spent not a small fortune, but a \nlarge fortune, lobbying for passage of this bill. They are not looking \nfor reform of class action; they are looking for repeal of class \nactions in many areas, to stop people from filing these lawsuits.\n  Those who are following the debate may say: Why should I even care \nabout that? I am not going to file a lawsuit or join a class filing a \nlawsuit, and I don't care if anybody else does either.\n  I wish people would step back and take into consideration some of the \nclass action lawsuits that have been filed. I think you will get an \nidea about why this is an important part of our legal process. We have \nthree branches of Government: legislative, Congress; executive, the \nPresident; and the court system at the State and Federal level. We say \nto Americans you have a right to elect the President, you have a right \nto elect Members to Congress, and you also have a right to go into your \nState and Federal courts and be represented and to plead your case and \nto receive justice.\n  What this underlying bill will do is to restrict individual American \ncitizens\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\nin their rights to come together as a class and file lawsuits in State \ncourts against corporations doing business in their States, selling \ngoods and services in their States.\n  Let's look at a few examples of class action lawsuits which I think \nillustrate these are not cases that should be easily dismissed or \nrestricted, as the bill does. Here is a product made by Warner Lambert, \na drug company. Warner Lambert made a product known as Rezulin. They \nprescribed it for type II diabetes and started selling it in 1997. They \ntold the people it was as safe as a placebo, extraordinarily safe, and \nnot harmful to consumers.\n  There was a couple living in Granite City, IL, which happens to be in \nMadison County, and the man who lived there was suffering from \ndiabetes. He was an older fellow who served in the Navy. There are many \npeople like him in those blue-collar neighborhoods in Granite City. He \nwas on oxygen at age 71. He got along pretty well, but he had heart \nproblems and bypass surgery. Unfortunately, he had to take some \nmedications. He took nitro tablets and about 15 medications a day, two \nof which were insulin. He was diagnosed with diabetes 20 years ago and \nhad very few complications. He went to his doctor and the doctor \nprescribed Rezulin, which is made by Warner Lambert. He remembers when \nthe prescription was given to him because when he went to the \ndrugstore, he found out it was very expensive. He told the doctor he \ncould not afford it. The doctor gave him samples to take home.\n  Three years after this drug, Rezulin, came on the market, the FDA \nasked Warner Lambert to voluntarily remove the drug from the market \nbecause it was causing too high an incidence of liver failure and many \nother deadly side effects. Then this individual was taken off the drug \nbecause of that warning. They gave him another drug.\n  A class action lawsuit was filed by people who purchased this drug in \nIllinois. The case they brought said the pharmaceutical company \nviolated the New Jersey consumer fraud statute, which is the State in \nwhich Warner Lambert was incorporated. They violated the New Jersey \nconsumer fraud statute by pricing the drug much more in excess of the \nprice the drug would have been. If anybody had known the side effects, \nnobody would have taken it, anyway. So not having disclosed the side \neffects, Warner Lambert was still charging more than they should have \nbeen charging for the drug. It turns out many insurance companies came \nto the same conclusion. They thought they were paying too much to \nWarner Lambert for a drug that wasn't that good and had deadly side \neffects.\n\n  The case was certified by the Illinois State court as a class action \non behalf of all of the purchasers of this drug in Illinois, and the \ncase would apply New Jersey law as the violation of the consumer fraud \nstatute. Shortly after the class was certified, the parties agreed to a \nsettlement, and here was the settlement: Class members, those who \nbought the drug Rezulin, would receive up to 85 percent of their out-\nof-pocket expenses related to the prescription drug.\n  While Warner Lambert's liability for concealing the true dangers is \nclear, look what happened when you see the same lawsuit brought to a \nFederal court, which this underlying bill would try to achieve, as \nopposed to Illinois State court. When this lawsuit was brought in a \nFederal court in the Southern District of New York, that Federal court \ndenied class certification and basically came to the conclusion that if \nthe drug was dangerous, there would be an awful lot of personal injury \ncases filed. Therefore, this class action wasn't necessary.\n  The Illinois trial court disagreed. As a result, the victims in \nIllinois received compensation. It turned out they were going to \nreceive up to 85 percent of their out-of-pocket expenses for this drug. \nThat is an example of a class action lawsuit.\n  You go to the doctor tomorrow. He prescribes a drug. You find it was \noverpriced or dangerous and an effort is made to say to the \npharmaceutical company you cannot benefit from these ill-gotten gains, \nyou must pay back to the consumers what you overcharged. A class of \nconsumers who brought the drug came together and they received the \nmoney back from the pharmaceutical company, as they did in this class \naction case. This is an illustration. In Illinois, the case went \nforward. Consumers had money come back to them. In the Federal court, \nthe case was basically stopped.\n  Here is another one. This involves a New York State court certifying \na class of over 200 nursing home residents living at Barnwell Nursing \nHome in Valatie, NY.\n  In the process of certification, it was found the Barnwell Nursing \nHome residents potentially received substandard care, violating the \npublic health laws of the State, which protect nursing home residents \nfrom the deprivation of basic necessities like heat, good food, \nprivacy, and socialization.\n  The plaintiff died of septic shock because she was neglected by \nnursing home staff. Following her death, the New York Department of \nPublic Health issued a 24-page statement of deficiencies at the \nBarnwell home. The reason I raise this is to give you an idea of the \nvariety of class action cases. Here, 200 residents of a nursing home \nwere not receiving what they were required to receive under State law. \nOne died from neglect in that nursing home. They came together as a \nclass to say the nursing home was not treating them fairly. Some would \nargue, why didn't they file individual lawsuits? How likely is it your \ngrandfather or grandmother who is in a nursing home will look for a \nlawyer to fight a lawsuit in court, when in fact they have been treated \nwrongly? But as a class they stand together, bring the lawsuit, and \nthey can recover.\n\n  There are so many other cases. Here is one. On July 26, 1993, the \nchemical Oleum, a sulfuric acid compound, leaked from a railroad tank \ncar at General Chemical's Richmond, CA, plant. General Chemical, based \nin New Jersey, is one of the largest manufacturers of sulfuric acid in \nAmerica. The leak caused a cloud to spread over North Richmond, CA, a \nheavily populated community. Over 24,000 people sought medical \ntreatment in the days following the leak. General Chemical entered into \na $180 million class action settlement with 60,000 northern California \nresidents who were injured or sought treatment from the effects of the \nrelease of this dangerous gas. While only California residents were \ninjured and the harm occurred only in California, this case would have \nbeen removed from California courts under the bill we are considering \nto a Federal court. Why? Because the company, General Chemical, was \nbased in New Jersey. All of the injuries were in California, all the \nvictims were in California, the actual harm occurred in California, the \ncompany was doing business in California, transporting its chemicals. \nYet under this bill they could not be sued in a California court.\n  We talk about dangerous drugs. Postal workers were given Cipro after \nthe anthrax attacks of 2001. We remember that on Capitol Hill. Many of \nthem were from New Jersey. The postal workers filed a class action in \nNew Jersey State court for damages and harm arising from the drug's \nside effects. The suit was filed against Bayer AG--you have heard of \nBayer Aspirin; it's the same German company--and its U.S. subsidiary \nthat is based in Pennsylvania, as well as against several New Jersey \nhospitals. The side effects listed in the suit include joint and tendon \ninjuries; neurologic, cardiologic, or central nervous system disorders; \nand gastrointestinal disorders. Bayer sold the drug. The people who \nused it were largely from New Jersey. Bayer was a company based in \nPennsylvania, but doing business in New Jersey.\n  In this case, while several named defendants are New Jersey \nhospitals, the case would have been removed to Federal court. The \nreason behind this is not only to move them to Federal court, but to \nmake it less likely the cases could be successfully filed. We have \nseen, when cases are brought to Federal court, they favor less \nliability. We have seen that the Federal courts are less likely to \ncertify class. We have seen that Federal law discourages Federal judges \nfrom providing remedies under State laws.\n  The people who brought this bill to the floor understand that. \nWhether it is because of a dangerous gas leak in California or a drug \nthat is sold in Illinois or New Jersey, they want to limit their \nliability and exposure. So they are basically closing the courthouse \ndoor to hundreds, if not thousands, of American citizens.\n\n[[Page S7717]]\n\n  Whether we are talking about environmental pollution that is \ndangerous to our families caused by an out-of-State company, or about a \ndangerous gas leak here, the purpose of this bill is to make it more \ndifficult for injured individuals, injured customers, and injured \nfamilies to recover.\n  Why in the world would we do this? We do this because the businesses \nthat are being sued by these class action lawsuits do not want to be \nexposed to these lawsuits. By having less exposure to these lawsuits, \nthey will be able to keep more money. They will not pay out as much to \nthose who have been injured or aggrieved. That is a natural business \nreaction. They want to maximize profits. Businesses want to do that. \nBut is that the right reaction of the Senate to ignore the victims in \nthese lawsuits, to ignore the people who come together because they \nhave been hurt, damaged, or lost money, and to say instead we are going \nto protect these corporations from these lawsuits?\n  There are ways of tightening up the laws when it comes to class \nactions. I would support them. I think there are frivolous class \nactions that should not go forward. I think some of these coupon \nsettlements as part of these class action lawsuits border on the \nridiculous if not cross the border.\n  There is a lot we can do to tighten up the law. But why is it the \nonly thing this Senate has been about in its debate over the last \nseveral years is limiting the opportunity of an American citizen to \nhave a day in court? Why is it that is what is driving the Senate \nagenda?\n  It is important for us to understand that when it comes to the \npriorities of this Nation, we need to establish one priority over all, \nand that is the priority of equal justice under the law.\n  If a resident of Nebraska or Illinois or New York were injured by a \nproduct sold in their State by a company licensed to do business in \ntheir State, I believe they should be able to go to their State court \nand file a class action and ask that it be certified. This underlying \nbill says they cannot, and I refer to page 15, subsection 2, and I will \nread it:\n\n       The district courts--\n\nFederal courts--\n\n     shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action in which \n     the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of \n     $5,000,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is a class \n     action in which\n       (A) any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a \n     State different from any defendant. . . .\n\n  If a corporation is incorporated in Delaware or any other State and \ndoes business in your State, this is an automatic pass. This means your \nclass action lawsuit goes automatically to Federal court.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist across the street does not give us much \nadvice--separation of powers, two different branches of Government--but \nhe has given advice on this issue: Please do not pass these bills. \nPlease do not send these class actions to Federal court.\n\n  Those of us who sit on the Judiciary Committee know many of our \nFederal courts are extremely busy. They are dealing with cases \ninvolving criminal law, terrorism, and a very crowded civil docket \nalready. What this bill would do is send these same complex class \naction lawsuits, now in State courts, off to the Federal courts in \nlarge number. Chief Justice Rehnquist has advised us that the Federal \ncourt system is not ready to receive these cases.\n  What does that mean? It means the people who are in the classes will \nnot get their day in court. Justice will be delayed and ultimately \ndenied to them, and that is part of the strategy. The strategy is to \nmake it extremely difficult to bring a class action lawsuit, to limit \nthe opportunities for those who have been injured, either in body or in \nmonetary loss, from having their day in court.\n  This bill has bipartisan sponsorship. There are 10 or 11 Democrats \nwho support it. I am sure they will speak on behalf of it, but from \nwhere I am standing, I think this goes far beyond class action reform. \nThis is an effort to close the courthouse doors. For some, that is \nfine. They say, fine, don't let them go to court because it means they \nwill have lawyers and lawyers will be paid fees and we do not want to \nsee that sort of situation.\n  Time and again, when we tell the stories of the individuals who have \nbeen harmed or injured, who are looking for someplace to turn, they \ncannot find a law that has been passed by Congress that gives them a \nfighting chance, they cannot find an agency of the Government that is \ngoing to protect them. Their only recourse and final recourse is to go \nto court. The purpose of this Class Action Fairness Act of 2004 is to \nclose the courthouse door to hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans \nwho buy defective products, who are exposed to dangerous pollution, who \nare buying drugs that, frankly, are unsafe and believe the \npharmaceutical companies should be held accountable. This bill will \nclose the courthouse door and make it extremely difficult, if not \nimpossible, for them to pursue their legal course of action.\n  I think that is the wrong way to go. I know the business community \nand the special interests behind them think the fewer lawsuits filed \nagainst them the better. I assume if my job in life were to maximize \nprofits in these companies, I would think the same thing. But that is \nnot our job. Our job is to provide equal access under the law to all \nAmericans.\n  This bill, the class action fairness bill, is going to restrict, \nreduce, and deny access to the court system for Americans who have been \ninjured.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n2062, the Class Action Fairness Act. Until this morning, I was very \nhopeful we would finally have the opportunity to discuss this important \nissue and move the bill forward.\n  As is well known now, last fall I joined with my colleagues, the \nSenator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, and the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu, to help craft a compromise that now constitutes the bill \nbefore us. Because I have worked long and hard to move this bill \nforward, I was very disappointed at the turn of events earlier today.\n  We have two strains going on here that are sort of colliding, and I \ndo not think they should necessarily collide. One is the desire of a \nmajority in this Chamber--62 at last count--on both sides of the aisle \nto move the class action bill forward, and that desire remains. That \nburns brightly in my breast. I think we should move this bill. There \nhas been a lot of work put into it. There have been compromises along \nthe road. It strikes a fair balance, and I will talk more about that in \na minute.\n  We also have the workings of the Senate, and that always is grafted \non top of whatever legislation we have. We all know the majority party \nis allowed to set the agenda, and next week, for instance, we are doing \na constitutional amendment against gay marriage, which no one thinks \nwill come close to the two-thirds vote, but it is the majority's right \nto set that agenda. That is fair. But just as it is the majority's \nright to set the agenda, it is the minority's right to offer \namendments--some germane, some not--on whatever is before us. That is \nwhat has always kept the balance in this Chamber. The majority does not \nhave complete control of what is on the agenda because of our \nnongermaneness rule. That is what distinguishes us more than anything \nelse, at least procedurally, from the House of Representatives where \nthe Rules Committee can block off all amendments, and the majority can \nhave iron-tight control.\n  To me, this fits the Founding Fathers' basic conception of the Senate \nas the cooling saucer. When the majority has certain rights, it slow \nthings down, there is no question about it.\n  That delay--delay is the wrong word--but that sort of more careful \nrendering of the process often makes better legislation. As we know, \nthe Founding Fathers were afraid that legislation would move too \nquickly through the body, and the Senate embodies that.\n  This morning, I thought the offer of the Senator from South Dakota, \nMr. Daschle, was extremely reasonable. He said let us do four or five \nnongermane amendments and then proceed to the\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\ngermane amendments. I do not recall if he said it on the Senate floor--\nI did not hear his whole speech--but he has said to all of us on the \nDemocratic side who want to move class action reform that we would not \ntake hours and hours and days and days on each of the nongermane \namendments; that the debate would be done rather quickly. Well, that is \nthe minority's right. That is what it is all about.\n  When Senators Dodd, Landrieu, Carper, Kohl, and I, all of whom have \nworked so long and hard on this bill, met with the majority leader and \nothers, we made it perfectly clear about the right of the minority to \noffer a limited number of nongermane amendments, not one but a number. \nWhen Senator Daschle said five, that seemed perfectly reasonable to us, \nand that was rejected by the majority leader. This puts us and the \nwhole class action bill at risk.\n  Make no mistake about it, if we cannot work this out, we will not \nhave a bill. Even if we do work it out, it is going to be difficult \nenough to get a bill. The kinds of abuses I have worried about and why \nI was willing to step forward and support this bill as modified will be \nlost.\n  So the first thing I will do today is make a plea to our majority \nleader, who I believe does operate in good faith--I realize he has a \nfractious caucus behind him and there are different opinions within \nthat caucus, but I urge the majority leader to reconsider his rejection \nor objection to Senator Daschle's offer, which I thought was fair and \nreasonable. I know that my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, \nthinks that because I heard him speak on the floor earlier today. I \nthink it would be seen as reasonable as well, if I am not speaking out \nof turn, by most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, the 10, \n11, or 12 of us who support class action reform.\n  So make no mistake about it, if the bill does not move forward, it is \nbecause the majority was unwilling to allow the Senate to proceed as \nusual, which is to allow some nongermane amendments.\n  For many on our side of the aisle--not me because I support it--this \nis a bitter pill to swallow. To then add insult to injury saying no \nnongermane amendments are allowed will be the straw that breaks the \ncamel's back. Even allowing one nongermane amendment would not be \nenough.\n  So, again, I renew my plea to the majority leader--and I want to \nunderscore, again, I met with him numerous times on this legislation, \nand I believe he is functioning in good faith and he wants a bill--to \nreconsider Senator Daschle's offer. It will not take much time. My \nguess is we can consider those amendments quickly.\n  Of the five that I have heard about, two are Republican amendments. \nWe all heard the good Senator from Idaho who seems to want to be able \nto offer his amendment, an amendment that I support on the floor, and I \nthink one of the others is from the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain. \nSo it is hardly that the nongermane amendments are a Democratic wish \nlist. If there are five, and two are Republican and three Democrat, \nthat seems to be a pretty fair division.\n\n  I renew my plea to the majority leader to accept Senator Daschle's \noffer, which I think was fair and reasonable. If not, we risk having no \nbill, despite the efforts of many of us.\n  I want to discuss for a minute why I support this legislation. I have \nbeen concerned for some time that lawsuits have gotten out of control \nin America. I am not one of those who think lawsuits have no use. I \nthink they have plenty of use and they are needed. Often those without \npower, it is their only bit of power to get redress. There is no \nquestion about it.\n  At a time when we are pulling back from governmental regulation--I \nwould much prefer to see government regulate, whether it is pollution, \nhealth care, or other things, than have lawsuits do it. Lawsuits are \nsort of a hit-or-miss way. But the impetus for lawsuits increases as \nthe impetus for government regulation decreases, and obviously in this \nadministration it has.\n  Having said that, I still believe we need lawsuits, but they should \nbe done fairly. One of my big beefs is that for some time now too many \nlawsuits have been filed in local State courts that have no connection \nto the plaintiff, the defendant, or the conduct at issue. This allows \nforum shopping. Forum shopping is something that undercuts the basic \nfairness of our justice system.\n  Certain courts in certain places--and people have talked about it \nearlier today--have become magnets for all kinds of lawsuits. Some of \nthese lawsuits are meritorious; some are not meritorious. In either \nscenario, my strong belief is that if the case affects the Nation as a \nwhole, it should be heard in Federal court. One should not have a judge \nin a small county make law for all of America. Maybe that judge will \nmake good law, but the odds are that parochial concerns will be too \nstrong in that type of decision.\n  For that reason, I agreed with my colleagues who support this bill \nthat something needed to be done to rein in forum shopping and abusive \nclass action litigation tactics. When consumers allege that a product \nsold nationwide to consumers in all 50 States is defective, it ought to \nbe a Federal court to decide that case. Actually, my belief is that \nprobably there should be Federal law to decide those kinds of cases, \nand eventually we will probably move in that direction, but at the very \nleast it ought to be the Federal court.\n  This bill does not take away anyone's right to sue or his or her \nability to bring a suit as a class action. I oppose such legislation. I \nwould not want to eliminate class actions. Instead, the bill ensures \nthat consumers, employees, and all citizens have an opportunity to have \ntheir class action heard in court, but it is a Federal court.\n  We worked hard to improve the bill. The agreement that we have struck \non class action lawsuits preserves the ability of Americans to bring \nlawsuits in a fair and responsible way, while doing away with forum \nshopping and other abusive tactics. This is why the three of us, \nSenators Landrieu, Dodd, and myself, were willing to stick our necks \nout a little bit and work on this compromise with Senator Kohl, who has \nbeen a leader on this issue on the Judiciary Committee, and Senator \nCarper, who has championed the proposal for so long. We want to see the \nbill move forward.\n  The bottom line is that it will not unless the Democratic leader--and \nI want to salute the Democratic leader. He does not like this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I salute our Democratic leader. I know, because he has \nexpressed it to me in very clear terms, how much he dislikes this bill. \nInstead of trying to delay, he has come up with a reasonable proposal.\n  As I said, the bill is a bitter pill for many to swallow. They have a \ndifferent view on class action lawsuits than I do or my good friend \nfrom California, who just came into the Chamber, but they are willing \nto do it because they know there is a majority of 61 or 62 who \nbasically support this proposal.\n  So the bottom line, again, is the Senator from South Dakota has made \na reasonable proposal. He is not offering dilatory tactics, and I hope \nthat proposal will be accepted.\n  I have not been a Member of this body as long as many of my \ncolleagues, but in my 6 years, I have come to appreciate that the \nSenate is designed to be a deliberative body. Sometimes the Senate \nlives up to this grand tradition of debate and process very well, but \nat other times, and that is what it looks like is happening up to now \ntoday, we fail. We have to let the deliberative process of the Senate \ntake its course if the Class Action Fairness Act is to become law.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the minority side has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I was going to speak in favor of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the proponent's side contains 55 \nminutes, so the Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of the bill, but I also wish \nto say that I very much hope some accommodation can be reached so this \nbill can\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\ncome to a vote. It is an important bill. It is a bill that deals with a \nvery real problem, and I would like to challenge every Member of this \naugust body to read this bill. I have read it twice. It is easily \nunderstood. It is in very plain English. It essentially provides a \nguide to consumers as to the protocols and regulations that govern what \nhas been a murky area of class action lawsuits. It is legislation that \nis long overdue.\n  I very much appreciate the position of my leader, Senator Daschle, in \nwanting to protect our minority rights, in wanting to have an \nopportunity to have a debate on bills that Members on this side think \nare extraordinarily important, as do Members on the other side. In the \npast, a fair way has been found, so I hope that will be the case.\n  As I said, I believe the way class actions are conducted is, in fact, \na real problem. I have spent a considerable amount of time on the issue \nthrough Judiciary hearings, many personal meetings with those on both \nsides of the issues, plaintiffs and defendants, and a lot of time and \nenergy on research and analysis. I eventually came to the conclusion \nthat the supporters of this bill have clearly identified this problem \nand have come up with a reasoned solution.\n  More than identifying the problem, the supporters of this bill--\nSenator Kohl, Senator Grassley, Senator Carper, and others--have worked \ndiligently over the course of the last few years to answer criticisms \nand concerns, to address real issues, and even to make significant \nchanges in the original legislation, changes that made this bill better \nat every single turn. The bill before us, then, is the result of many \nchanges and compromises, both in the Judiciary Committee and more \nrecently changes made after further negotiations with Senator Schumer \nand others pending floor action. Simply put, the legislation in its \ncurrent form is more moderate, more reasoned, and will be more \neffective than past versions of the bill.\n  I thank Senators Hatch, Grassley, and Kohl for so diligently working \nwith me and others throughout this process to correct a number of \npotential problems or areas of confusion that were within the original \nbill. I know they have many forces pulling on them from all sides, and \nI appreciate the time they spent in addressing these concerns.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the legislation and what it does and \nhow I became involved in it. I will never forget a hearing before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee 2 years ago. At that hearing, we heard from \na woman by the name of Hilda Bankston. She owned a small pharmacy with \nher late husband, in Mississippi. Since that time, Mrs. Bankston sent a \nletter to us, and she summed up her testimony before the committee. I \nwant to read it to you.\n\n       My name is Hilda Bankston and I live in Fayette, \n     Mississippi. I am a former small business owner who was \n     victimized by lawyers looking to strike it rich in Jefferson \n     County and I write to you today to tell you that our legal \n     system is broken and that the Class Action Fairness Act will \n     help fix it.\n\n  Over the next few days, et cetera, et cetera, we will be debating \nthis legislation. This is the important part, this is what she said in \ncommittee, and this is the overarching need to stop forum shopping:\n\n       For thirty years, my husband, Navy Seaman Fourth Class \n     Mitchell Bankston, and I lived our dream, owning and \n     operating Bankston Drugstore in Fayette, Mississippi. We \n     worked hard and my husband built a solid reputation as a \n     caring, honest pharmacist.\n       But our world and our dreams were shaken to their \n     foundation in 1999, when Bankston Drugstore was named as a \n     defendant in a national class action lawsuit brought in \n     Jefferson County against one of the nation's largest drug \n     companies, the manufacturer of Fen-Phen, an FDA-approved drug \n     for weight loss.\n\n  Here is where it gets difficult, and now I am speaking, not quoting \nMrs. Bankston. Fen-Phen certainly had problems. The reason for \nlitigation can be very clear. However, the rationale for forum shopping \nand, more importantly, how forum shopping is conducted, is what this \nletter and what Hilda Bankston's story is all about.\n\n       Though Mississippi law does not allow for class action \n     lawsuits, it does allow for consolidation of lawsuits or mass \n     actions as long as the case involves a plaintiff or defendant \n     from Mississippi.\n\n  Here it is:\n\n       Since ours was the only drugstore in Jefferson County and \n     had filled a prescription for Fen-Phen, a drug whose \n     manufacturer is headquartered in New Jersey, the plaintiffs' \n     attorney named us in their lawsuits so they could keep the \n     case in a place already known for its lawsuit-friendly \n     environment. They could use our records as a virtual database \n     of potential clients.\n\n  So not only was she not involved, they just happened to fill a \nprescription and they became a source for litigation.\n\n       Mitch had always taken the utmost care and caution with his \n     patients. As the Fen-Phen case drew more attention, he became \n     increasingly concerned about what our customers would think. \n     His integrity, honor, and reputation were on the line. \n     Overnight, our life's work had gone from serving the public's \n     health to becoming a means to an end for some trial lawyers \n     to cash in on lucrative class action lawsuits.\n       Three weeks after being named in the lawsuit, Mitch, who \n     was 58 years old and in good health, died suddenly of a \n     massive heart attack. In the midst of my grief, I was called \n     to testify in the first Fen-Phen trial.\n       I sold the pharmacy in 2000, but have spent many years \n     since retrieving records for plaintiffs and getting dragged \n     into court again and again to testify in hundreds of national \n     lawsuits brought in Jefferson County against the pharmacy and \n     out-of-state manufacturers of other drugs. Class action \n     attorneys have caused me to spend countless hours retrieving \n     information for potential plaintiffs. I've searched record \n     after record and made copy after copy for use against me. At \n     times, the bookwork has been so extensive that I have lost \n     track of the specific cases. I had to hire personnel to watch \n     the store while I was dragged into court on numerous \n     occasions to testify. I endured the whispers and questions of \n     my customers and neighbors wondering what we did to end up in \n     court so often. And, I spent many sleepless nights wondering \n     if my business would survive the tidal wave of lawsuits \n     cresting over it. Today, even though I no longer own the \n     drugstore, I still get named as a defendant time and again.\n       This lawsuit frenzy has hurt my family and my community. \n     Businesses will no longer locate in Jefferson County because \n     of fear of litigation. The county's reputation has driven \n     liability insurance rates through the roof.\n       No small business should have to endure the nightmares I \n     have experienced. I'm not a lawyer, but to me, something is \n     wrong with our legal system when innocent bystanders are \n     little more than pawns for lawyers seeking to win the \n     ``jackpot'' in Jefferson County--or any other county in the \n     United States where lawsuits are ``big business.''\n\n  This is really the point. I heard the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois make a very important point about the different kinds of cases \nthat are involved. But what we are talking about is forum shopping. It \nis specifically setting up a class action to be able to get that case \ninto a specific place, a friendly county.\n  The Bankstons were actually sued more than 100 times for doing \nnothing other than filling legal prescriptions. The pharmacy had done \nnothing wrong. They were the only drugstore in the county, a county \nthat was so plaintiff friendly, I am told, that there are actually more \nplaintiffs than residents.\n  Because of the arcane and problematic rules now governing class \nactions in U.S. courts, the plaintiffs' lawyers shopping for a friendly \ncourt just needed to name a local business in order to file their \nnational lawsuit in that county. That is all it took. Before they knew \nit, the Bankstons were defendants in dozens of essentially frivolous \nsuits against their small pharmacy.\n  This was a family torn apart by litigation. I use this case because, \nof all the hearings that have been held in the Judiciary Committee in \n12 years, this woman made a profound impression on me as I sat there \nhour after hour and listened to the testimony.\n  Let me hasten to say that this abuse comes from just some class \naction lawyers--not all of them but some--who forum shop national class \naction lawsuits and file them in States and counties where they know \nthe court will approve settlements favorable to them without concern \nfor class members.\n  What does this bill do? The amended Class Action Fairness Act goes a \nlong way toward stopping forum shopping by allowing Federal courts to \nhear national class action lawsuits that involve plaintiffs and \ndefendants from different States and which involve more than 5 million \nin claims. I think the original bill was 2 million. We amended it in \ncommittee to make it even bigger so we could be sure as to the kinds of \ncases that would be affected.\n  The Framers of the Constitution wanted Federal courts to settle \ndisputes between citizens of different\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\nStates. They wanted Federal courts to settle disputes between different \ncitizens of different States. The Constitution itself states that the \nFederal judicial power ``shall extend . . . to controversies between \ncitizens of different States.''\n  Historically, this meant that when one person sues another person who \nlives in another State, or sues a company headquartered in another \nState, the suit can be moved to Federal court with some limitations.\n  Class actions involve more citizens in more States, more money, and \nmore interstate commerce ramifications than any other type of civil \nlitigation. It only stands to reason that many of these cases should be \nheard in Federal courts. Yet an anomaly in our current law has resulted \nin a disparity wherein class actions are treated differently than \nregular cases and often stay in State court. The current rules of \nprocedure have not kept up with the times, and the result is a broken \nsystem that has strayed far from the Framers' intent.\n  This bill does a number of things. First, the bill contains a \n``consumer class action bill of rights''--and it is important, and you \nwill really see it is understandable--to provide greater information \nand greater oversight of settlements that might unfairly benefit \nattorneys at the expense of truly injured parties.\n\n  Let me give you some examples. The bill ensures that judges review \nthe fairness of proposed settlements if those settlements provide only \ncoupons to the plaintiffs. What is wrong with that? Coupons are a real \nproblem. They are a way by which a plaintiff actually receives very \nlittle or something that is very difficult to recover.\n  Second, it bans settlements that actually impose net costs on class \nmembers. I could read letters from individuals where they actually came \nout the losers in these suits.\n  Third, it requires that all settlements be written in plain English \nso all class members can understand their rights. How can anybody fault \nthat? Write it so people who read them can understand what they say.\n  The bill also provides that State attorneys general can review \nsettlements involving plaintiffs from their States so the consumers get \nan extra level of protection from someone elected to serve--not just \nplaintiffs' attorneys who may be trying to get the best settlement for \ntheir own interests.\n  Second, and of greater impact, the legislation creates a new set of \nrules for when a class action may be ``removed'' to Federal court.\n  These new rules are diversity requirements modified in committee and \nagain since then make it clear that cases which are truly national in \nscope should be removed to Federal court. But equally important, the \nrules preserve truly State actions so those confined to one State \nremain in State courts.\n  Since I have offered this amendment in committee, the so-called \ndiversity amendment, I believe it made it much better, more narrowly \ntailored. I think my amendment went right to the heart of the bill and \nits purpose. So I would like to spend a few minutes to talk about these \namendments, how it changed the original bill and the ways in which I \nbelieve it is more clear, more fair, and more workable.\n  I offered one amendment, cosponsored by Senators Hatch, Kohl, and \nGrassley, that was meant to do two things. First, it simplifies the \ndiversity jurisdiction section of the bill. Second, it narrows the \nscope of the bill by reducing the number of cases that automatically go \nto Federal court. This will allow Federal courts to focus on the cases \nthat are truly national in scope rather than cases that really belong \nin State courts.\n  This amendment only addressed the jurisdiction issues. It did nothing \nto change the rest of the bill which contains very important \nprotections for consumers, and it makes the whole settlement process \nmuch more fair. Let me explain it.\n  The original class action bill essentially moved all class actions of \na certain size--I think more than 2 million--to Federal court unless \n``a substantial majority of the members of the proposed class and the \nprimary defendants are citizens of the State in which the action was \noriginally filed.''\n  The case will be governed primarily by the laws of that State.\n  The original bill says that all class actions where a substantial \nmajority of the members of the class and the defendants are citizens of \nthe State would be moved to the Federal court.\n  We changed that. The standard was vague and it was prone to moving \nsome truly State class actions into Federal court.\n  My amendment, which was accepted by the committee, changed the law in \nthis section to split the jurisdiction into thirds. Now there is less \nambiguity about where a case will end up, and more cases remain in \nState court.\n  Let me explain that. If more than two-thirds of the plaintiffs are \nfrom the same State as the primary defendant, the case automatically \nstays in State court--it is clear; it is defined in the bill--even if \nboth parties ask for it to be removed to Federal court. It is very \ndifferent from the original bill. If we have two-thirds of the \nplaintiffs and the defendant company in a State, the case stays in the \nState.\n  If fewer than one-third of the plaintiffs are from the same State as \nthe primary defendant, the case may automatically be removed to Federal \ncourt. Remember, this happens if one of the parties asks for removal. \nOtherwise, these cases, too, stay in State court. This may have escaped \na lot of people. So even when there are fewer than one-third of the \nplaintiffs from the same State as the primary defendant, the case \nremains in State court unless one of the parties asks to remove it.\n  Now we are talking about the middle third in this diversity. We have \na third, a third in the middle, a third on the end. In the middle third \nof cases, where between one-third and two-thirds of plaintiffs are from \nthe same State as the primary defendant, the amendment gives the \nFederal judge discretion to accept removal or remand the case back to \nthe State based on a number of factors. In determining whether one of \nthese middle third cases would go to Federal or State court, the \namendment directed the Federal judge to consider these facts:\n  First, the judge must examine whether the case represents primarily a \nState issue or whether it is of national impact. There are strong \narguments to be made that State judges should not be making national \nlaw. This provision is meant to reach into that issue.\n  Second, the judge must consider whether the number of plaintiffs from \nthe defendant's home State is much larger than the number of plaintiffs \nfrom any other State. In other words, there may be a case where 40 \npercent of the plaintiffs from California and no other State has more \nthan a couple percent of the class. California law would apply. So even \nthough the California plaintiffs do not make up an absolute majority of \na class, they would clearly be the predominant portion of the class. If \nit is a State issue, such a case would remain in State court. The \nFederal judge would also look at whether the case was filed in State \ncourt simply because the plaintiffs are trying to game the system, \nperhaps by forum shopping for the best court, even when the case would \nbetter be tried elsewhere.\n  Finally, the judge is directed to look at whether this is the only \nclass action likely to be filed on the same subject--this is \nimportant--or whether there are likely to be others with the same facts \nat issue. This factor has been even further refined to provide that a \njudge need not consider whether similar class actions may be filed but \nonly whether similar class actions have actually been filed in the last \n3 years. In order to avoid duplication, the judge would look at whether \nthere were other like actions filed in the last 3 years.\n  Considering duplicative class actions is important because the \nFederal courts have a system in place to consolidate multidistrict \nlitigation. It may therefore be better to have all duplicative class \naction cases move to Federal court simply to save time and make the \nprocess more efficient. If a case stays in State court it cannot \nbe consolidated with similar cases out of State. Therefore, we might \nend up with 50 State judges deciding 50 cases involving exactly the \nsame defendant and exactly the same fact pattern. That does not make \nmuch sense. It is something that the judicial conference has \nrecommended we fix. And we do.\n\n  The amendment also raised the minimum amount of money that needs to \nbe at issue before a class action can\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\nmake it to Federal court. The original bill set that amount at $2 \nmillion. My amendment raised it to $5 million to further limit the \nnumber of cases that move to Federal court and to assure that it is \nonly truly big national cases that do.\n  The effect of this amendment, I hope, will be to make the system more \ntransparent so that plaintiffs and defendants know where a case will go \nwhen it is filed, and it will force truly State cases to stay in State \ncourt while allowing truly national cases to go to Federal court.\n  Under current law, an attorney can avoid Federal court simply by \nmaking sure that at least one plaintiff is from the same State as at \nleast one defendant. This allows for cases to be shopped to whatever \nforum may have the most sympathetic juries, no matter where the case \nshould truly be heard. Under this modified bill, this forum shopping \nwould be eliminated.\n  The second amendment I offered in committee, which was also accepted \nand has been only slightly modified, was designed to deal with a \nprovision that was added to the original class action bill apparently \nto specifically target a California law. That law allows individuals in \nCalifornia to sue on behalf of the general public in lieu of the \nattorney general. Other States have or are considering similar \nlegislation, but California is on the forefront of this issue, so it \nwas California law, more than the law of any other State, that was \ntargeted by this provision in the original bill.\n  The so-called private attorney general actions allow groups such as \nthe Sierra Club, local district attorneys, government officials, or \neven individual consumers, to sue large corporations on behalf of the \npeople of the State. In California, these suits are generally to \nrecover illegally gained profits or to enforce State law against \ncompanies that do business there. These are not true class actions. The \noriginal bill essentially deemed these suits to be class actions and \ntherefore would have moved many of them to Federal court even if all \nthe plaintiffs were in California.\n  This was a concern to me and to many in California who are concerned \nthese citizen suits would be so dramatically affected by a bill that \nwas supposed to be about class actions, not private attorney general \nsuits. My amendment and subsequent clarifications of that amendment \nworked out between myself, Senators Hatch, Grassley, and Specter, \nsimply clarify that in any case in which an individual pursues one of \nthese private attorney general suits on behalf of members of the \ngeneral public, or members of an organization, unless those suits are \nactually filed as class actions, the bill does not apply. I want to \nmake that clear.\n  If, for instance, a California consumer sued Enron on behalf of the \ngeneral public in an attempt to force Enron to disgorge ill-gotten \nprofits and return this money to the Government of California, this \nbill would not change anything. The case would stay in California \ncourt.\n  I know there will probably be several amendments, and I have comments \nabout some of those comments, but I would like to hold that until the \namendment is actually presented.\n  Let me sum up and then yield the floor. Again, a simple reading of \nthis bill is very demonstrative because it is easily understood. Unlike \nmost bills, it is written in simple English. Probably the most \ncomplicated part is what I just went over, the diversity issue. One-\nthird, one-third, one-third, with the Federal judge having specific \nareas where that judge must make a judgment regarding the middle third \nas to whether this is truly a case national in scope and belongs in \nFederal court or whether it should remain in State court, offers a \nviable way of settling what has been a process that has been grossly \ncriticized, and that is forum shopping, and I think with some \nconsiderable justification.\n\n  A lot of people have worked very hard on this bill. I am hopeful we \nwill be able to pass it. I believe the bill in itself provides a remedy \nto what is wrong with the present class action law, and I support it \nwith great pride. I urge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor momentarily on \naccount of a headline in the Financial Times, on page 3, U.S. business \nhits a choice of running mate. It quotes Tom Donohue, the president of \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in stating that he attacked Mr. Edwards \nin an interview in the Wall Street Journal. He warned if Mr. Edwards \nwere chosen, the group might abandon its traditional neutrality in \nPresidential elections and dedicate the best people and the greatest \nassets to defeating the Democratic ticket.\n  This is unfortunate. Since I know a little bit about the Chamber of \nCommerce, and I know even more about my friend Tom Donohue, I want to \nadmonish that they not take that course and begin to try to work for \n``Main Street'' America rather than ``Main Street'' Shanghai.\n  I speak advisedly of the Chamber of Commerce. As a young Governor, I \nwas the first Governor to take a trip to Latin America to develop \neconomically our little State of South Carolina. I reasoned the Port of \nCharleston was 300 nautical miles closer to the Port of Caracas, \nVenezuela, than New Orleans, and New Orleans was always getting the \nMidwest business. But there was no reason why we could not bring it to \nCharleston.\n  So I went down to Caracas, and to the Ports of Santos and Montevideo, \nBuenos Aires, Santiago, and we started building up industry there.\n  Incidentally, in June of 1960, I made a trip to Europe, following my \nfriend Luther Hodges of North Carolina. We called on the various \nDusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and other towns in Germany, and the \nlittle State of South Carolina now has 126 German industries.\n  We had gone to France in June of 1960. I called on Michelin. Michelin \nTire of Paris, France, now has four large production facilities and \ntheir North American headquarters and more than 10,000 employees in my \nState.\n  We are proud. We are business Democrats. That is my friend John \nEdwards. He is a business Democrat. If there was one leader in this \nindustrial development, it would have been the State of North Carolina \nwith its then-Governor Luther Hodges.\n  Hodges had been the president of the New York Rotary Club. He had \nbeen the vice president of the Marshall Field chain before he was \nGovernor. So he knew all of those businesspeople. I had to compete with \nhim, follow on board, so to speak, and try to get the jobs and develop \nbusinesses.\n  One thing we know upfront; that is, you have to have a sound fiscal \npolicy. We raised taxes in South Carolina. And I got the first triple A \ncredit rating.\n  So it is nonsense for the Chamber of Commerce to call John Edwards a \n``wide-eyed liberal'' and John Kerry a ``wide-eyed liberal.''\n  Incidentally, I can tell you when I had Gramm-Rudman-Hollings on the \nfloor of the Senate, I was opposed by the Democratic leader, who voted \nagainst it; I was opposed by the Democratic whip, who voted against it; \nI was opposed by the chairman of the Budget Committee, my late friend \nLawton Chiles of Florida. And in spite of that opposition, on 14 \ndifferent votes, up and down, we got the majority of Democrats to \nsupport cutting spending and working for a balanced budget. It was \nhailed at that time. Everybody talks about President Reagan, and I can \ntalk about him advisedly because he was outstanding in international \ntrade. But let me stick right to this particular point.\n  In order for Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, I had to go to many so-called \nliberal friends in the Northeast, and I got Senator Chris Dodd and \nSenator John Kerry, who had just been elected to the Senate, to vote \nfor fiscal responsibility. Yes, my friend Senator Kerry laid his life \non the line in Vietnam. He immediately, when he came to the Senate, \nlaid his political life on the line.\n  I know Tom Donohue well. I used to work very closely with the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S7722]]\n\nTrucking Association, and I was their loyal supporter, still am their \nloyal supporter. I, under Tom Donohue, was their man.\n  I am telling you, I got every financial support and every assistance \nand what have you. I know Tom Donohue, and he knows trucking all right, \nbut I never have seen him go out and develop an industry. Yes, he got \non the boards. He went big time, just like joining the country club. He \nimmediately started getting on the boards of all these multinationals \nand changing the national Chamber of Commerce into the international, \nmultinational Chamber of Commerce. That is my resentment. That is why I \ntake the floor.\n  I have worked with the Chamber of Commerce. Go back home to the State \nof South Carolina and you name a county or a city that I hadn't gotten \nthe Chamber of Commerce award. That is how I met my friend, Robert \nKennedy. I was 1 of the 10 men of the year back in 1954, 50 years ago. \nWe met on the TOYM program. And, yes, bring it right on up to 1992. In \n1992, they had a fellow named Bob Thompson. He was the national \npresident of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and I was his boy. I was the \ntoast of the town and got all kind of help because I had held up labor \nlaw reform on eight up-and-down cloture votes. We defeated that \ninitiative. We believed in the right to work and we didn't need labor \nlaw reform.\n  I only have to harken to the 8 years of President Clinton when we had \nthe strongest economy in the history of the United States, with all the \ntaxes that they are trying to cut. Even with all those taxes, we had \nthe 8-year record of economic outburst and production.\n  So what have you. Now comes the Chamber of Commerce being admonished \nby Tom Donohue that we can't have this wild, crazy Senator from North \nCarolina, which is a bellwether of industrial development. That is \nwhere he was grown and that is where the people who sent him know him \nbest. And now we are going to have him depicted by Johnny-come-lately \nto business over at the Chamber of Commerce after heading up the \ntrucking association for years and totally skew trial lawyers.\n  You know, I have tried to go quietly, and I have stayed off the floor \na good bit this year. I have had my time. But I still struggle. I can't \nkeep quiet when I hear all of this lawyer talk. I practiced law on both \nsides of the aisle. I represented the electric and gas company and the \nbus system. If you want to represent a defendant, represent the local \npower company buses. I can tell you, come November, everybody slips on \na green pea in the aisle; everybody gets their arm caught in the door; \neverybody gets their head bumped or whatever else it is. And do you \nknow what. They bring these little claims. When I say little, in those \ndays they were relatively little--$5,000 claim, $10,000 claim.\n  And the corporate lawyer was lazy. They didn't try the cases. So they \nsettled them out of court and they just paid. You see, corporate \nlawyers are the most lazy group in the United States. So I backed up \nall those claims and took them to court all during the month of \nDecember and the Christmas holidays and into January. And I won my bet \nwith Arthur Williams who was president of the electric and gas company. \nI saved them over $1 million at that particular time.\n  The only reason I mention this, you don't brag but you have to talk \nto the record. And what happens is that I have been on the side of the \ncorporate practice as well as the plaintiffs practice in punitive \ndamages. I know all about them. I have had a hard experience with them. \nI have had a hard experience with every Chamber of Commerce in my State \nand with the national group. When Tom Donohue starts this talk about \nlawyers, if he wants to really save corporate money, I wish he would go \nto the corporate lawyers. They talk about frivolous claims. Who in the \nLord's world as a trial lawyer can afford to be frivolous?\n  They have rules of court that get you out. Tomorrow you can file, if \nyou assume all the facts alleged in the complaint as being true. You \nstill don't have a cause of action or, if it is a frivolous charge, you \ncan take it up under rule XI and have it done up. The courts take care \nof these things, but the pollsters are like used car salesmen and kill \nall the lawyers and go after trial lawyers who have to work for a \nliving.\n\n  What does the trial lawyer do? The trial lawyer says: Poor client, \nhaven't you been offered anything for this particular injury? They said \nno. Or sometimes they said yes, but they only said $200 or $2,000 or \n$20,000, and that is not going to take care of my medical expenses for \nmore than a year.\n  We don't get cases as trial lawyers. Talking about ambulance chasers, \nI don't know how you chase an ambulance, to tell you the truth. I have \nbeen in practice now for--well, I got in in 1947--over 50-some years. I \npracticed law up here. It is just like making a jury argument. The only \nthing about it is, you can serve on the jury and you can vote. I like \nit better.\n  But the point is that we usually get the client, once his incident, \nhis accident, his claim has been totally investigated by corporate \nAmerica. I know them. I represented them. They have investigators. All \nyou have to do is tell them, go see this, go see that. When you have \ninvestigators to go out and check the jurors: Go around, by gosh, in a \nparticular neighborhood and ask questions. What kind of fellow is John \nAdams? Is he liberal or conservative? Has he ever had a law case \nbefore? They have all the resources in the world. But the trial lawyer \ngets it after the cake is done and you can't hardly rise it. And it is \ndone falling flat, and the poor client is disconcerted and \ndisillusioned and finally gets to you.\n  The last case I tried I said, Did you go to so-and-so? He knows this \nkind of case better. And I went to another one and another one and \neverything else of that kind. And it was an antitrust case. I had to \nbrief myself, antitrust work. Finally I tried that thing.\n  But what I am trying to say is, get off of this ambulance chasing \nissue. No trial lawyer, all the ones that you read about--Fred Baron, \nin one of the articles, an eminent attorney, head of the American Trial \nLawyers Association from Texas. They work. They know what they are \ndoing. And they take on all the expenses, the investigations, the \nmaking up of all the models that have to be made, pay the photographers \nwho have to take the pictures. In some instances, they pay the medical \nbills going along. They take a risk and take that case on as their own. \nWhy? Because they don't get one red cent until they win. They have to \nwin all the way through, taking the expenses of all the \ninterrogatories, all the depositions, all the motions, all the delays, \nall the frivolity of corporate America because that corporate American \nis sitting up there on the 12th or the 25th floor, and the clock is \nrunning.\n  The biggest cancer we have in the law practice is billable hours. \nThis crowd down here on K Street is nothing but billable hour boys. \nThey don't try cases. They fix you and me. And they are the ones who \nhave the unmitigated gall to come and talk about frivolous claims. They \nnever go to work. They take you to a dinner, take you to a movie, take \nyou to a weekend down to the golf course, take you out to Alaska \nfishing, take you anywhere you want to go.\n  They never try cases, but the trial lawyer does. He has to get \nprepared, and he has to work, and he has to not only try that case that \nmight take a day, might take a week--some cases take several weeks and \nmonths--but as they try that case, they are carrying those expenses all \nthat time. But the corporate lawyer is trying to delay it. It pays them \nbecause their clock is running. It pays the trial lawyer to get on with \nthe business of trying the case and bringing it to a conclusion. I \nknow, I have been there on both sides.\n  What do you have to do? He has to get all 12 jurors--all this about \nrunaway juries. There are some exorbitant verdicts. I have seen in the \nheadlines. When we get to debating this thing, maybe on legal fees, or \nclass actions, or medical malpractice, or whatever it is--if the \ndoctors policed themselves as the lawyers, they would not have any \nmedical malpractice.\n  There was a headline down in my own backyard how nationally they had \nabout 100,000 injuries and deaths last year as a result of medical \nmalpractice. It would be 200,000, or 300,000, or 500,000 if we didn't \nhave medical malpractice.\n  What do you think the purpose is of being able to recover for \nsomebody else's wrongful act? Heavens above, we\n\n[[Page S7723]]\n\nhave to get all 12 jurors. I can tell you now, that defendant, all he \nhas to do is get one. Just like they had one on a recent criminal case \nof some kind. They held that thing up and held it up, and that one \njuror said he just wasn't convinced.\n  The jury system is the fundamental of not only the British but the \nAmerican system of jurisprudence. We have many sayings of not only \nWinston Churchill and Alexander Hamilton, the forefathers about the \nimportance of trial by jury, because when you get a group of your peers \ntogether, they will listen to the facts and make an honest judgment \nabout it. Sometimes if they do go extreme, the trial judge can set it \naside, or give them an entire new trial, or just no verdict at all.\n  One of the last cases I had, I had over $40,000 in costs and \nexpenses--not time, no. I didn't have any clock. I never heard of \nbillable hours. Senator, I have never practiced law for a billable \nhour. It means if you send the case or dispose of the case and \neverything else like that, you lose.\n  The corporate lawyer wants to keep all the cases going. He has all \nthe hours. He just goes to the club, and on the weekend he is off with \nthe chairman of the board, and that is all he has to do. They keep \ndelaying things.\n  You talk about my friend, John Edwards, is a liberal, some kind of \nnut and some kind of frivolous nonsense here. He has worked hard, and \nthe Chamber of Commerce ought to know that.\n  Let's talk a minute about trade itself. It is the fundamental duty of \nCongress to protect--we take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend, \nand we have Social Security to protect us from the ravages of old age. \nWe have a minimum wage to protect us from slave labor. We have Medicare \nand Medicaid to protect us from ill health. We have clean air and clean \nwater to protect us from those environmental poisons. You can go right \non down the list. We have the Army to protect us from within.\n  The fundamental of us is to protect jobs and the fundamental of us is \nto create jobs. You know what the multinationals have to do? They have \nto move the jobs out because it is cheaper. Why? Because of you and me. \nWe say that before you can open up in manufacturing, you have to have \nclean air, clean water, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum \nwage, plant closing notice, parental leave, safe working place, safe \nmachinery--I can go down the list. But you can go to Shanghai, China, \nfor 58 cents an hour with none of that.\n  I called up Walter Allison Dreeny. He was an executive of Pirelli. We \nbrought him to South Carolina in the Lexington County area. I helped \nhim get connected with water and sewer lines. He made a heck of a \nsuccess in the fiber glass section of Pirelli. He went out on his own \nand organized what is called Avanex on the big board, and he was doing \ngood. This was about 5 years ago. I learned a lesson. I called Walter \nand I said: Walter, I see where you are doing good and we don't have a \nplant of yours in South Carolina. If you continue to do well and you \nexpand, I would like to get your expansion somewhere in Columbia, where \nyou still have a home, or somewhere in our State.\n\n  He said, Fritz, I don't produce anything in this country.\n  I said: You don't?\n  He said: No, I have my research and sales here.\n  He sells the innards of computerization and communications, \nfiberoptic stuff.\n  He says: I produce in China. When you go to China, they will build a \nbillion. You have a year-to-year contract. They have a good and capable \nworkforce. You got a guarantee. You put a quality man there; you get a \nyoung Byron Dorgan and say you go to Shanghai and oversee this thing--\nsomebody you can trust who knows the business. He watches it for you. \nYou sit on the Internet and you watch it every day as to what they have \ndone. You visit three or four times a year to see how it is going. If \nthe national trend goes big, you get an additional contract in China. \nIf it goes bad, you don't have to renew the contract. You have no \nobligation to the labor at all.\n  That is what we are competing with. That is the reality. Yes, the \nChamber of Commerce has to understand why their task is to make a \nprofit for the stockholders. Our task is to build jobs. We are not \ninterested in profit. We are interested in building the economy, in \neducation, in health care, safety, law enforcement, yes, and we are \ninterested in the economic strength of this country.\n  The security of the United States is like a three-legged stool. You \nhave the one leg of our values, our stand for individual freedom, \nunquestioned the world around; you have the second leg of the military, \nunquestioned, the superpower; the third leg, the economic leg, has been \nfractured intentionally.\n  I say intentionally fracture because after World War II, we had to \nrebuild freedom and capitalism the world around us, and we had to more \nor less give up the store. We not only had the Marshall plan, the \nexpertise, the money, and the equipment, but we gave a good part of our \nown production.\n  I had a hearing with President Kennedy in 1961 when he put out his \nfamous seven-point program showing that it was injurious to the \nnational security of the United States for us to import more than 10 \npercent of our consumption in textiles clothing. I am looking around \nand everywhere I look, I can tell my colleagues that 70 percent of the \nclothing is from offshore, imported into the United States. Yes, 84 \npercent of the shoes on the floor of this Chamber are imported. We are \nout of the shoe business. We are out of my textile business.\n  Yes, we are going to go out of the computer business, and we are \ngoing out of the semiconductor business. Ronald Reagan was the best of \nthe best. He saw that during his 8 years. And do my colleagues know \nwhat President Reagan did? He got what they called VRAs, voluntary \nrestraint agreements, on semiconductors, automobiles, steel, and \nmachine tools, hand tools. Ask Andy Grove of Intel. If President Reagan \nhad not put protectionism, a voluntary restraint agreement, on \nsemiconductors, we would not have had an Intel. We put that program in \nSEMATECH. It was assistance to equalize high technology development \nthat was about to go out.\n  As I see it, we are about to go out not only of textiles but \nsemiconductors, automobiles, and other products. We have to have basic \nproduction. That basic production has developed the middle class, the \nstrength of America. If you want to do away with it, Mr. Chamber of \nCommerce, and move everything to China all for a profit and no country \nat all--it is scandalous what corporate America has been doing, running \nover to Bermuda, evading and avoiding taxes.\n  I saw one report the other day that in corporate America, something \nlike only 20 percent pay taxes. About 80 percent of them do not pay \ntaxes at all. And they talk about high corporate taxes. They have more \nexperts on how to evade and avoid and change and cancel out. So it \nhappens.\n  Yes, Senator Edwards has worked not only on the Intelligence \nCommittee, knowing foreign policy for 6 years now. In one of the \nstories, they said if something happened to John Kerry, we would have a \nPresident with no experience again. The only thing is, this President, \nEdwards, would be interested in being President. President Bush is only \ninterested in being Candidate Bush. He goes out every day to some \nmilitary or some police or other particular situation, gets that 7 \no'clock news photo, makes his little statements, and he does not keep \nup with any of the legislation. He is not proud of any legislation. We \ndo not have any leadership from the White House on getting anything \ndone. We are getting little nagging spitballs of class actions and--\nwhat is that other thing--a constitutional amendment on marriages.\n  One can get a common-law marriage in South Carolina. Are we going to \nput that in the Constitution? Come on, a big national problem. He has \nmore funny bunny things to think of and bring up and waste our time. It \nis the worst administration I have ever seen.\n  My point is the Chamber of Commerce.\n  Mr. REID. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want the Senator to comment on this statement. Here \nis a good-faith effort to move a bill--I do not like the bill. OK, I do \nnot like the\n\n[[Page S7724]]\n\nbill, but we have a few Democrats who like it, so we decided not to \nstand in the way of this legislation.\n  I have a letter from Jerry Jasinowski who is the president of the \nNational Association of Manufacturers. Here is what he said yesterday, \nand I want my friend, the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, who \nsupports this legislation and others to hear what this plan has been. \nThis is not something that came up this morning.\n  He writes on this card to one of the Members:\n\n       I urge you to vote in favor of cloture.\n\n  There was never any intention of this being a fair deal out here; \nwill the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right. They know their scheme. I tell you, our \nRepublican colleagues know what they are doing when it comes to running \ncampaigns. We know how to run the office once we get in, but they know \nhow to run for the office. We saw President Bush was already in \nRaleigh, NC, and they called for, of all things, class actions so they \ncan lambaste our Vice Presidential choice. That is what is going on. \nThe campaign is going on on the floor, and I am joining in on the \ncampaign. I have tried to stay out of it, but I am happy to join it \nbecause when we get about protectionism--and this is what this article \nsays, we are going to lose out on everything and regressive--what are \nall those funny words they use?\n  Here is yesterday's Financial Times: ``China vows to use anti-dumping \nand trade measures to protect its markets.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the Tom Donohue article and this \narticle about China in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Financial Times, July 6, 2004]\n\n              U.S. Business hits at Choice of Running Mate\n\n                  (By Edward Alden and Alex Halperin)\n\n       The choice of John Edwards as the Democratic running mate \n     has triggered an unusually harsh reaction from U.S. business, \n     which fears his selection will tilt the Democratic ticket \n     sharply against tort reform and trade liberalisation.\n       Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \n     country's largest business group, attacked Mr. Edwards in an \n     interview with the Wall Street Journal before John Kerry made \n     his announcement yesterday. He warned that if Mr. Edwards \n     were chosen, the group might abandon its traditional \n     neutrality in presidential elections and dedicate ``the best \n     people and the greatest assets'' to defeating the Democratic \n     ticket.\n       Mr. Donohue said the issue of curbing costly lawsuits was \n     ``so fundamental to what we do here at the chamber that we \n     can't walk away from it''. He was lobbying the Senate \n     yesterday for passage of a bill to restrict such lawsuits.\n       The National Association of Manufacturers, which is leading \n     a coalition of companies fighting what it says is ruinous \n     asbestos litigation, was equally harsh. ``The prospect of \n     having a trial attorney a heartbeat away from the presidency \n     is not something we relish,'' said Michael Baroody, executive \n     vice-president.\n       The NAM tracks the votes of senators on issues deemed \n     important for manufacturing companies, and in the current \n     Congress Mr. Edwards has supported the NAM on only one of 16 \n     votes, the same as Mr. Kerry. ``It's not auspicious,'' said \n     Mr. Baroody.\n       While U.S. trial lawyers have long been an important source \n     of funding for the Democratic party, Mr. Edwards' ties are \n     unusually close. He made his own fortune as a plaintiffs' \n     lawyer in North Carolina before running for the Senate and \n     trial lawyers are by far the largest contributors to his \n     political career. Of his top 25 career patrons, 22 are fellow \n     trial lawyers, according to the Center for Public Integrity, \n     which tracks political contributions.\n       The American Tort Reform Association, which represent \n     companies opposed to class-action suits, yesterday accused \n     Mr. Edwards of favouring ``a prolitigation, anti-civil \n     justice reform agenda that puts his wealthy personal injury \n     lawyer patrons ahead of the American people''.\n       U.S. companies are also worried about Mr. Edwards' stance \n     on trade liberalisation. In his run for the Democratic \n     nomination, he was an outspoken opponent of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico, and helped make \n     the ``outsourcing'' of U.S. jobs overseas into a key issue \n     for the Democrats. North Carolina is among the states hit \n     hardest by the loss of manufacturing jobs. But he has also \n     cast several votes in the Senate in favour of trade \n     liberalisation.\n       The president of a business group representing U.S. \n     multinational companies, who asked not to be named, said that \n     while Mr. Edwards' rhetoric on trade during the Democratic \n     primary was not encouraging, ``he has not been by any means \n     one of the worst on the Democratic side''.\n       He said Richard Gephardt, the former Democratic House \n     leader who has voted against all the main trade agreements of \n     the past decade, would have been a much worse choice in terms \n     of future trade liberalisation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Financial Times, July 6, 2004]\n\n   China Vows To Use Anti-Dumping and Trade Measures To Protect Its \n                                Markets\n\n      (By Mure Dickie in Beijing and Guy de Jonquieres in London)\n\n       China plans to step up its use of anti-dumping and other \n     trade measures to protect its market, saying its economy and \n     industries need to be able to adjust to tougher competition \n     since it joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001.\n       China has been the biggest target of anti-dumping actions \n     by other countries. As well as signalling more awareness of \n     the potential for using such measures, the decision is a \n     pointed reminder to trade partners that the country is now \n     the world's fourth biggest importer.\n       The shift in policy also coincides with intensive, but so \n     far unsuccessful, efforts by Beijing to persuade the US and \n     European Union to grant it ``market economy status''. That \n     would make it easier for Chinese exporters to defend \n     themselves against anti-dumping cases.\n       The official China Daily newspaper yesterday quoted Gao \n     Hucheng, vice-minister of commerce, as calling for \n     ``concerted efforts'' by industrial associations and legal \n     agencies to help Chinese companies compete with foreign \n     rivals. ``It is an imperative task for governments at all \n     levels to resort to legal means that are enshrined in the WTO \n     pact, such as anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and other protective \n     measures,'' it quoted Mr. Gao as saying. China has long been \n     among the fiercest critics of U.S. and Eruopean anti-dumping \n     actions, saying they discrimate against its exports. However, \n     its use of such measures has increased since joining the \n     WATO.\n       Last year, it initiated 22 anti-dumping investigations, \n     more than any WTO member except India and the US. Though \n     lower than the 30 cases brought the previous year, the figure \n     was sharply higher than the six China opened in 2000.\n       Anti-dumping investigations can lead to steep duties being \n     imposed on imports that are found to have been sold below \n     cost and to have harmed producers in the importing countries. \n     Many trade experts criticise the methodology used to \n     determine dumping, saying it is opaque and open to official \n     manipulation.\n       Beijing recently caused concern in Washington by imposing \n     preliminary anti-dumping duties of as much as 48 per cent on \n     optical fibre imports from the US, Japan and South Korea.\n       The China Daily quoted Wang Qinhua of the commerce \n     ministry's bureau of industry injury investigation as saying \n     that government officials were watching closely ``to see if \n     some of the industries are hurt by unfair foreign \n     competitors''.\n       The newspaper said the government was also seeking to \n     shield Chinese exporters from foreign anti-dumping actions by \n     providing advice and information on international prices.\n       According to the WTO, other countries opened 45 \n     investigations into imports from China last year. The total \n     number of anti-dumping cases brought worldwide fell last year \n     to 210 from 311 in 2002 after a peak of 366 the previous \n     year.\n       Although industrialised countries were for a long time the \n     most active users of anti-dumping measures, developing \n     nations have accounted for most of the investigations since \n     the mid-1990s.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the reason I had the China article \nprinted in the Record is because China is following Japan. We have yet, \nin 50 years, to get into the downtown market, Main Street, Tokyo. We \ncannot sell in Tokyo what we sell in the United States. No. They have \ntotal protection. They not only have MITI with the financing and the \nrefinancing and keeping even bankrupt entities going, but they control \nthat market so they go for market share. They are not worried about \nprofits the way the government runs things. We have antitrust, they \nhave pro-trust.\n  That Lexus I have sells for, let's say, $35,000. It will sell for \n$45,000 in downtown Tokyo. They pay at the local market way more for \nthat camera, way more for that television set, way more for that \nautomobile because we are talking about profit, and they keep on \ngetting more and more market share.\n  So we have to understand not only the thrust of their competition, \nbut that they are competing. They are as protectionist as can be on \nantidumping. We get into WTO and say: Oh, no, it is WTO violative; you \ncannot enforce any antidumping statutes in the United States. That is \nwhy we have that funny tax bill over there that they loaded with all \nthese extra tax cuts for corporate America. It is a disgrace. Everybody \nhas written about that.\n\n[[Page S7725]]\n\n  Warren Buffett, two days ago, said that tax bill is a disgrace. But \nthe reason we got the tax bill started was to try to equalize the \nsituation where we have been taking care of our particular businesses \nand industries, and if we are going to have the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce join the other side, this is like joining Saddam in Iraq.\n  If my colleagues want to see a business-oriented State, come to North \nCarolina where John Edwards is a Senator. I can say right now, they \ntalk now about the two most liberals. That is the biggest bunch of \nnonsense I have ever heard. I resent it, particularly respected \nentities like the National Chamber of Commerce taking business away \nfrom America. Tom Donohue is just adamant on doing that. He has been \ntaken over by the multinationals. His main membership is the Business \nRoundtable. They are not for your stores, they are not for the Main \nStreet merchants anymore.\n  That is why the Chamber of Commerce--by the way, I was a member of \nthe oldest Chamber of Commerce in the United States, so I speak with \nsome authority. I have seniority in something. I have been around here \nfor so long, I have been looking for it wherever I could find it.\n  In any event, what we have to do is sober up. The business leadership \nhas to quit this race to China, quit this tax race avoidance to \nBermuda, quit this Chamber of Commerce nonsense about who is liberal \nand who is conservative, and understand that our jobs are here to build \nup this market so they can sell what they sell here, not dump. If we do \nnot have any jobs, they cannot buy, they cannot sell.\n  We have the richest market in the world, but we are vastly developing \ninto the poorest market. That is why I have my job. I see some other \nMembers. But they talk about a wonderful economy, we have 5 percent \ngrowth. Baloney. I have 56,800 manufacturing jobs lost since President \nBush took office, and they have not come back as of last night. This is \nfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That is manufacturing. Do not tell \nme about growth, growth, growth. I am not getting all of this growth.\n  We have a lot of Government jobs. The Government is growing, the law \npractice is growing, health care is growing, but business is not \ngrowing. Production is not growing in America. The middle class is \ndiminishing.\n  It is shrinking. We have to worry about that. We cannot go along with \nthese labels about, we have the Chamber of Commerce now which has \nalready said he is the most liberal. He could not be a Senator--he \ncould not have won any election in the State of North Carolina if he \nhad that character.\n  I say to my colleagues, he believes in hard work, he believes in \njustice, he believes in trying his case, and 12 jurors and the \npresiding judge and the appellate court all agreed with John Edwards. \nTell Tom Donohue to bug off.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Wisconsin yield for \na unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is the Senator from Wisconsin is going \nto speak for about 5 minutes. I ask consent to be recognized following \nhis presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Class Action \nFairness Act of 2004. Class action lawsuits serve an important role in \nour court system. They permit consumers to address their injuries \ncollectively and hold the wrongdoers accountable, often when a lawsuit \nwould have been too costly for any one individual to bring it alone.\n   Most of these cases proceed exactly as we would hope. Injured \nparties, represented by strong advocates, get their day in court or \nreach a positive settlement that is good for the parties and handled \nwell by their attorney.\n   Unfortunately, this is not how it always works. Rather, some are \ntaking advantage of the system and consumers are getting the short end \nof the stick, recovering coupons or pocket change, while the real \nreward is going to others. The Washington Post put it clearly, ``no \nportion of the American civil justice system is more of a mess than the \nworld of class actions.''\n   This legislation addresses the mounting problems in class action \nlitigation in a fair and balanced way. The bill is not a panacea, but \nit will stop many of the unfair and abusive class action settlements \nthat plague our court system and short-change consumers.\n   Let me provide just a couple of examples of these abuses. In a large \nclass action suit against Blockbuster video, consumer plaintiffs \nreceived coupons for $1 off their next rental as their only \ncompensation for a successful settlement to their legitimate claims. \nTheir lawyers received $9.25 million.\n   Or consider Martha Preston of Baraboo, WI, who was a member of the \nBank of Boston case. It was Mrs. Preston's experience that demonstrated \nfor many of us that we needed to take a serious look at changing the \nclass action system. When her class action suit was over, Mrs. Preston \nhad technically won the case, but ended up owing $91 to her lawyers and \ndefending a lawsuit that her own lawyers filed against her in State \ncourt.\n   Studies show that these are not isolated examples. Rather, certain \nState and county courts welcome the sort of unfair class action suits \nthat lead to the embarrassing settlements that we are trying to end. \nAnyone who follows this problem can say that class action cases brought \nin Madison County, IL or certain counties in Florida or throughout most \nof Mississippi will succeed regardless of the merits of the case and \nregardless of how poorly any truly injured consumers make out in the \nsettlement.\n   Our bill stems the abuses in the class action system. While we \nchange the location where some lawsuits are heard, the bill recognizes \nthe essential role class action cases play in our legal system. We can \nsay without reservation that not a single merited case will be deprived \nof its day in court under this bill.\n   We stop the coupon cases that are far too prevalent. We ask the \nState attorneys general to review the settlements that affect their \nconstituents in an effort to add another layer of protection for \nconsumers. Finally, we move some cases to Federal court where the \njudges have more resources and expertise to devote to these complex \ncases.\n   We look forward to debating this bill and all of the amendments that \npromise to be offered to in the coming days. We have worked on this \nbill for many years, crafting significant changes in response to \nconstructive criticism. Indeed, today we can say proudly that a strong \nbipartisan coalition supports this legislation.\n   This project that we started with Senator Grassley several years ago \nhas matured through numerous committee hearings, multiple markups, \ncountless favorable editorials, and a general educational campaign that \nhas taught Members that the class action device is in dire need of \nrepair. We have garnered broad support through repeated compromise and \nnegotiation and have now reached a point where a large majority of the \nSenate supports this bill.\n   I would particularly like to thank Senator Grassley with whom I have \nworked for many years on this bill as well as Senators Hatch and Carper \nfor all of their diligent efforts in support of class action reform in \nthe last couple of years.\n   The changes that we have made to the bill responded to the criticism \nthat we moved too many cases to Federal court and that local cases \nshould remain in State court. We addressed that first in a major \ncompromise with Senator Feinstein during the committee markup last \nyear. We addressed that the other concerns at the end of last session \nwith a second compromise with Senators Dodd, Schumer, and Landrieu. \nThe changes we made to the bill were good ones that did a better job of \ntailoring our bill to address only the sort of cases that are the worst \nabuses. Cases that belong in State court will stay there under this \nbill. Cases of national importance will be heard in the Federal system.\n   We have told the Republican leadership repeatedly that there must be \na reasonable amount of time for amendments to be offered to this bill \nand voted upon. We understand that the\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\nminority leader offered a maximum of 5 non-germane amendments and 10 \ngermane amendments to the bill this morning. This would certainly \nquality as reasonable under any definition. We know that many of us, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, want to offer amendments, both related, \nand unrelated to this bill. There must be an opportunity to do that. \nUnfortunately, so far we have not had that chance.\n   We are eager to see the Senate work its will and pass this bill. \nThat would be an important step designed to protect consumers injured \nby these abusive class action settlements.\n   I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was inspired by my colleague from South \nCarolina. Senator Hollings comes to the floor to speak, among other \nthings, about international trade issues and does it in a way that is \nnot only right on point but also very colorful. I would like to follow \non that a bit and talk about a couple of other subjects.\n  I know we have the class action reform bill on the floor of the \nSenate, but that bill apparently is going nowhere at this moment. My \nunderstanding is the majority leader has ``filled the tree,'' which is \na fancy way of saying he is blocking everything. He puts a bill down, \nblocks everything, and creates a little gate in the majority leader's \noffice saying: Show me your amendment. If I like it, you can offer it; \nif I don't, you can't. That is where we are. Because of that action, I \nassume very little is going to happen at the moment.\n  While I think that class action reform is an important issue and we \nshould get to the amendments to the bill, there are other things we \nalso need to be doing. There is a lot of unfinished business in this \nChamber. We are doing very little on any of it, regrettably.\n  On appropriations, we had some subcommittee markups scheduled this \nweek that have been canceled. We need to get the appropriations done.\n  Writing a new highway bill, we were supposed to have written the \nhighway bill last year, and it is not done this year. Now they are \ntalking about extending it until next year. There is no better job \ngenerator for those who are concerned about new jobs in this country \nthan having a highway bill because that puts people to work right now \nwith contractors and workers all across this country. Yet the highway \nbill was supposed to have been rewritten last year. It wasn't. It was \nsupposed to have been rewritten this year. It isn't. So there is a lot \nto do in this Congress that is regrettably not getting done. There is a \nlot of unfinished business.\n  My colleague from South Carolina talked about trade, the trade \ndeficit, the shrinking employment base in manufacturing and the \nshrinking manufacturing base itself in this country. He also spoke of \nthe Chamber of Commerce that was critical of our colleague, Senator \nEdwards.\n  That was one of the things I was going to talk about today. The head \nof the Chamber of Commerce, in a speech just within recent days, said \npeople who are affected by off-shoring should ``stop whining.'' Again, \nthe head of the Chamber of Commerce says those people who are affected \nby outsourcing, by the movement of jobs overseas, by offshoring, ought \nto ``stop whining.''\n  I don't know of the head of a corporation who has had his or her job \nmoved overseas. I don't know of a Member of the House or Senate, I \ndon't know of a politician who has had his or her job moved overseas. I \ndon't know of one journalist who has had his or her job moved overseas. \nBut there are plenty of folks who work in manufacturing in this country \nwho have been the victims of offshoring, outsourcing, moving jobs \noverseas.\n  I have pointed this out on numerous occasions, but it is worthwhile \nto do it again, just because it is, I think, such a good illustration \nof what is happening in our economy.\n  This is a bicycle I have spoken of often in the Senate, a Huffy \nbicycle. Most Americans know of a Huffy bicycle. It has 20 percent of \nthe American market. Many Americans have ridden a Huffy bicycle.\n  This used to be made in Ohio, by the way, by one plant with over 900 \nproud employees who made Huffy bicycles and did a good job by all \naccounts. They came to work one day and discovered they were all fired. \nWhy were they fired? Because they made $11 an hour plus benefits and \nthat was too costly.\n  The manufacturing plant in which these bicycles were produced was \nmoved to China. It was moved to China because they could hire somebody \nfor 33 cents an hour in China and work them 12 or 14 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week. So that is why Huffy bicycles are not made in this country \nany longer.\n\n  Those who say to those 900-plus workers who lost their jobs, ``stop \nwhining,'' apparently don't understand the anguish of being told, in \nthis country, that making $11 an hour is too much money. You can't \ncompete with a Chinese worker who makes 33 cents an hour.\n  The American people don't need to be told that. We can't compete with \n33 cents an hour. We can't compete with someone in Indonesia who is \nmaking shoes for 16 cents an hour. We understand we can't compete with \nthat. Nor should we be required to.\n  This country, for one century, has fought over the issues that are \nimportant to a good life in this country, issues of abolishing child \nlabor, in which we were sending kids into factories and down into \nmines. So we have child labor laws. There are issues about plants that \ndump effluents and poisons into the air and water, and so we have \nenvironmental laws. We have issues about safe workplaces, so that \nworkers can expect to go into a factory that is safe, and so we have \nlaws dealing with safe workplaces. There are issues about fair wages, \nso we have minimum wages in this country.\n  There are issues about the right to organize. People died on the \nstreets in this country for the right to organize as workers, and so we \nhave labor unions with the right for people to organize.\n  In one fell swoop, a company wishing to pole-vault over all of those \nissues can simply decide it wants to be an American company for \npurposes of incorporation, but it would like to be a foreign company \nfor purposes of production. Whether it is a Huffy bicycle or a little \nred wagon, the Radio Flier wagon which for 100 years was made in this \ncountry and now is gone, they can decide to move the production of \nthose products somewhere in the world where they don't have to worry \nabout child labor laws, environmental laws, about a labor union, \nbecause they can move it to a place where labor unions are not \npermitted, workers are not permitted to organize, where there are no \nrequirements with respect to fair wages.\n  What is happening, as we know, is more and more companies are engaged \nin outsourcing. It is not just bicycles and little red wagons, the \nRadio Fliers; it is not just that. It is now white collar jobs as well, \nwhere there is outsourcing into Indonesia and China and elsewhere. And \nthey are told stop whining. By whom? By people who have never lost \ntheir jobs and are not about to. They are not going to lose their jobs \nto outsourcing. To them, this is all theory.\n  By describing all of this, I am not suggesting we build a wall around \nthis country because I don't believe we should or could. I believe in \nexpanded trade and I believe in expanding opportunities for Americans \nthrough trade. But I do not believe in the kind of trade agreements \nthat have been brought to this Senate for approval.\n  I don't intend to support the Australian-United States Free Trade \nAgreement, which will come to the floor of the Senate soon, because it, \nagain, in my judgment, undercuts the interests of this country.\n  I am perfectly willing to support trade agreements that are fair to \nthis country, fair to America's workers and require us to engage in \ncompetitive and fair trade. If we can't win in fair trade, then that is \nour tough luck. That is our fault. But let me give some examples of \nwhat our trade negotiators have done, time after time after time. If \nthere are people who want to defend this, I wish they would come to the \nfloor of the Senate. None have and none will. I will give just one \nexample and then go on to several others.\n  About 2 years ago, we did a bilateral trade agreement with the \ncountry of China. In that agreement our trade negotiators said this to \nChina: You produce automobiles and ship them to\n\n[[Page S7727]]\n\nthe United States. We will charge a tariff of 2.5 percent on any \nautomobiles that you ship into the United States. But we agree that any \nU.S. automobiles, any automobiles produced in the U.S. that we would \nship to China, you can charge a 25-percent tariff. In other words, our \nnegotiators said: I will tell you what we will do. You have a very \nlarge trade surplus with us, China. We have a $130 billion trade \ndeficit with you. But I will tell you what we will do. We will set up \nan agreement with respect to automobile trade, and you can charge a \ntariff on U.S. automobiles going to China that is 10 times higher than \nany tariff we would impose on Chinese automobiles going to the U.S.\n  I would like to find the softheaded negotiator who decided that this \nis something that is fair to America, fair to America's workers or fair \nto America's producers.\n  I don't come from an automobile State. I will give you one more \nexample of automobile trade--that is, automobile trade with Korea.\n  We have a circumstance with Korea where we ship about 2,800 \nautomobiles every year to be sold in Korea. That is how many \nautomobiles we get into Korea. What does Korea ship to the United \nStates? Somewhere over six hundred thousand vehicles come into our \nmarketplace, and 2,800 we get into Korea. You know why? Because our \nmarketplace is wide open and the Korean Government doesn't want U.S. \ncars in Korea, so they set up dozens of impediments to our shipment of \nU.S. cars to the Korean marketplace.\n  The list goes on and on and on. If you are an American rancher and \nbelieve you ought to get beef into Japan--after all, we have a deficit \nwith Japan of $50 billion to $60 billion every year, year after year, \nso the Japanese market ought to be open to U.S. beef--you find that \nyears after the United States-Japan beef agreement, there still remains \na 50-percent tariff on every single pound of beef that is sent from \nthis country into Japan. Unfair? You bet your life it is. Anybody care \nabout it? No. Our trade negotiators are off busy negotiating new \nagreements with Singapore, Australia, Morocco, Honduras, Costa Rica--\nall of these new agreements that create new unfairness in trade law--\nbefore they will even talk to you about the old trade laws that aren't \nworking.\n  We have the largest trade deficit in history--not just our history \nbut in the history of the world. Someday it will have to be repaid. It \nwill regrettably be paid with a lower standard of living in this \ncountry, and nobody seems to care about it.\n  Let me talk about that trade deficit for a moment. On May 13, we see \nheadlines that the U.S. trade deficit grows unchecked--a $46 billion \ntrade gap in March--1 month, a $46 billion trade deficit. How about the \nnext month, June 15, when we learn that the U.S. trade deficit sets \nanother record in April--$48.3 billion in a single month. Up and up and \nup goes this trade deficit, with American jobs leaving, outsourcing, \noffshoring. That is not a way, in my judgment, to strengthen our \ncountry and strengthen our economy. No country will long remain a world \neconomic power without a strong, vibrant, growing manufacturing base, \nand our manufacturing base is being decimated month after month. These \nare not circumstances of fair trade. We ought to be debating them on \nthe floor of the Senate with respect to legislation. But we will not. \nInstead, we will debate the United States-Australia Free Trade \nAgreement, and will be unable to offer a single amendment because of \nfast track rules.\n  While I talk about some of the circumstances of trade, one of the \nproblems, of course, is that U.S. companies are setting up foreign \nsubsidiaries--not for the purpose of producing in a foreign country for \nsale in another foreign country, but for the purpose of producing in a \nforeign country for the sale into the U.S. marketplace. And in fact, \nanother reason they are setting up foreign subsidiaries is to avoid \npaying taxes to the U.S. Government.\n  Here is an interesting statistic. In a recent year, of the 100 \nlargest publicly traded companies that do business with the Federal \nGovernment--I am talking about Federal contractors, the biggest \ncompanies that build things, airplanes, tanks and all of the things \nthey sell to the Federal Government--59 of them had created \nsubsidiaries in tax-haven countries. Why? Because they want to move \nproduction plants to tax-saving countries? No. Because they don't want \nto pay taxes.\n  Halliburton Corporation, the subject of a couple of hearings I have \nhad, had 17 subsidiaries, 13 in the Cayman Islands. This is all about \nrunning a corporation through a mailbox, not for the purpose of \nproducing anything but for the purpose of trying to avoid paying taxes.\n  What you have is companies that decide they want to be American \ncitizens, they want to do business in this country, they want to sell \ninto our marketplace and contract with the Federal Government, but they \ndo not want to pay taxes. Second, to the extent they can, the \nproduction which they want to contract to the Federal government they \nwant to move offshore. Why? Because it is cheaper to produce offshore.\n\n  Once again, anytime someone gives a speech, as my colleague from \nSouth Carolina did or as I do from time to time, about trade and \nrequiring and demanding fair trade rules, the institutional press and \nothers will say this is just uninformed nonsense from a bunch of \nxenophobic, isolationist stooges who can't see over the horizon.\n  You can't have a thoughtful debate about trade. We have now a $48 \nbillion monthly trade deficit. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody \nwill talk about it. Will there be anything brought to the floor of the \nSenate to deal with this? No. We talk a lot about the fiscal policies \nand budget deficits, and we have a reckless fiscal policy that is out \nof control. No question about that. But this trade policy is something \nnobody talks about, and these trade policy deficits are way out of \ncontrol. They are affecting our economic base, our manufacturing base, \nand our productive capacity in this country. We will pay a heavy price \nfor that unless we decide at some point that our trading partners are \nrequired to engage with us in fair, competitive, and open trade.\n  My colleague talked a little bit about the effort through the WTO and \nthe allegation by some that we must remove our antidumping provisions \nthat exist in law. Antidumping provisions are provisions that protect a \ncountry against another country that would try to dump into that \nmarketplace at a price well below the price of production and injure or \ndemolish an industry in your country. The trade ambassador said those \nare on the table for negotiation. We are willing to negotiate and we \nwill negotiate in the WTO negotiations our antidumping provisions and \nget rid of them potentially. So we will get rid of the only protection \nthat exists for producers and workers in this country against unfair \ncompetition. I don't understand that. Is there some notion that we \nshouldn't stand up for this country's interests?\n  I come from a State that must find a foreign home for a substantial \namount of its agricultural production, and I am the last person in the \nworld to want a trade war or to shut down opportunities for fair trade. \nBut I will give you some examples of things that bother us.\n  We produce a great deal of wheat in my State. So we do a bilateral \ntrade agreement with China. The Chinese say: Well, under this agreement \nwe will set a tariff rate quota of 8.5 million metric tons. I didn't \nbelieve that, but I especially didn't believe it when I saw the South \nAsia Post one day and the Agriculture Minister from China was traveling \ndown there speaking in an interview in the South Asia Post. He said to \nthe Chinese: This 8.5 million metric tons of wheat, that is just \ntheory. That is just theory. That doesn't mean we are going to buy it. \nAnd sure enough, they didn't buy it. Now, finally, they have made some \nmodest purchases. But we didn't have any substantial quantity of wheat \ngoing into China for years after the agreement because they didn't have \nany intention of making those purchases. Our farmers deserve the \nopportunity to compete in these markets and yet were denied that \nopportunity.\n  Probably the most obvious hood ornament on foolishness here in \nCongress in terms of public policy and in the White House is our \nattempt to sell goods into Cuba. Talk about a political odd couple. \nJohn Ashcroft and I, when he was a Senator, actually got legislation \npassed which is now law, and it opens just a bit the embargo with Cuba\n\n[[Page S7728]]\n\nso that we could sell agricultural commodities into Cuba. After 40 \nyears of an embargo, we finally, because of the bipartisan work here in \nthe Congress, passed a law that opened that market just a bit so we can \nsell some agricultural products into Cuba. Cuba has to pay cash. They \nhave to run the transaction through a European bank, a bank that is not \nin this country. But, nonetheless, we have been selling agricultural \nproducts to Cuba. But the State Department and the administration are \ndoing everything they can, every conceivable thing they can to shut \ndown even that small amount of export of agricultural commodities to \nCuba.\n  I don't understand this effort to injure ourselves. Public policy \nthat hurts our country, that is believed to be sound and good policy, \nwhether it is at the White House or by some in Congress, is something \nthat makes no sense to me at all.\n  On a related subject but somewhat off of trade, in addition, with \nrespect to Cuba, we have a travel ban. That travel ban, incidentally, \nis an attempt to slap around Fidel Castro, someone for whom I have no \nuse at all, a Communist dictator that Cuba does not deserve. In an \nattempt to punish Fidel Castro, our Government has decided we shall \nprohibit Americans from traveling to Cuba, so we have a travel ban. We \ndo not ban people from traveling to Communist China. We do not ban \npeople from traveling to Communist Vietnam. But they cannot go to Cuba.\n  At a time when we are beset by terrorist threats in this country, we \nhave a little organization down in the U.S. Department of Treasury that \nought to hang its head these days. They have, I understand, 20 people \nin an organization called OFAC, Office of Foreign Assets Control. Their \njob is to track financial movements of money to the terrorist \norganizations.\n  Twenty of them are tracking Americans traveling to Cuba. They are \naccusing them of trying to take a vacation. A woman named Joan Scott \nwent to Cuba. Joan Scott went to Cuba to distribute free Bibles on the \nstreets in Cuba with a missionary zeal and a religious sense of making \na difference. She went to Cuba to distribute free Bibles. Guess what. \nBoy, the Treasury Department got hold of her recently and is going to \nfine her $10,000.\n  There is a fellow from near Seattle, WA. His dad died and was \ncremated. His dad's last wish was to be buried on the church grounds \nwhere he ministered in Cuba. This young fellow took his dad's ashes to \nCuba. They tracked him down, the people who are tracking down \nterrorists. They tracked down a young man taking his dad's ashes to \nCuba.\n  Or Joan Slote. They are supposed to track terrorists; they tracked \nJoan Slote down. Joan Slote is a 76-year-old grandmother who rides a \nbicycle all over the world. She joined a Canadian bicycle club and \nbicycled to Cuba. She did not know it wasn't legal. She had a good \ntime, a 76-year-old grandmother bicycling to Cuba. They tracked her \ndown right quick and slapped a big fine on her. It was all a mistake \nbecause she was not even home when they sent her the first letter. She \nwas gone because her son was dying of a brain tumor. She was not there, \ndid not get the letter, so they slapped her with a bigger fine. After \nshe paid part of that fine, they tried to attach part of her Social \nSecurity check.\n  These are people who are supposed to be tracking terrorists, but they \nare going after people distributing free Bibles in Cuba, retired \ngrandmothers who are taking bicycle trips, and a young fellow trying to \nbury his dead father's ashes.\n  It is embarrassing what is happening in this administration dealing \nwith this issue of the travel ban. We have, on repeated occasions, on a \nbipartisan basis, with Republican support and Democrat support in the \nSenate, voted to lift that ban. Yet, somehow, in the end, the White \nHouse always wins. That ban is in place and we are using precious \nresources that are supposed to be tracking terrorists who are now \ntracking American citizens accused of taking vacations in Cuba and \nslapping them with $10,000 fines.\n  I digress. That was not the point of raising the Cuba issue. The Cuba \nissue is about trade and the foolishness of what we are doing to \ninhibit our family farmers from fully exploring the opportunities of \ntrade in Cuba. We have a natural advantage over Canadian and European \nfarmers with respect to that marketplace.\n  Incidentally, they are required to pay cash for the food they buy in \nthese trades and yet the administration is making it more and more \ndifficult for our farmers to access those marketplaces.\n\n  I started by saying the Senator from South Carolina was talking about \nthe Chamber of Commerce and, as I said, the President of the Chamber of \nCommerce said people should stop whining if they are affected by \noffshoring or offsourcing or moving jobs overseas.\n  I don't think people who have been hurt by this should stop speaking \nup at all. I don't think they are whining. But you could certainly see \nthe anguish on the faces of people who are proud to go to work in the \nmorning and make a good product, only to discover their employer felt \n$11 an hour was excessive and they would sooner get that product made \nby Chinese workers at 33 cents an hour. You can certainly see the \nanguish in the faces of those people who had to go home some night and \ntell their loved ones: Honey, I lost my job. It was not my fault. I \nworked here for 15 years. I lost my job today because I make $11 an \nhour and my employer wants to go offshore and find somebody who will do \nit for 33 cents an hour, and who will be prevented from joining a labor \nunion, and who will work at a plant that may not necessarily be safe, \nand who will work in a plant that will put poisons into the air and the \nwater, and who will work in a plant where there are no child labor \nlaws.\n  That is a hard thing for people to do, to go home and tell their \nfamilies. It is not whining. These Americans deserve better than that. \nThis country was built by people who take showers after work. This \ncountry was built by people who work hard, do their best, expect a fair \ndeal, expect there is some connection between effort and reward in this \ncountry. And regrettably, these days, when we see this avalanche of \noutsourcing and offshoring and decisions that this is not about workers \nbeing part of the country, workers are like a pair of pliers or tools; \nwhen you are done with them, get rid of them. That attitude on the part \nof business is wrong.\n  I visited with a CEO of a corporation recently. He said, I am one of \nthe few companies in my industry that has not offshored or outsourced a \nportion of the servicing of my customers. He said, Everyone else has \ndone it and I have not. It costs me more and it makes me a little less \ncompetitive because I have not done it, but I have resisted it because \nI have not wanted to lay off workers in the United States and to \noutsource that to China or India.\n  I applaud him. But there are precious few companies which have that \nattitude.\n  In short, we need trade laws that stand up for this country's \ninterests. Why is it embarrassing for someone to say, I support this \ncountry's interests? Why has that become something no one will talk \nabout? I am not talking about advantage; I am talking about fair trade. \nWhy is it not fair for us to say we stand for requirements of \ncompensation that are fair? Yes, with China, with Japan, with Korea, \nwith Europe.\n  Why do we allow Korea to have a 300-percent tariff on potato flakes \nfrom our country? Why do we allow the Koreans to decide they will keep \nout our American automobiles to the extent they can, or keep out \nAmerican pickup trucks to the extent they can, while boats pull up at \nour docks with Korean cars?\n  I say to Korea, that is fine, bring your cars to our marketplace. Our \nconsumers want the opportunity to shop for them. But there is a \ncondition for that. Then your market must be open to American vehicles. \nIt must. We ought to have the strength and the assertiveness to say \nthat to all of our trading partners.\n  This country needs to get a backbone. This country needs to have a \nspine that says, look, we believe in trade and it should be mutually \nbeneficial. We also are not going to apologize for standing up for this \ncountry's interests. This country has interest in a growing economy and \nexpanding economy and jobs. There is no essential program we will vote \non in this Congress that is as important as a good job\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\nthat pays well with good benefits. There is no social program that is \nany more important than that.\n  It is time, it seems to me, to turn to important things in the \nSenate. First and foremost, perhaps the majority leader should come to \nthe Senate and stop blocking amendments so we can finish the class \naction bill. If we do not finish the class action bill, it will be \nbecause of one reason, and that is because the majority leader decided \nto block amendments.\n  If he wanted to offer amendments, I assume our side could have \noffered a number of the amendments we were prepared to offer today, \nwork through tonight, tomorrow, tomorrow night, and finish the class \naction bill. In my judgment, in all the discussions I have been in, and \nI am part of the leadership on our side, there was no desire to block \nclass action. There was an acknowledgment and an understanding that \nthis bill was going to get done--until this morning when the majority \nleader came to the Senate and used an unprecedented maneuver to block \nall amendments except those with which he would agree.\n  The first thing we ought to do is unhinge that problem, move forward \non class action, and then deal with a range of other issues we know are \nimportant for this Congress. It is surprising to me how little this \nCongress has accomplished and how much it should be required to \naccomplish.\n  The highway bill, which is so important, as I indicated earlier, is \nlast year's business. It was not done last year and now apparently will \nnot be done this year.\n  What are we doing? Standing around here in the Senate. We will not \nvote today, apparently, and probably will not vote tomorrow, I don't \nknow why. Why? Because we have these unusual procedures of blocking \namendments because someone is concerned, apparently, that someone else \nis going to offer an amendment that somebody else does not like.\n\n  I do not understand. We probably should be required to retreat \nsomeplace in a room and read Senator Byrd's history of the U.S. Senate. \nMaybe that would be helpful, and we can read about some of the great \ndebates in this Congress--tough debates, sharp debates. But they went \non and they had votes and they resolved them and got through them.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Sudan\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nmass human destruction unfolding in the Darfur region of Sudan. The \nstakes in Darfur are extremely high and the death toll could exceed the \nnumber killed in Rwanda 10 years ago.\n  Both Secretary of State Powell and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan \nhave visited Sudan in recent days. Their attempts to promote an end to \nthe killing in Darfur are admirable. The Sudanese Government has agreed \nto contain the janjaweed militias and allow human rights monitors into \nDarfur. Yet it is not at all clear that the Government of Sudan is \nserious. The Sudanese Foreign Minister continues to blame the militias \nalone for the violence in Darfur, and before Kofi Annan's visit, local \nauthorities cleared the squatter camp he visited.\n  Now, I have been around for a fair number of years. I have never \nheard of a situation where the Secretary-General of the United Nations \nwas going to visit a refugee camp--actually it was a squatter camp--and \nthe government comes in the night before and evacuates the whole place. \nI can imagine how insulting that is to the Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations. And it certainly may give us some insight into the \nseriousness or lack of seriousness on the part of the Sudanese \nGovernment.\n  Government officials have said that reports of humanitarian \ncatastrophe are overblown, and Sudan's Ambassador to the United States \nsays that despite widespread reports that the Government is using \nAntonov bombers to attack villages and water wells, that this is false \nand ``part of a smear campaign against Sudan.''\n  Mr. President, I received a letter from the Ambassador of Sudan that \nI ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Republic of Sudan,\n\n\n                                               The Ambassador,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2004.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: In reference to your article today, \n     Wednesday, June 23, 2004 in the op-ed section of the \n     Washington Post, concerning the situation in Darfur, a \n     western region of Sudan. First of all, I would like to \n     express my respect and appreciation for your sincere concerns \n     about the plight and suffering of my fellow citizens who are \n     affected by the rebellion that began in February 2003. This \n     rebellion began in response to an erroneous assumption that \n     the peace between the northern and southern parts of Sudan \n     would come at the expense of other regions in the country.\n       Militias affiliated with the two rebel groups in Darfur, \n     the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality \n     Movement, are numerous. These rebels call themselves Tora \n     Pora after a place in Afghanistan and Pushmanga in Kurdistan. \n     The Tora Pora, the Pushmanga and the pro-Arab Janajweed are \n     all outlaws and bandits that burn, rape, and loot. President \n     Al-Bashir is working to disarm all of them and bring these \n     criminals to justice. Attached you will find the full text of \n     his decree concerning this matter.\n       In regards to the Antonov bombers that you mention \n     attacking water wells, this is not the case and is in fact \n     part of a smear campaign against Sudan. This Russian aircraft \n     does not even possess the technical capability of undertaking \n     such a task. I would like to assure you that in the end the \n     Government of Sudan is determined to resolve this conflict as \n     quickly as possible. We hope that the U.S. Congress will \n     help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                  Ambassador, Khidir Haroun Ahmed,\n                                                  Head of Mission.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think this letter may give my colleagues an idea of how \nOrwellian the situation is because the Ambassador basically denies that \nany human rights abuses are going on.\n  The fact is, the Sudanese Government has teamed with the janjaweed to \nslaughter civilians in a systematic, scorched-earth campaign designed \nto ethnically cleanse Darfur of black Africans. The Government and its \nmilitias have bombed villages, engaged in widespread rape, looted \ncivilian property, and deliberately destroyed homes and water sources. \nThe Government does not oppose the militias, as they suggest; the \nGovernment and the janjaweed are on the same team.\n  How do we know that the Government is lying about its role and the \nscale of the crisis? Numerous press reports, victim accounts, and other \nevidence paints a tragic picture. The numbers are shocking: at least \n1.1 million people driven from their homes and up to 30,000 already \ndead. And 320,000--I repeat, 320,000--people may die by the end of this \nyear, and a death toll far higher is easily within reach.\n  But numbers do not tell the whole story. The National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency has produced a number of satellite images that \ndepict what is going on in the Sudan.\n  This map I have in the chamber of western Sudan and eastern Chad \nshows the large number of damaged and destroyed villages across the \nDarfur region. Each orange fire with a black center, as shown on the \nmap, represents a village that has been completely destroyed--each one \nof these areas shown in orange with the black in it.\n  At least 400 separate villages, most of which were stable black-\nAfrican farming communities, have been partly or completely burned by \nmilitary forces. This number reflects only those villages where there \nwas a clear intent to damage or destroy these villages. The total \nnumber of damaged and destroyed villages could be considerably higher.\n  Also, on this map, you will see pink triangles that represent U.N. \nrefugee camps inside Chad.\n  Now, this is very widespread. Remember, this country of Sudan is very \nlarge, about the size of the State of Texas.\n  Where have the people living in these villages gone?\n  The pink triangles on this map show U.N. refugee camps located 50 \nkilometers inside the Chad border. Yet\n\n[[Page S7730]]\n\nsome are still unsafe because the militias are launching cross-border \nattacks. Those who are not in camps have settled in dry riverbeds, and \nthe rainy season is approaching. These people will soon be unreachable.\n  The next picture shows the village of Karraro, a farming community \ndestroyed within the past few months. The village consisted of \napproximately 250 huts. By May, they were all gone. This image shows \nhealthy vegetation in red. There is very little left, and this was a \nfarming village. The blues and grays show areas that have been \ndestroyed.\n  It is remarkable.\n  This slide shows El Geneina, the capital of Western Darfur State. The \ntown is under the control of the Sudanese Government--I repeat, is \nunder the control of the Sudanese Government--and has not been attacked \nby militia forces.\n  In the upper right-hand corner of the slide, you can see a government \nairfield, one of three in the Darfur region. Sitting on the ground are \nM-24 HIND attack helicopters, as shown right here. According to \neyewitness accounts, the Government has used these attack helicopters \nto target the civilian population. It is not a matter of \ncounterinsurgency techniques; the Government is deliberately attacking \ncivilians and their villages.\n  The Government of Sudan may argue that the ethnic cleansing is being \ncarried out only by militias over whom the Government has no control. \nBut look at this image: These white arrows, right here, point to \ncraters which the imagery analysts conclude are consistent with aerial \nbombing.\n  This is the Forchana Rufugee Camp. As I mentioned earlier, there are \nupwards of one million internally displaced persons in Darfur today. In \naddition, over 100,000 Sudanese have sought refuge in camps inside \neastern Chad. The U.N. has erected eight camps in Chad, and they \ncontinue to grow. This image shows the Forchana refugee camp in Chad \nand they continue to grow. Since this image was acquired in mid-April, \nthis camp has increased to over 10,000 residents. Many residents fled \nwhen their homes and crops were burned. You can see approximately 1,700 \ntents, and it had a population of 7,000 on 19 April and is now well \nover 10,000.\n  These satellite images together paint an appalling picture--a picture \nof ethnic cleansing of the worst sort, of mass killing and untold human \nsuffering. To bring this picture into even sharper relief, I would like \nto share some photos taken on the ground.\n  I would like to thank Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times for his \npermission to reprint and use the following four slides.\n  This photo is of a 19-year old named Hussein. Hussein was in a group \nof men attacked by the janjaweed, and he suffered gunshot wounds to the \nneck and mouth. In this image you can see the scarring on his face--he \nstill cannot eat solid food. His brother, who was also shot in the \nattack, discovered Hussein still alive when he returned to the village \nto bury the dead.\n  This second photo shows a shelter set up under a tree along the Chad \nborder. The woman who lives here lost her husband and sons when they \nwere murdered by the janjaweed. As the region enters the rainy season, \nmany of the refugees are forced to live like this, without adequate \nprotection from the flooding and storms.\n  It is hard to adequately express my disgust at this photograph. This \n35-year-old woman is pregnant with the baby of one of the 20 janjaweed \nraiders who murdered her husband and then gang-raped her. Now she lives \nin Bamina, a remote border village where aid agencies have been unable \nto provide any help.\n  The current situation in Darfur is orphaning many children. This \nphoto shows two children whose parents, uncle and older brother are all \ndead or missing. The girl, Nijah, is 4 years old, and she is carrying \nher malnourished 1-year-old brother. Many orphans, such as these two, \nare alone and face starvation.\n  I could go on, but I think the picture is clear. The world cannot let \nthe situation in Darfur continue. The international community is \ngetting the message, and the administration has taken some needed \nsteps. But we must do more, and we must do it immediately.\n  The United Nations Security Council should issue a demand to the \nSudanese government: stop immediately all violence against civilians, \ndisarm and disband its militias, allow full humanitarian access, and \nlet displaced persons return home. The test of the government's \ncommitment must be what happens on the ground. If we do not see \ntangible evidence that the government and militias are meeting these \ndemands, the leadership of both should face targeted multilateral \nsanctions and visa bans.\n  Peacekeeping troops should deploy to Darfur to protect civilians and \nexpedite the delivery of humanitarian aid, and we should encourage \nAfrican, European, and Arab countries to contribute to these forces. \nThe African Union has announced that it will send 300 peacekeepers, but \nthis is just a start. The United States should help provide financial \nand logistical support to countries willing to provide peacekeeping \nforces. We should also initiate our own targeted sanctions against both \nthe janjaweed and government leaders, and consider other ways to \npressure the government.\n  Some Americans, understandably preoccupied with events in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere, may think that these steps are too \ndifficult or too expensive. Dealing with ethnic strife is never easy, \nand it is tempting to turn our heads. In a recent Washington Post op-ed \nby Senator DeWine and myself, we quoted a survivor of the Rwandan \ngenocide named Dancilla. She said, ``If people forget what happened \nwhen the U.N. left us, they will not learn. It might then happen \nagain--maybe to someone else.'' All Americans should realize one \nterrible fact: It is happening again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first congratulate and thank my \ncolleague from Arizona for his very eloquent statement and also his \ngreat leadership in regard to Darfur. Not only his comments but those \nunbelievable pictures really tell the story about what is going on in \nthis very tragic region of the world. The world is beginning finally to \nwake up and pay attention to what is going on.\n  During the Fourth of July recess, the crisis in Darfur, Sudan, made \nheadlines with the visit of Secretary of State Powell and U.N. \nSecretary Kofi Annan. I applaud them for going there and for taking the \nspotlight of that office that their office commands--the bully pulpit, \nas Theodore Roosevelt would say--and bringing the world's attention to \nthat region. I applaud them for bringing this much needed attention to \nthe genocide, the humanitarian crisis in Darfur.\n  Our colleague Senator Sam Brownback and Representative Frank Wolf \nalso visited Darfur over the Fourth of July break. I had the \nopportunity to talk to Congressman Wolf about this visit, and \nCongressman Wolf is someone who, along with Senator Brownback, has \ntraveled to regions of the world before. He has seen grave humanitarian \ncrises before, so nothing really shocks him. But when I talked to him \non the phone the other day, he told me that what he saw in Darfur \nreally defies imagination. He said: I am just so upset, so pessimistic. \nOf course, the pictures that Senator McCain showed us make us \nunderstand.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I certainly will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senator DeWine for his involvement in this effort \nand his commitment to trying to see some rapid addressing of an \nunfolding tragedy.\n  My question to Senator DeWine is, Did you happen to see that the \nSecretary General of the United Nations travels to Darfur and is \nscheduled to go to what they call a squatters camp, which is where \ndisplaced persons are, understanding from news reports that there is \nkind of a show camp where the Sudanese Government takes their regular \nvisitors to cycle through. The staff of the Secretary General of the \nU.N. visited this camp. It is in deplorable condition the day before. \nThe Secretary General of the United Nations shows up the next day, and \nit is empty. The Sudanese Government has evacuated every living soul. I \ncan't recall anything quite as insulting to the Secretary General of \nthe United Nations.\n\n[[Page S7731]]\n\n  I wonder if Senator DeWine had a comment on that.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I may respond to my colleague, it shows the arrogance \nof this government. We have seen what they have done to these \nindividuals. The other thing it indicates to me is that, even now, when \nthe world is paying attention, they still are thumbing their nose at \nthe world, thumbing their nose at the Secretary General, thumbing their \nnose at the Secretary of State. They really will not let people in to \nsee what the circumstances are.\n  So when we hear some people say: Senator DeWine, they promised they \nwere going to take care of these people and they promised they were not \ngoing to encourage the continuation of this genocide; why don't you \nbelieve them? The answer is because of what my colleague pointed out. \nIt is that type of attitude.\n  I think we know that if this was occurring in other parts of the \nworld, such as in Europe, let's be candid, the world would have paid \nattention a lot earlier. That is the truth. The world would have paid \nattention. Something would have been done about it earlier. Finally, \nnow, the world is paying attention.\n  The imperative to act in Sudan is clear. As my colleague from Arizona \npointed out, there are steps that must be taken; steps such as sending \nin a U.N.-authorized peacekeeping force and planning tribunals that \npunish the guilty are steps Senator McCain and I have called for in the \npast. I think the first time I talked about them was back in May. Yet \nwe are still waiting for the international community to act. This \ndelay, let no one make any mistake, is costing lives.\n  The U.S. Government and the Senate have taken other steps several \nweeks ago, such as providing more humanitarian aid funding. I thank my \ncolleagues for that vote. The House did the same. Yet much more needs \nto be done.\n  Let me go through, if I could, a list of what needs to be done. \nFirst, the U.N. should authorize peacekeeping forces and monitors to \nguard the region of Darfur, and particularly the displaced persons \ncamp. Again, as we discussed, I know the Sudanese Government already \npromised to protect the people of Darfur. They have made the same \npromises for months.\n  I want to show this picture of Darfur and show why the Government of \nSudan has been stalling. Satellite photos that are available from USAID \nconfirm the destruction of nearly 400 villages and 56,000 houses. Here \nis a picture from the ground. Here is what it looks like after they are \ndone. Here is what is left of the village. The stories are terrible. A \nvillager described it best. She said:\n\n       The Janjawid arrived and asked me to leave the place. They \n     beat women and small children. They killed a little girl, \n     Sara. She was two years old. She was knifed in her back.\n\n  We need to send peacekeepers in for Sara, and for the tens of \nthousands like her who have been killed because they were Black. That \nis why they were killed--because they were Black. These people have no \nreason to trust a government that has done this to them, and neither do \nwe. I would trust African Union monitors and peacekeepers. We need to \nhelp them with logistical planning and support, and I hope we will help \nthem as they prepare their troops. We have been calling for this for a \nnumber of months, and maybe now people will start to realize it is the \nonly step. The wolf cannot be expected to guard the sheep, and the \nSudanese military, which includes former militia members, cannot be \nexpected to guard and help the people of Darfur.\n  Furthermore, 300 peacekeepers is just a start. There are too many \ncamps, too many people, all in a region the size of Texas, for 300 \npeople to be the answer; 300 is only the first step. I expect other \ncountries to follow the African Union's lead.\n  Second, we need to classify what is going on in Darfur as genocide. I \nknow with the use of that term comes a legal obligation under the \nConvention on the Prevention of Punishment of the crime of genocide, \nbut we should not refrain from using the term simply to avoid acting. \nIf it is genocide--and it is--we should call it that. It is my \nunderstanding that the litmus test for using the term ``genocide'' is a \nmatter of intent. Is there intent to commit genocide? Let me tell you, \nwhen men on horseback and camel kill men, women, and children, and then \ngo 50 miles to Chad to complete the task when they fail, I don't know \nwhat other term to use. It is genocide and we should call it that.\n\n  Third, we need to name names. This is a list of 7 of those \nresponsible for orchestrating the atrocities within the militias of \nSudan. We should share this information and publicly identify these \npeople so the world knows that those who aid in genocide will not be \nable to hide in the shadows.\n  Fourth, we should impose targeted sanctions on Government of Sudan \nofficials who are responsible for aiding the militias. It is not enough \nto target the militia members who are little more than thugs on camels; \nwe need to target sanctions at government officials, including travel \nbans. It is not enough to say we are going to do travel bans against \nthese militias. They are not going anywhere. We need to get the people \nto whom it will really matter, and that is the people in the \ngovernment. We need to go after their assets and deny them the freedom \nand rights they have denied to those in Darfur.\n  Fifth, we need to prosecute the war crimes in competent international \ntribunals. Dog and pony show trials are no substitute for justice, and \na lasting peace in Darfur and in the rest of Sudan will require that \njustice is served. This is particularly important for the militia \nmembers who were counting on slipping back into the Sudanese military \nor back into the villages after all this is done.\n  The only future for those guilty of war crimes should be the inside \nof a courtroom and then the inside of a jail cell.\n  Sixth, we will need peace talks in order to address the deep roots of \nthis conflict. This is not just about skin color; this is about a \nsystematic policy of the Government of Sudan to deprive outlying \nregions the resources they need to develop. There are other regions of \nSudan that are also suffering from neglect, and unless the Government \nof Sudan changes its attitude and starts to treat its people with \nrespect, it will face more insurgencies in the future. The Government \nof Sudan needs to understand that.\n  Finally, I close with a word about the humanitarian situation in \nDarfur now. According to the World Health Organization, 10,000 people \nwill die this month in Darfur if nothing is done. Today, it is \nprojected that 100 to 200 people will die. By the end of the week, an \nadditional 1,000 people will die, not just from disease but from \ninaction. The crisis will require more than just contributing money, \nalthough money is important. According to the World Health \nOrganization, military logistics are needed immediately to distribute \nthe aid. According to the United Nations, at least 50 camps are \ncurrently receiving no aid at all. That is only going to get worse as \nthe rainy season intensifies, washing out all of the roads.\n  We know the Government of Sudan likes to deny that this is a crisis, \nas Senator McCain pointed out, but we all know this is the worst \nhumanitarian crisis in the world today. People are counting on us, \ncounting on our action. Tens of thousands of lives hang in the balance.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join the growing chorus of voices \ndemanding action in Darfur. I thank all those who have supported our \nefforts so far. We cannot rest upon our past laurels, but instead we \nmust continue to move forward, pushing the international community to \ndo more. After Rwanda, when we said never again, we meant it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the critical \nneed for class action reform. The class action fairness bill that is \nbefore us, S. 2062, seeks to guarantee that plaintiffs in a class \naction, the people who have actually been harmed and who have a right \nto be compensated, are the actual beneficiaries of class action and not \nonly attorneys.\n\n[[Page S7732]]\n\n  The Class Action Fairness Act provides, one, the ability to remove \nactions to Federal court in cases where the aggregate amount in \nquestion exceeds $5 million and the home State plaintiffs are no more \nthan two-thirds of the class. In other words, class actions that are \nessentially State court matters will remain in State court, but matters \nthat involve major amounts of money and large numbers of plaintiffs in \nmulti-State regions, which frequently occurs, ought to be in Federal \ncourt. Why should a single county in a single State, a State judge, \ndecide a matter that affects all 50 States and perhaps hundreds of \nthousands of individuals?\n  It will provide special scrutiny for the abused coupon settlements. \nThat is something we have heard a lot about and is not right; that the \nvictims get coupons for the product and the lawyers get paid millions \nof dollars. It provides protections against unwarranted higher awards \nfor certain class members based on geographic location.\n  The bill is responsible, it is restrained, it will curb class action \nabuses, and produce a more productive class action system.\n  As I understand the situation today, the majority leader wants to \nproceed to this bill, and I hope we can do that in short order. The \nbill passed out of the Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member, in \nJune of 2003 by a 12 to 7 strong bipartisan support. Since passing out \nof committee, the bill has been through two major substantive periods \nof negotiation, each one bringing on more Senators in support of the \nlegislation. Currently, 62 Senators have either voted for cloture on \nthe previous version of the bill or have publicly expressed their \nsupport for this version.\n  It is time to proceed to the bill, to debate the substance of the \nbill, and have an up-or-down vote on class action reform. But I am \nconcerned, I must say, that many of the people who say they are for it, \nmy Democratic colleagues who in the past have been reluctant to sign \non, but they studied it more and said they are for it, that they may \nnot really want to move to this bill. One way we can do that--and all \nMembers of this body understand how it works: Add amendment after \namendment to legislation, and they draw out the debate on issues \nnonrelated, nongermane to the legislation and, in effect, they can kill \nlegislation through a filibuster by amendment.\n  The majority leader has a lot of things we need to do. We need to \npass this bill. We have strong bipartisan support for it, but he has a \nlot of other legislation that needs to be done. The majority leader has \npropounded a series of proposals that would provide an opportunity for \nMembers on the other side to offer minimum wage amendments and other \namendments, unlimited germane amendments, amendments related to this \nbill, unlimited, and they have been rejected.\n  So what that suggests is there is not a serious commitment, that this \nbill is being obstructed and being blocked from even having an up-or-\ndown vote by a device that does not give any limits on the amount of \ndebate. That is very unfortunate. It is not the right thing to do. As I \nindicated, it is a device that allows a group of Senators to block the \npassage of the bill even if they say they are for it. But if we try to \ncut off and limit debate and have a definite time for a vote, they say, \nno, they will not support that; I am for the bill, I just will not give \nthis time limit; I will not agree to how many amendments we can put on.\n  The majority leader goes to it, we spend a week to 10 days on it and \nwe still have not passed it. Then what can he do? So he cannot move to \na bill under those circumstances. We need to have an agreement.\n  I hope Senators will reevaluate those circumstances so we can reach \nan agreement and move forward with this legislation that is very \nimportant. If not, everybody needs to know it was blocked again, \nobstructed from being able to be brought up, debated, and amendments \noffered to it.\n  I know the Presiding Officer served on the Texas Supreme Court and \nalso as attorney general of Texas. He understands the legal issues \nperhaps better than any other Member of this body. I think we would \nagree, and most lawyers would agree, class actions are not evil in \nthemselves. In fact, they are good tools to deal with litigation in \nwhich there is a single type of cause that injured a whole host of \npeople, where perhaps hundreds of thousands of people were injured or \nwronged by the same act or series of acts. So as the matter of proof \ngets to be unjustifiable, if the amount of loss is $100 or $200, \n100,000 people in America have to hire a lawyer to file 100,000 \nlawsuits, so a person can file a class action and a lawyer can \nrepresent the whole class to determine how much that group of people \nwere damaged and get them checks, pay them and get them recompensed. I \nthink that is a good procedure, and I am all for that. It is a real \ngood procedure. It is something we ought not to believe is bad in and \nof itself.\n  State courts are being overwhelmed by these actions. I saw the \nnumbers from 1988 to 1998. The number of class actions pending in State \ncourts increased by 1,042 percent while the number in Federal courts \nincreased only 338 percent during that period.\n  State courts have often been unable to give class actions the \nattention they need, and abuses have occurred too often under those \ncircumstances. It has hurt class members sometimes to the benefit of \nattorneys. Make no mistake about it, an attorney in a class action is \nin a delicate position. That attorney's interest, when the settlement \nnegotiations come around, can be in conflict with the interest of the \npeople he represents.\n  So what happens sometimes in these negotiations is that lawyers \ndemand from the big companies, or whoever they are suing, big fees to \nbe paid to the lawyers, millions of dollars, and then acquire only \ntoken benefits for the members of the class. That is not good, and I \nwill talk later about some of the cases where this has happened. \nLawyers in such cases have lost their perspective and have not handled \nthe interest of their clients with integrity.\n  This bill would crack down on that. It would give more power to the \njudge to make sure those kinds of abuses do not happen.\n  Sometimes these class action cases are being used as judicial \nblackmail, forcing defendants to settle cases that are basically \nunjustified, even frivolous, rather than spend millions of dollars in \nlitigation and the risk of loss of a whole customer base maybe because \nof bad publicity. So the defendants are compelled to pay even if they \nare really at fault, and sometimes they will pay the lawyers more \nthan they will pay the people who have been victimized.\n\n  Other examples of class action problems include what has been \nreferred to as ``drive-by'' class actions where the class is certified \neven before the defendant has notice. There are ``copycat'' class \nactions where the actions are filed in multiple jurisdictions to see \nwhich court will certify the class first, or they are filed by another \nlawyer to try and steal what appears to be a lucrative claim from the \nperson who filed the first class action; get in a race to the \ncourthouse.\n  This is a matter of significance. Lawyers are supposed to have \nfidelity to their clients. In some cases, the fidelity to their clients \nleads them to do things that are lawful and proper under the law but \nare really abusive. This is one of those examples. Class action lawyers \nare known to forum shop by naming irrelevant parties in class actions \nin order to destroy diversity and to agree to settlements that pay \nbounties for someone discovering a class action, awarding the original \nplaintiff more than any other member of the class.\n  It is hard to criticize a lawyer for forum shopping. If he looks all \nover the United States of America, he has a complaint that involves \neverybody, maybe it is a MasterCard that in every county in America \nsomebody has one, and there is a complaint about that, he can pick the \nbest jurisdiction in America, the best county. Maybe he knows the judge \nwho is very favorable to his theories. He can file it in any county in \nthe United States that he chooses. There are some counties in Alabama \nthat are known for this. He gets total choice of where to file the \ncase. I cannot say that is morally bad for the lawyer to do that, but \nthose of us who set the laws, who set the policy for class actions, we \nought to review that. We ought to create laws that make it more \ndifficult for a lawyer to be able to pick the single most favorable \njurisdiction in the whole United States in which to file an action.\n\n[[Page S7733]]\n\n  Let me talk about this situation in the Toshiba case. A class action \nsuit was filed in Texas, complaining of an entirely theoretical defect \nin the floppy disk controllers of Toshiba laptops. There were no \nallegations that the asserted defect had resulted in injury to any \nuser, and not one customer had ever reported a problem attributable to \nthe defendant. However, Toshiba faced potential liability of $10 \nbillion, and they decided to try to settle the claim. The class members \nreceived between $200 and $400 in a coupon off the purchase price of \nToshiba products. The two named plaintiffs received $25,000, and the \nattorneys received $147 million. The class members in this case only \nbenefitted from the lawsuit if they purchased additional products from \nToshiba and used the coupons. This is not the way the legal system is \nsupposed to work.\n  Class action reform is also needed so that people who are not injured \ndo not receive compensation. If members of a class are unable to \ndemonstrate damage, they ought not to be paid.\n  Lawyers are supposed to represent real clients with real problems. \nThey are ethically bound to represent the interests of their client \nforemost beyond their own interest.\n  Class action lawsuits are designed to be available when lawyers \nrealize that an entire class of people has been harmed in the same way \nhis client had been harmed. Class action should not become a way for \ncreative lawyers to gain excessive fees. It should not be a situation \nwhere good advocates figure out a way, by adding unrelated defendants \nor otherwise, to file actions in friendly circuits or to use other \nmethods that maximize the benefit to their clients while ignoring the \nrest of the class members.\n  Another case touched on my home State of Alabama, the famous, or \ninfamous, Bank of Boston case. In this case, a class action was filed \nby a Chicago attorney in the circuit court of Mobile, AL. The case \nalleged that the bank did not properly post interest to its clients' \nreal estate escrow accounts. The class settlements limited the maximum \nrecovery to individual class members at $9 each. That $9 was the \nmaximum amount anybody could recover.\n  After the State approved the settlement, the bank disbursed more than \n$8 million to the class action attorneys in legal fees and credited \nmost of the accounts of the victims with sums of less than $9. The \nlegal fees which were automatically debited from the class members' \nbank accounts total 5.3 percent of the balance of each account. It was \nbad enough that a lot of these people did not even know they had been \nin a class action or that they owed an attorneys' fee for the $9 \nrecovery that had been won for them, the worst part is that many \naccounts were debited for amounts that exceeded the credit they \nobtained from the settlement, meaning that the attorney fee that came \nout of their account far exceeded the $9 benefit they received from the \nclass action.\n  For example, Dexter J. Kamowitz, of Maine, a case which a Chicago \nattorney filed in Mobile, AL, and the plaintiff, who is supposed to be \nwinning a verdict, who lives in Maine, who did not initiate the class \naction against the Bank of Boston--he just happened to be declared a \nmember of the class--but he received a credit of $2.19 on the \nsettlement. At the same time, the class action attorney debited his \naccount for $91 in legal fees, producing a net loss of $87.81. Such \nresults, as might be expected, produced outrage from class members in \nother States affected by the action.\n  Judge Frank Easterbrook, circuit judge of the seventh circuit, asked:\n\n       What right does Alabama have to instruct financial \n     institutions in Florida to debit the account of citizens in \n     Maine and other States?\n\n  So we need to be careful about these matters. We need to be careful \nthat these cases are handled fairly. This bill takes steps forward in \nthat regard. That is why it received strong support throughout the \nNation, and that is why so many Senators have committed to supporting \nit, Republicans and Democrats.\n  S. 2062, offered by Senator Grassley and passed out of the Judiciary \nCommittee last summer, will help eliminate many of these abuses. I \nthink I have noted those. I will just note it will eliminate forum \nshopping, keeping State judges of a case of less than one-third of the \nmember class who are members of that State from dictating the fate of \nplaintiff members in 49 States.\n  I hope we will have a healthy debate on this process and that we can \nmove forward and get this bill before us and confront a problem that is \njeopardizing America. We have a lot of members here who say: We believe \nin jobs, we want to see the economy grow, they are not creating enough \njobs in America. But when you have huge, multimillion dollar, sometimes \nvirtually extortionate lawsuits filed against businesses on a regular \nbasis--they go up more than 1,000 percent in State court in 10 years, \n300-something percent in Federal court in 10 years; these lawsuits are \ngaining momentum all over the country--it does impact our productivity \nas a Nation.\n  No nation carries the kind of litigation cost that the United States \ndoes. When we export a product outside our country, the total value and \ncost of producing that product, which has to be competitive in prices \nin the world market, that cost is created and added to by litigation \ncosts. Much of that is just insurance premiums. The more these cases \nare filed, the higher insurance premiums go.\n  So it is a real problem for us. It has hurt our job creation, it has \nhurt our economic growth. It is time for this Nation to get in sync \nwith the rest of the world and bring some containment to the abuses in \nlitigation.\n  I believe in litigation. I believe in the court system of America. I \nbelieve many of these lawyers are not improper or immoral; they are \njust using the existing legal system in every way they can to maximize \nthe benefit they can obtain for their client. So what happens then? It \nis up to us to deal with it.\n  A lot of people have talked about this question of federalism, \nStates' rights, how we ought to handle this and why should the Federal \nGovernment involve itself in class actions or why are we dealing with \nit. Over the last 30 years, we have had a host of pieces of legislation \nthat poured through this body, many of them driven by our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, that impact States' rights. Now all of a \nsudden they are claiming States' rights will be violated by class \naction reform. Let me just say a few things about that question because \nit is very important. It is one we should think about and analyze \nhonestly.\n  First, there is no doubt whatsoever that the kind of cases we are \ntalking about ought to be or can be handled in Federal court. That is \nperfectly constitutional. The Constitution provides for the litigation \nbetween citizens of different States to be in Federal court to begin \nwith. It is only through the device of undermining diversity by suing a \nlocal defendant that Federal jurisdiction has been avoided in many of \nthese cases. The intention of the Framers of the Constitution was, in \nthese interstate lawsuits, jurisdiction should be in Federal court. So \nit is not unconstitutional for these cases to be tried in Federal \ncourt. I don't think there is a single Senator in this body who would \nargue that making these a Federal case somehow violates the State's \nrights because they are interstate cases. They involve plaintiffs from \nmore than one State. That really was always thought to be appropriately \nhandled in Federal court. I know that.\n  The next question is: Should we do it? Is it proper that we put more \nof these cases in Federal court? I think so. I believe it is proper \nbecause we are seeing abuses of state court jurisdiction and because \nFederal courts have a better ability to handle multi-state litigation \nissues. Let's take this practical example. Let's say there is a \nlawsuit--I think there was one filed a number of years ago involving \nthe construction of seatbelts for automobiles. It was filed on behalf \nof the class of everybody in America who had automobiles, and virtually \nevery county in America had one of those automobiles and so they go to \na certain county in the Midwest where thousands of these class action \nlawsuits are being filed and they filed it there, the result of which \ncould be an order and financial judgment that would impact the way \nseatbelts are handled throughout America.\n  If you appealed any verdict from that county, where would it go? It \nwould go\n\n[[Page S7734]]\n\nto the supreme court of the State that handled it. But it is going to \naffect everybody in America. So if you file this lawsuit in Alabama or \nTexas or Illinois, and you get a verdict that impacts the whole United \nStates and you appeal it, a single State gets to decide whether it was \nproperly tried and whether the order was appropriate. But if it is \ntried in Federal court, the appeal would be to the U.S. Supreme Court, \nwhich handles the jurisdiction of the whole United States of America, \nwhere it ought to be if the verdict is going to impact a multitude of \nStates. So I think that is perfectly logical and a good policy reason \nfor us to do it in that way.\n  We are seeing a problem in which litigation is impacting adversely \nour ability to create economic growth and impacting adversely our \nability to create jobs. It adds to the cost of products that we want to \nexport around the world. It adds to the cost of products produced here \nand sold in America making them less competitive against imports that \ncome into this country. If we can reduce the cost of litigation on \nbusinesses in America, they will be more effective about their \nbusiness.\n  We do not want to deny people who are wronged fundamental rights. In \nno way does this legislation do that. It says the litigation ought to \nbe tried in Federal court if it involves these kinds of situations and \nit contains some provisions to limit abuses.\n  Frankly, let me say this: I was a Federal prosecutor in Mobile, AL, \nfor 15 years, and 12 years as U.S. attorney. I have tried cases in \nState court and in Federal court. I know the Presiding Officer knows \nthat by and large Federal judges have a lot fewer cases than State \njudges. The fact is, in our State, Federal judges probably carry on \ntheir dockets one-fourth or less the number of cases in State court, or \nmaybe one-tenth the number of cases. State court judges have thousands \nof cases. Frequently, State court judges have fewer law clerks--\nsometimes no law clerk--when the Federal judges usually have one or two \nlaw clerks to help them do their work.\n  Where would a big, complex multi-state, multimillion-dollar lawsuit \nbe better filed? Which court is best able to handle these cases? Which \nones were designed by the original founders to handle interstate cases \nto begin with? It is clear to me that it is in Federal court. That is \nwhere these cases ought to go.\n  Frankly, I could see taking more class action cases than this \nlegislation provides for in Federal courts. I think it would be \njustified.\n  But because of the objections of some of my colleagues, we negotiated \nand worked out concerns that some lawyers had, these negotiations will \nkeep more cases in state court than the bill originally intended, but I \nam willing to live with that.\n  Article III of the Constitution vests the Federal courts with \njurisdiction over ``controversies between citizens of different \nstates.'' When you have a bank in Miami, a lawyer in Chicago, victims \nin Maine and Alabama and other places, that is a controversy between \ncitizens of different States. It is only through the reinterpretation \nof the diversity rule that these cases have many times been able to be \nkept in the State court system rather than to be allowed to go through \nthe Federal courts. I think this is right way for us to go. I think \nthis is a logical, fair, restrained, professional response to a problem \nof the abuse of class actions in America.\n  It is important for our economy. It is important for our business in \nAmerica. I believe we need to pass it. I hope our colleagues who are \nholding up this bill today will reevaluate and reach an agreement with \nmajority leader Bill Frist to have some amendments or all the \namendments that are relevant to the bill they want but not an unlimited \nnumber of amendments on any subject they want to offer amendments on. \nThat won't work. That is not right. Let us move this bill forward. Let \nus pass it. Let us do what at least 60 Senators in this Senate believe \nis proper.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Cost of Government Day\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to talk today briefly \nabout an important matter.\n  As many of you may know, today is Cost of Government Day. Not that we \nneed to celebrate it, but it is an important day.\n  What is Cost of Government Day, you ask? It is the day on which the \naverage American worker has earned enough money to cover his or her \nshare of the Federal, State, and local government. That means that our \ngovernment is so large and spends so much money that we must work our \npoor citizens 189 days a year before they can break even with spending.\n  Think about it like this. Say you go out and buy a house and the \nmonthly mortgage you have to pay for your house is one-half of your \nmonthly salary. That is a huge amount. One-half of the money you earn--\none-half of your salary--has to go to pay your house mortgage. Say \nevery month you get your paycheck and about half of it is written off \nto the bank to cover your mortgage.\n\n  That is the same way our government works. The cost of government \nconsumes 51.6 percent of our national income. It is taking more than \nthe hypothetical mortgage payment of half your salary. I cannot help \nwhat someone's mortgage payment is but we in this body can have some \nimpact on the cost of the government.\n  I say to those here today, that spending is getting out of hand. \nSince 1977, the earliest Americans have paid off their cost of \ngovernment was June 28. Now it is July 7. The United States prides \nitself in being a frontrunner in human and civil rights protections. We \ncome together under the values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness, those values that the Founders declared to be the basis of \nthis great Nation.\n  But there is a dragon in the midst, a burglar in the basement, \nsucking Americans dry of their hard-earned money. The perpetrators are \nright here among us. Our government is being burdened with cumbersome \nand unnecessary legislation and regulation for which the American \ncitizens also pay the bill. In this season of budget and appropriations \nbills, we need to think about who we are representing and the \nsacrifices they are making for each bill we pass.\n  We are not celebrating Cost of Government Day, a day 189 days into \nthe year. I am here to celebrate America. The strength and vitality of \nthis Nation is its belief and its investment in individual American \ncitizens, entrepreneurs, people working hard, giving their very best \nevery day. They do not mind paying a reasonable amount in taxes. But we \nneed to fight every day. We need to analyze the situation with every \nbill and ask ourselves: How much more can we expect the American people \nto pay? How much burden can we expect them to carry? How can they carry \na dynamic and growing economy that creates jobs and allows higher pay, \nwhere people work and save and invest and do well economically with \nthese burdens?\n  We do better, slightly better, somewhat better than the Europeans. \nTheir taxes are going through the roof. I notice that the leadership in \nGermany cited the U.S. tax cuts that have spurred our economic growth \nin recent months, something we are definitely celebrating. They are \ndiscussing whether they need to do that. The Europeans, though, are \nfurther down the road in social welfare, in burdens economically, than \neven we are.\n  We need to watch what we are spending. We need to indelibly imprint \nin our mind that the cost of Federal, State, and local government is \nthe work of American citizens for 189 days this year, 51.6 percent of \nthe income earned. That is more than we need to allow. We do not need \nto see those numbers increase. They need to start going down. It is \nsomething we ought to work on.\n  We must remember every day there is a limit to the burden that the \nAmerican citizens can carry if we expect them to be competitive in the \nworld market.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n[[Page S7735]]\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nthe Class Action Fairness Act, a bill to stop unfair and abusive class \naction lawsuits that ignore the best interest of injured plaintiffs. \nThis legislation is sorely needed to help people understand their \nrights in class action lawsuits and protect them from unfair \nsettlements. It is needed to reform the class action process which has \nbeen so manipulated in recent years that U.S. companies are being \ndriven into bankruptcy to escape the rising tide of frivolous lawsuits \nthat have resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs, especially in the \nmanufacturing sector.\n  Unfortunately, not enough Americans realize we are in a global \nmarketplace and businesses now have choices as to where they \nmanufacture their products. Many of our businesses are leaving our \ncountry because of the litigation tornado that is cutting through the \neconomy and destroying their competitiveness. The Senate must start \ntaking into consideration the impact of its decisions on this Nation's \ncompetitive decisions in the global marketplace. Too often, we think \nabout things in the United States for Americans and forget the fact \nthat we are in a global marketplace. Today, manufacturers and consumers \nworldwide have many choices about where to do business.\n  I believe for the system to work we must strike a delicate balance \nbetween the rights of aggrieved parties to bring lawsuits and the \nrights of society to be protected against frivolous lawsuits and \noutrageous judgments that are disproportionate to compensating the \ninjured and made at the expense of society as a whole. I believe this \nis what this legislation does. I am proud to be a cosponsor of it.\n  Since my days as Governor of Ohio, I have been very concerned with \nwhat I refer to as a ``litigation tornado'' that has been sweeping \nthrough the economy of Ohio, as well as the Nation. The Ohio civil \njustice system is in a state of crisis. Ohio doctors are leaving the \nState and too many have stopped delivering babies because they cannot \nafford the liability insurance.\n  From 2001 to 2002, Ohio physicians faced medical liability insurance \nincreases ranging from 28 to 60 percent. Ohio ranked among the top five \nStates for premium increases. General surgeons pay as much as $75,000 \nand OB/GYNs pay as much as $152,000. Comparatively, Indiana general \nsurgeons pay between $14,000 and $30,000 and OB/GYNs pay between \n$20,000 and $40,000.\n  Further, Ohio businesses are going bankrupt as a result of runaway \nasbestos litigation. Today, one of my fellow Ohioans can be a plaintiff \nin a class action lawsuit that she does not know about, taking place in \na State that she has never even visited.\n  In 1996, as Governor of Ohio, I was proud to sign H.B. 350, strong \ntort reform legislation into law--for a while. It might have helped \ntoday's liability crisis but it never got a chance. In 1999, the \nSupreme Court of Ohio in a politically motivated 4-to-3 decision struck \ndown the Ohio civil justice reform law, even though the only plaintiff \nin the case was the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers, the personal injury \nbar's trade group.\n  Their reason for challenging the law--this is incredible--they \nclaimed their association would lose members and lose money due to the \ncivil justice reform laws that were enacted.\n  The bias of the case was so great that one of the dissenters, Justice \nJ. Lundberg Stratton, had this to say:\n\n       This case should never have been accepted for review on the \n     merits. The majority's acceptance of this case means that we \n     have created a whole new arena of jurisdiction--``advisory \n     opinions on the constitutionality of the statute challenged \n     by a special interest group.''\n\n  From this, it is obvious to me the way we currently administer class \nactions is just not working.\n  While we were frustrated at the State level, I am proud to have \ncontinued our fight in the Senate, a fight for fair, strong, civil \njustice.\n  To this end, I worked with the American Tort Reform Association to \nproduce a study entitled ``Lawsuit Abuse and Ohio'' that captured the \nimpact of this rampant litigation on Ohio's economy, with the goal of \neducating the public on this issue and sparking change.\n  Can you imagine what this study found? In 2002 in Ohio, the \nlitigation crisis cost every Ohioan $636 per year. For every Ohio \nfamily of four, the cost was $2,544. These are alarming numbers. This \nstudy was released August 8, 2002. Imagine how high these numbers have \nrisen since that time.\n  In tough economic times, families cannot afford to pay over $2,500 to \ncover other people's litigation costs. Something needs to be done. \nPassage of this bill will help.\n  This legislation is intended to amend the Federal judicial code to \nstreamline and curb abuse of class action lawsuits, a procedural device \nthrough which people with identical claims are permitted to merge them \nand be heard at one time in court.\n\n  In particular, this legislation contains safeguards that provide for \njudicial scrutiny of the terms of the class action settlements in order \nto eliminate unfair and discriminatory distribution of awards for \ndamages and prevent class members from suffering a net loss as a result \nof a court victory.\n  The bill is designed to improve the handling of massive U.S. class \naction lawsuits while preserving the rights of citizens to bring such \nactions. Class action lawsuits have spiraled out of control, with the \nthreat of large, overreaching verdicts holding corporations hostage for \nyears and years.\n  In total, America's civil justice system had a direct cost to \ntaxpayers in 2002 of $233.4 billion. That is 2.23 percent of our gross \ndomestic product. That is $809 per citizen and equivalent to a 5-\npercent wage tax. That is a 13.3-percent jump from the year before--a \nyear when we experienced a 14.4-percent increase, which was the largest \npercentage increase since 1986. These lawsuits cost billions of dollars \nand are putting a crimp in the budgets of every American.\n  Now, some of my colleagues have argued that this bill sends most \nState class actions into Federal court and deprives State courts of the \npower to adjudicate cases involving their own laws. They argue that the \nbill, therefore, infringes upon a States' sovereignty. However, there \nis no evidence for this assertion, and, in fact, it is the present \nsystem that infringes upon State sovereignty rights by promoting a \n``false federalism'' whereby some State courts are able to impose their \ndecisions on citizens of other States regardless of their own laws.\n  Another argument against the bill is that it will unduly expand \nFederal diversity jurisdiction at a time when courts are overcrowded. \nHowever, State courts have experienced a much more dramatic increase in \nclass action filings and have not proven to be any more efficient in \nprocessing complex cases. In addition, Federal courts have greater \nresources to handle most complex interstate class action litigation and \nare insulated from the local prejudice problems so prevalent under \ncurrent rules.\n  We all know that so many of these class action lawsuits are filed in \njurisdictions--two or three of them--because they know the results of \nthose cases if they file them in certain jurisdictions. We have a \ncertain jurisdiction in Illinois. We have another in Mississippi. As a \nresult, there is no fairness to the defendants.\n  I emphasize to my colleagues that this is not a bill to end all class \naction lawsuits. We will have plenty more class action lawsuits. \nRather, it is a bill to identify those lawsuits with merit--with \nmerit--and to ensure that the plaintiffs in legitimate lawsuits are \ntreated fairly throughout the litigation process. It is a bill to \nprotect class members from settlements that give their lawyers millions \nwhile they see only pennies. It is a bill to rectify the fact that over \nthe past decade, State court class action filings increased over 1,000 \npercent. It is a bill to fix a broken judicial system.\n  Madam President, I am a strong supporter of this bill and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. I hope that the Holy Spirit enlightens us so \nwe can have a vote on this legislation which is so important to the \nfuture of America's economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before he leaves the Senate floor, I \ncommend my colleague from Ohio for his excellent statement.\n  I agree with him that this is an important piece of legislation. I \nhave spent a good part of a year, along with\n\n[[Page S7736]]\n\nmy good friend and colleague from Delaware, and others--the Senator \nfrom California, Mrs. Feinstein, the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, \nand the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer--working to try to put \ntogether a responsible bill on class action reform. We have done that \nwith this proposal.\n  I regret the fact that nearly eight months after we forged a \ncompromise on class action reform, we have just begun to deal with this \nissue. I had hoped the legislation would have come up earlier in the \nyear when there would have been more time available to consider it.\n  I was pointing out to my colleagues earlier, as someone who managed \nand wrote the securities litigation reform bill, that we spent almost 3 \nweeks on the floor of the Senate debating that bill. At the time, Bob \nDole was the majority leader of the Senate. We had countless amendments \nthat were offered, both relevant and nonrelevant amendments. Never once \nwas cloture invoked. Never once did someone fill up the amendment tree \nso as to limit who could offer what amendments. You didn't have to get \npermission, in effect, to offer your amendment. It was a contentious \ndebate from time to time, but ultimately the will of the Senate \nprevailed. The legislation was adopted.\n  But I also point out, interestingly, the securities litigation reform \nwas the only bill that President Clinton vetoed that was ultimately \noverridden by both the House and the Senate. It became the law of land.\n  It was a lengthy process, but it was a good process. I think the \ndebate was healthy. It was complicated, but nonetheless I believe the \nlegislation ultimately proved to be worthwhile.\n  I cite that example because here we are now in a situation where \nbefore any amendments were offered--and we went on this bill almost 24 \nhours ago--we were told last night by the majority there would be no \nvotes last evening. We have been in session since about 9 o'clock this \nmorning. There have been no amendments offered one way or the other \nbecause we have an amendment tree that is filled up, and you must get \npermission to bring up an amendment.\n  Madam President, this is the U.S. Senate. I have served here for a \nquarter of a century and I have rarely seen this kind of procedural \ntactic being used on a bill that enjoys a strong majority of support. I \nbelieve we have at least some 62 supporters of this bill. The idea that \nwe are not going to allow amendments to be brought up unless approved \nby the majority runs counter to everything this institution stands for.\n  Now I know that some of these nongermane amendments are \nuncomfortable. There are people who are against them, although in \nseveral instances they have strong bipartisan support. For example, the \nlegislation dealing with immigration reform has been offered by Senator \nCraig of Idaho and Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts. Also the \nreimportation issue on drugs. I will be the first to admit it, but I \nthink an overwhelming majority of our colleagues are either \ncosponsoring or supporting that legislation. Even in the other areas, \nwe have had a limited amount of time to bring up some of these issues.\n  But I believe we can get time agreements on some of these amendments \nif we stay in today, if we stay in tomorrow, if we stay in Friday, if \nwe work longer hours, and if we come back on Monday or Tuesday. I \nbelieve we could adopt this important legislation, and we would either \naccept or reject a number of these other nongermane amendments. But to \ngo through now the second day with nothing being done on a bill that \nmany would argue is one of the most important pieces of legislation \nfrom the business community perspective is inexcusable. I want the \nbusiness community to know what is happening here because I am sure the \nallegations are going to be made that somehow the minority is trying to \nstop this legislation. That is anything but the case.\n  We probably could have dealt with five, six, or seven amendments on \nthe floor of the Senate today. I am told there are only 13 filed \namendments on this bill. In effect, we probably could have almost \nconcluded action on this legislation instead of stonewalling to make \nsure some amendments are not going to be debated and heard. We stop \neverything from happening so a good piece of legislation that a lot of \npeople have worked long and hard on to get right may be denied an \nopportunity to be heard. That is wrong, Madam President.\n  Now, again, I know voting on nongermane amendments is not something \nwe are terribly excited about here. It is the U.S. Senate though. In \nthe U.S. Senate, we allow nongermane amendments--absent a unanimous \nconsent agreement or filing cloture--to be considered by this body. So \neven before a single amendment is debated here, the majority is now \ninvoking rules and procedures that limit the ability of this \ninstitution to be heard. I regret that deeply.\n  I was fearful this would happen. I am sort of mystified as to why it \nis happening. The majority, at least among their members, are more \nsupportive of the class action reform bill.\n  There are a number of Members on this side who are supporting this \nlegislation, but the bulk of the support comes from the majority side. \nI am mystified as to why the majority would not be pushing us to bring \nup our amendments, agree to time limits, and then vote on the \namendments one way or the other and move the bill forward. But that is \nnot the case.\n  So we find ourselves now at the close of business on this day. We \nvoted on one judge yesterday, and that is it. Now we are about to go \ninto Thursday. We will be leaving, I presume, sometime around noon on \nFriday and probably won't come back until next Tuesday. We have about \n30 legislative days left around here to consider all matters before the \nelections of the fall. If my colleagues sense some frustration in this \nSenator's voice, it is because I am frustrated.\n  I regret having spent as much time on the bill only to find out in \nthe end we can't even get amendments to be brought up to debate. \nInstead, we have to agree ahead of time what amendments are going to be \nbrought up. Those rules exist in the House of Representatives. The \nrules of the Senate are very different. This body is the antithesis of \nthe House of Representatives, and for good reason. That has been the \nway this institution has functioned for two centuries.\n  On important legislation such as this, to invoke House rules to apply \nin the Senate is unfortunate. As important as this bill is, how this \ninstitution functions, in my view, is far more important. Senators have \nthe right to be heard. Because one day, not too distant in the future, \nthe very Senator who today is trying to stop a debate may be the one \nseeking one. And so be careful what you wish for when you set \nprecedents or establish procedures that may be repeated at times when \nyou may find yourself on the other side of the political equation.\n  For all of those reasons, I am frustrated that this important bill \nmany of us have spent a lot of time on may be close to death. We may \nnot be able to enact it. That is unfortunate that we are getting to \nthat point with this bill, despite all the efforts that have been made, \nwhere we may not get a chance to even debate it, much less act on it.\n  I hope the leadership will listen to those who want to bring up some \namendments, and see if we can't work out some time agreements and move \nforward. If that is not the case, the idea that somehow the Senate as \nan institution would have to take a back seat to some procedural \nhurdles the majority would want to impose on the minority is not worth \ngiving up. As important as this bill is, how the Senate operates is \nmore important to this Senator. I will be most reluctant, but \nnonetheless I want my colleagues to know if it comes down to making a \ndecision about supporting a bill I have helped write or abandoning \nprocedures in the Senate, I will protect this institution over this \nbill, as much as I would like to see this bill enacted.\n  I am not going to sit here and support a set of procedures which deny \nmy colleagues an opportunity to be heard. I wouldn't support an \nunlimited right that goes on for days with endless amendments. I know \nwhen I am being gamed. I know when I am being taken advantage of. That \nis not the case at this point at all, not even close to being the case.\n  My hope is wiser heads will prevail, that voices who care about this \nlegislation would be heard, and that we could move to consideration of \nthis legislation in the normal course of business,\n\n[[Page S7737]]\n\non how we normally function when matters such as this emerge, where \nthere is a division of thought and there are differences of opinion.\n  There are those who feel strongly about not adopting this \nlegislation. I understand that. But there are also those in the \nmajority who would like to see it adopted. To suggest somehow we are \ngoing to prohibit those who would disagree with the bill an opportunity \nto be heard on other matters on this legislation is a wrong set of \nprocedures to be followed.\n  Despite the fact my name is on this bill and I am proud of the fact \nit is--I think it is a good bill and we did a good job writing this \ncompromise--and as much as I would like to see S. 2062 become the law \nof the land, I am not about to turn my back on an institution that \nallows Members to be heard and their ideas to be debated. As important \nas this bill is, it is not as important as maintaining the integrity of \nthe Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, before the Senator from Connecticut \nleaves the floor, I want to say how much I have enjoyed working with \nhim on this issue. I appreciate the wisdom and experience he brings to \nthe matter.\n  We had a press conference today around noon, those of us Democrats \nand Republicans who support this compromise on class action. The real \nstars of the press conference were three guests: A woman from near \nCharlotte, NC; another from Wisconsin; and a third lady who, along with \nher husband, for many years ran a pharmacy down in Mississippi. They \nshared with us how they had been involved in class action legislation.\n  In the case of the Mississippi lady whose pharmacy down there in this \nlittle county had been named in over 100 lawsuits, not because they had \ndone anything wrong but because it was a way to be able to try to get a \nclass action certified in that particular county of Mississippi, really \nthe defendants were the big pharmaceutical company.\n  Another lady talked about being a plaintiff in a class action \ninvolving the Bank of Boston and the issue was escrow accounts. \nApparently somebody took umbrage at the way the Bank of Boston was \nhandling escrow accounts and money going in and out of escrow accounts, \nand they filed a class action lawsuit. In the end, the folks on whose \nbehalf the class action had been filed ended up losing moneys. Their \naccounts were actually debited in order to be able to help pay the \nattorneys' fees which were rather substantial.\n  The other lady was a lady from Charlotte, NC. She talked about late \nfees by Blockbuster. She didn't like the fact that they had a late fee \nthat was unfair. Over the course of time, because of the family and \nthis sort of thing, they paid a fair number of late fees, and she \ndidn't appreciate it, so there was this class action lawsuit. She \napparently got named as a plaintiff because she had shopped there, and \nshe was included in the lawsuit.\n  In the end, the agreement that was worked out enables her to get--I \nwill paraphrase: Out of this, maybe I am going to get a couple of \ncoupons for rentals, for two videos. And I will get a dollar-off \ncoupon. I could do as well clipping coupons from the newspaper from \nBlockbuster. She was not pleased, particularly when she mentioned how \nmuch the attorneys were going to get in the litigation.\n  The point I am trying to make is, they were the really interesting \npeople who spoke at our press conference. What they had to say \nreinforced my belief that we are trying to do the right thing.\n  Again, I realize it is not something everybody agrees upon. We are \ntrying to find some balance in this legislation which says when people \nhave a legitimate beef, they have been harmed by a product or service \nor been taken advantage of, even people who don't have a lot of power, \nthe little people, they would have an opportunity through a class \naction to join together and to hold accountable the big companies that \nhave harmed them or at least treated them unfairly.\n  I had hoped we would have a chance today by this time to have debated \nand voted on a couple of germane amendments, maybe a nongermane \namendment or two, and even work into the night. From what I am told, we \nmay be wrapping up here fairly soon. It is not even 6 p.m. I hate to \nsee us waste the day.\n  We had some exchange earlier today between our leaders where Senator \nDaschle had suggested maybe an approach where we agree to offer five \nnongermane amendments to the bill and maybe 10 germane amendments. \nSenator Frist countered with the ability for either side maybe to offer \n1 nongermane amendment and maybe 10 or more unlimited germane \namendments. If you look at the numbers between one and five in terms of \nnongermane amendments, there is a number between one and five that is \nprobably more than two, maybe five, maybe four, but there is probably a \nnumber there we could agree on.\n  Our side is not going to go along with the idea of the Republicans \ntelling us what nongermane amendments we can offer. But I am encouraged \nthat if the two leaders will take some time later today, maybe as early \nas this evening, and sit down, they can hopefully work out among \nthemselves how many nongermane amendments and maybe even work out the \nones that would be offered.\n  There are a couple of amendments the Republican leader indicated he \nwould not want to see offered as nongermane. And to the extent that is \na concern he has, I respect that concern. I had hoped maybe he would \nchange his mind. But if there is something he doesn't want to see \noffered as an amendment to this bill, it is not germane to this bill, \nbut it might be germane to another freestanding bill that would be \noffered later, let's go ahead and make a commitment to offering that \nnongermane amendment, not on this bill but at a later point in time to \nanother bill.\n  So the proponents of that measure would know for sure that they are \ngoing to have a chance to debate their issue and get a vote on it in \nthe Senate. I am not discouraged. Somebody asked me earlier--and it may \nhave been the Presiding Officer--if we were going to make any progress \nthis week on this bill. I think we are. I am encouraged. If our leaders \nwill sit down and talk it through between the two of them, they can \nwork this out. It is important they do that. Nobody on our side wants \nto be seen as obstructionist. A number of us have worked very hard on \nthis proposal. Most of the folks on the other side are acting in good \nfaith on this bill, too. Whether you happen to be a company out there \nthat wants to just get a fair shake when you are taken to court, or if \nyou are a consumer who wants to make sure you are not being ripped off \nby some company, there is a way to meet the legitimate concerns of both \ninterests.\n  The more I learn about this bill and the more I hear about the \ngermane amendments that will be offered, frankly, the more I am pleased \nwith the work that has been done. I think Senator Bingaman has a \ngermane amendment or two he would like to offer. I think Senator Breaux \nhas a germane amendment. I think maybe Senator Pryor has an amendment \nto offer that is germane. Maybe Senator Kennedy has a germane amendment \nto offer, too. There may be germane amendments on the other side. They \nare thoughtful amendments. Each of them bring some concern. They, \nfrankly, need to be debated on the floor and we need to have a chance \nto vote.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARPER. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I want the record to reflect that I know how deeply the \nSenator from Delaware feels about this issue. There are not many issues \nwhere the Senator from Delaware and I disagree. This is one of them. I \nknow how strongly he feels. Also, I know how strongly the Senator from \nDelaware feels about other issues. For example, even though the Senator \nfrom Delaware feels extremely strong about this bill, when there came a \ntime a few weeks ago when the majority leader made a tentative decision \nto move off the very important Defense authorization bill, I called my \nfriend from Delaware and I said: Don't you agree that we should finish \nthe Defense bill before we move to class action? Without any \nhesitation, the Senator, being a veteran himself, who has hundreds of \nhours in an airplane for our country, said yes.\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n\n  As a result of that, Senator Daschle and I gave the Senator from \nDelaware our word that we would do everything we could, as soon as the \nDefense bill was completed, to move to this bill. In fact, we made a \nunanimous consent agreement that the minute we finished the Defense \nbill we would move to the class action bill.\n  I am disappointed, but not that the bill is not going to go anywhere \nbecause I don't like the bill; I am disappointed in the way the bill \nwas disposed of. This is like having a football game and the football \nfield is only 90 yards long. It is not fair to either side. I want the \nrecord to be spread with the fact that the Senator from Delaware has \nbeen fair in all his dealings in the Senate. The example I just made \nwas the Defense authorization bill. That was a prelude to the question. \nI am terribly disappointed because it appears to me that this has been \nin the minds of the majority for some time, at least in the minds of \nthe majority yesterday, July 6. We have a card that was sent to one \nSenator from the National Association of Manufacturers, dated \nyesterday, July 6. Today is July 7.\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 14,000 member companies in \n     the National Association of Manufacturers, including more \n     than 10,000 small and medium-size manufacturers, I urge you \n     to vote in favor of cloture on this bill.\n\n  This was planned yesterday. So I am disappointed because we are \nplaying on a football field that is not quite long enough. That is too \nbad, not for the end result that I see, but I believe, as the Senator \nfrom Connecticut so well described, in this institution. Having served \nin the Congress of the United States for 22 years, as I have, I believe \nin the institutional integrity of these bodies. When you see something \nsuch as this, it means there is not a fair hand being dealt. He is \nsomeone who believes strongly in legislation.\n  Frankly, I think people have taken advantage of the Senator from \nDelaware. He is a very hard person to take advantage of because he has \na lot of experience in government. This has not been fair. It is not \ngood for this body and it is not good for individual Senators.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. I was supposed to ask you a \nquestion, but I didn't do that. I hope the Senator understands. I \nwanted to make sure he was on the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, Senator Reid and I came to the House \ntogether in 1982. We worked on a lot of issues together. He is a \nstraight shooter and a real good leader on our side. I appreciate his \nwords.\n  Let me close with this: I have said any number of times to my \nRepublican friends, when we are talking about how to bring this bill to \nthe floor, the one sure way to kill it is to not permit the minority to \nhave a reasonable opportunity to offer amendments, germane and \nnongermane. I was troubled this morning, after having tried to drive \nthat message home again and again in the past months, for us to end up \non the floor today with a motion to invoke cloture and to limit \namendments to one nongermane amendment and a number of germanes.\n  That was the wrong way to get started. We need to get back on the \nright track. We can do that. The people who can get us back on the \nright track are the majority leader and the minority leader. While the \nminority leader is not a proponent of the bill, he has been fair in \nterms of making sure those who are proponents can have our day in court \non the floor and not be obstructionist. I am grateful for that. I hope \nthat maybe even while we are speaking, or shortly thereafter, the two \nleaders will get together and have the kind of discussion in private \nthat they need to have, and maybe later in public on the floor, so we \ncan have a day that is more productive tomorrow than today was.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I wish to take an opportunity to make \na few comments and respond to some of the statements that have been \nmade by individuals on the other side of the aisle who are opposed to \nthis bill. I know a lot of people on the other side of the aisle favor \nthis bill and that is why we have been able to get to the place where \nthis legislation is coming up again. So my remarks are made toward and \nin response to those who oppose this legislation, not those who have \nbeen helping us move it along.\n  For instance, I heard there were claims that the Class Action \nFairness Act has never been considered before, that there have not been \nany hearings or markups on this legislation. Clearly, these Members \nhave not been talking to the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, who has \nworked hard with me since the 105th Congress. Clearly, critics didn't \npay any attention to what I had to say last night in my opening \nstatement or, for that matter, many of the statements made by my \ncolleagues on the long history of this legislation.\n  To the contrary, Congress has been considering this Class Action \nFairness Act for several years. Small businesspeople who are paying for \nthis irresponsible tort system we have in America would tell you they \nhave been paying dearly too long and that this legislation is long \noverdue. One might even find some big companies saying that. But there \nis no free lunch in America. Somebody is paying when there are \nfrivolous lawsuits. Somebody is paying when lawyers are getting paid \ntoo much and when consumers are getting too little. It is a cost to the \neconomy, and we ought to do something about irresponsible costs to our \neconomy.\n\n  My colleagues may remember--or they may not remember or we would not \nhave heard these comments today about this legislation--as I indicated \nin my opening statement last night, both the House and Senate have \nconvened hearings on class action abuse and the need for reform. Are we \nhearing there have never been hearings held? On what planet are those \nSenators living?\n  The House has passed similar versions of the Class Action Fairness \nAct since the 105th Congress and have done it, by the way, with very \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  In the Senate in the 105th Congress--this is the 108th Congress. We \ncan go back to the 107th, the 106th, and the 105th Congresses when \nthere was work done on this legislation. At that time, I held hearings \non class action abuse in the Judiciary Committee's Administrative \nOversight and Court Subcommittee. In the 106th Congress, my \nsubcommittee held another hearing on class actions, and the Judiciary \nCommittee marked up and reported the Class Action Fairness Act, two \nCongresses ago.\n  In the last Congress, the 107th, the Judiciary Committee held a \nhearing on class action abuse. And in the 108th Congress, the Judiciary \nCommittee marked up the bill.\n  Any Senator who says we have not had hearings on this legislation has \nnot been in the Senate very long or they do not have very good staff \nhelping them or they are not doing anything themselves.\n  The bill we are considering is also compromise legislation that we \nworked out in a bipartisan way, a continuation of the bipartisan spirit \nof this legislation that is exemplified by the work of Senator Kohl now \nfor over four Congresses. We did this with Senators Schumer, Dodd, and \nLandrieu since the cloture vote failed last October.\n  While the bill numbers may have changed for the Class Action Fairness \nAct, we have been working on it now for the fourth Congress. If people \nthink just because we change the title of a bill we ought to have \nanother hearing, that is just an excuse for stalling. If they do not \nlike the bill, vote against it. But let's move something along that \nneeds to be moved along, and there is a consensus in this body that it \nought to be done.\n  I heard this morning claims that the Class Action Fairness Act would \ndeny people the ability to file class action lawsuits. That is just \nplain not true. We do not take away claimants' ability to file in State \ncourt. All we do is modify the rules to allow removal to Federal court \nfor class actions that fit certain criteria within this bill, and most \noften that is when there is a national implication of the class action \nsuit, or it is not limited to a single State. It is in no way mandatory \nin our legislation that these cases need to proceed to the Federal \ncourt.\n  Moreover, the claims that we have heard this morning and this \nafternoon that the Federal courts do not certify class actions are not \ntrue either. The Federal courts certify class action cases all the \ntime, and the claimants win their suits in the Federal courts\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\nand it is often seen as a forum of preference.\n\n  A recent Federal Judiciary Center study found that it was more likely \nfor a class action to be certified in Federal court than in State \ncourt. There simply is no foundation, then, for the allegation that \nFederal courts are less capable of deciding these kinds of cases than \nState courts. Simply, that does not meet the commonsense test.\n  It also is not true that it will take longer for Federal courts to \ndecide class actions. The Federal courts have more resources to decide \nthese cases than State courts. In fact, we have the same Federal \nJudicial Center study indicating that State courts are much more likely \nthan Federal courts to sit on class action lawsuits.\n  Also, I want to restate that we have made significant changes to the \nbill to ensure that truly local class actions stay in State court. This \nis the local controversy exception that was worked out to bring on \nother Democratic Senators who did not like certain aspects of the bill \nbut wanted the bill to pass and said they would help us get it passed. \nThose Senators who wanted that local class action exemption, that the \nclass action stay in State courts, were Senators Schumer, Dodd, and \nLandrieu.\n  Earlier, some of my colleagues indicated that local issues, such as \nthe PCP leak made famous in the Erin Brockovich case, or suits brought \nby nursing home residents would be required to be heard in Federal \ncourt. Again, this is not true because of the compromise that we \ncrafted with these other Senators and included in the bill that is now \nbefore us.\n  So it is not true that if you have your case heard in Federal court, \nyou will get no justice. That is an outrageous statement and, quite \nfrankly, an insult to the Federal judiciary. The Class Action Fairness \nAct does not close the courtroom door to anyone. Congress has studied \nthis issue, and Congress has found that there are many problems that \nneed to be considered. That is why we have been working on this \nsteadily for so many Congresses.\n  A number of studies have come out indicating there are serious abuses \nof the class action system. There have been numerous editorials and \narticles that support this bill. It is a bipartisan bill. So I think we \nought to move on. The Senate is functioning as the Senate ought to \nfunction. As I said last night, nothing gets done in the Senate that is \nnot bipartisan, and when it comes to an issue of partisanship, if 41 \nSenators stand against it--and that is quite a minority in this \nSenate--nothing gets done.\n  We had that vote last October, 59 votes, 1 short of the supermajority \nto move on, but enough to bring a halt to the consideration of this \nlegislation, because nothing happens in this body unless there is \nstrong bipartisan support. After that cloture vote, we spent last fall \nworking with Senators on the other side of the aisle to get above that \n60.\n\n  So if there is a situation where one Senator is still not satisfied, \ndo we shut down the whole Senate, or where we maybe even have 10 \nSenators not satisfied? What more do we have to do to get over that \ncustomary rule in the Senate of 60 votes to stop debate to get to \nfinality?\n  For sure, if we get to a cloture of 60 votes and end up with 70 votes \nor 75 votes, are not the people trying to stall this legislation \nsomewhat embarrassed by wanting to shut down the whole legislative \nprocess? So we have worked to get over that magic hurdle, and when we \nget over that we will have plenty of votes.\n  Remember the vote we had through April and May on what we call the \nFSC/ETI bill, or the JOBS bill, the bill I called creating jobs in \nmanufacturing? We took 15 days over about 2 months to get that \nlegislation passed. It passed 92 to 5.\n  There were all sorts of games being played with it on matters totally \nunrelated to the underlying legislation, all in the interest of \npreserving minority rights. Well, I think this bill has met that test, \nand we ought to move on. We still have a few people who do not want to \nmove on, and that is a sad commentary, because when one plays by the \nrules of the game, it seems to me that people who do not get their way \nhave to quit crying in their beer and suck it in, suck it up and move \non. That is what I am asking my colleagues on the other side to do, \nsuck it up and move on.\n  Let the Senate work. It has worked. This legislation is proof that it \nis working.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to oppose the Class Action \nFairness Act.\n  This bill is anything but fair to the millions of consumers who will \nhave the courthouse doors slammed on them.\n  Class action lawsuits are the only way a large number of people can \nget justice for a harm done to them by a consumer product, a corporate \npractice or an environmental harm. It is often not possible or \npractical for an ordinary individual to go to court against powerful \ncorporations when they have only have a small amount of damage from a \ndangerous product. These cases help Americans, who can not bring a \nlawsuit on their own behalf, get their day in court. We cannot close \nthe courthouse door on them.\n  I do believe that there are problems in the tort system that we need \nto address, and I have supported reform efforts to do that. But this \nbill goes too far. It throws the baby out with the bath water, removing \nvirtually every State class action to Federal court.\n  Yesterday's New York Times called this bill ``A mischievous bill \nmasquerading as . . . reform.'' In fact, this bill does little to \nreform the tort system and does much more to benefit the special \ninterests who are supporting it.\n  Supporters of this legislation have claimed that they are making the \nsystem fairer and that they have improved on the original bill. But \ncreating a system which moves virtually all class action cases to \nfederal court is not fair to consumers, workers and victims of \ndiscrimination, who stand to benefit from strong State laws on consumer \nand environmental protection, civil rights protections and labor \nrights.\n  In our federalist system, these individuals look to their State \ncourts and State judges for justice and this bill would undermine those \nrights.\n  This bill will also cause many of these cases to be dismissed once \nthey reach Federal court. It is a bait and switch game. Get the cases \nout of State court and into Federal court where there are more hurdles \nfor a class to be certified and then the case is thrown out. That is \nnot fair either.\n  Finally, this legislation means delay and denial for injured \nconsumers. Our Federal courts are already overburdened. Adding a \nsignificant number of cases to their dockets will only create further \ndelay, both for the cases that this bill removes to those courts and \nfor the cases that are already there. Judges will have more complex \ncases, with no additional resources, and plaintiffs will wait longer \nand longer for relief, if they get relief at all. Federal judges have \neven said that they don't want all these cases sent to them.\n  Instead, it is the special interests who will benefit. They will be \nable to take cases out of State courts where they belong, even if most \nof the plaintiffs live in the State and the issue involved purely \nmatters of State law. Corporations will be able to move these cases to \nFederal court where it is harder to certify a class, where courts often \nwon't certify a multi-State action, and where business interests have \nan advantage over the little guy. That puts special interests above the \ninterests of working Americans.\n  Supporters of this bill claim that consumers will benefit from the \nprovisions they have added to the bill. They say that the bill will \nsafeguard consumer rights and make sure that the lawyers don't get all \nthe money. But what this bill really safeguards is a good outcome for \ncorporations, for drug companies, and the tobacco industry, by changing \nthe case to a forum known to be better for business and, once its \nthere, not even guaranteeing that the Federal court will allow it to \nproceed. That means State and Federal courthouse doors all over our \nNation will be slammed on those seeking to hold business accountable \nfor harmful practices. That is not fair and that's not what our legal \nsystem is all about.\n  As I travel through my State, I hear about problems with the legal \nsystem. Most often people are concerned about\n\n[[Page S7740]]\n\npolicies that restrict access to the courts and not with abuses of the \ntort system. Yet I know that there are problems out there, and I have \nbeen on the record saying let's fix the problems.\n  But this bill doesn't do it. This bill does not deal directly with \nthe problems. This bill is a one-size-fits-all solution to a \ncomplicated legal problem. Instead, let's look directly at the problems \nthat are impacting consumers, workers and communities and where there \nare abuses in legal fees or trial awards they should be fixed. Many \nStates have led the way, fixing their own systems to prevent some of \nthe abuses that proponents of this bill talk about. More work needs to \nbe done and the Senate should be looking at doing that instead of \nsupporting this overbroad bill.\n  But I believe in fixing the problems. That is why I supported Senator \nBreaux's alternative the last time we debated this bill and why I will \nvote to support his and Senator Bingaman's amendments if they are able \nto offer them this time around. That is why I was optimistic when \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee were debating this issue, and I wish \nthat we had given them more time to conduct hearings to get the root of \nthe concerns and provide a specific solution.\n  Yet today we find ourselves faced with a bill that goes too far. I \ncame to the Senate to fight for the little guy when his or her rights \nwere trampled. This legislation threatens those rights, and I urge my \ncolleagues to reject it. We should go back to the drawing board and \ncome up with a proposal that gets at the heart of the abuses but \ndoesn't undermine the rights of consumers and others looking for a fair \nday in court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I arrived to hear the final comments of my \nvery respected colleague from the neighboring State of Iowa. With all \ndue respect, I am surprised, at least as I heard it, that my colleagues \nand I on this side of the aisle are being vilified for the status of \nthis legislation. I was curious because the Senator, of course, knows, \nas chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, about the fate of the \nlegislation that he saw through in his own committee to which he just \nreferred, the FSC/ETI bill.\n  From my understanding of that legislation, what happened to that \nafter it left the Finance Committee, to the point where it reached the \nSenate floor, and not always with the chairman's concurrence, what was \nadded to it as part of the process and what has been done to it over in \nthe House, if we want to talk about legislation that has had measures \nadded to it where there is no connection to the public interest--and I \nsee no connection to the bill at all which is called the JOBS Act; in \nthe House it was called the Jobs in America Act--and then provides the \nkind of tax breaks that it does in the Senate bill for $39 billion \nworth for outsourcing American jobs and expanding businesses and their \nsubsidiaries in other countries, it is hard for me to see how we are \nthe sole culprits in wanting to add measures to this bill.\n  I believe there are members of the other caucus who also desire to \nadd measures to this bill because there are not many bills that are \nlikely going to be passed and confereed and signed into law. We have \nour genuine interests in seeing that some of these important measures \nreceive at least an up-or-down vote in the Senate, and then either \nproceed or not accordingly.\n  The Senator said we devoted 15 days to that corporate tax bill. I do \nnot know why there is this rush to close the door on this legislation \nwhich is before us now. I do not support this bill, but I do support \ndealing with it and having an up-or-down vote on it, but only after all \nof us on both sides of the aisle have had the opportunity to bring \nforward our amendments and have them acted upon. That is the tradition \nof the Senate. That is the spirit of the Senate. Those are the rules of \nthe Senate. I do not see anybody on this side who is trying to be an \nobstructionist. I see people on this side who thought that was our \nunderstanding and agreement and want to proceed on that basis.\n  I do rise to oppose this underlying legislation, which is truly a \nwolf in sheep's clothing. Its proponents claim, as a top U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce official is quoted in yesterday's Washington Post, that it \nis strictly process, that it does not affect anyone's substantive \nrights.\n  That is nonsense. If that were true, we would not be debating this \nbill on the Senate floor yet again and it would not be the third time \nthat this issue has been brought before the Senate in this session. \nThat same Chamber of Commerce official also said: There are a number of \njuries on the State level where a lot of abuses are going on.\n  What are those abuses that we hear about over and over by the \nproponents of this legislation to justify the actions that it would \ntake? Well, the people who are pushing this legislation are unhappy \nwith the decisions that juries are making. Too often the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce and other proponents claim juries are deciding for the \nplaintiffs, for the groups of people who have claimed that they have \nbeen wronged, and against the defendants, which are usually large and \nwealthy corporations.\n  So that is the abuse: Juries, comprised of qualifying citizens agreed \nto by the attorneys for both sides, are deciding too many cases for the \npeople who have been harmed and then are awarding financial settlements \nmore costly than the convicted defendants would like. Well, our \ncountry's judicial system has a long roster of defendants who are \nunhappy with the verdicts and their punishments, but Congress is not \nconsidering changes that benefit all of them.\n  This present judicial system is not perfect--nothing ever is--but it \nworks better than most systems in our country. In fact, it may be the \nlast place the people without money have a fair chance against people \nwho do. People without money cannot afford to hire a full-time lobbyist \nto influence Congress or State legislators or Federal and State \nadministrations. They do not make big campaign contributions or hold \nfancy receptions at party conventions. Many Americans cannot even \nafford to hire a lawyer to assert their rights in a court of law. They \ndo not have the hundreds or thousands of dollars needed to pay for the \npreparation of complex cases and all the time required to go through \nthe judicial process. They cannot afford the special consultants that \nmany legal defense teams use to select the juries that are most \nsympathetic to them. Thus, many Americans have to join together with \nother alleged victims in order to be able to afford all together to \nseek justice, to have their day in court. They might win; they might \nlose, but at least they have their day in court. They do lose, many \ntimes, in State courts as well as in Federal courts. But of course we \ndon't hear any complaints from the Chamber about those juries. The only \n``abuses'' are when the people win, and the moneyed interests lose. So \nthe moneyed interests have come to the Congress to get the special \nfavors they want in order to have the world their way.\n\n  Tragically for this country, it is likely, it appears, that Congress \nis going to give the powerful, moneyed special interests what they want \nat the expense of everyone else in America. Hundreds or thousands of \nthe people we are supposed to represent will be hurt by this \nlegislation. Most of them do not realize yet that they are in the \nprocess of being harmed; they are too busy working, raising their \nfamilies, going about their lives, until something bad happens to them \nand they need to seek justice.\n  This legislation would hurt their chances to get that justice. This \nbill would move many of their cases to Federal courts where the delays \nare greater, where the waits for justice are much longer, and where, \nevidently, the rich and the powerful win more often. That is why this \nbill's proponents want us to pass it. To me, that is exactly why we \nshould reject it.\n  There are other reasons to reject this bill. The Chief Justice of the \nUnited States has asked Congress not to shift cases from State courts \nto Federal courts. In 1998 he said:\n\n       In my annual report last year I criticized the Senate for \n     moving too slowly in the filling of vacancies on the Federal \n     bench.\n\n  That was back in 1998.\n\n       I also criticized Congress and the President for their \n     propensity to enact more and more legislation which brings \n     more and more\n\n[[Page S7741]]\n\n     cases into the Federal court system. If Congress enacts and \n     the President signs new laws allowing more cases to be \n     brought into the Federal courts, just filling the vacancies \n     will not be enough.\n\n  More recently, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the \npolicymaking body for the entire Federal judiciary, wrote Chairman \nHatch on March 6, 2003, of their opposition:\n\n       . . . based on concerns that the revisions would add \n     substantially to the workload of the Federal courts and are \n     inconsistent with the principles of federalism.\n\n  So this bill ignores the advice of the Federal judiciary and the \nChief Justice of the United States, and it ignores the best interests \nof most Americans in order to further advantage the rich and the \npowerful. Proponents say the judicial system is broken and needs to be \nfixed. I say what needs to be fixed is this legislative system, whereby \nthe rich and the powerful get special legislation passed that helps \nthem and hurts everyone else. I have seen it tried time after time in \nmy 3\\1/2\\ years here. I have seen the rich and the powerful win most of \nthose times, and the people who are not rich and powerful abandoned. It \nlooks like that will happen again. What a tragedy for the Senate. What \na tragedy for America.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this late afternoon to \nstand in support of the Class Action Fairness Act of 2004. I thank my \ncolleagues, especially Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, and a Senator who has been a champion of the reform of this \nparticular provision of law in our country for a good number of years.\n  When working properly, class action lawsuits are an important part of \nour civil judicial system. The whole idea behind class actions is to \npromote the efficient, effective administration of justice by allowing \nfor the consolidation of numerous, but identical claims brought against \none defendant. When working properly, these lawsuits provide relief to \na large number of people who have been victimized--when working \nproperly. But our current class action system is not working properly.\n  The class action system is uniquely ripe for abuse. In normal \nlitigation, plaintiffs who have been injured seek out an attorney to \nredress their grievances. In class action litigation, this process is \nreversed--lawyers are appointing themselves as counsel to a group of \npeople who may or may not feel victimized. This designated victim may \nnot only be unaware he or she is even part of a lawsuit, this person \nmight be perfectly satisfied with the product or service that is the \nsubject of the litigation. Even when a large group has suffered an \ninjury, the lawyers are often the real winners, as they are able to \nsecure large fees while their clients receive coupons of little or \ndubious value.\n  A serious need for this legislation has also resulted from the \nactions of a few rogue State courts. Diversity jurisdiction was \nestablished to facilitate commerce by ensuring that claims brought \nagainst interstate businesses would be heard in Federal court, so as to \navoid local biases. The Framers foresaw the potential chilling effect \nthat could occur on commerce if out-of-State businesses were forced to \ndefend themselves in front of State court judges, who have a greater \npotential to ``play favorites.''\n  The Framers realized this in 1787. Today, we live in an advanced \ntechnological age, where interstate business occurs at the click of a \nbutton, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Certainly, the Framers' efforts \nto ensure the fairness of claims brought against out-of-State \ndefendants is no less important today; and, at the very least, commerce \nstill deserves the amount of protection our Constitution already \nprovides.\n  However, under current law, a class action involving thousands of \nresidents from all 50 States and millions of dollars does not qualify \nfor access to Federal court. The Class Action Fairness Act resolves \nthis problem by ensuring that truly local disputes will be litigated in \nState courts, while interstate class actions, involving national \nissues, will be heard in Federal court.\n  S. 2064 will go a long way toward ensuring the intent behind the \nestablishment of class actions is followed. S. 2064 will do this by \nreforming the diversity rule applicable to class actions in order to \nprovide greater protections for consumers by curbing class action \nlawsuit abuses, which are enriching lawyers at the expense of \nconsumers.\n  S. 2064 is in line with our idea of justice and fairness. As set \nforth in Article III of the Constitution, the Framers established \ndiversity jurisdiction to ensure impartiality for all parties in \nlitigation involving persons from multiple jurisdictions, particularly \ncases in which defendants from one State are sued in the local courts \nof another State. Interstate class actions--which often involve \nmillions of parties from numerous States--present the exact concerns \ndiversity jurisdiction was designed to prevent: the potential for local \nprejudice by the court against out-of-State defendants or a judicial \nfailure to recognize the interests of other States in the litigation.\n  This act is not about protecting ``big business,'' as some critics \nclaim. Rather, it is about protecting the rights of workers and \nconsumers. I come from the great State of Idaho, where the need to \nattract new industries is important to our largely rural economy. If a \nbusiness cannot be sure of the liability it might face in the event of \nlitigation, it will be more reluctant to leave its State of \nincorporation. And, when litigation costs become too unpredictable, the \neffect will be to dissuade investment. Or, worse yet, businesses will \nconverge on a few select States, whose laws are most favorable to \ncorporate interests--not only clogging the dockets and slowing down \njustice in those courts, but providing business opportunities in only a \nfew select areas. This is not good for anyone.\n  Under the Class Action Fairness Act, the exact type of cases that \nshould be heard in Federal court--cases involving issues of national \nimportance--will be heard in Federal court. While, a case between two \ncitizens from different states, with no national significance, will be \nleft to the State courts. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues \nto support this important legislation.\n  Finally we have a bipartisan bill on the floor of the Senate and it \nis ready to be debated, ready to receive amendments, ready to be voted \non. It is exciting when work of this kind reaches that, if you will, \nsupermajority status that finds both Democrats and Republicans in \nsupport of it. There are some 60 cosponsors, I understand, of this \ncritical legislation.\n  Much has been said about it this afternoon, both pro and con, but the \nreality is we have a system that has been largely abused and misused \nand clearly one our Founding Fathers put within the construct of our \njudicial system to provide a fairness element to all of those in the \nbroad context that class action addresses, not to be victimized by the \nsystem but to be served by the system. I hope we can find ourselves a \nway, through the course and process of the Senate rules, to allow an \namendment, amendments, and ultimately final passage on this important \nlegislation.\n  I was on the floor earlier this morning when our majority leader was \nattempting to work out a satisfactory process by which we could debate \nand bring resolution to this important legislative agenda. But I was \none of those who had an amendment on the floor, ready to go, that was \nnot specifically germane to class action. Strangely enough, it is in \nitself a bipartisan piece of legislation, having now garnered the \nsupport of some 63 Members of this Senate. It deals with some element \nof immigration reform, specifically in the area of agriculture, dealing \nwith substantial reform in the H-2A designated immigrant, or I should \nsay worker, as it relates to agriculture.\n  Here we have two pieces of legislation worked on for many years by \nour colleagues here in the Senate, one the class action legislation \nwith 60-plus cosponsors, my agriculture jobs legislation with over 63 \ncosponsors, and somehow we can't seem to get the process working in a \nway that would allow us to vote on these up or down.\n  I was certainly willing to offer my amendment and to seek a time \nlimit of 4 or 5 hours to debate it, to allow Members to come to the \nfloor and possibly amend it or to offer amendments and\n\n[[Page S7742]]\n\nwithstand the judgment of their colleagues as to whether those \namendments were worthy in shaping or reshaping or transforming \nlegislation that 62 other colleagues and I wanted on the floor for the \npurpose of debate and consideration.\n  That is also true of the class action legislation. We have heard a \ngreat deal today about the pros and cons of the legislation, S. 2062, \nthat is before us. The great tragedy we are now facing is the process \nand/or the procedure may disallow an up-or-down vote on class action. \nThere is a strong effort on the part of my leadership to block my \neffort in coming to the floor with a strongly developed bipartisan \npiece of legislation to address that also.\n  Does the public become confused by this effort? I suspect they might, \nand that is difficult as we attempt to work out the differences and \nallow these kinds of issues to come to the floor. I am prepared to vote \non class action. I am prepared to support the legislation, the \nunderlying bill that is now on the floor.\n  I also hope my colleagues will seriously consider that a time is \nnecessary to deal with an immigration reform policy. Although it is not \na whole cup, although it does not address the universe of undocumented \nforeign immigrants in this country, it deals with a very critical part \nof America, American agriculture, that now finds it must seek its \nworkforce in a way that allows it to become nearly 80 percent \nundocumented because the law is so restrictive and prohibitive and \ncumbersome and bureaucratic that the average agricultural producer \nsimply cannot identify with it in an appropriate timeline to harvest \nhis or her crops.\n\n  They seek employment from people who want to come here and work. Not \nAmerican citizens. American citizens don't do that kind of work \nanymore. They are, if you will, an economic cut above it. Or they have \na social program that simply allows them a sustenance or a lifestyle in \nwhich they don't need to seek that kind of employment.\n  But there are now about 1.5 million undocumented workers in this \ncountry who are employed by American agriculture, who harvest our \ncrops, who bring them into the process, and who ultimately help get \nthem to the supermarket shelf. Yet we cannot in a responsible, legal \nfashion deal with them. That is why I spent the last 5 years working \nwith a vast array of people, both House and Senate, to fashion this \nlegislation. That is why it now has 63 sponsors. It is why it now has \nover 400 groups nationwide, from the National Farm Bureau to the United \nFarm Workers Union to the AFL/CIO to the National Nurseries \nAssociation, that say it is critical this legislation pass.\n  We have producers, agricultural producers in our country today who \nare finding it so difficult to gain the necessary employees to do the \nwork in the field or in the processing sheds that they are \ncontemplating--and some have already made the decision--to go out of \nbusiness.\n  Where does that production go? Offshore, out of the country to Chile \nor Peru or someplace like that instead of happening in the valleys and \nin the farm fields of America.\n  Why can't we solve this problem? Some say it is too political. I \nsuggest it is not political at all. It is time that we lead, that we \nsolve it, that we address the issues, that we create a system that \nallows people to come to our country to do certain kinds of work and to \ngo home--to do it in a legal, open, transparent way while we can \neffectively control our borders as we should as a great nation, and at \nthe same time for those who are illegal we ought to be able to \napprehend them and remove them from our country. But to do the first or \nthe last without something in the middle that creates an effective, \nresponsible avenue and workforce is simply irresponsible.\n  That, in essence, is what we have created.\n  What happened after 9/11? We rediscovered all of this vast array of \nimmigration law in our country that doesn't work.\n  We have between 8 and 12 million undocumented people in our country. \nI say shame on us for having allowed that to happen. You solve the \nproblem, you control the border. Great nations maintain their integrity \nby controlling their borders. Great nations maintain their integrity by \ncreating a civil process on the inside that effectively works. Great \nnations maintain their integrity by apprehending those who are \nviolators of the law and treating them accordingly. In this instance, \nand in those examples or situations, we are not doing either.\n  I proposed--and 62 of my colleagues agree--a piece of legislation \nthat is most critical to our country and to a segment of our economy. I \nbrought it to the floor this morning willing to stand it alongside this \nimportant piece of legislation, willing to limit the debate on it so \nthat we can facilitate the process and move this through. And I surely \nthought the underlying bill with 60-plus cosponsors, and my amendment \nwith 63, ought to be something that can come together. Apparently it \ncan't, or it won't.\n  I am here this evening to tell my colleagues we ought to be debating \nand voting on this important piece of class action reform legislation, \nand we ought to be voting on agricultural jobs. We ought not simply put \nit off. Those who are the critics of it, who have no alternative, \nsimply want us to, as we have done for two decades, turn our backs, \nlook over our shoulders, say, Oops, there is a problem, while in many \ninstances these human beings are treated inhumanely, while over 350 of \nthem died at the United States-Mexican border this past year, while we \nsimply say, Oh, well, it is so complicated we cannot solve it.\n  I suggest we can. I suggest it is ready to be solved now and that \nmany of us have worked to accomplish that.\n  I hope our leadership can work with the other side and work out our \ndifferences and get a unanimous consent agreement that shapes the time \nand moves this legislation forward. We ought not have lawyers working \nthe legal system to simply benefit their pockets while the citizens who \nmay have been harmed get little or nothing but a meaningless coupon of \ndubious value. That is not the appropriate way for our legal system to \nwork in this country. And that is why Senators Grassley, Carper, \nChafee, Dodd, Hatch, Kohl, Landrieu, Lugar, Miller, Schumer, Specter, \nand a good many others believe that S. 2062 ought to become the law of \nthis land.\n  I hope by tomorrow we will have resolved this important situation in \na way that allows us to move forward in a timely fashion and allow the \nAmerican people to see where we stand on these critical issues.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to update everybody as to where we \nare with respect to the Class Action Fairness Act. From the many \nstatements over the course of today and last night, it is clear that \nthis bill is important to the American people, and it is important to \nthe economy. It is a bill about equity and it is a bill about fairness.\n  Earlier today, I attempted to reach an agreement that would allow an \norderly process to consider the bill. The agreement respected Members' \nrights to offer amendments, but also represented a commitment to focus \non the issue--class action reform--and eventually proceed toward a \nfinal agreement with the House through the regular conference process. \nThat is all we asked with no restrictions as long as we stayed on the \nbill, amendments on the bill, and once we passed it in the Senate, it \nwould go to a conference with the House.\n  The important point is at the end of the day--and this is where we \nstand tonight--by the end of this week we need to pass this bill and do \nwhat is right for the American people to create a public law.\n  Unfortunately, we were unable to get this agreement. There was an \noffer from the other side which did not necessarily allow completion of \nthis measure, and that offer included five nongermane amendments, the \nsubject matter of these amendments simply being unknown. These \nnongermane amendments are totally unrelated to class action reform. \nThey could be controversial in nature, and I can tell my colleagues, \nsharing with my colleagues\n\n[[Page S7743]]\n\nwhich amendments they might be, indeed they are very controversial in \nnature and would require extended debate. That is not the way to \ncomplete action on this bill.\n  With that said, I am prepared to file cloture this evening on the \nbill. I do so continuing to hope we can consider relevant amendments to \nthe bill while the motion ripens. If colleagues do have relevant class \naction amendments they want considered, I encourage them to come \nforward and discuss them with the managers and let us work out a \nprocess to dispose of them.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I now send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     430, S. 2062, a bill to amend the procedures that apply to \n     consideration of interstate class actions to assure fairer \n     outcomes for class members and defendants, and for other \n     purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Orrin Hatch, Charles Grassley, Peter \n           Fitzgerald, Craig Thomas, Mitch McConnell, Ted Stevens, \n           Robert F.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, this \nvote will occur on Friday unless it is vitiated by some other \nagreement, and we will remain in discussion and willing to vitiate it \nif agreement can be reached. We will be on the bill throughout \ntomorrow's session.

Mr. President, I would like to set aside a few moments \ntoday to reflect on the life of LCpl Russell P. White. Russell \nepitomized the best of our country's brave men and women who are \nfighting to secure a new democracy in the Middle East. He exhibited \nunwavering courage, dutiful service to his country, and above all else, \nhonor. In the way he lived his life--and how we remember him--Russell \nreminds each of us how good we can be.\n   A resident of Dagsboro, Russell's passing has deeply affected the \ncommunity. A graduate of Indian River High School, Russell was the son \nof Gregg and Tricia White. Friends, family, and school officials \nrecalled Russell as a proud young man who made a sacrifice for their \nfreedom, even if his death did not come during combat. As a senior at \nIndian River High School in rural Frankford, Russell spent his days in \nclassrooms overlooking soybean fields, and his spare time at home \nhunting duck along tranquil Vines Creek. In his senior year, he tried \nout for and made the football team at Indian River. He became a starter \nand, at a mere 165 pounds, played nose guard, out hustling opposing \nlineman who weighed 50 to 100 pounds more than he did.\n   But Russell had a desire to be part of something bigger. He wanted \nto be among the troops sent to hunt Osama bin Laden in the mountainous \nterrain of Afghanistan, so he joined the Marines early last year.\n   Russell had been stationed in Afghanistan for about a month prior to \nhis death and was part of the mission to root out bin Laden and other \nmembers of al-Qaida. He was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine \nRegiment, whose home base is at Camp Lejeune, NC.\n   Russell was remembered by his fellow marines as a young man who had \na kind spirit and a zest for life with an outlook that sometimes got \nhim into a little trouble, especially in the 13 grueling weeks of boot \ncamp. When drill sergeants would bark orders, Russell would often crack \na smile, unlike others who might shed tears in their bunks at night. \n``They couldn't crack him,'' Russell's father, Gregg, said. While \nRussell may have found some of his early training a little amusing, he \nwas absolutely serious about his duties in Afghanistan.\n   Russell was a remarkable and well-respected young soldier. His \nfriends and family remember him as an honorable man. He enjoyed playing \nfootball, hunting, skiing and being out on the water. He had hoped to \nreturn to Sussex County to help run his father's home-building \nbusiness.

On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On October 14, 1995, a 9-year-old boy named Steven Wilson was found \nbrutally raped, beaten, and drowned in a muddy ditch one mile from his \nhouse. Around the town, little Steven was known as a kid who liked to \nplay with dolls. Other kids teased him and called him ``fag.'' \nNonetheless, Lamont Harden, a 15-year-old neighbor of Wilson, confessed \nto this horrific murder on the basis that he was trying to ``humble the \nfag'' that allegedly got into a scuffle with his brother.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/07/senate-section/article/S7743-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7743-S7744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERIOR ALASKA WILDFIRES\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 10 years ago, on July 6, 1994, fourteen \nwildland firefighters lost their lives fighting the deadly South Canyon \nFire near Glenwood Springs, CO. Nine of the 13 who perished were \nmembers of a single crew--a hotshot crew based in the small high desert \ntown of Prineville in central Oregon. The ``Prineville Nine,'' as they \nhave come to be called, were all in their 20s.\n  The events of July 6, 1994 were as significant to the wildland fire \ncommunity as the events of September 11, 2001 were to the New York City \nFire Department, and the brave young men and women who perished in the \nSouth Canyon Fire were every bit as heroic as those who perished at the \nWorld Trade Center.\n  The anniversary of the South Canyon Fire brings home to all who live \nin the West how dearly we hold the brave young men and women, clad in \ntheir fire resistant yellow shirts, green pants and helmets, who fight \nthe fires that sweep through our backyards.\n  On Monday, July 5, I had the privilege to visit a fire camp near \nFairbanks, AK. The young men and women based at the camp were fighting \nthe Boundary Fire, which is burning to the North of Fairbanks, under \nthe experienced leadership of Steve Hart and his Type I Incident \nManagement Team, drawn from the Rocky Mountain region of our Nation.\n  In the course of my visit, I had the opportunity to meet with each of \nthe leaders on the Incident Command Team and received detailed \nbriefings on how the fire was being managed.\n  One of those briefings was delivered by the Incident Safety Officer, \nwho emphasized the acronym L-C-E-S, which stands for lookouts, \ncommunications, escape routes, and safety zones. Wildland firefighters \nare taught to keep safety in their forefront of their minds, constantly \nfocusing on L-C-E-S.\n\n[[Page S7744]]\n\nOn the Boundary Fire, the singular focus on safety is evident \nthroughout the camp. It is clear that the lessons of the South Canyon \nFire have not been lost to history.\n  Today there are 73 wildland fires burning in the State of Alaska and \nsome 1,544 wildland firefighters from 26 states and one province of \nCanada are on the ground tirelessly addressing these fires. Since the \nbeginning of this year's fire season, approximately 2 million acres \nhave burned in Alaska. Most of these acres have burned in seven large \nfires and ``fire complexes'' which occurred in the last few weeks.\n  As of the last report that I received, the Boundary Fire is 27 \npercent contained. Two other incidents are five percent contained and \nthe remaining four are zero percent contained. New fires can start on a \nmoment's notice from a strike of lightening and, depending on the fuel; \nwind shifts can move existing fires at rates of over 2 miles per hour.\n  In fact, a new fire was just reported yesterday, near the villages of \nBettles and Evansville. At 5:00 PM, when the fire was reported, it had \nburned one acre, one hour later it was reported at 500 acres and at \n10:00 PM it was reported at 1500 acres.\n  Last week was an exceptionally difficult one for the people of \nInterior Alaska. In Fairbanks, a dark, smoky haze hung over the \ncommunity. The Boundary Fire was burning about 30 miles to the north of \nFairbanks between the Steese and Elliott Highways, while the Wolf Creek \nFire was burning to the east, near Chena Hot Springs Road.\n  These fires caused the evacuation of more than 280 households and \ncountless animals, including household pets, sled dogs, cows, pigs and \nllamas. While volunteers from the Tanana Valley Chapter of the American \nRed Cross were offering shelter, food and respite from the smoke to the \npeople of Fairbanks, officers from the Fairbanks North Star Borough's \nDivision of Animal Control and numerous volunteers were making sure \nthat the displaced animals were being well cared for.\n  Miraculously, only seven structures, to date, have been lost in the \nspate of these wildfires with no loss of life. Thanks to the hard work \nof firefighters through the Independence Day weekend, the people \nuprooted by the Boundary Fire are returning home today.\n  Although the Boundary and Wolf Creek fires were the subject of \nattention in the national media because of their proximity to urban \nareas, we must not forget that the fires are also threatening bush \nvillages in rural Alaska. The Pingo Fire has burned to within one and \none half miles of the town of Venetie and wildfires continue to \nthreaten habitat that is important to the subsistence lifestyle \npracticed in the village.\n  The people of Eagle on the Canadian border have been challenged by \ntwo fires, one burning west from Dawson City in the Yukon Territory. \nThe safety of these communities, as well as Bettles, Chicken, \nEvansville, Fort Yukon, Stevens Village and Tok are on our minds today.\n  The proximity of wildfires to the outskirts of our urban areas \nreminds us all to be firewise. Building defensible space around \nstructures not only increases the likelihood that a building will \nsurvive a fire; it also increases resident and firefighter safety. \nAlaskans are also being encouraged this week to store their firewood \naway from structures and to use metal or fire resistant roofing \nmaterials in construction. I support these important safety \ninitiatives.\n  I also continue to support the important fuels reduction provisions \nof the President's Healthy Forest Initiative, and will continue to work \nto ensure that adequate resources are made available by Congress to our \nNation's fire fighting crews.\n  Fairbanks is known as the ``Golden Heart City,'' so let me say that \nour golden hearts go out to the thirty seven Alaska Native firefighting \ncrews that are protecting Fairbanks as well as our villages, the Alaska \nfirefighters on mutual aid assignments to fight the wildfires, and \nmembers of the national wildland fire community who have been \ndispatched to Alaska to help us get through this difficult fire season. \nI am deeply grateful to all in the wildland firefighter community for \ntheir tremendous sacrifices and commitment to making all of our \ncommunities safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/07/senate-section/article/S7744-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7744-S7745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today President Bush is holding a private \nfundraiser in North Carolina and complaining about the few judicial \nnominees who have not been given hearings by the Republican-led Senate, \nwhen he should be commending the Senate for confirming nearly 200 of \nhis judicial nominees. One-hundred-ninety-eight of his judicial \nnominees have been confirmed. This number of confirmations is higher \nthan the number of judicial nominees confirmed during President \nReagan's first term, during the President's father's Presidency, and \nduring the final term of President Clinton.\n  With these confirmations, there are only 26 vacant seats in the \nentire Federal judiciary, which is the lowest level since the Reagan \nadministration. Senate Republicans more than doubled circuit court \nvacancies and raised overall federal court vacancies to more than 100 \nfrom 1995 through early 2001. Vacancies have been greatly reduced with \nDemocratic cooperation during the last 4 years. Vacancies have been cut \nby more than 75 percent and judicial emergency vacancies have been cut \nby more than 60 percent from what they were.\n  During the 1996 session, when President Clinton was seeking a second \nterm, Republicans allowed only 17 of his judicial nominees to be \nconfirmed all year and blocked all of his circuit court nominees from \nbeing confirmed. This year, the Senate has confirmed 29 of President \nBush's judicial nominees, including five circuit court nominees.\n  Democrats have acted with bipartisanship toward the judicial \nnomination process and supported the confirmation of this historic \nnumber of judicial nominees of this Republican president. During the 17 \nmonths of Democratic control of the Senate, 100 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees were confirmed. Republicans had blocked the \nconfirmation of more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees, \nincluding nearly two dozen to the circuit courts.\n  The situation in North Carolina illustrates this history of \nRepublican obstruction and the Bush administration's determination to \ntry to pack the courts. During the Clinton administration, four \nnominees from North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit were blocked by \nRepublican Senators, and they never got a hearing or a vote. U.S. \nDistrict Court Judge James Beaty would have become the Fourth Circuit's \nfirst African-American jurist. According to The Charlotte Observer of \nMarch 8, 1996:\n\n       He is an excellent judge, partly because of admirable \n     qualities that make him an ideal candidate for judging \n     others. He rose from humble circumstances and eventually \n     graduate from the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Law. Admirers say \n     he is an ideal judge and citizen: even-tempered, hard-\n     working, fair, serious, intelligent and unfailingly polite.\n\n  Judge Beaty never got a hearing or a vote from Republicans in 1995, \n1996, 1997, or 1998. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Richard Leonard also \nnever got a hearing or a vote in 1995 or 1996 on his nomination to the \nFourth Circuit, nor did Republicans give him a vote in 1999 or 2000 in \nhis nomination to the District Court in North Carolina. North Carolina \nCourt of Appeals Judge James Wynn never got a hearing or a vote on his \nnomination in 1999, 2000, or 2001. Had Judge Wynn been confirmed he \nwould have been the first African American to sit on the Fourth \nCircuit. Law Professor Elizabeth Gibson also did not get a hearing or a \nvote.\n  During Republican control of the Senate, no nominee from North \nCarolina to the Fourth Circuit was allowed to be confirmed during the \nentire Clinton administration. It is ironic that Republicans now claim \nthat Judge Boyle must be confirmed because the seat is considered a \njudicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, \nwhen the North Carolina vacancies on the Fourth Circuit were considered \njudicial emergencies years ago when Republicans blocked Clinton nominee \nafter Clinton nominee. During the Clinton administration, Republicans \nargued that these vacancies did not need to be filled because the \nFourth Circuit had the fastest docket time to disposition in the \ncountry, a distinction it still holds. After three\n\n[[Page S7745]]\n\nconfirmations for Bush nominees to that court, including Judge Duncan, \nthe Fourth Circuit has fewer vacancies today--three--than it did when \nRepublicans claimed no more judges were needed--5 vacancies.\n  Republicans used every argument they could muster to stop Democratic \nnominees from being confirmed to the Fourth Circuit, particularly in \nNorth Carolina, and now they flip flop to claim that Republican \nnominees must be confirmed.\n  When Senator John Edwards was elected, he sought out the middle \nground on judicial nominations, after years of North Carolina nominees \nbeing blocked by Republicans. For example, he should be commended for \nworking with the President on the nomination of Judge Allyson Duncan, \nan African-American women who had served as the President of the North \nCarolina Bar Association, for a seat on the Fourth Circuit. Senator \nEdwards fully supported her confirmation. She was a Republican who had \ntestified in favor of Clarence Thomas' confirmation, but she had a \nreputation of fairness. With Senator Edwards' support, Judge Duncan was \nconfirmed. He broke through the Republican logjam in this circuit. \nSenator Edwards also acted with bipartisanship in supporting the \nconfirmation of two Bush nominees to the district court, Judge Brent \nMcKnight and Judge Louise Flanagan.\n  Senator Edwards has sought out compromise with his fellow North \nCarolina Senators on judicial nominations, but they have, by and large, \nrefused to help find a middle ground. He has supported the proposal of \nthe North Carolina Bar Association that the State establish a \nbipartisan merit selection commission to propose nominees to the \nPresident, Republican or Democratic, to create a long-term solution to \nimpasses that are created by any Senator's insistence on his choice \nalone, with no compromise, for these lifetime seats of trust on the \nFederal bench. Unlike President Bush, Senator Edwards understands what \nit means in reality to be a uniter and not a divider. He comes from a \npart of the country that understands deeply how important it is that \nleaders seek to unite people across racial, economic and political \nlines rather than to divide them.\n\n  Senator Edwards has stood up to efforts by this President to pack the \ncourts with people whose records do not demonstrate that they will be \nfair judges to all who come before them, rich or poor, Democrats or \nRepublicans, or any race or background. He has expressed concerns about \nBush nominees Judge Boyle as well as James Dever, a 40-year-old \nFederalist Society member and Republican Party activist. President Bush \nhas repeatedly claimed that he is opposed to judicial activism while he \nhas simultaneously nominated activists for judicial positions.\n  He would not support the confirmation or recess appointment of a \njudicial nominee who violated judicial ethics to reduce the sentence of \na convicted cross burner, as President Bush did over the holiday \ncelebrating the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King. Senator Edwards \nopposed other Bush judicial nominees whose record demonstrate \ninsensitivity or hostility toward the civil rights and the blessings of \nliberty guaranteed to all Americans. Just yesterday, President Bush \nnominated Keith Starrett to the vacancy created by Judge Pickering's \nrecess appointment and by his resignation from the district court. This \nnomination shows again the President's insensitivity to the wishes of \nso many in the South District of Mississippi by passing over qualified \nAfrican-American candidates for that powerful district court seat. In \nact, this President has chosen narrow ideological purity over diversity \nby nominating more people involved with the Federalist Society than \nAfrican Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans combined.\n  The biggest problem in the judicial nominations process is not with \nthe Senate but with the White House. The judicial nominations process \nbegins with the President, and President Bush has chosen to divide the \nSenate and the American people with his judicial nominations, instead \nof to unite us. The administration is intent on undermining the \nindependence of the Federal judiciary and on making it a clone of the \nRepublican Party. The President and his aides have shown the same \nunilateralism and arrogance to the Senate in their handling of judicial \nnominations that they have shown in so many other important policy \nareas.\n  I commend Senator Edwards for breaking through the Republican logjam \non appointments from North Carolina to the Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit. He has sought out the middle ground while also standing \nfirm in his efforts to protect the right of the people to fair judges \nin our Federal courts. The American people deserve an independent \njudiciary with fair judges who will enforce their rights and uphold the \nlaw.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/07/senate-section/article/S7745-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DRUG PRICING DISCOUNTS\n\n   Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Pfizer, Inc., \nfor its new initiative to provide discounts of between 15 and 50 \npercent off retail prices of its drug inventory to any uninsured \nAmerican, regardless of age or income. We have been grappling with the \nissue of quality, affordable healthcare and accessibility to \nprescription drugs for some time. I think all of us in Congress believe \nthis is one of our most critical challenges. A lot of thoughtful work \nhas gone in to trying to address this, but from my perspective, we have \nhad only limited success to date. As an industry leader, Pfizer has \nreally stepped up to the plate to fill in some of the gaps that we all \nacknowledge still exist.\n   The recently passed Medicare reform bill gives limited assistance to \nseniors and the disabled but leaves 44 million other uninsured \nAmericans without coverage for their medications. The new program \nPfizer is undertaking will offer assistance to those Americans who are \nnot eligible for help under the Medicare plan. Pfizer's effort is truly \na model of corporate responsibility, and I applaud the company for its \nexample. I am particularly proud that Pfizer has a strong commitment to \nmy State of New Jersey, with over 3,700 employees there.\n   We can especially appreciate that this new program covers a range of \ncircumstances. It is widely acknowledged that expanded access to \nprescription drugs is integral to improving the health and quality of \nlife for millions of Americans. By offering substantial discounts on \nits entire drug inventory, including the widely used Lipitor, Celebrex \nand Zoloft, Pfizer is taking an innovative and proactive approach to \nproviding relief to the many Americans who would have gone without \nthese vital medicines because they could not afford them.\n   In addition, there are 27 advocacy groups that have joined in \nsupport of the Pfizer initiative. This kind of collaboration between \nindustry and community-based organizations represents public-private \npartnerships of the best kind. I am pleased to join with so many others \nin commending Pfizer's groundbreaking announcement, and look forward to \nworking with all my colleagues in Congress on efforts to provide \nquality, affordable prescription drug coverage to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/07/senate-section/article/S7745-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         USS ``RONALD REAGAN''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, my fellow \nRhode Islanders, and our Cape Verdean community in celebration of Cape \nVerde Independence Day.\n  Every country is rich with its own history and unique story of how it \nachieved democracy, and Cape Verde is no exception. In 1462, Portuguese \nsettlers arrived at Santiago and founded the first permanent European \nsettlement city in the tropics. In 1951, Portugal changed Cape Verde's \nstatus from a colony to an overseas province in an attempt to blunt \ngrowing nationalism. Five years later, a group of Cape Verdeans, led by \nAmilcar Cabral, and a group from neighboring Guinea-Bissau organized \nthe clandestine African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and \nCape Verde, PAIGC, demanding improvements in economic, social, and \npolitical conditions in Cape Verde and Portuguese Guinea. This \nimportant action formed the basis of the 2 nations' independence \nmovements.\n  By 1972, the PAIGC controlled much of Portuguese Guinea despite the \npresence of the Portuguese troops, but did not disrupt Portuguese \ncontrol in Cape Verde. It was not until the April 1974 revolution in \nPortugal that the PAIGC and Portugal signed an agreement providing for \na transitional government composed of Portuguese and Cape Verdeans. On \nJune 30, 1975, Cape Verdeans elected a national assembly, which \nreceived the instruments of independence from Portugal on July 5, 1975, \nmaking it the official national day of independence.\n  For its first 15 years of independence, Cape Verde was ruled by one \nparty. Then in 1990, opposition groups came together to form the \nMovement for Democracy. Working together they ended the 1-party state \nand the first multi-party elections were held in January 1991.\n  Cape Verde enjoys a stable democratic system where 4 parties share \nseats in the National Assembly. It is an example to other nations as to \nwhat can be accomplished. These democratic changes meant better global \nintegration as the government has pursued market-oriented economic \npolicies and welcomed foreign investors.\n  Today there are close to 350,000 Cape Verdean-Americans living in the \nUnited States, almost equal to the population of Cape Verde itself. \nThese Americans hold a special right since the Cape Verdean \nConstitution formally considers all Cape Verdeans at home and abroad as \ncitizens and voters. Thus, July 5th is a day of independence for all \nCape Verdean-Americans as well as those in Cape Verde.\n  Recently we celebrated the independence of our own country, \nreflecting on the personal sacrifices many have made to ensure our own \nfreedom and democracy. It is fitting we do the same with Cape Verde and \nI urge my colleagues to join me in wishing all those with direct and \nancestral ties to Cape Verde a happy Independence Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/07/senate-section/article/S7746-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO THAYAS RAY BRAY\n\n Mr. LOTT.

In fact, his accomplishments are so numerous \nand his dedication to his community so strong, Moss Point officials \nhave designated this Saturday as ``Thayas Ray Bray Day.'' Along with \nhis wife, Joyce Bray, and two sons, Jerry and Keith, and their \nfamilies, I want to take this opportunity to join the City of Moss \nPoint in congratulating Mr. Bray on all of his hard work.\n  Mr. Bray's service to his local community and fellow citizens has \ntaken on many different forms over the years. He has served as \npresident of YMBC, MPAC, Exchange Club, and JC. He has owned Moss Point \nSonic since 1976, as well as Lucedale Sonic, and has co-owned Jackson \nCounty Funeral Home. I understand he was the original organizer of Moss \nPoint Impact, and a member of the Mississippi Restaurant Association. \nAll the while, he has remained an active member of First Baptist Church \nof Moss Point.\n  By giving back so generously to the community through volunteer time, \nhe has truly made a difference in the lives of others. Leading youth in \nBoy Scouts and Little League baseball are prime examples of his \ndedication. He has supported local activities such as the high school \nband and football, Gulfport Special Olympics, and YMBC Golf \nTournaments. He also has been an active supporter of the fight against \nMuscular Dystrophy, and has supported both the American Cancer Society \nand American Heart Association.\n  As you can see, his contributions to the City of Moss Point are far-\nreaching and have benefited the community in many different ways. So \nagain I want to thank Mr. Bray for his contributions to his community, \nand I want to join my friends and neighbors in applauding and \ncommemorating his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/07/senate-section/article/S7746-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7746-S7747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OPPORTUNITY VILLAGE'S 50TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to honor and celebrate an \norganization that has made an unbelievable impact on my home State of \nNevada.\n  Today marks 50 years since Opportunity Village became part of the Las \nVegas landscape. In 1954, a group of families joined together to \nsupport the needs of children with mental retardation. In the 50 years \nthat followed, Opportunity Village grew to become the largest private \nprovider of vocational training, employment, advocacy, and recreation \nfor people with disabilities in Nevada.\n  Words cannot adequately describe the difference that Opportunity \nVillage makes in the life of a person with severe disabilities. The \norganization gives individuals long-term work experience, marketable \njob skills, independence, and increased self-esteem. Those benefits are \nthe very least that they provide.\n  However, Opportunity Village's accomplishments have not been made \nsingle-handedly. In Las Vegas, there are many wonderful partnerships \nbetween Opportunity Village and community businesses and agencies. \nAmong them are America Nevada Corporation, ATC-Vancom, the U.S. Air \nForce, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Department of Energy, \nthe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. General Services \nAdministration, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, the \nLas Vegas Valley Water District, Bellagio, Harrah's, Station Casinos, \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bank of Nevada, Bechtel, Boyd \nGaming, the City of Henderson, the Clark County Health Department, \nDesert Automotive Group, GES, the Internal Revenue Service, KNPR, \nKrispy Kreme Doughnuts, McCarran International Airport, New York-New \nYork Hotel and Casino, Southwest Gas Corp., Wells Fargo, and Wynn \nResorts. I applaud all of Opportunity Village's partners for their \nvision and their commitment to providing opportunity for so many \nindividuals.\n  I had the chance to see one of the Opportunity Village partnerships \nin action and it was then that I truly understood the tremendous impact \nthey make each and every day. Opportunity Village clients serve more \nthan 60,000 meals per month at the Nellis Air Force Base (AFB) dining \nfacility and also operate the postal service center at the base. On one \nof my visits to the base, Senator Reid and I joined Opportunity Village \nworkers in serving lunch in the mess hall.\n  It was incredible to see individuals with disabilities working and \ninteracting with our military. Not only were they serving food and \nsmiles, but they were contributing to our Nation and the Air Force with \ntheir work.\n  Their accomplishments and contributions are quite remarkable given \nthe hurdles they have faced all their lives.\n  Eddie was diagnosed a mentally retarded child in the first grade. \nThose who know him say he has a genuine and caring personality, a \nchild-like shyness, and the focus of a genius. Eddie began working with \nOpportunity Village in 1986 where his specialty was packaging and \nproduct assembly. Following his mastery of that program, Eddie moved on \nto janitorial services in the work center. Later, he moved to another \npromotion as a room attendant in a hotel. Finally, he was promoted to \nmess attendant at Nellis AFB where the results of his hard work are \neasily seen in the respect he has earned from his coworkers and \nsupervisors.\n  Jamie was diagnosed with mild mental retardation when he was a child. \nHe refused to let the diagnosis slow him\n\n[[Page S7747]]\n\ndown and began working with Opportunity Village in 1998. Jamie started \nin the Work Center where he assembled buckets for $5 an hour. He moved \non to become a part of the janitorial crew in the work center. Then he \njoined the American Nevada Enclave cleaning parking lots. Today, Jamie \nhas proved to be a valuable member of his work team at Nellis AFB where \nhe washes dishes, performs janitorial services, and busses tables. \nJamie will proudly tell you the $8.27 an hour he earns now helps to pay \nhis mom's mortgage.\n  Paul was diagnosed a moderately mentally challenged adult and has a \nhistory of seizures. Despite all of the obstacles placed in his way, \nPaul continues to persevere. Beginning his career with Opportunity \nVillage in August of 1999, Paul focused on production assembly. Quickly \nmastering the techniques necessary, Paul was promoted to room \nattendant. Then he moved to a position cleaning at the American Nevada \nEnclave parking lot. Now, Paul is also a mess attendant at Nellis AFB. \nPaul proudly calls himself a ``team player.''\n  While the accomplishments of Eddie, Jamie, Paul, and all of \nOpportunity Village's clients are inspiring, the benefits to our \ncommunity are not just emotional. Employment generated through \nOpportunity Village contracts helps to reduce dependence on Government \nbenefits and increases tax revenues. Individuals with severe \ndisabilities are paid wages that reduce their need for other Government \nbenefits. Earning wages allows them to become productive members of \nsociety and to join the ranks of the taxpayers of Nevada. Economic \nstudies show that since its inception 50 years ago, Opportunity Village \nhas saved Nevada taxpayers almost $1 billion.\n  I mentioned earlier that Opportunity Village receives vital support \nfrom business partners in reaching its goals. The other two essential \nelements to the success of Opportunity Village are its leadership and \nthe contributions of the Las Vegas community.\n  Year after year, Opportunity Village is named by Las Vegas residents \nas their favorite charity. Las Vegans of all ages look forward to the \nyearly Magical Forest fundraising event as well as many other \nOpportunity Village programs. From world-renowned entertainers to local \ncelebrities to area children to Las Vegas businesses, southern Nevadans \ncontinue to understand the importance of Opportunity Village's mission \nand fully support the 100 percent local organization.\n  And at the helm of Opportunity Village is a man whose vision and \ndedication has made it possible to serve more than 600 disabled workers \nevery day. Opportunity Village Executive Director Ed Guthrie has proven \nto be a tireless advocate for individuals with disabilities and a true \nfriend to the disabled community. I have had the pleasure of working \nwith him on many projects, and I know how committed he is to the \ncontinued success of Opportunity Village.\n  Today, we look back on the last half century with heartfelt gratitude \nfor those local families who, in 1954, decided that their loved ones \nwith disabilities deserved more. They planted the seed that has been \nnurtured and cared for by their extended family of Las Vegans. Today, \nfamilies of disabled individuals proudly see their loved ones--who 50 \nyears ago would not have had an opportunity--gain self esteem and \nachieve things once not thought possible. With Opportunity Village's \ncontinued strong leadership, business partners, and community support, \nthe next 50 years will bring opportunity and optimism to future \ngenerations of intellectually disabled individuals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/07/senate-section/article/S7747-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CHUCK VEST\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Chuck Vest will soon end his \ndistinguished 14-year tenure as President of the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology. He has been an excellent leader for this \noutstanding institution in our State. He has attracted and retained a \nworld class faculty, including Nobel Prize winners. He has maintained \nan impressive balance between consistency and change to meet the \nchanging needs of the university in the modern high-tech world. And has \ndeveloped the research capacity of the institution far beyond its \nabilities when he took the helm.\n  His commitment to diversity has also been impressive. In 1990, the \nundergraduate student body was 34 percent women and 14 percent \nunderrepresented minorities; today the student body is 42 percent women \nand 20 percent underrepresented minorities--the result of a \nconscientious effort by President Vest and the community he cared so \nmuch about.\n  His leadership was marked by many innovative reforms. He decided to \npublish all course material online, so that it is freely available to \nanyone in the world. He brought the unequal treatment of senior female \nfaculty to the attention of the community and held an open dialogue on \nhow to correct the situation. He offered health benefits to same-sex \npartners. His leadership on financial aid methodologies laid the \ngroundwork for the provisions that are now part of the Higher Education \nAct.\n  Chuck has worked skillfully as well to obtain increased support for \nscientific research--especially in the physical sciences--and he was a \nfamiliar figure in corporate boardrooms and to many of us in Congress. \nHis cooperative work with Lincoln Labs, with Harvard and with the Broad \nFoundation and his commitment to the Cambridge and Boston Public \nSchools are important parts of all he has brought to MIT. When he was \nnamed in February to the President's Commission on the Intelligence \nCapabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass \nDestruction, he said, ``I will concentrate on two priorities, MIT and \nthe Commission.''\n  There is so much to be said about Chuck Vest--his intelligence, his \nappealing personality, his modesty about his own high accomplishments, \nand his tireless pursuit of excellence in everything he does. All of us \nwho know him wish him well in the years ahead, confident that we will \ncontinue to think and act boldly about the role of science and \nscientific education in our changing world and its fundamental \nimportance to the future of our Nation and its best ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/07/senate-section/article/S7747-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:23 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 103.

A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nprovide assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children in \ndeveloping countries; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I join Senators Smith, Chafee and \nFeingold in introducing legislation aimed at helping the 110 million \norphans in the world. This legislation is a companion measure to \nCongresswoman Lee's bill that unanimously passed the House of \nRepresentatives last month.\n  Current estimates suggest that by 2010, there will be more than 25 \nmillion orphans worldwide as the result of the HIV-AIDS pandemic. We \nmust do more to provide hope for these children. This legislation is an \nimportant step forward.\n  Our bill would authorize the President to provide assistance to \norphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. Specific \nauthorization is provided in the areas of basic care, HIV-AIDS \ntreatment, school food programs, protection of inheritance rights, and \neducation and employment training assistance.\n  The legislation also calls on the President to use U.S. foreign \nassistance to support programs that eliminate school fees. Throughout \nthe world, many orphans are prevented from attending school because \nthey cannot afford to pay for school or are forced to financially \nsupport their families or care for sick relatives.\n  Finally, the bill would establish an Office for Orphans and Other \nVulnerable Children within USAID and a monitoring system that will \nensure that U.S. assistance is effective. Right now, there is no office \nor individual within the Agency with responsibility for the overall \noversight or implementation of programs for orphans and vulnerable \nchildren.\n  I look forward to working with Congresswoman Lee and the Chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, in passing legislation \nto address the tragic issue of AIDS orphans throughout the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of this bill signed \nby the Global Action for Children be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Global Action for Children\n\n        Dear Senators Boxer and Chafee: We welcome your leadership \n     on the issue of orphans and vulnerable children. As of 2001, \n     an estimated 100 million children were orphans throughout \n     Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. \n     The AIDS epidemic is rapidly accelerating the orphan crisis \n     and leaving a generation of children without hope. As \n     millions of parents are dying from AIDS, the children they \n     leave behind are often left without any adult to look after \n     their basic needs and survival.\n        Your bill expands the capacity of communities to take care \n     of the basic needs of orphans and dramatically expands \n     educational opportunities for orphans. The bill creates a \n     mechanism to eliminate the school fees that prevent so many \n     orphans from ever going to school. School fees also \n     discourage families from adopting orphans because of the \n     major financial burden posed by such fees.\n        The legislation you are introducing also provides new hope \n     to orphans and vulnerable children living with HIV and AIDS. \n     Each year, 700,000 babies are infected with HIV and most of \n     these children will become orphans. The legislation provides \n     a focus on treatment of these children in order to promote \n     healthy development and normal growth.\n        Your bill also builds in monitoring and evaluation \n     criteria and improved coordination, including a new office of \n     orphans and vulnerable children, to ensure that funds for \n     orphans will be used most effectively. As we ramp up our \n     response to the orphans' crisis, new structures to ensure \n     effective coordination are essential to meeting the needs of \n     these orphans.\n        We welcome the Boxer-Chafee legislation as an essential \n     companion to the comprehensive legislation that has already \n     passed the House of Representatives.\n\n             Global Action for Children--Leadership Council\n\n        AFXB.\n        Center for Health and Gender Equity (CHANGE).\n        Episcopal Church, USA.\n        Global Justice.\n        Keep A Child Alive.\n        Progressive National Baptist Convention.\n        RESULTS.\n        Student Campaign for Child Survival.\n        American Jewish World Service.\n        church World Service.\n        Global AIDS Alliance.\n        Hope for African Children Initiative.\n        Pan-African Children's Fund.\n        Religions Action Center of Reform Judaism.\n        Student Global AIDS Campaign.\n        United Methodist Church, General Board of Church and \n     Society.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 2612. A bill to amend the Law Enforcement Pay Equity Act of 2000 \nto permit certain annuitants of the retirement programs of the United \nStates Park Police and United States Secret Service Uniformed Division \nto receive the adjustments in pension benefits to which such annuitants \nwould otherwise be entitled as a result of the conversion of members of \nthe United States Park Police and United States Secret Service \nUniformed Division to a new salary schedule under the amendments made \nby such Act; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nLaw Enforcement Pay Adjustment Equity Act. This legislation amends the \nLaw Enforcement Pay Equity Act of 2000 to allow retired police officers \nof the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division and the United \nStates Park Police to receive the same Cost of Living Adjustment as \nactive officers.\n  For almost 80 years, Secret Service and Park Police retirees were \nassured an increase in their pensions whenever their active \ncounterparts received an increase by the ``equalization clause'' in the \nDistrict of Columbia Police and Firearms Salary Act of 1958. When the \nLaw Enforcement Pay Equity Act passed in 2000, the automatic link that \nensured retirees of getting the same COLA as active officers was \nsevered. This bill would restore that link, guaranteeing that the \npension for these retired Federal police officers keeps up with the \ncost of living.\n  The Law Enforcement Pay Equity Act created a sharp inequality in \nretirement benefits for a small number of\n\n[[Page S7752]]\n\nretirees--600 Secret Service retirees and 470 Park Police retirees, \nroughly eleven hundred in total. They gave years of loyal service, \noften in difficult and life-threatening situations. They are the only \nFederal retirees who had existing retirement benefits scaled back.\n  Providing for government retirees and their families has always been \nan important function of the Federal Government. There is no reason why \nthe government should go back on its word to provide this small group \nof valuable employees with secure retirement benefits. Restoring the \nCOLA to the pensions of 1,100 Federal retirees will have a minimal \nimpact on the Federal budget, but a major impact on the quality of life \nof the people involved.\n  When it comes to Federal employees, I believe that promises made \nshould be promises kept. These former Secret Service and Park Police \nofficers planned for their retirement with the understanding that their \npension would be enough to live on, even as the cost of living \nincreased. They deserve the retirement benefits they were promised when \nthey signed up for service.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in expressing support for this bill \nto restore promised retirement benefits to retired officers of the \nUnited States Secret Service Uniformed Division and the United States \nPark Police. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2612\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nscholarship and loan repayment program for public health preparedness \nworkforce development to eliminate critical public health preparedness \nworkforce shortages in Federal, State, and local public health \nagencies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with my \ncolleague Senator Hagel, legislation that will help to address the \nsevere workforce shortages within public health agencies throughout the \nUnited States. This bill, known as the Public Health Preparedness \nWorkforce Development Act of 2004, provides financial help to both full \nand part-time students who are interested in pursuing a career in \npublic health at Federal, State and local public health agencies.\n  Our Nation faces myriad public health threats and challenges, ranging \nfrom emerging diseases such as West Nile virus and SARS to the special \nneeds of an aging population, from bio-terrorism to obesity, tobacco \nuse and environmental hazards. The ability of the public health system \nto prevent, respond to, and recover from these challenges depends on \nadequate numbers of well-trained public health professionals in \nFederal, State, and local public health departments.\n  However, our public health system has an aging staff nearing \nretirement and there are not enough students graduating with training \nin public health disciplines to provide a consistent source of skilled \nemployees to fill the void. The average age of the public health \nworkforce is 47, 7 years older than the average age of the Nation's \nworkforce. The ratio of public health workers to overall population has \ndropped from 219/100,000 in 1980 to 158/100,000 in 2000. There are \nalready shortages of public health nurses, epidemiologists, \nenvironmental health workers, health educators and other public health \nprofessionals at Federal, State and local public health agencies. In my \nhome State of Illinois, the Illinois Department of Public Health \nestimates that they are in need of at least 15 epidemiologists and are \nhaving trouble filling those positions.\n  Further evidence suggests that as much as 50 percent of the current \npublic health workforce at the State level will be retiring in the next \n5 years. Losing so many experienced public health workers at a time \nwhen the public health workforce should be expanding to meet increased \nneeds presents a clear argument in favor of encouraging more students \nto enter the many academic fields related to public health such as \nepidemiology, health education, nursing and environmental health.\n  To continue to improve the health of our people, we must have a well-\ntrained and dedicated public health workforce. But developing and \nmaintaining the necessary human capital is already a challenge and \npromises to continue to be a challenge in the future. Our bill would \nhelp alleviate this dangerous shortfall of public health professionals \nby providing scholarships or loan repayments for full and part-time \nstudents in public health and for workers with previous public health \ntraining who agree to serve at the Federal, State and local level.\n  The scholarship program will provide scholarships to eligible \ngraduate, undergraduate and community college students to pursue a \ncourse of study to prepare to serve in the public health workforce.\n  The loan repayment program is designed to help pay for education \nloans incurred by individuals currently employed or about to be \nemployed in a Federal, State or local public health agency.\n  The grants for the loan repayment program to political jurisdictions \nat the State and local level will provide funds to the appropriate \nagencies to operate the loan repayment program.\n  The bill is supported by the Association of State and Territorial \nHealth Officials, the National Association of City and County Health \nOfficials, the American Public Health Association, and the Council of \nState and Territorial Epidemiologists.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to strengthen the \ncapacity of our Nation to respond to public health threats now and in \nthe years to come. The Public Health Preparedness Workforce Development \nAct of 2004 will help provide the public with the educated and well-\ntrained public health workforce to meet the health challenges of the \nfuture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 2614. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the benefits under the medicare program for beneficiaries with \nkidney disease, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the End Stage \nRenal Disease Modernization Act, designed to improve the quality of \ncare and quality of life for the more than 300,000 Americans with end \nstage renal disease (ESRD).\n  To avoid death, patients with ESRD must receive a kidney transplant \nor undergo dialysis. As you know, the shortage of organs makes \ntransplantation a limited option for the vast majority of patients. \nTherefore, most rely upon 3-4 hour dialysis treatments three times a \nweek to save their lives.\n  Congress must honor its commitment to Americans with ESRD by bringing \nthe Medicare ESRD program into the 21st Century. As we recognized in \nother areas of health care, education serves as a valuable tool in the \nfight of any chronic disease. ESRD is no exception. This bill would \nestablish educational programs to teach individuals about the factors \nthat lead to chronic kidney disease, the precursor to kidney failure, \nand how to prevent it, treat it, and avoid kidney failure. It would \nalso support programs for patients once they have kidney failure to \nassist them in developing self-management skills that could \ndramatically improve their quality of life.\n  Another important factor that influences patients' quality of life is \nthe method of dialysis they select. Although most patients must receive \nin-center hemodialysis, some can benefit from home dialysis. In rural \ncommunities, like so many in North Dakota, home dialysis proves an \nimportant option for patients who do not have dialysis facilities near \ntheir homes. In\n\n[[Page S7753]]\n\nthis measure, we would require HHS to determine how to provide \nincentives for home dialysis.\n  The bill also incorporates provisions to provide for an annual update \nmechanism from legislation that my colleague Senator Santorum and I \nintroduced at the beginning of this Congress. As we have discussed many \ntimes in this Chamber, the ESRD Program is the only major Medicare \nreimbursement system that does not have an annual update mechanism to \nadjust the payment rates for changes in input prices and inflation.\n  Since the inception of the Medicare ESRD program, we have made \nenormous strides in extending the lives and the quality of life of \npatients with kidney failure. If we are to continue that course, we \nmust allow the program to keep pace with advances and changes in the \ndelivery of services. We must also ensure that patients receive the \nbest information possible so they can make informed choices and provide \nincentives that promote the highest quality of care. The End Stage \nRenal Disease Modernization Act is a comprehensive bill that moves the \nprogram in that direction. Thus, I urge my colleagues to join with me \nin sponsoring this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 2616. A bill to increase the availability of H-2B nonimmigrant \nvisas during fiscal year 2004 for rural border areas, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I have introduced the Emergency \nRelief for Rural Borderlands Act.\n  This act deals with a problem which is probably well known to many of \nmy colleagues--the insufficient number of H2-B visas available for \ntemporary seasonal employment this year.\n  U.S. laws governing labor-based immigration have always maintained \nthat employers must give priority to American workers. I support this \nphilosophy, as I am sure the rest of my colleagues do as well.\n  I also acknowledge the reality that sometimes there are jobs that, \nfor a variety of reasons, cannot be filled by American workers. This is \na fact of life. We can see it on our farms, in our restaurants, and on \nour construction sites.\n  My legislation deals with one small sub-set of these foreign workers, \ntemporary seasonal laborers under the H2-B visa program. H2-B guest \nworkers may work in the United States for no more than 6 months, at the \nend of which they must return to their countries of origin. They fill \ncritical gaps in the labor market, which in turn helps American \ncompanies to prosper year-round. They work at summer camps and resorts, \nfor fisheries and for landscapers, and in many other non-agricultural \npursuits.\n  My legislation does not propose to fix the H2-B crisis across the \nboard. Some of my colleagues have introduced legislation to this end, \nand I would not presume to improve upon their proposals. My legislation \nrepresents, instead, a commitment to the needs of a unique geographical \nsituation--rural borderlands.\n  In my State of Minnesota, and indeed across the country, rural areas \ncontinue to be challenged economically. It would be safe to say that \nthere is a crisis in rural America today. To address the challenges \nfaced by rural communities, I introduced the Rural Renaissance Act, and \nothers in the Senate have also introduced legislation that is directed \ntowards rural America. What the Rural Renaissance Act would do is help \nrural, small towns develop the infrastructure needed to expand \ncommunities and create jobs. It takes a long-term view of what is \nneeded in rural America. But at the same time, there is another, \ntemporary crisis for those in rural America who can't get the H2-B visa \nlaborers they rely on. This kind of labor shortage is the last thing \nrural America needs.\n  Rural communities located near the border have a special set of \nchallenges, which go beyond even what the rest of rural America is \ndealing with. Companies who are recruiting workers naturally target the \ncities and towns closest to them. But when a company is located near an \ninternational border, the pool of U.S. workers in close proximity is \nsmaller than for companies located more centrally.\n  For example, take Warroad, MN, in Roseau County. Roseau, like many \nrural counties in Minnesota, is dealing with a number of challenges--\nfrom out-migration of younger people leaving behind an aging \npopulation, to economic sluggishness, to inadequate infrastructure and \neven flooding issues. The town of Warroad, population 1,722, is located \nabout 6 miles from the U.S.-Canada border. The largest company in \nWarroad is a first-class window manufacturer, Marvin Windows.\n  Because of its relationship to construction, the window industry has \na seasonal element to it. During the summer, Marvin hires hundreds of \nAmerican college students to work at its factory in Warroad. But when \nthese students go back to school, there are short-term positions which \nneed to be filled through December. For the last 8 years, Marvin \nWindows has relied on Canadian workers to fill these critical \npositions. This year, because of the early date when the cap on H2-B \nvisas was reached, Marvin Windows is looking at a big gap in their \nemployment--which not only could hurt their revenues this year, but \nalso threatens to undercut their long-term reputation as a reliable \nsupplier of windows.\n  I am aware that my colleague Senator Hatch has introduced legislation \nto remedy the H2-B visa shortage. I support this legislation. But as we \nhave seen, there is not yet consensus on it.\n  Companies like Marvin Windows cannot afford to wait much longer. \nThat's why I have proposed the Emergency Relief for Rural Borderlands \nAct. This legislation is admittedly less ambitious than Senator Hatch's \nlegislation, or Senator Kennedy's bill. My legislation would simply \nobserve the unique circumstances facing rural areas--which are \nchallenged economically already--as well as the realities of the labor \npool for companies located near our borders. My legislation would \nrelieve these rural borderlands from the visa cap for this year only. \nMoreover, my legislation would only give relief to those companies who \ncan demonstrate that they have relied on the program in the past, by \nlimiting eligibility to only those companies which have made use of H2-\nB workers in at least 2 of the last 5 years.\n  My legislation is not a permanent fix, nor is it a comprehensive fix. \nI know that there are deserving companies that are not going to be able \nto qualify under my legislation. My legislation is only applicable this \nyear, and I am sure we will need to revisit this issue again next year.\n  But if we in the Congress cannot reach agreement on a comprehensive \nsolution for this visa shortage, perhaps the time has come to look at a \nmore limited approach. Rural America has unique labor requirements, and \nborderlands have challenging recruitment conditions. If we begin by \nlooking at the needs of areas that are both rural and close to the \nborder, we can help the economies that stand to be hurt the most by the \nshortage in H2-B visas this year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2616\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Relief for Rural \n     Borderlands Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The laws of the United States that govern labor-based \n     immigration require employers to give United States workers \n     priority for employment over foreign workers.\n       (2) Many employers have found themselves unable to hire \n     United States citizens for certain positions, particularly \n     for temporary, seasonal employment.\n       (3) Due to the historic availability of H-2B visas, many \n     employers have developed business models based on an \n     assumption that businesses will be able to hire temporary \n     seasonal workers who are aliens.\n       (4) During fiscal year 2004, the date on which no more H-2B \n     visas could be issued because the maximum number of such \n     visas available for such fiscal year had been issued was \n     earlier than the date such maximum number had been reached \n     during any prior fiscal year.\n       (5) As a result of the maximum of H-2B visas being issued \n     prior to the end of fiscal year 2004, many employers face an \n     urgent\n\n[[Page S7754]]\n\n     shortage of workers that threatens to seriously erode the \n     current and future revenues of the employers' businesses.\n       (6) It is particularly difficult for employers located in \n     rural areas to attract workers and such employers have often \n     relied on foreign workers.\n       (7) An employer located near an international border has a \n     smaller radius for recruiting United States workers than an \n     employer located more centrally, which can create \n     difficulties in finding United States workers to fill vacant \n     positions.\n       (8) Large employers located in rural areas are invaluable \n     to the communities in which such employees are located, and a \n     disruption in the business of such employers is devastating \n     for such communities facing challenging economic conditions.\n\n     SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL H-2B VISA ENTRANTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004.\n\n       (a) In General.--During fiscal year 2004, an alien who is \n     issued a visa under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b)) may not be counted toward the numerical \n     limitation set out in section 214(g)(1)(B) of such Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1184(g)(1)(B)) if such alien is providing temporary \n     service or labor in the United States--\n       (1) at a work site that is located--\n       (A) in a rural area; and\n       (B) not more than 50 miles from an international border; \n     and\n       (2) for an employer that has hired aliens who received \n     visas under such section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) during not less \n     than 2 of the fiscal years between fiscal years 1999 and \n     2003.\n       (b) Expedited Visa Processing.--During fiscal year 2004, a \n     petition for a nonimmigrant visa submitted by an alien who \n     intends to provide temporary service or labor that meets the \n     requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) \n     shall be processed not more than 30 days after the date of \n     the submission of such petition.\n\n     SEC. 4. RURAL AREA DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``rural area'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 343(a) of the Consolidated Farm and \n     Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1991(a)).\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Section 3(a) of this Act shall take effect as if enacted on \n     September 30, 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 2617. A bill making supplemental appropriation for the Department \nof Education for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act \nenacted two years ago contains the right set of education reforms for \nAmerica's public schools. It raises academic standards and calls for \nbetter teachers and smaller classes. It supports periodic testing for \nall children, so that teachers can assess learning needs early, before \nmajor problems develop. It also calls for supplemental services and \nafter-school programs for children who are lagging behind academically. \nIt focuses schools on the hardest-to-teach children, and holds schools \naccountable for the performance of all children, whatever their race or \nbackground.\n  These basic principles in the No Child Left Behind Act have broad \nbipartisan support. But as we all know, reforms without the resources \nneeded to implement them cannot succeed. Since the law was enacted in \n2002, the Bush administration has consistently withheld the resources \nneeded to fulfill the basic promises of the Act. The Administration's \nbudget for the coming fiscal year leaves 4.6 million children behind. \nIt underfunds the President's school reform law by over $9.4 billion.\n  Even worse, because of the administration's low priority for \neducation, over 7,500 school districts received notice last week that \ntheir Federal funds under the No Child Left Behind Act will be cut back \nthis fall. As a result, thousands of school districts across the nation \nwon't even be able to maintain their current quality of education, let \nalone improve it. Schools that serve the neediest children will be hurt \nthe most.\n  Every school district in Massachusetts faces a cut in Federal \neducation funding this fall. The city of Lawrence has a 27 percent \npoverty rate, and it faces a $1.2 million cut in school aid. It can't \nafford the loss of 20 teachers. The city of Springfield has a 28 \npercent poverty rate. It faces a cut of $1.4 million, which means that \nover 1,000 needy children won't get the supplemental services they're \ncounting on. We cannot in good conscience allow these cuts to go \nforward.\n  Today, Congressman George Miller in the House of Representatives and \nI are introducing ``The No Child Left Behind Appropriations Support Act \nof 2004'' to provide $237 million in emergency resources needed this \nfall to stop the cuts called for by the Administration in funds for \nschool reform. Over 70 Members of Congress have now joined our letter \nto the Appropriations Committees requesting that emergency funds be \nprovided. With deep and widespread cuts in local education funds, it \nwill be much more difficult to achieve the school reforms that are so \nurgently needed in communities across the country.\n  Clearly, Congress needs to act.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nextend medicare cost-sharing for the medicare part B premium for \nqualifying individuals through September 2005; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Baucus and I are pleased to \nannounce the introduction of legislation to extend cost-sharing \nassistance to qualifying individuals for the Medicare Part B premium \nthrough September 2005. Qualified Individuals are a vulnerable \npopulation with income between 120 percent and 135 percent of the \nfederal poverty level and limited assets. It is estimated the monthly \nMedicare Part B premium will be around $75 in fiscal year 2005. Let me \nput this into real numbers, this extension will provide over $900 \ndollars of annual assistance to Medicare beneficiaries who earn less \nthan $12,600 per year.\n  In the Medicare discount drug card program, Congress has targeted \nthis same population with the transitional assistance program. These \nsame seniors are eligible to receive $600 in assistance on their \nMedicare-approved drug card both this year and next. We need to extend \nthis program, and the President agrees. An extension is part of his \nfiscal year 2005 budget. It does not seem right for us to assist these \nMedicare beneficiaries with some of their health care costs and \nrelinquish our assistance in other areas. This program has been in \nexistence since 1997 and has been extended every year thereafter \nbecause it targets help to low-income Medicare beneficiaries. I urge \nCongress to act on this important legislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague and friend \nChairman Chuck Grassley to introduce The Qualifying Individuals' \nProgram Extension Act. This bill would extend avery important program \nthat provides assistance to low-income Medicare beneficiaries. The so-\ncalled QI-1 program, which will expire at the end of\n\n[[Page S7755]]\n\nthis fiscal year, currently pays Part B premiums for Medicare \nbeneficiaries earning less than $12,570 this year. That's about $1,050 \na month. Medicare Part B premiums are expected to increase to $75 next \nyear. That's a substantial sum for beneficiaries living on a fixed \nincome of $1,000 a month. 7.5 percent of their total income, in fact, \nand that's just for premiums for one part of the Medicare program--they \nmust still pay coinsurance and the deductible for Parts A and B.\n  In enacting the Medicare prescription drug benefit last year, \nCongress acknowledged that seniors with incomes up to 150 percent of \nthe Federal Poverty Line--in 2004, that's about $14,000 a year, or \n$17,000 per couple--need some additional help in paying their drug \nbills. I viewed the low-income drug assistance provisions as one of the \ngreat successes of the prescription drug bill. We should not give with \none hand and take away with another by allowing the QI-1 program to \nexpire--hurting the very same people that we tried to help in the \nMedicare prescription drug bill.\n  The QI-1 bill is a truly bipartisan effort. Democrats, particularly \nmy colleague Senator Bingaman from New Mexico, have long championed the \nQI-1 program. And the Administration's budget for Fiscal Year 2005 \nincludes an extension for QI-1s. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant program and work with me to get it passed as quickly as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Enzi, \n        Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Frist, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Lott, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Miller, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. Talent):\n  S.J.

Res. 41. A joint resolution commemorating the opening of the \nNational Museum of the American Indian; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, it is my pleasure and distinct honor to \nintroduce, on behalf of myself and 31 other Senators, a joint \nresolution commemorating the opening of the National Museum of the \nAmerican Indian.\n  This Museum was many years in the making. It's been 15 years since \nthe bill authorizing the construction of the museum was signed into \nlaw, and that was only the beginning of a long, difficult path.\n  There are many people who deserve praise and gratitude for their \nunstinting efforts in realizing this dream--far too many for me to name \nthem all here. I would, however, like to honor two people in particular \nfor their dedication and perseverance in seeing this task through to \ncompletion: my friend, colleague and vice chairman of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs, Daniel K. Inouye; and, Rick West, director of the \nNational Museum of the American Indian, and my Southern Cheyenne \nbrother.\n  I consider myself fortunate that I was there at the beginning, \nserving in the House of Representatives when the museum was authorized, \nand I will be there on September 21, 2004, when the National Museum of \nthe American Indian first opens its doors to the public.\n  I consider the American people fortunate in that they now possess a \nremarkable resource for learning learning about Indian cultures and \ncivilizations.\n  I also consider American Indians fortunate that, finally, there is a \nnational facility dedicated to and worthy of their cultures. History \nhas not always been kind to Native Americans, neither the events that \noccurred nor the words recorded about them, and the United States has \nnot always accorded honor where honor was due the Indians. The National \nMuseum of the American Indian is an important step in rectifying this \nomission and continuing the reconciliation between a great nation and \nits first peoples.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 41\n\n       Whereas the National Museum of the American Indian Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 808 et seq.) established within the Smithsonian \n     Institution the National Museum of the American Indian, and \n     authorized the construction of a facility to house the \n     National Museum of the American Indian on the National Mall \n     in the District of Columbia;\n       Whereas the National Museum of the American Indian \n     officially opens on September 21, 2004;\n        Whereas the National Museum of the American Indian will be \n     the only national museum devoted exclusively to the history \n     and art of cultures indigenous to the Americas, and will give \n     all Americans the opportunity to learn of the cultural \n     legacy, historic grandeur, and contemporary culture of Native \n     Americans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President. It is with great pleasure that I rise today \nto recognize the Oinkari Basque Dancers for their dedication to the \narts and culture of their great heritage.\n  The Basques have a long, proud history in the State of Idaho, which \nis home to the largest concentrated population of Basques outside of \ntheir native country. The first Basques began arriving in Idaho around \n1890, the same year Idaho achieved statehood. Since then, the Basques \nhave become an integral part of Idaho's unique identity. While citizens \nof Basque decent exist in each of our 50 States, the presence of the \nBasque culture is perhaps most evident in Boise, ID, a hub of Basque \ncultural activities and home to the Basque Center, the Cenarrusa Center \nfor Basque Studies, and the Basque Museum and Culture Center. Boise \nalso hosts the Jaialdi Basque festival, which attracts visitors from \naround the world. One of the most notable activities for young Idaho \nBasques is the preservation of their unique music and dance. The \nOinkari Basque Dancers are an excellent example of this dedication to \ndance, music and education.\n  This group of young Basque Americans was founded over 40 years ago to \npreserve and perform the unique folk dances of their Basque heritage. \nTheir traditional dances have been taught to hundreds of young Basques \nover the years. These dedicated young people have traveled nationally, \nincluding here in our Nation's capital, and internationally to perform \ntheir dances and act as good will ambassadors of the American West. \nTheir travels have included trips to the Basque country where they \nperformed alongside native Basque dancing groups. The Oinkaris also \nperform for local charities, hospitals, nursing homes and centers for \nthe disabled to share their culture and talents with others. They have \nentertained people from the State Fair to the World's Fair and never \nfailed to impress an audience.\n  There are many talented individuals responsible for the Oinkaris' \nmany accomplishments, but I believe there is one who deserves special \nrecognition. The dancers are led by the music of Jim Jausoro, a \nfounding member of the Oinkaris. ``Jimmy'' Jausoro has received \nnumerous cultural honors, including the National Heritage Award from \nNational Endowment for the Arts. Under his tireless leadership, the \nOinkaris have grown and developed into an elite dance group who \nrepresent their ancestry in the true spirit of dance and music.\n  For their dedication to arts, I am pleased to call Idaho the home of \nthe Oinkari Basque Dancers, and pleased to honor them today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 400--RECOGNIZING THE 2004 CONGRESSIONAL AWARDS GOLD \n                            MEDAL RECIPIENTS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Baucus) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States;\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian \n     archipelago that is now part of the United States, are \n     indigenous, native people of the United States;\n       (3) the United States has a special political and legal \n     responsibility to promote the welfare of the native people of \n     the United States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (4) under the treaty making power of the United States, \n     Congress exercised its constitutional authority to confirm \n     treaties between the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii, \n     and from 1826 until 1893, the United States--\n       (A) recognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) accorded full diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii; and\n       (C) entered into treaties and conventions with the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, \n     1849, 1875, and 1887;\n       (5) pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 \n     Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United States set aside \n     approximately 203,500 acres of land to address the conditions \n     of Native Hawaiians in the Federal territory that later \n     became the State of Hawaii;\n       (6) by setting aside 203,500 acres of land for Native \n     Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Hawaiian Homes Commission \n     Act assists the members of the Native Hawaiian community in \n     maintaining distinct native settlements throughout the State \n     of Hawaii;\n       (7) approximately 6,800 Native Hawaiian families reside on \n     the Hawaiian Home Lands and approximately 18,000 Native \n     Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands are on a waiting list to receive assignments of \n     Hawaiian Home Lands;\n       (8)(A) in 1959, as part of the compact with the United \n     States admitting Hawaii into the Union, Congress established \n     a public trust (commonly known as the ``ceded lands trust''), \n     for 5 purposes, 1 of which is the betterment of the \n     conditions of Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) the public trust consists of lands, including submerged \n     lands, natural resources, and the revenues derived from the \n     lands; and\n       (C) the assets of this public trust have never been \n     completely inventoried or segregated;\n       (9) Native Hawaiians have continuously sought access to the \n     ceded lands in order to establish and maintain native \n     settlements and distinct native communities throughout the \n     State;\n       (10) the Hawaiian Home Lands and other ceded lands provide \n     an important foundation for the ability of the Native \n     Hawaiian community to maintain the practice of Native \n     Hawaiian culture, language, and traditions, and for the \n     survival and economic self-sufficiency of the Native Hawaiian \n     people;\n       (11) Native Hawaiians continue to maintain other distinctly \n     native areas in Hawaii;\n       (12) on November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the ``Apology Resolution'') was \n     enacted into law, extending an apology on behalf of the \n     United States to the native people of Hawaii for the United \n     States' role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (13) the Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States and \n     further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never \n     directly relinquished to the United States their claims to \n     their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national \n     lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum;\n       (14) the Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President--\n       (A) to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of \n     the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) to support reconciliation efforts between the United \n     States and Native Hawaiians; and\n       (C) to consult with Native Hawaiians on the reconciliation \n     process as called for in the Apology Resolution;\n       (15) despite the overthrow of the government of the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their \n     separate identity as a distinct native community through \n     cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give \n     expression to their rights as native people to self-\n     determination, self-governance, and economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (16) Native Hawaiians have also given expression to their \n     rights as native people to self-determination, self-\n     governance, and economic self-sufficiency--\n       (A) through the provision of governmental services to \n     Native Hawaiians, including the provision of--\n       (i) health care services;\n       (ii) educational programs;\n       (iii) employment and training programs;\n       (iv) economic development assistance programs;\n       (v) children's services;\n       (vi) conservation programs;\n       (vii) fish and wildlife protection;\n       (viii) agricultural programs;\n       (ix) native language immersion programs;\n       (x) native language immersion schools from kindergarten \n     through high school;\n       (xi) college and master's degree programs in native \n     language immersion instruction;\n       (xii) traditional justice programs, and\n       (B) by continuing their efforts to enhance Native Hawaiian \n     self-determination and local control;\n       (17) Native Hawaiians are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources;\n       (18) the Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future generations of Native Hawaiians their \n     lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural identity in \n     accordance with their traditions, beliefs, customs and \n     practices, language, and social and political institutions, \n     to control and manage their own lands, including ceded lands, \n     and to achieve greater self-determination over their own \n     affairs;\n       (19) this title provides a process within the framework of \n     Federal law for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise their \n     inherent rights as a distinct, indigenous, native community \n     to reorganize a Native Hawaiian governing entity for the \n     purpose of giving expression to their rights as native people \n     to self-determination and self-governance;\n       (20) Congress--\n       (A) has declared that the United States has a special \n     responsibility for the welfare of the native peoples of the \n     United States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) has identified Native Hawaiians as a distinct group of \n     indigenous, native people of the United States within the \n     scope of its authority under the Constitution, and has \n     enacted scores of statutes on their behalf; and\n       (C) has delegated broad authority to the State of Hawaii to \n     administer some of the United States' responsibilities as \n     they relate to the Native Hawaiian people and their lands;\n       (21) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special political and legal relationship with the Native \n     Hawaiian people through the enactment of the Act entitled, \n     ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii \n     into the Union'', approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; \n     73 Stat. 4), by--\n       (A) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held as a public trust for 5 purposes, 1 of which is \n     for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians; and\n       (B) transferring the United States' responsibility for the \n     administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of \n     Hawaii, but retaining the authority to enforce the trust, \n     including the exclusive right of the United States to consent \n     to any actions affecting the lands that comprise the corpus \n     of the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42) that are \n     enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting \n     the beneficiaries under the Act;\n       (22) the United States has continually recognized and \n     reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the aboriginal, indigenous, native people who \n     exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands;\n       (B) Native Hawaiians have never relinquished their claims \n     to sovereignty or their sovereign lands;\n       (C) the United States extends services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their unique status as the indigenous, native \n     people of a once-sovereign nation with whom the United States \n     has a political and legal relationship; and\n       (D) the special trust relationship of American Indians, \n     Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to the United States \n     arises out of their status as aboriginal, indigenous, native \n     people of the United States; and\n       (23) the State of Hawaii supports the reaffirmation of the \n     political and legal relationship between the Native Hawaiian \n     governing entity and the United States as evidenced by 2 \n     unanimous resolutions enacted by the Hawaii State Legislature \n     in the 2000 and 2001 sessions of the Legislature and by the \n     testimony of the Governor of the State of Hawaii before the \n     Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate on February 25, \n     2003.\n\n     SEC. __03.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 599, H.R. 218.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 218) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \n     exempt qualified current and former law enforcement officers \n     from State laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed \n     handguns.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up \nand passing today the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, H.R. 218, \nwhich was passed overwhelmingly by the House last month by voice vote. \nI have waited a long time to see this action taken.\n  I want to pay special thanks to Congressman Randy ``Duke'' \nCunningham, the author of this bill, and my good friend Senator \nCampbell, with whom I cosponsored the Senate companion bill, S. 253, \nfor their leadership and fortitude while negotiating this legislation. \nWithout their perseverance and commitment, passage of this bill would \nnot have happened. In fact, Representative Cunningham has been \ntirelessly working for over a decade to push this legislation, and I \ncommend him for his dedication to making our communities safer and \nproviding better protection for our law enforcement personnel.\n  During his time in the Senate, Senator Campbell has been a leader in \nthe area of law enforcement and brings with him invaluable experience. \nAs a former deputy sheriff, he knows the difficulties and dangers law \nenforcement officers face due to the patchwork of conceal-carry laws in \nState and local jurisdictions. He and I have worked together on several \npieces of law enforcement legislation, such as the Bulletproof Vests \nPartnership Grant Acts of 1998, 2000 and 2003. It has been a privilege \nworking with him on our bipartisan Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act.\n  Law enforcement officers are never ``off-duty.'' They are dedicated \npublic servants trained to uphold the law and keep the peace. To enable \nlaw enforcement officers nationwide to be prepared to answer a call to \nduty no matter where, when or in what form it comes, I am proud to join \nSenator Campbell and 69 other cosponsors, including Judiciary Chairman \nHatch, Democratic Leader Daschle, Assistant Democratic Leader Reid, \nMajority Leader Frist and Assistant Majority Leader McConnell, on the \nSenate version of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, S. 253, \nwhich was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in March 2003 \nby a vote of 18 to 1. Both H.R. 218 and S. 253 will permit off-duty and \nretired law enforcement officers to carry a firearm and be prepared to \nassist in dangerous situations.\n  These bills are strongly supported by the Fraternal Order of Police, \nFOP, the National Association of Police Organizations, NAPO, the \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association, FLEOA, the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, IBPO, the Law Enforcement Alliance of \nAmerica, and the National Law Enforcement Council.\n  I was honored to work closely on this measure with the former FOP \nnational president, Lieutenant Steve Young, whose death last year was a \nsad loss for us all. Steve was dedicated to this legislation because he \nunderstood the importance of having law enforcement officers across the \nNation armed and prepared whenever and wherever threats to our public \nsafety arise. I have continued my close work with the FOP and current \nnational president, Major Chuck Canterbury, to make this legislation \nlaw.\n  Community policing and the outstanding work of so many law \nenforcement officers play a vital role in our crime control efforts. \nUnfortunately, during the past few years the downward trend in violent \ncrime--specifically murder--ended and violent crime rates have turned \nupward. The FBI has reported that while preliminary numbers show that \nviolent crime overall declined slightly in the first half of 2003, \nmurders increased by 1.3 percent compared with the year before.\n\n[[Page S7773]]\n\n  There are more than 740,000 sworn law enforcement officers currently \nserving in the United States. Since the first recorded police death in \n1792, there have been more than 17,200 law enforcement officers killed \nin the line of duty. Over 1,700 law enforcement officers died in the \nline of duty over the last decade, an average of 170 deaths per year. \nRoughly 5 percent of officers who die are killed while taking law \nenforcement action in an off-duty capacity. On average, more than \n62,000 law enforcement officers are assaulted annually.\n  The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act creates a mechanism by which \nqualified active-duty law enforcement officers would be permitted to \ntravel interstate with a firearm, subject to certain limitations, \nprovided that officers are carrying their official badges and \nphotographic identification. An active-duty officer may carry a \nconcealed firearm under this measure if he or she is authorized to \nengage in or supervise any violation of law; is authorized to use a \nfirearm by the agency, meets agency standards to regularly use a \nfirearm; and is not prohibited from carrying by Federal, State or local \nlaw. This measure would not interfere with any officer's right to carry \na concealed firearm on private or government property while on duty or \non official business.\n  Off-duty and retired officers should also be permitted to carry their \nfirearms across State and other jurisdictional lines, at no cost to \ntaxpayers, in order to better serve and protect our communities. H.R. \n218 would permit qualified law enforcement officers and qualified \nretired law enforcement officers across the nation to carry concealed \nfirearms in most situations. It preserves any State law that restricts \nconcealed firearms on private property and any State law that restricts \nthe possession of a firearm on State or local government property.\n  To qualify for the measure's exemptions to permit a qualified off-\nduty law enforcement officer to carry a concealed firearm, \nnotwithstanding the law of the State or political subdivision of the \nState, he or she must have authority to use a firearm by the law \nenforcement agency where he or she works; not be subject to any \ndisciplinary action; satisfy every standard of the agency to regularly \nuse a firearm; not be prohibited by Federal law from receiving a \nfirearm; and carry a photo identification issued by the agency. The \nbill preserves any State law that restricts concealed firearms on \nprivate property, and any State law that restricts the possession of a \nfirearm on State or local government property or park.\n  For a retired law enforcement officer to qualify for exemption from \nState laws that prohibit the carrying of concealed firearms, he or she \nmust have retired in good standing; have been qualified by the agency \nto carry or use a firearm; have been employed at least fifteen years as \na law enforcement officer unless forced to retire due to a service-\nconnected disability; have a non-forfeitable right to retirement plan \nbenefits of the law enforcement agency; meet the same State firearms \ntraining and qualifications as an active officer; not be prohibited by \nFederal law from receiving a firearm; and be carrying a photo \nidentification issued by the agency. Preserved would be any State law \nthat permits restrictions of concealed firearms on private property, as \nwell as any State law that restricts the possession of a firearm on \nState or local government property or park.\n  Last month, during the House Judiciary Committee markup of H.R. 218, \namendments were accepted to bar officers or retired police from \ncarrying arms in other jurisdictions if they are under the influence of \nalcohol or other intoxicating or hallucinatory drug or substance, and \nto require retired police to have proof they received arms training in \nthe previous year before being permitted to carry concealed weapons. \nThe bill was then reported out of Committee by a vote of 23 to 9 and \npassed overwhelmingly by the House.\n  Convicted criminals often have long and exacting memories. A law \nenforcement officer is a target in uniform and out, active or retired, \non duty or off duty. The bipartisan Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act \nis designed to establish national measures of uniformity and \nconsistency to permit trained and certified on duty, off duty or \nretired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms in most \nsituations so that they may respond immediately to crimes across State \nand other jurisdictional lines, as well as to protect themselves and \ntheir families from vindictive criminals.\n  I urge the Senate to take up and pass the bipartisan, commonsense Law \nEnforcement Officers Safety Act, H.R. 218, as amended and passed by the \nHouse, to make our communities safer and better to protect law \nenforcement officers and their families.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H. R. 218) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/07/senate-section/article/S7773-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 8, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
