Mr. President, my colleagues may be wondering what \nhappened on the Internet tax moratorium bill. I wish to make a couple \nof comments. There was significant disagreement over a variety of \nissues on both sides of the aisle concerning various provisions of S. \n150, the Internet tax moratorium bill. It is now narrowed down to one \nfinal difference--the rest are negotiable or have been negotiated--and \nthat is the definition of ``Internet access.'' It sounds pretty \ntechnical and a bit arcane, but it is really the vital aspect of this \nissue.\n  I think both opponents and supporters of the Internet tax moratorium \nwill agree to some kind of moratorium, but the question of the \ndefinition of Internet access, particularly as it has been affected by \nthe development of new technologies that now apply to the Internet, has \ncomplicated the issue. Intense negotiations are going on, on both \nsides. I think there is a recognition on both sides that we need to act \non the issue of the Internet tax moratorium. I will be actively engaged \nin those negotiations, and I hope that absolutely before we leave for \nthe Christmas break, we will have this issue resolved and voted on by \nthe Senate.\n  I thank my friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona, the \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, for his tireless efforts to get \nthis important piece of legislation through the Senate. I wish him \nwell. We really must achieve something in that area before we leave for \nthis year.\n  Mr. President, I am going to ask for a few moments to address the \nSenate as in morning business. I don't know whether the Senator from \nNevada would like to make a couple of observations prior to that time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, simply when the Senator completes his \nstatement, I am going to manage the bill for a while until Senator \nHollings arrives. I wanted to let everybody know that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/10/senate-section/article/S14286-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, when the Constitution was written, \nThomas Jefferson was away in France. He wrote George Washington asking \nhim to explain the function of the Senate. Jefferson understood the \nrole of the House to be a place of great passion and quick reaction, \nbut he wasn't quite sure what this Senate was going to be like. So \nWashington used a Southern analogy of drinking tea, where folks in \nthose days would pour the hot tea down into the saucer, let it cool, \nand then pour it back into the cup.\n  Washington suggested that the Senate was the cooling saucer--a place \nwhere things cooled off--of this new Federal Government they were \ncreating, where the heated passions that might bubble over could cool \ndown. That is the way the Senate has worked for over 200 years. I \nsuggest it is unworthy of the Senate when those in it, Members of the \nSenate, fail to heed to the role of this body, which is to provide \ncool, reasoned, and less passionate judgment as we do the people's \nbusiness.\n  Recently, we have heard the venting of frustration by leaders on the \nminority side. Callow, petulant characterizations have been directed at \nour leader, such as ``amateur.'' Someone on the Senate floor referred \nto the Republican leader last week as ``amateur'' and used the term \n``mismanagement.''\n  Well, Mr. President, in addition to that being quite unsenatorial, \nlet us recall that this leader is laboring under a one-vote margin, \njust as the last leader had to endure. Given that same burden, it might \nbe appropriate and timely to compare the hard facts.\n  Those hard facts deal with the passage of bills through the Senate. \nWith the same one-vote majority, Senator Frist has pushed 10 \nappropriations bills across the Senate floor while last year's \nleadership delivered only 3. That is over three times as many \nappropriations bills through the Senate in this year compared to last \nyear.\n  Now, the 11th bill has been the subject of a filibuster, and the \nremaining 2 should be dealt with this week. Again, last year, three \nappropriations bills moved through the Senate--the worst record in at \nleast two decades.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. Last year only three \nappropriations bills made it through the Senate, the worst record in at \nleast two decades.\n  Let's look at bills signed into law. With the same one-vote majority \nas the other side had last year, Senator Frist has delivered six \nappropriations bills into law. Last year only two were delivered.\n  Using the terms employed by the Democratic leadership, delivering \njust two appropriations bills into law is the worst Senate management \nrecord in 16 years. Let me repeat, Mr. President. Delivering just two \nbills into law, which is what happened last year, is the worst Senate \nmanagement record in 16 years.\n  This year and last year, with the same one-vote majority, Senator \nFrist has just done his job in funding the Government for this year. He \ndid the job of last year's leadership by passing last year's funding \nbills back in January. What is amateur, to use the Democratic \nleadership's terminology, is not doing your job and blaming someone \nelse. That is what is amateur, not doing your job and blaming someone \nelse.\n  With a one-vote margin, this leader passed a budget, a jobs package, \na prescription drug benefit for seniors, a global AIDS bill with record \nfunding, established the Department of Homeland Security, and is \ncompleting the appropriations bills. That is the record of this leader, \nSenator Frist.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator mentioned the budget. As I \nrecall, no budget was passed under the prior leadership in the prior \nyear for the first time in--I don't know how long. Isn't it appropriate \nto pass a budget of the Government, and didn't the Republican leader \npass that budget with a one-vote majority where it was not passed in \nthe prior Congress?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from New Hampshire is entirely correct. \nLast year is the first year since the Budget Act was passed when the \nSenate didn't pass a budget. Last year, the leadership--I was about to \nget into that--didn't pass a budget and failed to enact all but two of \nthe appropriations bills. They had plenty of time and energy to \ncomplain about jobs, and they did nothing about them.\n  The results are very different this year. We passed a jobs program, \nand today more Americans are at work than any time in U.S. history, a \nrecord 138 million jobs. This new leadership stands in sharp contrast \nto the past leadership.\n  Last year, the old leadership stalled desperately needed legislation \non homeland security. For months, they could not decide whether to \nreduce or increase the President's power to fight terrorism. It took an \nelection to break that deadlock. To use the Democratic leadership's \nwords, it took the American people to say that amateur hour was over, \nand that is what the American people said a year ago.\n  These are the facts of leadership. When the margin of the majority is \nthe same but the record of accomplishment is so different, the answer \ncan only be leadership. A one-vote majority this year versus a one-vote \nmajority last\n\n[[Page S14287]]\n\nyear, and I would argue the big difference is the leadership of Senator \nBill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader.\n  I don't believe these types of attacks help in any way to advance the \nimportant business of the American people, the business they, in fact, \nelected us to do. The people want results, not name calling. We need to \nfocus on the job, stop hurling epithets, stop the blame game, and \ninstead complete the work the American people sent us here to do.\n  We all know that the last 2 weeks of this session are going to have \nample opportunity for tension and disagreement. We have probably been \ntogether about as long as we ought to be this year, but the job is \ngoing to be finished by November 21, and it would be a lot easier if we \ncould keep our rhetoric in check and not say things in the passion of \nthe moment that we subsequently regret.\n  Much work remains to be done. We intend to accomplish the major tasks \nremaining for this year prior to Thanksgiving, and we are well on our \nway to doing that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/10/senate-section/article/S14287-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14287-S14334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2799, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2799) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, \n     and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a most important bill. I understand \nhow important it is. I also understand it is normal procedure to have \nthe chairman of the subcommittee speak first and the ranking member \nspeak second. But I feel it is appropriate, in talking about this bill, \nto respond very briefly to my friend from Kentucky.\n  It is obvious to anyone who understands Senate procedure why things \ndid not go well last year. It is because the minority stopped us from \ndoing our work. We worked very hard to allow these pieces of \nlegislation to pass. We have been partners with them. The Senator from \nKentucky can talk all he wants about leadership, but everyone knows \nthat the situation where we now have, toward the last few days of this \nCongress, a time set aside--30 hours--to talk about judges, and the \ncomments in that regard upstairs by Senator Daschle and by me indicated \nthat was something we thought was amateurish.\n  Mr. President, one of the chief aims of the Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill is to articulate the priorities of the United \nStates on matters related to business and the economy.\n  This legislation contains funding for the Small Business \nAdministration, U.S. Trade Representative, the National Trade \nAdministration, the Bureau of Industry, the Economic Development \nAgency, the Minority Development Business Agency, and a lot more.\n  I think everyone today should understand we are not going to have any \nvotes for a while. Maybe by 6 o'clock, if people still want to vote \nthey can vote, but I am going to be talking until 6 o'clock today and, \nif necessary, talk longer than that.\n  I, of course, understand the rules relating to the Senate. I \nunderstand there is a rule that for the first 3 hours, a Senator has to \nbe talking about issues relating to this bill. I can certainly do that. \nBut I say to my friend--and I have the deepest respect and regard for \nthe chairman of this subcommittee, a former Governor of New Hampshire, \na former Member of the House of Representatives, and now a Senator--\nthat I am going to be talking for a while. If he wants to hang around \nand listen to me, he can do that. But this has certainly nothing to do \nwith my friend from New Hampshire. It has everything to do with the way \nthat I, speaking for myself, believe the Senate is being run.\n  I think it is inappropriate that we are not going to be able to work \nthrough this week; that we are going to take 2 days to talk about \njudges. I don't know the exact count anymore but I think it is about \n168, 169 to 4, but yet we are going to take valuable time to deliver a \nmessage--I have been told the reason it is being done is to deliver a \nmessage to the base. I don't know what that means, except it is being \ndone for reasons that I don't think are appropriate for the Senate.\n  The legislation that is now before the Senate is important. These \nentities that I have talked about serve one key mission, and that is to \npromote the development of American business and the American economy. \nAs we think about how these agencies should carry out this important \nmission, it is appropriate to spend some time reviewing where the \neconomy stands.\n  Certainly, one of the most important indicators of how the economy is \nfaring is the unemployment rate. On Friday morning, the Department of \nLabor issued its report on the October 2003 unemployment figures. The \nunemployment rate was essentially unchanged, from 6.1 percent last \nmonth to 6 percent this month. We heard a lot about the fact that the \neconomy grew by 126,000 new jobs in October. Sounds like a lot of jobs, \nuntil we understand it is catchup time and the 126,000 does not even \nkeep up with the current population growth in the United States.\n\n  The administration lost no time putting out a series of press \nreleases that said: Stronger growth; 126,000 new jobs in October show \nPresident's jobs and growth plan is working, but there is still more to \ndo.\n  This bill, S. 1585, making appropriations for the Department of \nCommerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and related agencies for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2004, is important legislation. One \nreason it is important is to talk about how--\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. No. I will in half an hour or so.\n  Mr. GREGG. My question was going to be as to how much time the \nSenator is going to take?\n  Mr. REID. When the Senator was off the floor--and I will repeat--I \nindicated my great respect and admiration for someone with a record of \naccomplishment that certainly is significant--Governor, Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, Senator, and I indicated publicly, and I will \nsay again, my speaking today for an extended period of time has nothing \nto do with my regard for the Senator from New Hampshire. I am going to \ntalk for probably 4 or 5 hours today.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question? That is not a \nproblem for myself. I would just like to know the approximate time.\n  Mr. REID. I have answered the Senator's questions, and I would \nappreciate it if he would not interrupt.\n  I do not think the President's plan is working for 9 million \nAmericans who are unemployed. I do not think it is working for 2 \nmillion of those people who have been out of work for longer than 6 \nmonths. Gaining 126,000 new jobs is certainly better than losing an \naverage of 85,000 jobs a month, which is what the country did for the \nentire first half of the year, but it does not mean their plan is \nworking, and it does not mean it is getting easier to find a job.\n  In fact, it is not. October job growth does not even keep up with the \npopulation growth. October is the best month we have had in a long time \nin terms of job growth. Even October's job creation does not keep up \nwith the population growth. So that means for the average person who \nwants a job, it is getting more difficult to land a position, not less \ndifficult. Let me say why.\n  The number of young people entering the workforce is greater than the \nnumber of people retiring out of the workforce. The population of \npeople who want to work rises every month, so there must be some level \nof increase in the number of jobs every month just to keep pace with \nthis growth. Put another way, between the beginning of the Bush \nrecession in March 2001 and last month, the U.S. working age population \nincreased by almost 8 million people. Since March 2001, the U.S. \nworking-age population has grown by 3.4 percent. Because of this influx \nof working-age people, it is not enough just to keep employment level; \nwe need to be adding jobs every month just to keep our heads above \nwater. Most\n\n[[Page S14288]]\n\neconomists say we need to create about 150,000 new jobs every month \njust to hold steady with population growth. That is 150,000 just to \nremain static. October numbers do not get us that far.\n\n  One of the chief aims of the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations \nbill is to articulate the priorities of the U.S. Congress and the \nAmerican people in matters related to business and the economy.\n  My distinguished friend, the majority whip, indicated the great \naccomplishments of the Senate this year, and I think we have had some, \nbut we have been complicit. We have been partners in passing that \nlegislation. Just so everyone understands that compromise is important \nin the Senate, not in the House of Representatives. In the House of \nRepresentatives, the majority party can run right over the minority \nparty, but in the Senate it cannot be done.\n  Senator Daschle and I agreed the week before last and last week that \nwe would work today and tomorrow, full-time, even though tomorrow is a \nlegal holiday, and then out of the blue we learned there is going to be \n30 hours spent on judges all Wednesday night and all day Thursday until \n12 midnight Thursday night. This is a one-man show to indicate that the \nSenate cannot necessarily be run unless we work together. So there can \nbe votes, but they will be tonight sometime. They are not going to be \nearly this afternoon, as the majority has indicated to some of its \nMembers.\n  The Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill is an important bill. \nAs I indicated, we need 150,000 new jobs every month just to remain \nstatic. October numbers do not get us even that far. That is why this \nbill is so important.\n  The Departments of Commerce, State, and Justice have wide-ranging \njurisdiction, and the 126,000 jobs that the economy generated in \nOctober will not even absorb the new entrants into the labor market \nlast month. Given how bad things are, and that seems to be a pretty \nmodest goal, keeping up with population growth, should we not please \ntry to keep up with job growth? We cannot even grow enough jobs to make \nthat happen, let alone make up for 3 million private sector jobs that \nwe lost since the recession began.\n  How many jobs should have been created by now? The difference between \nthe number of jobs--and I will get some charts in a minute when the \nfloor staff brings them to me. They will show in very significant \ndetail the difference between the number of jobs we actually had in \nOctober and the number of jobs we have had if we had merely kept up \nwith the population growth since the beginning of the recession is over \n7 million.\n  Not only did we lose 2.6 million jobs, but we also never created the \n4.5 million jobs necessary to keep pace with the population growth. So \nwe are over 7 million jobs in the hole since the beginning of the Bush \nrecession, and the White House declares that their plan is working. If \nit is working, we are in deep trouble.\n  October job growth is less than the President promised in February. \nThe administration continues to make promises it cannot keep when it \ncomes to job creation. In February, when the President was trying to \nwin votes for his latest tax cut, the White House predicted that his \nso-called jobs and growth plan would create an additional 1.4 million \njobs. That was 1.4 million jobs over and above the 4.1 million jobs \nthat it was projected would be created even if no new taxes were \npassed. So we are supposed to get a total of 5.5 million jobs before \nthe end of the next year. So this bill we are talking about that helps \ncreate job growth is something that has to be looked at very closely. \nThis bill making appropriations for the Department of Commerce provided \nfor funding for responding to the threat of terrorism. That has had a \ntremendous negative impact on job creation, but the President has not \nresponded appropriately, and we will talk about this later, as well as \nthe unfunded mandates that he has passed on to the States.\n\n  This bill deals with drug enforcement, judicial process, conducting \ncommerce within the United States--and I want to make sure the \nParliamentarian hears that, conducting commerce within the United \nStates. It would seem to me that a discussion about jobs would \ncertainly deal with commerce within the United States. In February, the \nPresident was trying to obviously win votes for his latest tax plan, \nwhich was a tax cut, and predicted at that time that his so-called jobs \nand growth plan would create an additional 1.4 million jobs. He said \nit. I did not. That was 1.4 million jobs over and above the 4.1 million \njobs that were projected would be created even if there were no new tax \ncuts.\n  We were supposed to get a total of 5.5 million jobs before the end of \nnext year. That is a job creation pace of over 300,000 a month. That \nwould represent some strong growth. I think that would be tremendous. \nIf the U.S. economy was adding jobs at that rate over a long period of \ntime, we would be in much better shape.\n  In fact, if the economy added 300,000 jobs per month starting today, \nby next summer we would be approaching the levels we were at when \nPresident Clinton was in office, before the Bush recession began. But \nof course we have not approached that level of growth in any month \nsince the plan was adopted. We have not even come close.\n  As I said before, most months we have slid further and further into \nthe hole. Mr. President, 126,000 jobs is better than no jobs, and that \nis what we have had in the past; it is better than negative jobs, but \nit is not good enough.\n  The failure of this administration's latest plan should come as no \nsurprise. We all remember the White House promising that the 2001 tax \ncut would create 800,000 new jobs by the end of last year. It didn't \nwork. Instead of creating the 800,000 new jobs, we lost 1.2 million \njobs. That is a net change of 3.2 million jobs. October job growth was \nless than the Secretary promised. Last month, John Snow, Secretary of \nthe Treasury, told the New York Times he thought the economy would \ncreate about 200,000 new jobs per month.\n  I think the reason he said that was there were signs that even the \nRepublicans were beginning to realize the plan was not a success. That \nis 100,000 fewer jobs than Snow promised, than he had even predicted a \nfew months before when they were trying to get the plan passed.\n  Revising their estimates down by a third is a pretty surprising \nadmission that they know their policy isn't working. Then they failed \nto even meet their lowered expectations.\n  On Friday, the White House issued a statement saying:\n\n       The President's jobs and growth agenda is working. The \n     economy created 126,000 jobs in October. Employment has now \n     grown 3 months in a row for a total jobs gain of over a \n     quarter of a million. The President's jobs and growth \n     agenda is working.\n\n  That is what the administration says. That is not the reality. The \nadministration promised us this plan would create 918,000 jobs over the \npast 3 months. Then the Treasury Secretary assured us it would create \n600,000 in just 3 months.\n  This bill that talks about conducting commerce within the United \nStates--jobs is commerce. I think it is very important we realize this \nlegislation is dealing with commerce. Jobs is commerce. I think it is \nvery important we spend some time talking about jobs.\n  The administration's Treasury Secretary assured us it would create \n600,000 jobs in 3 months when we just heard previously it would be over \n900,000 jobs. Now the administration is claiming its plan is working \nbecause it created over 250,000 jobs. Again, the math doesn't add up. \nWe need 300,000 jobs just to keep up with the normal population growth. \nIn fact, that is not keeping up with the pace the administration said \nthe economy would achieve without the tax cut.\n  If this is a plan that is working, then it is sure not the same plan \nthe administration told to Congress 6 months ago. That sounds like a \nplan the Enron accountants were involved in.\n  Let's not forget this was not an inexpensive proposal. We spent $350 \nbillion on this scheme. Is the $350 billion plan a success? No, not \nbecause it created 250,000 jobs. It is a failure. They acknowledge, \nthemselves, that without the tax cut, more jobs than that would be \ncreated. If my math is right, that works out to be $1.4 million per \njob.\n  We are here talking about the Commerce-State-Justice bill. It is an \nimportant piece of legislation. One of the\n\n[[Page S14289]]\n\nthings this bill talks about in some detail is security and cooperation \nin Europe. It talks about judges, it talks about general \nadministration, asset forfeiture, Office of Justice Programs. It talks \nabout the National Institute of Standards and Technology. There are \nother matters, of course, that take up a significant amount of space in \nthis dealing with Alaskan fisheries. It deals with noncredit business \nassistance. It is an important piece of legislation dealing with an \nautomated biometric identification system. It deals with a joint \nautomated booking system. It deals with detention trustees, \nadministration reviews, counterterrorism fund, Office of Inspector \nGeneral. It deals with the U.S. Parole Commission, Antitrust Division, \nNational Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, salaries and expenses of the \nU.S. attorneys, U.S. Marshals Service, Foreign Claims Settlement \nCommission. It deals with courthouse security equipment all over the \nUnited States. It deals with the U.S. military construction programs \nall over the country, Marshals Service programs all over the country, \ninteragency law enforcement, interagency crime and drug enforcement. It \ndeals with programs with the FBI.\n  There are many programs there that we will come back and talk about \nlater dealing with the FBI, including a polygraph program. They \npolygraph themselves, but of course it has been declared it doesn't \nwork very well for others. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, \nand Explosives; activation of new prison facilities in Hazelton, WV; \nCanaan, PA; Terre Haute, IN; Victorville, CA; Forrest City, \nAR; Herlong/Sierra, CA; Williamsburg, SC; Bennettsville, SC. There is a \ntotal of almost 10,000 beds for a prison facility.\n\n  So there is certainly a lot of meat in this bill, items to talk about \nother than the job loss that has been created in this country.\n  There are other things we could do to create jobs in this country. \nThe President has talked about tax cuts. It has resulted in a few jobs, \nbut in reality this President is headed for the worst record of job \ngrowth in more than 50 years. This goes back to the days probably of \nHerbert Hoover. All other Presidents created jobs. There was net job \ngrowth even in the 2 Eisenhower years--one term of his Presidency lost \njobs overall, the other gained jobs.\n  In no other time have we had a President who has lost jobs--as you \ncan see here, lots and lots of jobs. It is now over 3 million. Every \nother President has created jobs.\n  If things continue--and it appears they will--this will be ``George \nW. Hoover Bush's Presidency,'' creating no jobs, losing jobs. When they \nissue a press release saying, ``Boy, we are doing well; we created \n126,000 jobs,'' understand that doesn't keep up with the 300,000 \nnecessary to keep up with the population growth.\n  What are some of the other things we can do? Prior to September 11, I \nhad a plan that was accepted by cities, counties, and States all over \nAmerica. The National Council of Mayors met here in Washington and \npassed a resolution approving my suggested legislation. It would be a \njobs program for sure. It would be the Federal Government spending \nmoney to create jobs in infrastructure development: highways, bridges, \nwater systems, sewer plants. These are things that are in such \ndesperate need of repair, renovation, and construction.\n  All over America there are blueprints stacked up gathering dust. They \nare ready to be effectuated, but there is no money. Why is this \nimportant? It is important that we do this to effect commerce in this \ncountry because for every $1 billion we spent, we would create 47,000 \nhigh-paying jobs. Those are direct jobs. And the spinoff from those \njobs would certainly be more. People who work at those infrastructure \ndevelopment jobs would need more fuel for their cars, they would need \nmore cars, they would need refrigerators, carpets, clothing--on and on. \nAnd every one of those products they buy, someone has to produce them, \nand it would create jobs in America.\n  The spinoff would be very significant.\n  That is how this administration should create jobs, but it has shown \nlittle interest in investing in our country.\n  This year's Transportation bill is one of the largest bills we have. \nUp until now--hopefully, they will join with us in producing a highway \nbill--we have fought for months to get a high enough number so we could \nhave a highway bill. We hope to be able to mark something up on that \nmaybe even this Wednesday if the judges issue doesn't get in the way of \nthat.\n  But the highway bill, home building, highway construction--those are \njobs that are created. I remember when I first came to Washington how \nimportant those two areas of commerce were--building houses and \nbuilding roads.\n  We need to move beyond that and do something about the bridges. A \nsignificant number of bridges we have are in a state of disrepair. They \nwon't allow school buses to drive over some of them because they are in \nsuch bad shape.\n  We know how important it is to do something about our water systems \nthroughout the country. Sewer systems--we could have been much further \ndown that line today and looking at significant job creation if the \nadministration had focused on measures which we know work rather than \nsquandering the surplus on tax cuts for the wealthy--for the elite. \nThere is nothing wrong with being wealthy--for the elite.\n  The administration's $350 billion tax was supposed to be a jobs and \ngrowth act. Where are the jobs? If we spent $10 billion for needed road \nconstruction, for sewer systems which need to be repaired, and for \nwater systems which are in need of renovation and repair in Colorado \nand Nevada, and the other 48 States, we would be creating thousands of \njobs. If we spent $10 billion directly, we would create 470,000 jobs. \nOf course, $20 billion would create 920,000 jobs. The spinoff from \nthose would be so absolutely, unbelievably powerful for this economy. \nBut we are not doing that.\n  The jobs I am talking about can't be shipped overseas. If you are \ngoing to build a road, it will be built here in America. If you fix a \nsewer plant, it will be done here in America. If you repair a water \nsystem, it will be done here in America. If you fix a bridge, it will \nbe an American bridge. You can't ship those overseas to the lowest \nbidder.\n  Where have all the jobs gone? What has happened to the jobs? They are \ngoing to different places. I have a few charts, and we have a lot of \ntime today. We will spend a little time talking about that.\n  Goodyear Tire lost 1,100 jobs; Levi Strauss, San Antonio, TX, lost \n800 jobs just this past month; Sumco in the State of Oregon, 190 jobs \njust last month; John Harland, Decatur, GA, 3,500 jobs last month; \nJohnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, almost 100 jobs in September of \nthis year; DSM Pharma, Greenville, NC, 2,000 jobs in October--a month \nago; TRW, Greenville, NC, 229 jobs, September 2003; Bluebird--you have \nseen Bluebird, the big, beautiful buses which I am told are the \nCadillac of recreational vehicles--Fort Valley, GA, 400 jobs lost just \nlast month; Dan River, Fort Valley, GA, 447 jobs last month; YKK, \nMacon, GA, 36 jobs the month before last; Timken, Torrington, CT, \nalmost 200 jobs last month; Spring Industries, Lancaster, SC, 330 jobs \nthe month before last; and, Bronx, NY, 100 jobs this month. Bronx, NY, \nis where the company that makes Everlast equipment is located. Boxers \nhave Everlast on all of their boxing equipment, such as Everlast boxing \ngloves. They do not have many jobs left in Bronx, NY, anymore. They are \nchecking out. They lost 100 jobs.\n\n  Brylane, Indianapolis, IN, 415 jobs; Olin Brass, Indianapolis, IN, \n310 jobs gone; Inland Paperboard, 287; General Electric, Schenectady, \nNY, 400 jobs last month; Tysons, Hope, AR, birthplace of President \nClinton, lost 500 jobs--I can imagine how significant that was in that \nlittle community--just the month before last; Kelly Springfield, Tyler, \nTX, lost 200 jobs in October of 2003; Bristol Compressors, Bristol, VA, \n300 jobs; Internet, Radford, VA, 348 jobs the month before last; and \nAlcoa, Bellingham, WA, 200 jobs.\n  Throughout the afternoon we will refer to some of these. You can kind \nof get the picture of why jobs are leaving.\n  I am worried about my constituents. I am confident that every Member \nof this Senate is worried.\n  What am I supposed to tell the people in Nevada who are unemployed? \nShould I tell them that the $350 billion which was used to help mostly \nthe wealthy is going to help put them back to work\n\n[[Page S14290]]\n\nwhen we have waited this long for two huge tax cuts to create new jobs? \nIt only lost jobs. I voted against the plan because I didn't think it \nwould create jobs. But once it passed, it was the only game in town. I \nhoped it would succeed, but it hasn't.\n  I am not in favor of higher taxes, not at all. I wish taxes were much \nlower. But we have to be realistic. We have to see that people are \nhappier with jobs--not tax cuts for the elite of this country. I want \nto see my unemployed constituents have the opportunity to go back to \nwork. Too many of them are still anxious and hurting and waiting. They \nhave waited for a long time. It really tears at your heartstrings.\n  I don't see all of the letters. I wish I could. But I see a lot of \nthem. I don't see all of the letters and the e-mails pouring in these \ndays. But my staff picks out those that are representative of a large \ngroup of letters.\n  I have been hearing from large groups of people in Nevada who have \nnever been unemployed in their whole lives. They have never been \nunemployed. These aren't people who are holding out for cushy, high-\npaying jobs. They are proud people with a strong work ethic who are \nwilling to do whatever amount of hard work it takes to keep a roof over \ntheir heads and food on their tables, people who never thought they \nwould be in this position. They are still having no luck finding work.\n  I received a letter a few weeks ago from a woman who lives in Spring \nCreek, NV. Spring Creek is a place in northeastern Nevada. It is a \ncommunity that has grown up over the past 25 years. It is a beautiful \ncommunity. She said she wrote to me and she wrote to the President and \nto Congressman Gibbons who is the Member of Congress who represents \nthat part of the State of Nevada. She said:\n\n       I really do not expect any of you will actually read this \n     letter. It will probably go to an aide, and if I am lucky I \n     may get a response. But why am I writing this letter?\n\n  She answers her own question:\n\n       Because there are many other people in this country who are \n     unemployed and have run out of unemployment benefits. Many \n     people like me feel that writing a letter like this is a \n     waste of time. Many have no hope but I believe that one \n     person's voice can make a difference. I live in a \nsmall community in northern Nevada. There are at least 50 people \napplying for every job opening. We have thought about moving to other \ncities but the job market is tight everywhere. My husband is disabled \nand receives a small Social Security check every month, but it pays all \nbut $15 for our first mortgage on our house. I have to supply the money \nto pay a second mortgage and all of our living expenses. The company \nthat I was working for updated their computer system to make it easier \nto purchase items over the Internet web site. As a result, they laid \noff some people, including me. Since then I have sent out hundreds of \nresumes with little response. I am not writing this letter to get a \nhandout or for sympathy. I have faith in God that he has a perfect job \nfor me that he will provide for us. There are many thousands of people \nwho do not have hope. They have been laid off multiple times and are \neligible for little or no unemployment benefits. I have friends that \nwere laid off over a year ago and are still trying to find work. \nUnemployment should not be a free ride. All I'm asking is that people \nwho are truly trying to find work, get a fair chance to provide for \ntheir families while they seek employment. I would work a part-time job \nor two part-time jobs in lieu of a full time job if I could find one. \nSo the solution is to get the economy going so the people like me can \nfind a decent job or jobs. Gentlemen, this is the greatest country in \nthe world. The middle class needs a break. I don't want a free ride, I \njust want a job or jobs to supply the basic needs of our family.\n\n  Mr. President, she is right. It is our job to get the economy going \nso she can get on with her life. It is astounding we spent $350 billion \non a jobs proposal and it did not make a bit of difference in the \ncircumstances she and many millions of people face.\n  We have job losses all over America. Bradford, WA, we talked about, \n348 jobs; Alcoas Intelco in Bellingham, WA, 200 jobs lost last month.\n  My friend, Ron Wyden, the distinguished senior Senator from Oregon, \nsaid Oregon has the highest unemployment of any State in the Union--the \nbeautiful State of Oregon, the highest unemployment of any place in \nAmerica. That is too bad for Ron Wyden and Senator Gordon Smith and the \npeople who live in Oregon.\n  Graphic Packaging, West Monroe, LA, 30 jobs. Think of that, 30 people \nwho have a job one day and do not have a job the next day. What does \nthis do to their families? Thirty people, that is what people say. \nRemember, are the 30 people going to be able to continue to make their \nhouse payments? The average person in America is out of work 5 months. \nThe people who work at Graphic Packaging in West Monroe, LA, how will \nthey handle bills for 5 months? Some get a job in 8 months, some in 4 \nmonths, unless things get worse. It averages 5 months. What do they do \nfor car payments? Or the payments due when they bought the refrigerator \nthey had to buy because the old one broke down? What about the house \npayments, the rental payments? What are those 30 people going to do? \nWhat are they going to do for Christmas? Remember, these people in West \nMonroe, LA, were laid off just the month before last. What are they \ngoing to tell their children come Christmastime? Is it a single-parent \nfamily that is taking care of the children and lost her job in West \nMonroe, LA? Is it a two-parent family with both working? We can \nenvision the circumstances of those 30 people. It is scary. It is \nfrightening. Only 30 people, some would say, but remember, every one of \nthe 30 is a human being, with a job they no longer have.\n\n  Trane, Lacrosse, WI, 350 jobs last month; Bob's Candles, Albany, GA, \n54 jobs. I have purchased Bob's Candles. There are 54 less people who \nare working at Bob's Candles. That happened last month. Parker \nHamilton, 100 jobs, Akron, OH; Delphi Packard, Warren, OH, 214. I am \nconfident this company is making parts of automobiles. Brach's Candy, \nbased in Chicago, 1,000 jobs gone a month before last; Hussman in \nBridgeton, MO, 250 jobs; Waterbury Plastics, Randolph, Vermont, 29 \njobs--only 29 jobs--the month before last. Vermont is a sparsely \npopulated State that has gotten a lot of attention in recent months \nbecause of a Presidential candidate, former Governor Dean of Vermont. \nKodak, Rochester, NY. Many years ago when I was there I visited the man \nwho ran the company then and went to his home in Rochester; 800 jobs; \nConStar Plastics, Reserve, LA, 69 jobs; Kosa Textiles, Cleveland \nCounty, North Carolina, 150 jobs; Cone Mills, Rutherford County, North \nCarolina, 600 jobs.\n  I heard Senator Hollings from South Carolina talking about the \ntextile industry being so devastated. North Carolina has a lot of new \nthings happening and it is certainly good, but they are losing a lot of \njobs--600 jobs at Cone Mills.\n  Radio Shack, Swannanoa, NC, 140 jobs; American Uniform, Robbinsville, \nNC, 34 jobs; Hewlett-Packard, Nashua, NH, 50 jobs; Delco Remy, Bay \nSprings, MI. They are losing jobs because of the auto industry. \nTrellborg Automotive, Logansport, IN, 454 jobs; Coca-Cola, Highstown, \nNJ, 900 jobs; Thompson Consumer Electric, Marion, IA, 820 jobs; Lear, \nTraverse City, MI, 300 jobs; Gateway, Hampton, VA, 450 jobs; Hamilton \nBeach, Washington, NC, 1,400 jobs. They all went to Mexico. Pfizer, \nKalamazoo, MI, 615 jobs; Ramtex, Ramseur, NC, 90 jobs; Boeing, Seattle, \nWA, 710 jobs just last month; Outokampu, Buffalo, NY, 26 jobs; \nMotorola, Elma, NC, 60 jobs.\n  This is happening all over America; thousands and thousands of jobs \nare lost, and I have only talked about a few of them. I will talk about \nmore later.\n  We could have done a better job to spend part of the $350 billion on \ninfrastructure and investments which meet our basic needs. They are an \namazing job stimulus, as I have spoken. All over the country we have an \ninfrastructure need--roads that have been on the drawing board for \nyears with no money to pay for them; airports in need of renovation, \nbut there is no money to pay for them; sewer systems that need repairs, \nbut there is no money to pay for them.\n  I held a hearing shortly before September 11 and I invited the mayors \nof Washington, DC, Atlanta, GA, I think maybe Denver, CO, Las Vegas, \nNV, and we talked about what was going on around their cities with the \nneed for renovating and repairing sewer systems. I can remember very \nclearly the mayor of Atlanta, GA, said he was\n\n[[Page S14291]]\n\nlooking forward to getting out of office and the reason he was so \nanxious to get out of office is because he is sure, in the foreseeable \nfuture, the whole water system in Atlanta will collapse. It is old and \nneeds huge amounts of money to bring it up to a condition that is not \none that will fail. That is basically what all the mayors say.\n  The mayor from Las Vegas had a different situation. There the growth \nis so tremendous--even though in Atlanta the growth is tremendous, \ntheir concern is in old Atlanta--in Las Vegas, with the new people \nmoving in, just last month, 8,500 people moved to Las Vegas. They need \nhelp with the infrastructure.\n  Schools are crumbling. The average school in America is about 50 \nyears old and in a state of disrepair.\n  In Las Vegas, the Clark County School District has a little different \nsituation. We cannot keep up with the growth, even though we are \ndedicating one new school a month. We held the record 2 separate years. \nWe built and dedicated and opened 18 new schools. We need some help.\n  But that is the way it is all over America. Other places need the \nmoney to renovate schools. It is something that is badly needed, but it \nis so important to not only creating jobs but giving kids a decent \nplace to work on their school studies. With a lot of the old schools, \nwe can get them all the new computer equipment you want, but they are \nnot wired to handle the new computer equipment. They need to be \nrewired. They need to be fixed so they can use modern technology, which \nthey cannot do now.\n  For every $1 billion, 47,000 direct high-quality new jobs are \ncreated. These new jobs create thousands of additional jobs through the \nripple effect that I talked about. When someone gets a job as a \nsurveyor for a new road, a bricklayer for a new school, one engineer \nfor a water project, or a crew member on a road construction project, \nthese jobs help all layers of our society--the educated, the people who \nare not educated in books but know how to run heavy equipment, as I \nindicated, those who lay brick; those who can do work in a house, \ncarpenters.\n  These are the kinds of things that are important. This is the ripple \neffect I am talking about. As I said, someone gets a job as a surveyor \nfor a new road. What follows that? Then you have to have someone come \nand do the engineering after the survey. That creates jobs. After that \nis done, you put it out to bid, and then the people come in.\n  As an example, in my little town of Searchlight, NV, we had--it is no \nlonger the case--the busiest two-lane road in all of Nevada. It was a \ndeath trap: 36 miles of it from Railroad Pass to Searchlight, a two-\nlane road, traffic would back up for 4 or 5 miles. Big trucks would \nslow down traffic to 40, 45 miles an hour. People would get anxious and \ntry to pass, and there would be head-on collisions, with many people \nkilled.\n  We were able to get 18--or half that distance--put out to bid, and \nnow that is completed. I was home this past weekend; I drove that 18 \nmiles. It was so nice, so safe. Then the other 18 miles--which is put \nout to bid as we speak--it was not as bad as it used to be because \nthere the congestion was not as much because people knew within 18 \nmiles they would be out of the traffic jam. They were a little more \npatient.\n  But on that road to Searchlight, as I just indicated--with the heavy \nequipment there, graders and bulldozers, and those carryalls, those \nhuge things that have to level the place where the road is going to be; \nand this is not a very hilly area, in fact, not hilly at all--people \nwere there doing cement work for the culverts, and hundreds of people \nwere put to work as a result of that job. I really do not know what the \nbid was on that, but I am sure it was $25-$30 million, and it created \nlots of jobs, as you can see.\n  These people who do this work--the people who built the road to \nSearchlight--every one of those people with these high-paying, good \njobs were able to go out and have dinner more often than they had in \nthe past. They were able to buy that coat for winter. They were able to \ntake a little weekend trip, maybe to LA, or visit relatives someplace \nelse, maybe in Salt Lake City, and spend a few dollars along the way.\n\n  That is what this is all about. They have money to spend on a car or \na dishwasher. As I indicated, all over America we will have more people \ncoming to Las Vegas. Multiply that person, that one person who is \nworking on that road to Searchlight, by 47,000, and you suddenly have \nthe business of the auto dealers, the hotels, and the airlines picking \nup. Soon they decide it is time to bring on more sales people, more \nhotel workers, more pilots. That is the ripple effect we need.\n  That is why this bill we are debating today from the Committee on \nAppropriations, making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce, \nJustice, and State, the Judiciary, is an important bill. It is a bill \nthat I have talked about before that does a lot of things that are \nimportant for this country.\n  This bill provides for conducting commerce within the United States--\nconducting commerce within the United States--among other things. That \nis a part of the bill I am talking about now: conducting commerce, \njobs. There is no more important commerce in all of America, all the \nworld, than jobs.\n  What is it like to have a job? What is it like not to have a job? I \ncome from one of the smallest States, population-wise, although \ncertainly for many generations we, population-wise, were the smallest \nState in the Union. We are now about 35th, 36th. There are a \nsignificant number of States smaller than we are but a lot of them \nbigger.\n  On the Senate floor, just the other day, I was having a dialog with \nmy friend from the State of Michigan, the junior Senator from Michigan, \nMs. Stabenow. She indicated that the State of Michigan has 9 million \npeople in it. That same day, a few minutes later, I asked the Senator \nfrom Illinois how many people live in the State of Illinois. The senior \nSenator from Illinois indicated that 12.5 million people live in the \nState of Illinois.\n  Nevada, Mr. President, is approaching 2.5 million people, so it is \nsignificantly smaller than those States, but we still have tens of \nthousands of people who are not employed. We do not know the exact \nfigures. Between 60,000 and 80,000 people are unemployed who are \nofficially counted as unemployed. There are many more, of course, who \nare unemployed. The official classification undercounts the number of \npeople who are interested in jobs and available for work. So the true \nnumber of unemployed people is significantly higher than the 60,000 or \n80,000 I talked about.\n  These are tens of thousands of people anxious to find work but unable \nto do so. Think about that. Sometimes we get overwhelmed by statistics. \nBut think about that piece of information for just a minute.\n  Let's take the lower figure. Let's say 60,000 people. I think it is \nhigher than that, but let's say there are 60,000 people without a job. \nEach represents a family struggling or going without, the American \ndream deferred, sometimes disappearing forever.\n  I have already talked about people being concerned about losing a \njob. People are worried about how to make their next mortgage or rent \npayment. They are worried about what will happen if they encounter \nunexpected medical bills. They worry about buying clothes for their \nkids. They worry about how long this jobless recovery is going to last \nand what will become of them when it is over.\n\n  In America today, there are 44 million people with no health \ninsurance. There are millions of others who are underinsured--people \nwho have insurance, but it is not very good.\n  I would hope that we would spend some time on that. Wouldn't it be \ngood if we spent 30 hours of the Senate's time debating health care for \nall Americans--health care for all Americans? But we are going to spend \n30 hours talking about judges.\n  As Senator Trent Lott said when he was majority leader, every time he \nwent back to Mississippi, no one ever asked him about judges. He said--\nand I am paraphrasing--it is a nonissue. That is true, especially when \nyou have what is taking place during the present President's tenure in \noffice: 168 judges approved, 4 disapproved; 168 to 4. We are going to \nspend 30 hours nonstop of the Senate's time talking about a ratio of \n168 to 4. I wonder if they would move to 30 hours if instead of having \na 98-percent track record, it was 99 percent. Maybe that would only \nrequire 15 hours. If it was a 99.5-percent track\n\n[[Page S14292]]\n\nrecord, maybe they would only spend 10 hours talking about judges.\n  And I see constantly--I see constantly, Mr. President--statements \nbeing made that there has never been a filibuster before of a judge. In \nfact, there was a statement issued today. I have it here on my \nBlackberry. Here it is right here. I am sorry to hold up the Senate. \nHere it is right here. This is a statement from Senator Frist. He says:\n\n       What we are doing to move our judicial nominations \nforward. This year the Senate has suffered unprecedented obstruction of \na Presidential judicial nominee by filibuster. In the history of our \nNation, this has never been done before.\n\n  (Mr. CHAMBLISS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Whoever prepared this for Senator Frist had better revise \nit. During the time I have been in the Senate, there have been \nfilibusters. I can think of a couple. I can think of three filibusters \nthat had to be ended by a vote of the Senate. Of course, previously \nthere were all kinds of filibusters. We know that. So this is simply \nuntrue: ``in the history of our Nation, this has never been done \nbefore.'' That is simply untrue.\n  Rather than spend this time on the 168-to-4 record this President \nhas, the country would be well served if we spent 30 nonstop hours \ntalking about the lack of health insurance in America. Forty-four \nmillion people have no health insurance. Many millions of others have a \nlack of health insurance. There are millions of people who have no \njobs. We are going to spend 30 hours talking about four people who want \na new job. They already have a job. They want a new job.\n  Thirty hours should be spent talking about the need for health care \nreform in America. The doctors would appreciate it. The patients would \nappreciate it. All over America, we see doctors making less money, we \nsee patients getting less care. Where is the money going? It is going \nto the middlemen, HMOs, insurance companies. Why don't we spend the 30 \nhours talking about health care, have a real debate on that subject? We \nhave no legislation dealing with health care. We have a Medicare bill \nthrough which we are trying to get prescription drug benefits to \nseniors. In fact, at 1 o'clock today, I understand, there was a meeting \ngoing on, a very important laydown of that legislation.\n  There is not now a bill dealing with prescription drugs for senior \ncitizens, as all senior citizens in America know. It spilled over into \nMedicare in an attempt to revise Medicare, to privatize Medicare. The \nchairman of the House conferees has said that that is one of the most \nimportant issues, to develop ``privatization.'' They have a fancy new \nname for it, but that is all it means. The American people aren't going \nto stand for that. Why don't we have a debate for 30 hours dealing with \nhealth care?\n  These people in Nevada who are out of a job, they really understand \nhow important it is to do something to create jobs. It is a bleak \npicture and can drag on and on for families in this situation. These \npeople who used to get up every morning and go to work all day, who \nused to feel the sense of purpose and pride that comes with holding a \njob, now that security is gone.\n  Why don't we spend 30 hours talking about why we haven't increased \nthe minimum wage? That would help commerce in this country. That would \nwork within the confines of this legislation. The minimum wage is now \n$5.15 an hour. Take that math and figure out how tough it is. That is \nwhy two people are working two jobs, just like the woman whose letter I \nread into the Record saying she would work two minimum-wage jobs \ngladly.\n  Who are the people who have these minimum-wage jobs? Are they kids in \nhigh school at McDonald's flipping hamburgers? No. Sixty percent of the \npeople who draw the minimum wage are women. For the majority of those \nwomen, that is the only job they have for their families. Why don't we \ntalk about the minimum wage? Let's spend 30 hours talking about people \nwho are working two jobs at $5.15 an hour, who have no benefits, no \nmedical benefits, no retirement benefits. We should spend a little time \non them, on the minimum wage. I think that would be something that \nwould be very beneficial.\n\n  San Francisco just passed a citywide minimum-wage bill. It has been \ndone in other places in the country. But in the Federal Government we \ncan't do that. We are going to spend 30 hours talking about four people \nwho already have jobs who want a new job. They want to be an appellate \njudge.\n  Estrada is not unemployed. Owens is not unemployed. Pryor is not \nunemployed. Pickering is not unemployed. In fact, Judge Pickering is \nalready a Federal judge. Pryor is attorney general of the State of \nAlabama. Owens is a supreme court justice of California. Miguel Estrada \nis one of the highest paid lawyers in the community. But we are going \nto spend 30 hours talking about four judges or wannabe judges who \nalready have jobs. But no time do we spend on the minimum wage. No way \nlet's back away from that, because all that affects is a bunch of kids \nflipping hamburgers.\n  Why don't we talk about the majority of the people who draw the \nminimum wage who are women, desperate for work for themselves and their \nfamilies. We are going to spend 30 hours, starting Wednesday at 6 \no'clock, until midnight Thursday, talking about four people who already \nhave jobs. We are not going to talk about the people who are unemployed \nin my State or about the minimum wage or about health care reform.\n  It is a bleak picture. Today, the average unemployed worker is out of \nwork for up to 5 months. That is the average. The number of people \nunemployed for greater than 6 months is at a 20-year high.\n  It is time we look at some of the places we are losing jobs again. \nThese are jobs that have been lost in the last few months. Just to talk \nabout some of them: Central Textiles, Pickens, SC, 140 jobs, the month \nbefore last. I am not familiar with this company: Leica, Depew, NY, 55 \njobs; a company called Tecumseh--that is an Indian name--Douglas, GA, \n535 jobs last month; General Electric--we have heard that before; they \nmust be cutting jobs all over the country--General Electric, \nGreensville, SC, 600 jobs just last month; Albany International, \nGreenville, again, South Carolina, 120 jobs, the month before last; \nRockwell Collins, Cedar Rapids, IA, 155 jobs; General Electric again, \nShreveport, LA, 200 jobs--that is 800 jobs; if you add all those on the \nother charts, it is well over 1,000--Carrier Corporation, 1,200 jobs, \nSyracuse, NY; Tolcheim, Washington, IN, I don't know how many jobs. \nThat is off my chart so I am sorry about that; Nestles USA, Fulton, NY, \n400 jobs; Sonoco Flexible Packaging, Fulton, NY, 1,300 jobs; Black \nClawson, Fulton, NY, 322 jobs; Tyco, that has made a little bit of news \nlately; the guy had a birthday or anniversary party that cost $6 \nmillion--one of the bosses--Argyle, NY, 335 jobs. New management \ndecided how to handle things: Just move the jobs to Mexico. That is \nwhat they decided to do.\n  Back to the chart: Maytag, Galesburg, IL, 380 jobs; Gates \nCorporation, Galesburg, IL, 76 jobs; Mettler-Toledo, Inman, OH, 150 \njobs; Paper Converting, Green Bay, WI, 115 jobs; Slater Steel, Fort \nWayne, IN, 418 jobs; Cognotti Industries, 100 jobs; Tolcheim, Fort \nWayne, Freemont, IN, 454 jobs; International Paper, Sartell, MN, 542 \njobs; R.J. Ray, Buffalo Grove, IL, 56 jobs;\n  These jobs were all lost within the last couple of months--some last \nmonth.\n  Playtex Products, Dover, DE, 94 jobs; Parker Hannifin, Marion, OH, \n165 jobs; from Greencamp, OH, again, Parker Hannifin, 165 jobs; Amcast, \nRichmond, IN, 133 jobs; Delco Remy, 349 jobs, Anderson, IN; Dana \nPerfect Circle, Richmond, IN, 182 jobs; Royal Precision, Torrington, \nCT, 110 jobs, the month before last.\n  It is going on as we speak. We have this administration boasting they \ncreated 126,000 jobs, which doesn't keep up with growth. Although I was \nimmensely relieved to see the economy stop losing jobs, I have been \nmore than a little concerned about the administration's promise. It \ndoesn't seem to know whether the current unemployment rate of 6 percent \nis a problem or not. I think it probably is.\n  During the last full month President Clinton was in office, the \nunemployment rate was 3.9 percent. The reversal has been enormous. On \nFebruary 4, the President's Council of Economic Advisers published a \nreport entitled ``Strengthening America's Economy: The President's Jobs \nand Growth Proposals.'' In that report, the President's\n\n[[Page S14293]]\n\neconomic advisers laid out the case for a new tax cut, saying:\n\n       Thus far in the recovery, the labor market remains a weak \n     spot, with the unemployment rate reaching 6 percent in \n     November and December.\n\n  This past Friday, the White House issued a statement claiming, again:\n\n       The President's jobs and growth agenda is working.\n\n  The unemployment rate is 6 percent. How can this jobs plan be working \nnow when the unemployment rate is exactly the same as when the \nPresident's smartest economic advisers called the labor market a ``weak \nspot.'' In February they considered 6 percent such an urgent problem \nthat it was a justification for a $300 billion tax cut. Now 6 percent \nunemployment is reason to celebrate and claim credit for its successful \neconomic plan.\n  We have a situation here where the distinguished majority whip came \nto the floor and criticized statements where we on this side talked \nabout this 30 hours being something that was not very smart--for lack \nof a better word--to do. Then they talked about the one-vote majority. \nWe had a one-vote majority, and now they have a one-vote majority. Now \nthings are ``so much better.''\n  Well, I hope today people understand why they are so much better. We \ncan help a lot, as we have this past year, in passing the legislation \nand the shortness of time on the appropriations bills we were unable to \naccomplish. We did not have the luxury of the cooperation of the \nminority. We have been cooperating. As you can see, today isn't the \nmost cooperative day. I think the majority should learn the lesson they \nneed to work with us, not against us. We can work together. We have \nworked together in the past. We will work together in the future. But \neveryone understands the Senate is a body created more than 200 years \nago and it was created to protect the minority, not the majority. The \nmajority can always protect itself. The minority needs help. What gives \nus that help is the Constitution. The majority should understand it \njust cannot run over us, say we are going to work Monday and Tuesday, \nthen have 30 hours for judges, votes in the afternoon on Monday, and \nthen we will decide what we are going to do Tuesday later. We need to \nbe part of the plan, part of the program.\n  The Senate is an interesting place. Everything has to be done here by \nunanimous consent. If there is no unanimous consent, not much happens. \nToday, not much is happening because there is no unanimous consent. It \nis normal on a bill like this appropriations bill for the subcommittee \nchair to give a nice little statement, the ranking member gives a nice \nlittle statement, and then you go to amendments. We have been so \ncooperative. The reason the majority today has been able to pass these \nappropriations bills is because we have cooperated. We have not tried \nto stall them. We did not speak at extended lengths of time on \namendments. I worked to get amendments taken off the list so we could \nmove forward to the next appropriations bill. That is the way the \nSenate should work. We have set an example as a minority on how it \nshould work. There should be an example set by the majority as to how \nthings should work.\n  You just cannot run over us. The Senate is set up to protect one \nSenator. There are 49 of us. We need some protection, some help, some \ncooperation, some partnership. I hope everybody understands that when \nthe majority decided to move along, we were whipping through these \nappropriations bills. I had many conversations with the Appropriations \nCommittee chair, Senator Ted Stevens--a wonderful, fine friend and a \ngreat Senator--and we had a plan to finish these bills. We could have \nfinished them. I don't expect anybody in the majority to publicly \ncriticize their leader, but I believe there is criticism in the hearts \nof some of the people in the majority.\n  What a ridiculous thing to have 30 hours--a week before trying to get \nout of here--spent on the jobs of 4 people, when there are over 3 \nmillion people who have lost their jobs and more than that are \nunemployed. We are going to spend 30 hours on the lives of four judges. \nThat just doesn't seem right to me. If people are wondering why we are \nnot moving along, you can do all the name calling you want, but I think \nthe history books will reflect how the leadership has been--at least \nduring the past few days when you interrupt the ending days of a \nsession to spend 30 hours on a wasteful exercise.\n  I agreed with the administration back in February when it believed \nthe 6 percent unemployment indicated the economy was weak. That is why \nI look forward to this bill being done--this bill dealing with the \nlegislation that is led by the senior Senator from New Hampshire and \nthe senior Senator from South Carolina. It is important legislation. It \nis just not the number of people out of work that is disturbing; it is \nalso the fact it is taking people so long to find something new. In \nfact, wages and salaries are falling precipitously. There is an \nincreasing amount of slack in the labor supply.\n  It is impossible to truly understand how bad the job market is now \nwithout being aware of a couple factors:\n  First, the record length of time jobs have been declining; second, \nthe growth in the working-age population since the recession began in \n2001; third, the fact that many people have stopped looking for a job \nout of hopelessness, not because they no longer want to work, and they \nare no longer counted as unemployed. Until this job slump, the number \nof jobs had never fallen steadily for 2\\1/2\\ years. These numbers go \nback to 1939. As of November 2003, payroll jobs had fallen by 2.6 \nmillion below the level of March 2001. Unfortunately, at the same time \nthat job market shrank 2 percent, the working-age population grew by \n2.4 percent. Had job growth kept up with working-age population instead \nof falling, we would have 7.2 million more jobs right now.\n  I watched on TV--it may have been last night. I got home from Nevada \nlast evening. It could have been last night. It could have been the day \nbefore. They did an interview about a young woman who had gotten her \nfirst job. She was so excited. She had graduated from college and for \nalmost 2 years she was unable to find a job. She had finally gotten a \njob.\n  The picture I want to paint here is the fact that the people who are \nout of work are not just a bunch of people who are looking to dig \nditches. They are people from a wide spectrum of our society, people \nlike the woman I saw on TV, who is highly educated, and not just people \nwho have no education. Everyone in between is out of work and needs a \njob.\n  This job deficit hits everybody. We should recognize that we have not \nonly the problem of creating new jobs to fill the jobless market \ncreated by those people who lost work but also the new jobs that need \nto be created because of new people moving into the workforce. But, sad \nto say, job creation has occurred mostly in low-quality jobs.\n  As glad as we should be that any new jobs are actually springing up, \nit is still worth examining what kinds of jobs are growing in today's \neconomy. The firm of Challenger, Gray, and Christmas analyzed the \nOctober job growth figures and determined that job creation was the \nheaviest in some of the sectors where the pay was the lowest--retail, \ntemporary help service firms, bars, and restaurants.\n  Jobs, commerce--Commerce-Justice-State, it is a very important topic. \nI am going to talk about some of the other things in the bill later on \ndealing with the State Department and the Justice Department, but now I \nam just talking about the Department of Commerce--jobs, commerce for \nthis country. Most of the jobs that have been created are low-quality \njobs.\n  As I look back over my work career, I remember some of the jobs I \nhave held. I have been very fortunate, I understand, to have the job I \nhave now, a contract with the people of the State of Nevada. I have a \nlittle over a year left to run on that contract.\n  I have done a lot of jobs. I have worked with my hands. I dug ditches \nand got paid for doing that. I remember one job I had digging holes to \nput up wooden telephone poles for power to the top of a mountain, some \nkind of microwave relay station. The man I worked with didn't speak \nEnglish. I was a young boy, maybe 16 years old. Oh, it was such hard \nwork. We had a bar, and it was hard getting the dirt out of that hole. \nWe spent all day together and we couldn't talk to each other, except by \nfacial expressions. When it was time to eat, we kind of got that idea. \nThat was one job. I was happy to have that job.\n\n[[Page S14294]]\n\n  I drove a truck for two summers. I worked as a warehouseman. For many \nyears--they were special summers--I worked in service stations where I \npumped gas and tried to sell lubes, carburetors, greasing the \nbearings--doing minor mechanical work.\n  I was a janitor part time in college. I was a radio dispatcher for \nthe city of Las Vegas building department. I was a Capitol policeman \nright here. I worked in a post office. I had lots of different jobs \nbefore I graduated from law school, but they were all jobs.\n  I was so fortunate. I never had to look for a job. I always had a \njob. I am very fortunate because for a lot of people that is not the \ncase. There are lots of people who have never had a job.\n  We have a wonderful program in Nevada. We have given Federal \nappropriations to this program. It was originally started because of \nthe largess, the generosity of Kirk Kerkorian, a very wealthy man, a \nformer client of mine who is one of America's entrepreneurs. He wanted \nto set up a job-creating program in a high unemployment area in west \nLas Vegas. Now it is run by a conglomerate. Kerkorian got it started \nand has since given it up. Now the Federal Government is involved in \nit. Labor unions are involved in it.\n  What it did was create jobs, teach people how to work who had never \nworked before. It is an amazing program. We have lots of service jobs \nin Las Vegas. Las Vegas, as you know, has about 140,000 hotel rooms. We \nhave more hotel rooms on the four corners of Tropicana and the strip \nthan the entire city of San Francisco. We have lots of hotel rooms, and \nwe need people to make beds in those rooms, to clean those rooms. We \nneed people to be waiters and waitresses in those large hotels.\n\n  What we do at that facility that I just toured again a few weeks ago \nis teach people who have never worked before to work. We teach them the \nmeaning of a job; why they have to be on time; why they are not \nsupposed to take time off unless it is absolutely critical they take \ntime off. It has worked well.\n  We place over 80 percent of these people. Those who are not placed we \nreally would have trouble placing them anyplace because the jobs are \nnot there.\n  We need to create jobs. We need to be involved in the creation of \njobs. Even though we are creating many low--what is the word, not low \nquality because they are important jobs--jobs in the lower sector \nbecause they don't pay enough. We need to create jobs, like I got a job \ndigging post holes. It was a very important job for me. It helped me \nget through school. It was important I had that job.\n  In these jobs where job creation has been the heaviest in recent \nyears, including this group that is paid the lowest--that is the word I \nwas thinking of--the firm of Challenger, Gray, and Christmas found \nweekly earnings in these work places--temporary service, bars, \nrestaurants--average $336, $318, and $225 respectfully. Each of these \nsectors pays wages well below the average of $521 per week for all \nthese industries.\n  This firm found that nearly one out of four unemployed Americans has \nbeen out of work for 6 months or more. The largest percentage, 47 \npercent of those experiencing extended unemployment, are white-collar \nworkers in management, professional, sales, and office occupations. Of \nthose unemployed, 1.4 million said they were able to find only part-\ntime work. That figure represents a 27-percent increase from just a \nyear ago when only 1.1 million workers were trapped involuntarily in \npart-time jobs. Now it is up another 200,000.\n  Mr. President, 7.5 million Americans worked two or more jobs in \nOctober, up from 7.3 million just a year ago. That is an increase of \n200,000. The percentage of people for part-time jobs increased from 1.7 \nmillion to 1.8 million over the same course of the year.\n  I want to look at where some more of these jobs have been lost.\n  Hedstrom, Ashland, OH, 60 jobs, just last month; Laurel Hills, NC, \nSpring Industries, 120 jobs, month before last; Wolverine Tube, \nBonneville, MS, 300 jobs, month before last; Rome Cable in Rome, NY, \n240 jobs, month before last; Union Tools, Frankfort, NY, 80 jobs, month \nbefore last; Arvin Industries, Franklin, IN, 850 jobs, month before \nlast; Alpine Electric, Greenwood, IN, 195 jobs; Standard Motor \nProducts, Argos, IN, 150 jobs; Cavalier Specialty Yarn, Gaston County, \nSC, again Senator Hollings' home State, 120 jobs; Bowling Green Mill, \nGastonia, NC, 160 jobs; Parkdale Mills, Belmont, NC, another 161 jobs.\n  In Wichita, KS, we have a situation where Boeing just laid off 4,800 \npeople in the last year or so.\n  Tecumseh--we have seen that name before. Now we see it in New \nHolstein, WI, 300 jobs; Sheboygan, WI, 292; Perry Judd, Waterloo, WI, \n372 jobs; Gateway, Sioux City, SD, 700 jobs in a small State such as \nSouth Dakota. They must feel that very significantly. International \nPolymers, Hamblen County, TN, 450 jobs; Lea Industries, North Carolina, \n120 jobs; Chiquola, Kingsport, TN, 200 jobs; Modine Manufacturing, \nClinton, TN, 200 jobs; Lucent, Genoa, IL.\n  These are the issues I have focus on today. There are more. This is \nnot from the Bureau of Vital Statistics or the Department of Commerce. \nThese are jobs that have been lost, that we have had staff pick up \nreading different news articles around the country. It is demonstrative \nof what is happening to jobs in America. They are leaving us.\n  The New York Times, I agree with it on occasion; I disagree with it \non occasion. It is a newspaper that is a very substantial part of the \nAmerican political body. People certainly view it as an important \nnewspaper. The editorial section is probably one of the best in the \nworld, if not the best. I was struck by a column written by Bob Herbert \njust a few days ago, on October 27. This article is so good, and the \nsubject matter of it is so important that I thought I should read it.\n  I want to read what Bob Herbert said in the New York Times because, \ntrying to paraphrase what he says does not capture all of his arguments \nin this October 27 column. It is entitled: ``There is a Catch: Jobs.''\n  He is, of course, referring to the economic growth announcement last \nweek. Here is what he said:\n\n       The President tells us the economy is accelerating, and the \n     statistics seem to bear him out. But don't hold your breath \n     waiting for your standard of living to improve. Bush country \n     is not a good environment for working families.\n       In the real world, which is the world of families trying to \n     pay their mortgages and get their children off to college, \n     the economy remains troubled. While the analysts and \n     commentators of the comfortable class are assuring us that \n     the President's tax cuts and the billions being spent on Iraq \n     have been good for the gross domestic product, the workaday \n     folks are locked in a less sanguine reality.\n       It's a reality in which: The number of Americans living in \n     poverty has increased by three million in the past two years. \n     The median household income has fallen in the past two years. \n     The number of dual-income families, particularly those with \n     children under 18, has declined sharply.\n       The administration can spin its ``recovery'' any way it \n     wants. But working families can't pay their bills with data \n     about the gross domestic product. They need the income from \n     steady employment. And when it comes to employment, the Bush \n     administration's has compiled the worst record since the \n     Great Depression.\n       The jobs picture is far more harrowing than it is usually \n     presented by the media. Despite modest wage increases for \n     those who are working, the unemployment rate is 6.1 percent, \n     which represents almost nine million people. Millions more \n     have become discouraged and left the labor market. And there \n     are millions of men and women who are employed but working \n     significantly fewer hours than they'd like.\n       Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy \n     Institute, has taken a look at the hours being worked by \n     families, rather than individuals. It's a calculation that \n     gets to the heart of a family's standard of living.\n       The declines he found were ``of a magnitude that's \n     historically been commensurate with double-digit unemployment \n     rates. It is not just that there were fewer family members \n     working. The ones who are employed were working fewer \n     hours.''\n       According to government statistics, there are nearly 4.5 \n     million people working part-time because they have been \n     unable to find full-time work. In many cases, as the \n     outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas noted in a \n     recent report, the part-time worker is ``earning far less \n     money than his or her background and experience warrant--\n     i.e. a computer programmer working at a coffee shop.''\n       Economists expect some modest job creation to occur over \n     the next several months. But there is a ``just in time for \n     the election'' quality to the current economic surge, and \n     even Republicans are worried that the momentum may not last. \n     The President has played his tax-cut card. The spending on \n     Iraq, most Americans fervently hope, will not go on \n     indefinitely. And President Bush's\n\n[[Page S14295]]\n\n     own Treasury secretary is talking about an inevitable return \n     to higher interest rates.\n       Where's the jobs creation miracle in this dismal mix? \n     Meanwhile, these are some of the things working (and jobless) \n     Americans continue to face: Sharply increasing local taxes, \n     including property taxes; steep annual increases in health \n     care costs; soaring tuition costs at public and private \n     universities. Families are living very close to the edge \n     economically, and this situation is compounded, made even \n     more precarious, by the mountains of debt American families \n     are carrying--mortgages, overloaded credit cards, college \n     loans, et cetera.\n       The Bush administration has made absolutely no secret of \n     the fact that it is committed to the interests of the very \n     wealthy. Leona Helmsley is supposed to have said that only \n     little people pay taxes. The Bush crowd has turned that into \n     a national fiat.\n       A cornerstone of post-Depression policy in this country has \n     been a commitment to policies aimed at raising the standard \n     of living of the poor and the middle class. That's over.\n       When it comes to jobs, taxes, education and middle-class \n     entitlement programs like Social Security, the message from \n     the Bush administration couldn't be clearer. You're on your \n     own.\n\n  Now, what did he say in this column? What did he say? He said that \nwhat is going on in this administration is not good for working men and \nwomen. He said, among other things, Bush country is not a good \nenvironment for working families. He said the administration can spin \nits recovery any way it wants, but working families cannot pay their \nbills with data about the gross domestic product.\n  As I said, people in America are more concerned about J-O-B, not GDP. \nThey are more concerned about jobs than the gross domestic product.\n  I think it is interesting to note that Herbert also says that in \naddition to the gross domestic product not being something that people \nare concerned about--they are more concerned about jobs--economists \nexpect some modest job creation to occur over the next several months. \nRemember, we need 300,000 jobs just to keep up with normal growth in \nthis country. Meanwhile, those things that American families, the \njobless Americans, continue to face, sharply increasing local taxes, \nsharply increased local taxes--Nevada was one of about 41 States during \nthis year's legislative sessions that were in deep financial trouble. \nNevada had three or four special sessions of the legislature called in \nan attempt to try to right the ship, to try to figure out some way that \nthey could afford to handle this rapidly growing State.\n  As I indicated earlier, talk about commerce, this bill in Commerce-\nState-Justice, commerce in Nevada is very difficult because just last \nmonth, in September, we had 8,500 new people move into the Las Vegas \narea. I think we have to understand that the legislature had to keep up \nwith the demand for services that we had throughout the State of \nNevada, but they were faced with some unfunded mandates, such as Leave \nNo Child Behind.\n\n  Clark County School District, I think, is the sixth largest school \ndistrict, maybe the fifth now, 270,000 students or thereabouts, a \ndifficult time because of what we passed on to them with Leave No Child \nBehind. We are leaving lots of children behind because we have not \nfunded the Leave No Child Behind Act.\n  Homeland security, I had a conversation with Tom Ridge last week. Tom \nRidge is a wonderful man. He is my friend. We came to Congress together \nin 1982. He was a good Governor of the State of Pennsylvania, one of \nour very highly populated States. I was happy to see the President \nselect him as head of the Department of Homeland Security and now the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. He has a difficult job, and in Nevada \nwe are faced with significant problems. We have huge responsibilities. \nWe have responsibilities for people visiting Nevada from the State of \nGeorgia. We have to take care of the people from the State of Georgia \njust like we have to take care of the people of the State of Nevada if \nthere is some kind of emergency. There is no separation. But when we \nhave, on any given day, 300,000 to 500,000 tourists in Las Vegas, it \nmakes it really tough. We have had lots of added responsibilities \nbecause of the legislation we have passed dealing with homeland \nsecurity.\n\n  I spoke with the Secretary about the need to try to do something to \nhelp an area where we have so many tourists on any given day. We need \nhelp. I am confident the Secretary understood and listened and will try \nto do his very best to help. But we have unfunded mandates because of \nthat.\n  I heard my friend, the distinguished junior Senator from Tennessee, \nthe former Governor of Tennessee, and he should understand what \nunfunded mandates are about. Lamar Alexander spoke in the Chamber last \nweek on several occasions about an unfunded mandate dealing with the \nInternet tax debate we brought up last week. He said that is an \nunfunded mandate.\n  I don't know as much about that as I know about education and police \nwork, but they are unfunded mandates. That is why there have been \nsharply increased local taxes all over America.\n  Mr. Herbert also says there are steep annual increases in health care \ncosts. We have talked about that. Not only are there 44 million people \nwith no health insurance, but we have 44 million people who have not \nonly no health care insurance but those health care costs are \nincreasing. I think that is very significant. Health care costs are \ngoing up, as Mr. Herbert said.\n  There are soaring tuition costs at public and private universities. \nThere was an article in one of the weekly magazines--I don't remember \nwhether it was Time, Newsweek, or U.S. News and World Report this \nweek--that reported the most expensive private school in America, just \nfor tuition, is $41,000 a year. State universities, which you would \nthink would be significantly cheaper--some are cheaper; they are almost \nhalf as much. The highest State tuition, according to this weekly \nmagazine, is almost $20,000 a year--soaring tuition costs at public and \nprivate universities. Why? They have to do that because there is no \nmoney coming from State governments. It is as simple as that. They have \nto do that.\n  But I think the most telling thing Mr. Herbert wrote about is when he \nsaid Leona Helmsley is supposed to have said only little people pay \ntaxes. The Bush crowd has turned it into a national fiat.\n  Are unemployment benefits important? Of course they are important. \nDuring the first thousand days under Bush, unemployment is up, the rate \nof impoverished is up, debt is up, and judicial vacancies are the \nlowest in some 15 years. So what are we going to spend 30 hours on? We \nare not going to spend 30 hours on unemployment. We are not going to \nspend 30 hours on the impoverished of America. We are not going to \nspend 30 hours on the deficit. When the President took office, the \nsurplus over 10 years was about $7 trillion. That is gone. We are now \nspending in the hole.\n  Is that important to commerce? I think so. But we are not going to \nspend 30 hours talking about the debt. This year we will have the \nlargest debt in the history of this country. But we are not going to \nspend 30 hours talking about that. We are going to spend 30 hours \ntalking about judges.\n  Judicial vacancies--are they up? They are down. They are the lowest \nin some 15 years. We are going to take 30 hours talking about the \nlowest judicial vacancy rate in 15 years. We are going to take 30 hours \nnot talking about the things that should be down--unemployment should \nbe down, impoverishment should be down, deficits should be down, \ndebt should be down. We are going to talk about the thing that is up. \nWe have no vacancies to speak of--the lowest in well more than a \ndecade.\n\n  I think this administration has things turned around. Doesn't common \nsense dictate we should be spending 30 hours talking about \nunemployment? Talking about impoverishment? Deficit? Debt? They were up \nduring the first thousand days of this President's administration. But \nno, we are going to talk about judicial vacancies, which have been the \nlowest in many years.\n  Later today I will have a few things to say about judicial pay and \nabout the Justice Department. We can talk about Clinton judges being \ndenied hearings, let alone votes. We can talk about the names. We have \na judicial scoreboard chart. We can compare the Bush record and the \nClinton record. We have a lot to talk about here.\n  I want the American people to understand what we are doing. We have \nsaid we believe it would be better if the Senate spent its time--30 \nhours, going from 6 o'clock Wednesday night to midnight on Thursday--\ntalking about issues we need to complete. I begged--well, that is a \nlittle strong. I certainly pleaded with the majority last week on at \nleast five occasions to pass a military construction bill. I thought \nthat\n\n[[Page S14296]]\n\nwas very important, that we pass the military construction conference \nreport. It was important to do. I believe it was a partisan attempt to \nhold up the bill for reasons I don't understand because it should be \nnonpartisan, because it deals with supporting our forces on military \nmissions all over the world.\n  For Nevada, it would have a devastating result. While we delay, there \nwill be no vehicle maintenance facility for Nellis Air Force Base, the \npremium aviator training facility in this country; no water treatment \nfacility in Hawthorne, where we have the Army depot to store \nammunition, a depot supplying munitions for our war effort in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. There will be no telecommunications security force \nbuilding for the Reno Air National Guard, a Guard unit fully deployed \non many fronts in the war on terrorism; no new hydrant fuel system for \nour planes and pilots in Nellis. We could go on.\n  The military has critical needs across the country and every Senator \nhere knows how crucial these facilities are. I haven't mentioned the \nbarracks and additional security measures this bill includes for our \nmilitary around the world. Certainly they need the funding more than \nanyone, but apparently there has been a decision on the other side of \nthe aisle not to turn to this bill and not to turn to the Syria \nAccountability Act, both of which have a direct connection for our \nnational security and the security of our forces.\n  This bill we are now debating, the conference report on Commerce-\nState-Justice, is extremely important, dealing with jobs, and we spent \na lot of time talking about jobs and we need to talk about jobs.\n  We have people dying every day. There is a global war on terror. And \nwe are going to waste 30 hours so one side can try to secure some \npolitical points. What has happened to the urgency?\n  This bill we are now taking up, Calendar No. 274, from the Committee \non Appropriations chaired by Senator Gregg, is an important piece of \nlegislation. It covers a lot of different areas that are so important \nto our country.\n\n  We have this bill, which is H.R. 2799. We would like to complete \nthis, as we have a number of our other appropriations bills, and go to \nconference. But we have been unable to do that for reasons that are \nquite obvious to everyone here.\n  I cannot understand why we cannot spend 30 hours of the people's time \nworking on things the people care about, and not on things we should \nnot be spending time on, like four people who want to get better jobs--\nwell, only three now, because Miguel Estrada has withdrawn his name--\nOwen, Pickering, and Pryor. They want jobs, so we are down to three \nnow. We are going to spend 30 hours--I guess 10 hours per judge.\n  (Mr. Coleman assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Unemployment benefits--and certainly this legislation we \ndeal with here is concerned about unemployment, as I indicated. We \ntalked about this on previous occasions, about the people who have been \nunemployed, even within the confines of this legislation right here. \nPeople about whom I have talked, people on these charts, certainly are \nincluded within this bill. There are many people affected when this \nbill cuts back on a number of programs, people who have lost their \njobs.\n  As I indicated here, we have unemployment that has gone up. Actually \nit was 3.89 percent. The number of impoverished has gone up, the number \nof uninsured has gone up, the budget deficit has gone up, the national \ndebt has certainly gone up, and judicial vacancies have gone down. \nRather than talk about these things in red--impoverishment, uninsured, \nbudget deficit, national debt--we are going to spend 30 hours talking \nabout the three who want a better job, not the over 3 million who are \nunemployed.\n  Last month I got a letter from a woman who lives in Las Vegas. She \nwrites:\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: On July 2, 2003, I became a displaced \n     airline worker\n\n--in fact, maybe I will read that letter a little bit later.\n  If I could have the people up front keep their voices down a little \nbit, please; sorry about that. It is a little distracting.\n  The report on the bill that is now before us goes through a number of \nissues. It talks about the purpose of the bill. It talks about the \nhearings that were held dealing with this legislation. Then it has a \nsummary of the bill. The summary of the bill states:\n\n       The budget estimates for the departments and agencies \n     included in the accompanying bill are contained in the budget \n     of the United States for fiscal year 2004 submitted on \n     February 3, 2003. The total amount of new budget authority \n     recommended by the committee for fiscal year 2004 is \n     $37,637,536,000. This amount is a decrease of $362,290,000 \n     below the appropriations for fiscal year 2003 for these \n     departments and agencies. The committee's recommendation is \n     $770,699,000 below the budget estimates.\n\n  The following paragraphs highlight major themes contained in this \nbill: terrorism, protecting America's children, information technology \nenhancement, reprogramming, reorganizations, and relocations.\n  This is an important bill. The two people who have operated the \nsubcommittee for the last several Congresses are extremely good. I \nalready earlier today complimented the senior Senator from New \nHampshire about his stalwart public service. The senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. Hollings, will go down in history as one of \nAmerica's truly great Senators. He is the longest serving junior \nSenator in the history of this country as a result of the longtime \nservice of then-senior Senator Strom Thurmond. Senator Hollings, to my \ndisappointment, decided not to run for reelection. But he has not lost \nan ounce of his vigor, and he is a great Senator. He and Senator Gregg \nhave done a wonderful job on this bill over the years. I look forward \nto completing this legislation when we have an opportune time to do \nthat.\n  Some may ask, Why is the Senator taking so much time on the floor? I \ndon't speak often on the floor. I speak often but not very long. The \nreason I am speaking today is because I think it is important people \nunderstand that the 100 Senators here have to get along. The majority \nhas to be aware of the minority.\n  The Presiding Officer is a new Senator but he is someone who has been \ninvolved in government for a number of years. He will come to \nunderstand better than he does now that for the Senate to work well, we \nhave to work together.\n  Just to repeat for those people within the sound of my voice, Senator \nDaschle and I have worked very hard. I have spent days of my life here \non the Senate floor--not all of the time pleasing Democratic Senators. \nI have tried my best to make the trains run on time, as one Senator \ntold me when he criticized me.\n  But I don't regret anything that I have done to help the Senate \nschedule. I think it is important the trains run on time in the Senate. \nThat is why I have worked personally very hard with the Democratic \nSenators to move legislation. If a Senator has four amendments, can he \nget by with two? You ask for 45 minutes; can you squeeze your time down \nand take half an hour? As a result of that, we have been able to do \nsome really good things. It is not because of me. It is because of the \ncooperation of the 48 others on this side of the aisle.\n\n  That is why Senator Daschle and I decided that it would be in the \nbest interests of the Senate to go along with working on Monday \nstarting early in the day, and work all day on a legal holiday, \nVeterans Day. I told the majority leader here on the floor publicly on \nmore than one occasion that the veterans of America will understand \nthat. They will understand why we have to work on Veterans Day because \nthe work we do here is for them directly.\n  We are moving along well, even when we are, in effect, jabbed in the \neye by being told, you can go ahead and have your Senators jam this \ntime because what we have to do is allow 30 hours of time during \nsupposedly the next to the last week we are in session to talk about \nfour judges. For four failed judgeships, we are going to spend 30 hours \nbeginning at 6 o'clock on Wednesday until midnight on Thursday.\n  I personally thought that wasn't the way to run the Senate. I think \nas history judges, history will agree with me. What is there that would \ncreate the desire to use our time to talk about judges? Senator Lott \nhas said that there are more important issues. When he was majority \nleader, he said when he went home no one ever asked him about judges.\n\n[[Page S14297]]\n\n  Rather than have the majority run the Senate today, as they want, I \nwant everyone to understand that we have a voice in what goes on around \nhere. We are in the minority--51 to 49. We are not too far behind the \nshow here. Had it not been for the untimely death of the Senator from \nMinnesota, Paul Wellstone, it probably would have been 50 to 50. But it \nisn't. Paul Wellstone was killed. His death was untimely, and I grieve \nfor him often. But the fact is that we also have a say in how this \nplace is run.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield for a question for up to 1 minute without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I heard the Senator's question about \ndelaying on this question of judges. Could it be that our friends on \nthe other side, having blocked 61 of the President's nominees usually \nbecause of one Republican's objection, are concerned that Democrats \nhave helped confirm a record number of President Bush's nominees, has \nstopped less than any President in recent history, and that maybe they \nwant to obscure their own record and not be in the position to praise \nours?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on this floor, I have defended, advocated, \nand commended my friend, the senior Senator from Vermont, for his \nhandling of the Judiciary Committee. It is a very difficult committee. \nBut he has handled it masterfully. He has been fair.\n  As indicated by the record of accomplishments of President Bush, who \nis now in office, to look at the accomplishments of the Senator from \nVermont, one need only look at what President Bush has accomplished \nwith his judiciary. Mr. President, 168 of his judges are now serving \nlifetime appointments. Four were turned down. That is 168 to 4.\n  I would like you to put that chart back up.\n  I want my friend to understand what I just said. What I said is that \nthe unemployment rate has gone way up; impoverished rate, way up; \nuninsured, way up; budget deficit, way up; national debt, way up; and, \njudicial vacancies, down.\n  Why are we going to spend 30 hours--not on the national debt, not on \nthe budget deficit, not on unemployment, not on the impoverished, not \non the uninsured--on 4 judges who have been turned down--4 of the 168? \nWe are going to spend 30 hours of the Senate's time with the lowest \njudicial vacancy rate in about 15 years.\n  I say, through the Chair to my friend from Vermont, that I hope he \nholds his head high, as he knows he does, in working his way through \nthese judges. Frankly, some of these judges I have not been wild about \nvoting for, but I believe the President of the United States has a lot \nof latitude. But I also believe in the Constitution of the United \nStates. This little document says Senators have the role of advising \nand consenting to the President's actions in certain cases, and judges \nis one of them. We have taken our constitutional prerogative and on \nfour occasions said no, these are not people who should serve in the \nU.S. court at a level they are seeking.\n\n  I say to my friend, rather than spending our time on the unemployed, \non impoverished people, on uninsured people, on the budget deficit, on \nthe national debt, all of which are skyrocketing--this is not a close \ncall. We had a surplus of $7 trillion. We now have debt of $5.6 \ntrillion. Figure that out. Does this deserve a few minutes talk? What \nabout the deficit? We will have the largest deficit in the history of \nour country this year. People are out there underinsured, uninsured, \nand poor. What is happening in America today, I am sad to report, is \nthe rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.\n  I spent time talking about the unemployed today. It would be nice to \nspend a little time talking about the unemployed. But no, we are going \nto take 30 hours, from 6 p.m. on Wednesday until midnight on Thursday, \ntalking about how badly Miguel Estrada was treated; it was awful what \nwe did to that man; We asked him to fill out a form; We asked him to \ngive us his memo that he prepared at the Department in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. No, he could not do that--no way. We picked on that \nman so badly. What a shame. It seems, if he wants the job, he should \nfill out the application. People are saying this guy is something, he \nis great. Well, if he is so great, let's see what he said in his \nmemoranda in the Solicitor's Office. It is not as if he is out of work. \nHe is a man with one of the best jobs in Washington. I don't know how \nmuch money he is making, but it's lots.\n  Then we had Priscilla Owen. The President's own lawyer, Judge \nGonzales, who served on the Texas Supreme Court with Priscilla Owen, \nsaid she should not be there, basically. That was an opinion he wrote. \nNow they are trying to remedy that situation. She also has a job.\n  Then a man by the name of William Pryor wants to be a Federal judge. \nOne problem: He has a record that is embarrassing. I don't know why \nthey put him in. That was an easy vote because his record is so bad.\n  Then Judge Pickering. I wish we could have done something to help \nJudge Pickering because of my high regard for Trent Lott. I think the \nworld of Trent Lott, and Judge Pickering is from Mississippi. Judge \nPickering is from Mississippi. His son came to speak to me--a wonderful \nyoung man. But his father has a bad record. He is a Federal district \njudge. He should stay there and be happy. But he wants to be a Federal \ncircuit court judge. Every civil rights group in America opposed that--\nevery one--because of what he had done while he was a judge.\n  I say to my friend, through the Chair, the distinguished Senator from \nVermont--my friend--I compliment him, I applaud the job the Senator has \ndone in representing not only the State of Vermont but the State of \nNevada and the rest of the country in a dignified way. The Senator \nknows he has an obligation, even when he gets the worst of the worst. \nWe have been very careful.\n  We make sure there has to be a unanimous vote out of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We follow that almost perfectly. We look for certain things \nto do, a unanimous vote by our people that serve on our committees. The \nSenator has done a wonderful job.\n  I ask my staff to put on the board the chart about judges. I am not \non the Judiciary Committee, but I have learned a lot about the judicial \ncommittee. This bill, of course, deals with the Federal Judiciary. One \nsection of this bill deals with that, and we will get to that in more \ndetail.\n  I failed to mention something important earlier. According to \nEstrada's financial disclosure forms, he makes about half a million a \nyear where he now works. So we are going to spend 30 hours dealing with \nhow poorly this man, who makes half a million a year, is treated--not \ntalk about Americans making $50,000 a year; and not, as I talked about \nearlier today, about the jobs.\n  There are a few jobs being created in certain areas. From the \nChallenger firm, job creation was heaviest in the sectors where the pay \nwas lowest: Retail, temporary, bars and restaurants, making weekly \nearnings of $366. So they work 10 weeks and they make not much money. \nThat is $3,066; about $15,000 a year. That is the highest paid--in \nretail. The bars and restaurants make $225 a week.\n  I don't think there should be a lot of tears shed on Miguel Estrada \nbecause he makes $500,000 a year. I don't know the salaries of Pryor, \nPickering, and Owen, but it makes these jobs that are being created \nlook pretty bleak.\n  Before I get off the subject, I will point out some Clinton circuit \nnominees who were ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association, \nwho were blocked from being confirmed or delayed by Republicans who \nvoted against them. Allen Snyder, never given a vote; Elena Kagan, \nnever given a vote; Merrick Garland waited 559 days; Sonia Sotomayer, \nSecond Circuit, 494 days; Robert Cindrich, never given a vote. Stephen \nOaslofsky, never given a vote; James Beatty, never given a vote; Andre \nDavis, never given a vote; Elizabeth Gibson, never given a vote; Alston \nJohnson, never given a vote; Enrique Moreno, never given a vote; Jorge \nRangel, never given a vote; Kathleen McCree Lewis, never given a vote. \nWe had cloture votes with Berzon and Paez; there were other filibusters \nprevious to that.\n  As Senator Daschle said when we took over the Senate, it was not \npayback time; we would work to get judges\n\n[[Page S14298]]\n\napproved. We have done that. It is the lowest vacancy rate in many \nyears. We have turned down 4 and approved 168.\n  Some time ago, within the past hour or so, I said I got a letter from \na woman who lives in Las Vegas. She wrote to me:\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: On July 2nd, 2003, I became a displaced \n     airline worker after 38 years as a TWA, now American \n     Airlines, flight attendant. I received no severance pay. My \n     unemployment benefits will expire January 2nd, 2004. Congress \n     has passed new legislation which made December 28, 2003, the \n     cut off date for temporary extended unemployment \n     compensation. After that day, there will be no more extended \n     unemployment compensation extensions. I'll miss the deadline \n     for extended unemployment benefits by five days. I'm a \n     single woman and sole supporter. I have no skills \n     applicable to this difficult job market, and my age makes \n     an already bad job market even more limited. It will take \n     time to learn skills to find a suitable job. Extended \n     unemployment benefits will be needed for my very survival. \n     I ask you to please support Senate bill 1708 which will \n     extend temporary unemployment compensation benefits and \n     provide additional unemployment benefits for those of us \n     who can't find jobs.\n       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.\n\n  It is important to be straight with the American people. The \nadministration may be able to put out press releases declaring a dismal \nrecord a successful one, but the people know better. They know the \nadministration's plan is not working. They know it from their own \nexperience or from a friend, neighbor, or spouse who is unemployed and \nunable to work, from the overcrowded or rundown school their children \nattend, from the hours they spend in traffic every day.\n  Mr. President, $355 billion is a lot of money to invest in a plan--\nany plan--to create jobs, but it is a plan that has failed. Instead of \ntrying to turn a failure into a success by press release, and nothing \nmore, this administration owes the American people a new course, a new \nplan that will actually put them back to work.\n  I have spent time going over the job creation of other \nadministrations and what has happened in this administration. It is not \na pretty picture, and that is an understatement. It is not a pretty \npicture. In this administration, for the first time, there has been job \nloss going back to the Hoover years. That is not good. That certainly \nis not good.\n  This bill is something that is important. It is important. It is also \nimportant to recognize we have an obligation as a Senate to work to try \nto get things done. But there have been efforts made in recent days to \nshow how little we can get done. Does the majority think they are \ndictators as to what happens around here? They can say: We are going to \nhave votes. Come on in, we are going to have votes. They can have \nvotes, but not when they want them, if that is what they want to do.\n  As the Presiding Officer has learned in his short tenure in the \nSenate, one Senator can really mess things up around here. We need \ncooperation. We need people to work together. We do not need to be \ntold, ``Come on in Monday, we will vote.'' ``What time?'' ``We don't \nknow.'' ``What time can people go to their events, if at all?'' ``Well, \nwe will find out later.''\n  I hope the ensuing days will include us a little more in what is \ngoing on around here. It may not be something the majority wants to do, \nbut I am saying it is something the majority has to do. The majority \nhas to work with us or nothing gets done.\n  I can say from experience the majority, which was the minority, \npretty well understands that because they were able to stop us from \ndoing lots of things. As the Senator from Kentucky pointed out this \nmorning, when they, the Republicans, were in the minority, they did a \ngood job of stopping us from doing things. We had difficulty passing \nappropriations bills. We got three passed. We have cooperated, and \nthere have been 10 completed. That is because we have cooperated.\n  Because of us, the minority worked with the majority, and we will \ncontinue to do that at a subsequent time. But we want to be involved in \nwhat is going on around here. As I said, it is easier to be a dictator, \nto be a tyrant, to just tell us what we are going to do. That is not \nhow the Senate works. You need to work with us. That is what this is \nall about today. You need to work with us. Because if you think you can \njust march down any road you want to go, you are going to find \nroadblocks in that road.\n\n  We have worked to pass important legislation, and we will continue to \ndo that. Bills have been done and the budget was done this year because \nwe worked to help them get done.\n  I want, before we leave this judges thing, and talking about why I \nthink it is important to talk about unemployment, about jobs, to \nmention Judge Pickering now makes about $155,000 a year as a district \ncourt judge. Supreme Court Justice Owen makes $113,000. William Pryor, \nas attorney general of Alabama, makes $125,000. That pales in \ncomparison to Miguel Estrada.\n  These are the four, the ``Big Four.'' We are going to spend 30 hours \non the Big Four. The Big Four make a total of about a million dollars a \nyear, and we are going to spend 30 hours lamenting how poorly these \npeople have been treated, and we will not spend 30 seconds talking \nabout the unemployed of this country, people who are out of work for an \naverage of 5 months.\n  We have this administration, after years of job losses, coming \nforward and saying: Oh, we finally got it. Everything is in shape. We \nhave had two huge tax decreases, and we were supposed to create \nmillions and millions of jobs. We need 150,000 just to keep up with \npopulation growth. But we are not going to talk about that. We are not \ngoing to talk about the economy. We are going to spend 30 important \nhours of this body talking about judges--four judges--and how poorly \nthey have been treated: Pickering, Estrada, Pryor, and, of course, \nOwen; 30 hours. It does not seem fair to me.\n  I repeat, more poor people, more unemployment, more deficit, more \nuninsured, and we are going to spend 30 hours telling how sad it is a \nman making $155,000 a year did not get a promotion, that a woman making \n$113,000 a year, whom the President's own lawyer does not think is very \ngood, and an attorney general who makes $125,000 a year, plus the star \nof the lot, Estrada, who makes half a million dollars a year--we are \ngoing to spend 30 hours on them.\n  We do not have time to talk about the minimum wage because they make \n$5.15 an hour--$5.15 an hour. Why, if they work real hard, they will \nmake over $40 a day. If they are lucky enough to work all week, they \nwill get $200--$200--in a week.\n  Well, if that is not enough for them, let them find another part-time \njob; let them find another minimum-wage job. There are lots of them. \nWell, not as many as you would think. They are kind of hard to find, \nespecially if you do not have a car or you can't pay the bus fare to \nget there. But we are going to spend 30 hours talking about 4 people \nwho make a total of a million dollars a year, and we are not going to \nspend 5 minutes on the approximately 9 million people who are out of \nwork in America today. Some people have been unemployed so long they do \nnot even count them on the unemployment rolls anymore.\n  I wonder if it is important that we spend a little bit of time back \nhere talking about education. We know how difficult it is for parents \nto send their kids to college. I have talked about that a little today. \nFor one school, tuition is $41,000 a year.\n  Public education. I think the highest is about $18,000 a year. But it \nis very expensive. In Alabama, I think they are raising the tuition \nthere by 30 or 40 percent to help pay for some of the shortages they \nhave in the State budgets. I wonder if we should spend a little time \ntalking about education. I think it would be a good idea.\n  I have a little school named after me in Nevada. It is a small school \nin Searchlight. I am proud to have that school named after me. It is a \nbetter school than the one I went to, at least physically. Where I went \nto school, it was a little different than now. But that little school \nneeds a lot of additional things they do not have there. It is part of \nthe very large Clark County School District. The Clark County School \nDistrict, as I said, has about 270,000 students. They are fighting to \nbuild new schools, hire new teachers. Last year, they had to hire about \n3,000 teachers just to keep up with growth.\n  Figure that out: Hire 3,000 new teachers. That is very hard to do. \nThat is only 1 county out of the 17 counties in Nevada. Shouldn't we \nspend a little\n\n[[Page S14299]]\n\ntime talking about school, about education? Shouldn't we talk about \nwhat helps our public educational system instead of tearing down our \npublic educational system?\n  I don't know about how other people feel. But for me personally, \nother than my immediate family, the most important people in my life \nhave been my teachers. They have altered the way that I think. They \nhave changed who I am. Why did I go to law school? There was no lawyer \nin Searchlight, of course; none in Henderson where I graduated high \nschool. I went to law school because of Mrs. Robinson, a part-time \ncounselor and part-time government teacher who pulled me out of class \nwhen I was in junior high school. She said: We have looked over all \nyour grades and all your aptitude tests. You should go to law school.\n  That was it for me. Mrs. Robinson told me I should go to law school, \nand I was headed for law school. That was it. I was going to become a \nlawyer. I had never been to a courthouse, never met a lawyer. But she \ntold me I should go to law school.\n  I feel very strongly about the positive nature of our public \neducational system. I think we belittle teachers far too much. Teachers \nare so important. We have to give them better tools with which to \nteach. We need to build smaller schools. I called Bill Gates about a \nmonth ago. Bill Gates gave a very large grant to New York's public \nschool system. The reason I called him is because he is getting it \nright. His money is only going for the development of small schools.\n  The problem in America today is not large school districts; it is \nlarge schools. Clark County is an example. We have several high schools \nthat are about 5,000 students large. Why do they build large schools? \nBecause they are cheaper to build.\n  We know the learning environment in a very large school is extremely \ndifficult. We need to come up with some way of having school districts \nbuild smaller schools. It has worked before. One of the leading \nadvocates of small schools in America is a woman named Deborah Meyer. \nShe did wonderful things in New York. Bill Gates, as I said, is a very \ngenerous man, and he is spending some of his great wealth in making \nkids' lives better. He will do that with the smaller schools he is \nhelping to build, to develop. That is so important.\n  There are areas in this bill that deal with education in many \ndifferent ways, grants to different educational institutions, things of \nthat nature, that certainly help what we do with education in America \ntoday. As a result, it is important we talk about that.\n  This bill probably needs to be talked about a little more anyway. It \nhas wonderful people on the committee, the subcommittee. There is \ntremendous work that is done. As I indicated, the bill covers many \ndifferent areas. I talked about some of them.\n  When we talk about education, one of things this bill deals with is \nthe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which is so important. The \nwhole section we have been dealing with in the Justice Department is \nextremely important in this bill. I haven't talked about it, but the \nAntitrust Division is so important.\n  I know my friends in the insurance industry won't like this, but \ntalking about antitrust, I think one of the areas that needs to be \nchanged and we need to deal with in legislation is to have the \ninsurance industry subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act. Most people \ndon't realize that the only area other than professional major league \nbaseball that is not subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act is insurance. \nThat came about during the Depression by Nevada Senator McCarran and a \nman from Alabama, Ferguson. They said that things were bad during the \nDepression and that insurance companies should be able to meet and--\nthis is my word, not theirs--conspire, be able to fix prices and not be \nsubject to the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\n  That has been the law for almost 70 years. It is not a good law. \nInsurance should be no different than any other business. They should \nbe subject to antitrust laws. They could live within the confines of \nthat law just like other businesses do. There is no reason the \ninsurance industry is not part of regular American commerce. They \nshould be subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act. That is why in this \nbill, in the Antitrust Division, there is a huge amount of money spent \nthere. This year it will be about $142 million. That is a ton of money. \nIt is for a good cause. But I wish that the insurance industry was \nsubject to the antitrust laws of the country.\n  This bill funds, for example, the national census. The census is \ncritical to assuring taxpayer dollars are distributed fairly in Federal \nprograms. This is so important to Nevada because, as I have already \ndiscussed, it is a rapidly growing State. Because we are a rapidly \ngrowing State, if you don't change the numbers that you base Federal \nprogram assistance on, you don't do it until 10 years has gone by, we \nsuffer greatly. The State of Nevada is the fastest growing State in the \nUnion. The census figures are important to us. But we wish they would \nbe reviewed more often than what they are.\n  The condition of many public schools is dismal. We have a high \ndropout rate in Nevada, one of the highest in the country, one of the \nlowest graduation rates. This is nothing I am proud of, but it is a \nfact of life. We need to be working on this. And we don't do well in \nnational reading, writing, and math tests. Per pupil, Nevada spends \nless money on students than all other programs. Why? Because we spend \nso much money building schools.\n  The former superintendent of schools, a wonderful man who was \nsuperintendent of schools for many years, said he was more of a \nconstruction superintendent than an education superintendent. That is \nthe way the new superintendent is. Carlos Garcia, the new \nsuperintendent of schools, spends far more time in construction-related \nproblems than he does in education because he has to build more than a \nnew school every month.\n  So there is no easy way to fix the problems facing Nevada schools, \nexcept help us with school construction. We need it and other States \ndo. Schools are primarily the responsibility of individual States. We \nknow that. There is only so much the Federal Government can do to help, \nbut the education of our children must remain one of our top priorities \nbecause they are the future of this country. We have to give them the \ntools they need to succeed. We have tried to do that with Leave No \nChild Behind.\n  I believe many of Nevada's problems stem from the fact its high \ngrowth rates prevent it from receiving its fair share of Federal \neducation funding.\n  Nevada, and Las Vegas in particular, has the fastest growing \npopulation in the entire Nation. As a result, we find ourselves in a \nnever-ending race to fund the growing demands for education. That is \nwhy the legislation this bill deals with, the census, is so important \nto us. Our schools struggle each year to make room for new students. \nDespite all this, Nevada is last in Federal per-pupil funding. It is \nbecause of the cost of building new buildings.\n  A recent Las Vegas Review Journal article makes a comparison between \nLas Vegas and Buffalo, NY.\n  According to the article, Buffalo received about $716 in low-income \ntitle I funding per child, while Las Vegas received $454. Why? It was \ndistributed, despite the fact that Buffalo loses about 2,000 students \nper year, while Las Vegas had to build more than a dozen new schools \nlast year to make up for growth. Those schools are too big, as I have \nalready indicated.\n  I want to reiterate that the high growth problem is unique to Nevada. \nBut it is interesting, schools in other States also face budget \nrestraints for high population rates. Despite the rapid growth, the \nCensus Bureau does not use statistics to reflect that expansion. The \nformulas that allocate Federal education dollars usually don't factor \nhigh growth rates into the calculations. So schools in Nevada and \nelsewhere are challenged even under the best fiscal conditions.\n  One can imagine how difficult the situation is in a time of record \nFederal and State budget deficits like we have experienced. All States \ndeserve their fair share of Federal education dollars. It is an issue \nof fundamental fairness. I hope we will address the problem of \nproportional funding in a comprehensive manner the next time we revisit \nthe No Child Left Behind Act, and I hope that is soon.\n  In the meantime, I hope we can correct a similar flaw in the way we \nfund\n\n[[Page S14300]]\n\nHead Start. Throughout its 38-year history, Head Start has helped put \nmillions of at-risk children on a path to success, giving them the \nsocial and academic skills they need to succeed in elementary school. \nIt is a text book example of a Federal program that has worked. Really, \nMr. President, it is a holistic approach. This holistic approach \naddresses many of the underlying causes of poor academic performance by \nproviding medical services and guidance for parents of at-risk \nchildren. But State budget crises have placed Head Start programs under \nsiege, along with all other aspects of public education, and programs \nin high growth States are among the hardest hit.\n  That is why I introduced the High-Growth Head Start Assistance Act \nalong with Senator Ensign. That bill would reward high-growth States, \nsuch as Nevada, for the commitment to Head Start by ensuring that \nprograms in their State receive their fair share of Federal funds. \nCongresswoman Berkley introduced a similar bill in the House. I applaud \nher for her leadership on this issue.\n  This bill would make a difference in the lives of thousands of at-\nrisk children in Nevada and across the country, and it would address \nthe problem of inadequate census data. Most important, it represents a \nsmall but significant step forward, fulfilling the promise we made 2 \nyears ago to leave no child behind; and in those 2 years, we have left \nlots of them behind.\n  As we continue consideration of the Commerce-State-Justice bill, the \nbill which funds our census, it is critically important to keep in mind \nthe impact this small program has on the fundamental fairness of other \nimportant programs like education.\n  Mr. President, one of the things that I want to talk about is what \nhas not been done in this legislation as it represents tribal trust \nfund litigation. This bill provides $3.06 million for tribal trust fund \nlitigation. But it also directs the Department of Justice to seek \nreimbursement of these funds from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  As we consider this bill, it is important to remember how and why \nthese litigation expenses have been incurred--and the injustice done to \nNative Americans.\n\n  Filed over 10 years ago was Cobell v. Norton, a class action lawsuit \nin the district court in Washington, DC, to require the Federal \nGovernment to account for billions of dollars that belong to \napproximately 300,000 American Indians that has been held in trust \nsince 1887.\n  On September 25, 2003, the U.S. district court, Judge Royce Lambert, \nruled that the Government breached its trust obligations and has \ndirected the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a full accounting of \nthe trust money.\n  The U.S. has spent nearly $1 billion on this case.\n  There is no argument that the U.S. Government failed the Indian \npeople in managing this trust in a debacle that has spanned more than \n100 years.\n  Nobody disagrees that at least $13 billion has been generated from \nIndian lands for the life of these trusts--without interest. That is a \nhuge number. At least $13 billion has been generated from Indian lands \nfor the life of these trusts--with no interest.\n  Yet none of this money has ever been accounted for by the Department \nof the Interior.\n  We don't know how much of this money has reached the beneficiaries. \nWe don't know how much money shall be allocated to each beneficiary. \nBut we do know that we have obtained this extraordinary resource from \nthe Nation's American Indians, without an accounting.\n  Moreover, in the Department of the Interior appropriations bill, \nlanguage has been attached that will stop the accounting of these \nfunds.\n  As Senator Daschle stated on the floor during consideration of the \nInterior appropriations bill, the rider in place tells the court how it \nmust construe existing law and denies account holders a full accounting \nof their trust fund moneys and other assets.\n  I don't understand how, in one appropriations bill, our Government \ncan block all litigation of this matter and, in another appropriations \nbill, fund the litigation of this matter. They fund it not within the \nJustice Department, but out of the poor Bureau of Indian Affairs, which \nis broke to begin with.\n  Rather than enacting legislation that is not only unconstitutional, \nbut also will serve to delay an accounting of these trust funds, we \nshould address this in a fair manner. I do believe there are some who \nare doing this only to delay the accounting of these trust funds, and \nfor that reason only.\n  Once tribes have a full accounting of their own trust funds, they \nshould be permitted access to those funds. I have tried to do this for \nthe Western Shoshone people of Nevada in the Western Shoshone \ndistribution bill, which passed out of the Senate earlier last month. \nThis will distribute almost $150 million to the Western Shoshone \npeople.\n  Last year, the Senate unanimously passed this bill that will, at \nlast, release the funds that the U.S. has held in trust for the Western \nShoshone people for almost a quarter century. But the House was unable \nto complete its consideration of the bill before Congress adjourned.\n  Historically, the Western Shoshone people have resided on land within \nthe central portion of Nevada and parts of California, Idaho, and Utah. \nFor more than a hundred years, they have not received fair compensation \nfor the loss to their tribal land and resources.\n\n  In 1946, the Indian Claims Commission was established to compensate \nIndians for lands and resources taken from them by the United States\n  In 1962, the Commission determined that the Western Shoshone land had \nbeen taken through ``gradual encroachment.''\n  In 1977, the Commission awarded the tribe in excess of $26 million. \nThe United States Supreme Court has upheld the Commission's award. It \nwas not until 1979 that the U.S. appropriated over $26 million to \nreimburse the descendants of these tribes for their loss.\n  Like the hundreds of thousands of American Indians who are entangled \nin this accounting mess, the Western Shoshone are not a wealthy people. \nThat is an understatement. A third of the tribal members are \nunemployed--a third. For many of those who have jobs, it is a struggle \nfrom one paycheck to the next. Wood stoves often provide the only \nsource of heat in their aging homes.\n  Like other American Indians, the Western Shoshone continue to be \ndisproportionately affected by poverty and low educational attainment. \nThe high school completion rate of Indian people between the ages of 20 \nand 24 is dismal.\n  The American Indians have a dropout rate of 12.5 percent higher than \nother Americans.\n  For the Western Shoshone, the money contained in the settlement funds \ncould lead to drastic lifestyle improvements.\n  After 24 years, the judgment funds still remained in the U.S. \nTreasury. The Western Shoshone have not received a single penny of the \nmoney--their money. In those 24 years, the original trust fund has \ngrown to well over $144 million.\n  It is long past time that this money should be delivered into the \nhands of its owners. The distribution bill will provide payments to \neligible Western Shoshone tribal members and ensure that future \ngenerations of Western Shoshone will be able to enjoy the benefit of \nthe distribution in perpetuity.\n  Through the establishment of a tribally controlled grant trust fund, \nindividual members of the Western Shoshone will be able to apply for \nmoney for education and other needs within the limits set by a self-\nappointed committee of tribal members.\n  I will continue my ongoing work with the members of the Western \nShoshone and the Department of the Interior to help resolve any current \nland issues.\n  The Western Shoshone have affirmed and reaffirmed their choice to \nhave these funds from their claim distributed without further delay.\n  They have voted twice--and we have voted unanimously twice--they \nvoted 94 percent twice to decisively distribute this money. Members of \nthe Western Shoshone gathered in Fallon and Elko, NV, in May of 1998. \nThey cast a vote overwhelmingly in favor of distributing the funds. \nAgain, about 4 years later they cast a vote overwhelmingly in support \nof the distribution of the judgment funds at a rate of\n\n[[Page S14301]]\n\n100 percent per capita--again, only a handful.\n  The final distribution of this fund has been lingering for many \nyears. I have been assured by the House Members from Nevada that they \nwill do everything within their power to push this bill through the \nHouse. We need it out of the House.\n  The Western Shoshone distribution bill is an example of legislation \nthat--unlike the Indian trust rider that was attached to the Interior \nappropriations bill--will actually benefit American Indians across the \nwhole Nation.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that is before this body is important. \nWhy is the Senator from Nevada spending now about 2\\1/2\\ hours, or \nthereabouts--what time was the bill laid down, by way of parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 1:16 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. It has been 2 hours and 35 minutes or 36 minutes. Mr. \nPresident, in about 25 more minutes we will be past the so-called \nPastore rule. After that, I don't have to talk about the bill. I can \ntalk about the color of the ties. I can talk about the ties in this \nroom. I can talk about the color of people's hair. I can tell how good \nthese court reporters are. I can talk about anything I want. For the \nnext 25 minutes or so, I have to stick with this bill. I am happy to do \nthat.\n  One of the provisions in this bill is global warming. One of the \nagencies funded in this bill is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, or NOAA, as it is called. The bill funds critical \nresearch into climate change or global warming. As we consider this \nbill today, I would like to say a few words about global warming and \nthis administration's stewardship of the environment over the past 2\\1/\n2\\ years.\n  This administration's environmental record has gone from bad to \nworse. The latest bad decision is the rollback of the Clean Air Act \nwhich was enacted under a Republican administration more than 30 years \nago and has improved the air we all breathe. EPA announced several \nmonths ago it is relaxing Clean Air Act requirements to apply to some \nof our aging powerplants. This will result in more pollution and more \ngreenhouse gases contributing to global warming.\n  Then when we thought it couldn't get any worse, just last week we \nlearned that the Environmental Protection Agency is likely to drop a \nnumber of lawsuits in cases involving powerplants that are polluting \nour air and contributing to global warming. Global warming is real.\n  I so admire the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain. Senator \nMcCain and I came to Washington together in 1982. We were freshmen \nMembers of the House of Representatives. I go to the congressional \nprayer breakfast--not all the time; my schedule is as difficult as \neveryone's. I have been to the prayer breakfast in the House and the \nSenate on a number of occasions. I will never forget the prayer \nbreakfast I went to in the House of Representatives which was led by \nJohn McCain. I will never forget the power of that morning.\n  John McCain talked about the first time they were able to get \ntogether and sing Christmas carols. This man spent--I don't know the \nexact time--about 7 years in a concentration camp. The vast majority of \nthat time was in solitary confinement. This is a man who could have \ngotten out early. His father was the commander of the naval operations \nin the area of Vietnam, Admiral McCain.\n  John McCain could have gone early because of his father. They said to \nhim: You can go. He wouldn't leave without the rest of them.\n  He was hurt when his airplane went down. His shoulders were broken \nand a lot of other damage. He was tortured unmercifully. When his \nshoulders healed, they broke them again.\n  I only lay this foundation to show that John McCain is a courageous \nman. As we know, he can be a pain in our side because he doesn't always \ndo what we want him to do, Democrats or Republicans. It doesn't matter \nto me. It does not take away from my admiration of this American hero. \nHe may do things that I think are wrong, but he does things that he \nthinks are right. He never does things that he doesn't believe in, as \ndifficult as they are for the Members of the Senate to sometimes \nunderstand.\n\n  This is a man of great courage and, I have come to learn, of \nintellect. A demonstration to me of the strength of his convictions is \nwhat he has done on global warming. But for John McCain, we would not \nhave debated for 2 days global warming. He forced us to do that. I, of \ncourse, would love to do it. I am on the environment committee. I have \nbeen chairman of that full committee twice.\n  Because of John McCain's leadership, the senior Senator from Arizona \nforced the leadership of this Senate--by the way, he is a Republican--\nhe forced his own leadership to bring this bill to the floor. It \nwouldn't have come to the floor otherwise.\n  John McCain knew that the lobbyists, the big powers--the automobile \nmanufacturers and oil companies--he knew he wouldn't win, but he wasn't \nafraid of a fight because he knows, as I know and the vast majority of \nAmericans know, that global warming is upon us. We saw that with the \ngraphs, charts, and pictures of the icecap shrinking before our eyes. \nWe know. We talked about global warming.\n  I hope the issue is big enough that we should be talking about global \nwarming. I would like to start this coming Wednesday, the day after \ntomorrow, at 6 o'clock and go until midnight on Thursday. The people of \nAmerica would appreciate that more than talking about three judges who \ndidn't get promotions, who are making about $1 million a year, one of \nwhom is making half a million dollars a year. That would not be a bad \nthing to do with our time.\n  John McCain said a few weeks ago when he displayed the dramatic \nphotographs of our planet that all we have to do is believe what we see \nwith our own eyes. As the administration made a bad decision to weaken \nthe Clean Air Act, it has made a disastrous decision to ignore the \nproblems of global warming.\n  I spread all over the record of this Senate my appreciation for the \nwork of Senator John McCain on this issue alone. He is one rung ahead \nof me on seniority. Why? We came at the same time. We had the same \nservice in the House. Why? Because the State of Arizona has more people \nin it than Nevada. That is why he is one notch ahead of me.\n  I have already made very clear how much I admire John McCain and how \nmuch I appreciate his bringing global warming before our eyes. Ignoring \nglobal warming isn't merely a bad decision; it is also a broken promise \nto the other nations of the world and a broken campaign promise to the \nAmericans.\n  The administration talks about the difficulty of reducing greenhouse \ngases, but it isn't even willing to take the easy step of requiring our \nvehicles to be more fuel efficient. We need leadership from the White \nHouse. Reducing fuel efficiency is important. Requiring greater fuel \nefficiency would not only reduce the gases that cause global warming \nbut also help us break our dependence on foreign oil which threatens to \nundermine our national security.\n  When it comes to producing electricity, we need to encourage the \ndevelopment of renewable resources, such as geothermal power, solar \npower, and wind power.\n  After I finished law school and moved back to Nevada, my wife and I \ndecided to take a vacation. It was a wonderful trip. We had our little \nValiant station wagon. We put our two little children in the back seat. \nI am sorry to say in those days there may have been seatbelts there but \npeople did not use them. The kids laid down in the back of the station \nwagon and played around. We would never do that now but we did it then.\n  It was a wonderful, pleasurable trip we took to Yellowstone. I can \nremember lots of it, but what was most impressive to me about \nYellowstone National Park was Old Faithful. A magnificent national \ntreasure is the geyser we call Old Faithful. It was only a few months \nago that I had a chance to go back. It had been many decades--I should \nnot say many decades but it had been decades since I had been there. I \nhad a chance to return to Yellowstone.\n  I only had a part of a day. I was doing something in the Big Sky area \nfor Senator Max Baucus and we had a little downtime. We had a few \nhours. I was asked: Where do you want to go? I want to go see Old \nFaithful.\n  So we went to the geyser farm, as I call it, and it was tremendously \ninteresting again. The geyser erupted a few\n\n[[Page S14302]]\n\ntimes while I was there, spewing thousands of tons of boiling water, 18 \nstories into the air, as high as an 18-story building. It is power. It \nis awesome. But even more impressive than this power is its \nreliability. Since man first set eyes upon Old Faithful, it has erupted \nwithout fail every 90 minutes or so, give or take a few minutes but \nvery close to that. It is a marvel of nature, but it is not an isolated \nphenomenon because it sits among the largest concentration of geysers \nin the world.\n  When we went there this last trip, we took a little stroll. They have \na little wooden path people can walk around in the geyser farm, and it \nwas interesting because the buffalo would come and lay right near one \nof the geysers. We asked the guide who was taking us around, why would \na buffalo walk through these people and lay down by a geyser? The \nreason was it kept the bugs off of him. Whatever insects bother the \nbuffalo, they do not do it around all of that steam and stuff. So it is \na marvel of nature, and they are studying it all the time.\n  Out west, though, we are surrounded by sources of reliable power--\nmighty rivers, the brilliance of the Sun, the force of the wind and the \nheat within the Earth itself. These renewable resources can free us \nforever from energy shortages and unexpected price increases.\n  More importantly, they can produce reliable electricity without \npumping more carbon into the atmosphere, carbon that contributes to \nglobal warming. As Nevada and other States begin to harness their \npower, we are forging a path that the Nation should follow.\n  The geysers that we saw at Yellowstone come from deep within the \nbowels of the Earth. In Nevada, we are fortunate to have not geysers \nbut we have a lot of very hot water that is under the surface of the \nground. During the times of the pioneers, these really became a problem \nuntil people understood what was going on. For example, on one of the \nimmigrant trails that was traversed often, they would leave what is now \nUtah and come across an awfully difficult desert and they would get up \naround the place we now call Gerlach and they would see this beautiful \nwater, big pools of water. The early travelers would rush to that \nlittle pond, that pool of water as big as this circle here that covers \nthe members, the staff and the Presiding Officer, and they would die. \nIt was boiling. It was hot. They were dying of thirst. They would rush \nin and they could not drink it. So they learned, as they had to, as \nSenator McConnell said earlier today; they would have to drain the \nwater from the big pool and let it cool before the animals could drink \nit and the people could drink it.\n\n  We have hot water that goes from Gerlach clear down below Reno to the \nCarson City area and beyond, and we have geothermal power that has \nalready been developed. We are known in Nevada as the Saudi Arabia of \ngeothermal, but the problem is that the tax incentives for geothermal \nand solar simply are not there. It is for wind. Wind is as cheap now to \nproduce as using standard fossil fuels. We hope in this Energy bill \nthat is being worked on that the tax section will allow geothermal and \nsolar to have the tax credit that wind has. If we did that, it could \nchange things dramatically.\n  The President is talking about hydrogen. Hydrogen means nothing if we \ncannot produce it by alternative energy. We have to produce our \nhydrogen fuel by either wind, the Sun, or geothermal. Otherwise, we are \njust burning huge amounts of fossil fuel to take care of a problem that \nwill only create more problems. So in Nevada we are looking forward to \nthe tax incentives so we can cheaply produce electricity.\n  Senator Ensign and I have worked hard to stop the dangerous nuclear \nwaste coming to Nevada, Yucca Mountain. We want the State to be a \nproving ground for renewable energy. Renewable energy is good for \nNevada because it will create jobs and help our consumers. It is good \nfor America because it will slow global warming. The work that is being \nfunded in this appropriations bill includes convincing evidence that \nglobal warming is real. What more is needed is hard for me to \ncomprehend. We have studied too much.\n  We have all heard the story about the frog that is placed in a pot of \nwater. So far, so good. When the water is brought to a boil, the frog \ndoes not know it, so the water keeps getting hot until it scalds him. I \nhope, unlike the frog, we take notice of global warming before it is \ntoo late.\n  Global warming is here. It is not only like the frog, it is like the \nostrich that hides its head in the ground not seeing what is going on \naround it.\n  Before I start another section talking about this bill, I want to \nagain remind everyone what is going on today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). If the Senator would suspend for \na minute, the Senator asked before at what point the bill was laid \ndown. The Chair can now inform the Senator the bill was laid down at \n1:16 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that very much.\n  One of the things I have been concerned about for many years is the \npay of judges in the Federal judiciary. I have had the good fortune of \nsending to Presidents the names of attorneys who are now Federal \njudges--very proud of every one of them. I have worked with Senator \nEnsign, during the time that President Bush has been President, in \nsending judges that Senator Ensign has had me take a look at.\n  We have a fine Federal judiciary in the State of Nevada, those who \nSenator Ensign and I have worked on and those who have come before. I \nthink the thing that concerns me, though, about those judges, they \nshould be paid for. To get the high quality of people we want to be \nFederal judges is not easy. Many people who I went to, Senator Ensign \nwent to, who we thought would be good Federal judges, could not do it \nsimply because they could not afford to do it.\n  This bill provided for the funding for the judiciary. I am pleased \nthat the bill provides a 16\\1/2\\ percent pay increase for judges. That \nhelps make up for the fact that judges have not received and do not \nreceive annual cost-of-living adjustments. The 16.5 percent increase \nhelps to right this wrong.\n\n  I would like to take a few minutes during our consideration of the \nbill to discuss the important issue of judicial pay. Before I came to \nwork in the Congress, I practiced law. I am proud to be a lawyer. I \nhave great respect and appreciation for the law and those involved in \nthe judicial process. The very reason there has been such a great deal \nof debate on Federal judicial nominations is precisely that these \npositions are so important to the administration of a fair and \neffective legal system.\n  The individuals chosen to serve on our Federal bench make lifetime \ncommitments to public service. Increasingly, however, that commitment \ncomes at a fiscal price. In fact, the real pay for these jobs has \ndeclined drastically. The compensation for Federal judges has declined \nby 25 percent in the last three decades.\n  In testimony before the National Commission on the Public Service, \nSupreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer stated that while the real pay for \nFederal trial court and appellate court judges has declined by about 25 \npercent, there has been a 12.4 percent increase in real pay that the \naverage American worker has enjoyed.\n  Justice Breyer also drew attention to the fact that since 1993, when \nCongress last comprehensively revised Federal salary statutes, real \njudicial pay has declined by approximately 10 percent.\n  How can we continue to attract the best of the best when low salaries \nare offered for lifetime tenures? The answer is simple. In order to \ncontinue to attract and retain the most talented men and women to the \nFederal bench, the salaries must be raised. The Founders recognized \nthat Federal judicial compensation was integrally tied to judicial \nindependence.\n  In 1989, Congress linked the salaries of its own Members to senior \nexecutives and to Federal judges. As a result, Federal judges did not \nreceive cost-of-living increases for several years in the 1990s. Some \nof my colleagues may say there is no need to maintain ``inter-branch \npay parity.'' However, there are fundamental differences between our \nrespective branches.\n  While a judge and Congressman may each make the same salary, they do \nnot each face the same financial future. In fact, the Federal bench is \nthreatened by some of the best and brightest choosing to take early \nretirement as they are wooed away by the private sector.\n\n[[Page S14303]]\n\n  Even the Justices of our highest court, the U.S. Supreme Court, make \nfar less than leaders of educational institutions and not-for-profit \norganizations. Salaries of Federal district court judges and deans of \nprestigious law schools used to be competitive with one another. Not \ntoday. Today, according to a survey conducted by U.S. News and World \nReport, the average salary for law school deans is $301,639, about \ntwice as much as we pay our Federal district court judges.\n  I believe the deans of our schools are important but no school--\nHarvard, Yale, Stanford, none of the big name schools, none of the \nsmall schools--less prestigious schools, I should say--none of them has \na dean who is more important than any Federal district court judge, \nnone of them.\n  We pay our judges substantially less than either England or Canada. \nOur Constitution creates lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. \nMany men and women who accept these positions are giving up far more \nlucrative careers. Some suggest we may rely upon our judges' devotion \nto public service to keep them at their posts while we allow their \npurchasing power to dwindle. However, we should rely on their public-\nspiritedness only so far. Although they are aware the salaries are not \nof the level these individuals could demand in the private sector, it \nis only fair that they be adequately compensated.\n  Legislation to increase their salaries and sever them from yearly \ncongressional authorization restores both fairness and the appeal of \npublic service to the Federal judiciary by improving compensation. \nBetter compensation means better quality judges, and quality judges \ninstill greater public confidence in the Federal courts. Raising \nFederal judicial salaries by 16.5 percent and limiting the annual \ncongressional authorization of cost-of-living adjustments for Federal \njudges helps to secure judicial independence.\n  Those who support the increase in compensation for Federal judges \ninclude the American College of Trial Lawyers, the United States \nJudicial Conference, the American Bar Association, the National \nCommission for Public Service, and many others.\n  In an editorial on May 5 of this year, the New York Times wrote:\n\n       The increase is warranted to make up for the erosion in \n     judicial pay caused by inflation and Congress's repeated \n     withholding of cost-of-living adjustments that are supposed \n     to be routine. A report in January by the National Commission \n     on the Public Service, a study group led by Paul Volcker, the \n     former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that the \n     purchasing power of federal judicial salaries had dropped 24 \n     percent since 1969. It said the decline was ``arguably \n     inconsistent with the Constitutional provision that judicial \n     salaries may not be reduced by Congress.'' A year ago, the \n     Supreme Court declined to accept a case raising that issue. \n     But it should not take a lawsuit to persuade members of \n     Congress to treat the judiciary fairly. The government cannot \n     match the salaries offered by big-time law firms. But to \n     recruit and retain quality judges--and for the sake of \n     fairness--Congress needs to provide salaries that bear a \n     reasonable relationship to other professional opportunities. \n     As part of the package, judges should be required to forgo \n     privately financed junkets that cast an ethical cloud on the \n     courts, as Senator Leahy has previously proposed. These are \n     matters that transcend the ongoing partisan battle over \n     President Bush's hard-right judicial nominees.\n\n  As we consider the funding bill for our Judiciary here today, I think \nit is important to highlight the issue of judicial pay.\n  This bill takes an important first step of providing a pay increase \nto make up for the many years that judges received no cost of living \nadjustment.\n  Going the extra step of delinking COLAs from congressional pay would \nbenefit the administration of justice for the judges that serve our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the 3 hours are up. We are no longer bound by the \nPastore rule. I can talk about anything I want to talk about now, but \nthe first thing I want to talk about is the Senate schedule.\n  I participated in a press conference on Friday right upstairs. I \nthought we laid out our case pretty well--Senator Daschle and I and \nSenator Stabenow.\n  We were very concerned about what was going on in the Senate. I \nrepeated, and I will continue to repeat, it seems so unfair that we \nwould work so hard and cooperate so much to make sure that, at this \nstage, 10 of the 13 appropriations bills would pass. That couldn't have \nbeen done without us.\n  We were willing to work to complete the other three within the matter \nof the next few days, and suddenly we are struck with the 30-hour \nperformance that will begin Wednesday at 6 o'clock where we will spend \n30 hours on four people we have turned down; lamenting to you how bad \nthings are in America today because Estrada, Owen, Pickering, and Pryor \nhave been turned down. Isn't that just awful?\n  I was concerned about talking about unemployment, the impoverished, \nthe uninsured, the budget deficit, the national debt, and so we, among \nother things, demanded we be given half of that 30 hours.\n  Since that press conference and the unanimous consent agreement that \nwas entered while I was here in the Chamber, we get half of the 30 \nhours.\n  I think it is foolish that we are spending 30 hours, but we will take \nour half and talk about whatever we feel is appropriate.\n  During the press conference, I said I thought this was the most \namateurish leadership I had seen in my years in Congress. I think name \ncalling does not serve the Senate well. Perhaps this Senator could have \nused terms more descriptive. I didn't want anyone to think we have to \nresort to name calling. I spend a lot of time on this floor, and I \ndon't want anyone to think less of me for name calling. If I offended \nthe Republican leadership--that is, Senator Frist and Senator \nMcConnell--by calling them the most amateurish leadership I have seen \nsince I have been in Congress, I apologize for that. I apologize. They \nknow and I know why I was upset. I try never to let my emotions \noverride my mind, but perhaps it did that day. I have read the news \narticles from all over the country. The press loved ``amateurish,'' the \nword I used. I apologize in front of the Senate and millions of people \nby saying I shouldn't have used that word. I don't want to have to \nresort to name calling.\n  As I have said, I think it is absolutely wrong that Senator Frist \nallows this to go forward. He has his reasons for doing it. I have \ntalked to him. I disagree with those reasons. But please strike from \neveryone's mind the fact that I used the words ``the most amateurish \nleadership'' since I have been in the Congress. I may have thought so \nfor those few minutes I was up there, but it probably wasn't a very \ngood thought.\n  Again, I apologize. I hope I didn't hurt anyone's feelings. I don't \nthink I can say any more than that. I strike that, but everything else \nI said up there was just fine.\n  We have a lot of work to do here.\n  Why am I on the Senate floor today? I repeat I am here to show the \nSenate is a body where we have to work together. We have to work \ntogether. No one can demand that we be here to vote when no one tells \nus when the votes are going to take place or what the votes are going \nto be on. You can't do that. Everything done in the Senate, with rare \nexception, is done by unanimous consent. It means all 100 Senators have \nto say, That is OK, let us go ahead and do that. We spend a lot of time \nhere dealing with individual Senators who do not like when we are going \nto vote, do not like when we begin debates, do not like the makeup of \ncommittees--all kinds of things. Everything has to be done by unanimous \nconsent.\n  I hope when we finish here today people will better understand that \nMembers over here want to work together. We want to be part of good \nthings to happen in the Congress of the United States. But don't take \nus for granted. Don't think we are unimportant. Don't think we can be \npushed around with no say in what goes on around here, because we have \na say in what goes on around here. We can do things like I am doing \ntoday.\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle said, Well, we have \nbeen told we will have a vote or two early and we can go back to our \nparade. People who serve in the western part of the United States can't \ndo that. They can't go home today. Right now, if I left to go back to \nNevada, if I were lucky enough to get a plane--there is one that leaves \nat 5:30--if everything left on time, I could get out there by 7:30 or \n7:45 tonight. Remember, that is a 3-hour time difference. Coming back \nthis way, it is almost impossible. Coming back this way, if you leave \nat noon, it\n\n[[Page S14304]]\n\nis 3 o'clock back here, and you get back here at 8 o'clock at night.\n\n  We need to be a part of what is going to go on. If we are going to \nhave votes on Monday, tell us what the votes are. Somebody can make a \nchoice about whether they want to make that vote or not.\n  Tomorrow is a holiday. It is a legal holiday. We originally thought \nwe were going to work from early in the morning to late at night and \nget our work done around here. But now we don't know. We don't know. We \nhave to debate 30 hours--we have to rest up for that--starting day \nafter tomorrow at 6 o'clock and spend many hours--30, to be exact--\ntalking about the 4 judges who didn't get the job they wanted.\n  There are a few more things we need to talk about. One of the things \nwhich is important is that on Friday, August 29, as most Americans \nstarted a 3-day Labor Day weekend, President George Bush announced he \nwas expanding the United States policy known as the global gag rule \nwhich denies United States family planning funds for foreign \ngovernmental organizations that use their own funds to counsel, \nperform, and advocate abortion. Apparently, the President didn't care \nthe Senate voted just 2 months earlier to overturn this rule.\n  Remember that this wasn't to do abortions but just to educate about \nabortion. The President didn't realize or didn't care the Senate had \nvoted just 2 months earlier to overturn this rule. Despite that vote, \nthe President decided to expand a policy that violates free speech and \nendangers the lives of women around the world.\n  Just days after the President acted to expand this policy, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee reported my amendment to the Commerce-Justice-\nState bill and voted to block the expansion of the global gag rule. \nPrior to the President's action to expand this policy, the gag rule \napplied only to groups that received grants from the United States \nAgency for International Development; that is, their family planning \nprogram.\n  During consideration of the State Department's authorization bill in \nJuly, the Senate debated this policy and determined it is inconsistent \nwith American values of free speech, and we adopted an amendment \noffered by Senator Boxer to rescind the rule. The President acted to \nexpand this policy so it would apply to not just one program at the \nDepartment of State but to all population programs at the State \nDepartment. It is impossible to determine the impact of expansion of \nthe global gag rule at this point in time, but the consequences of the \noriginal policy are well documented. Here are some examples.\n  No. 1, the Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia is the largest \nreproductive provider in Ethiopia. It operates 18 clinics, 24 youth \nservice centers, 671 community-based reproductive care sites, and \nhundreds of other sites for health care services. The global gag rule \nhas cost this group more than half a million dollars and has cut off \nthe supply of condoms and other contraceptives even though abortion is \nillegal in Ethiopia. This group doesn't provide abortion services, but \nbecause the organization does not seek to educate policymakers in the \ncountry about the role unsafe abortion plays in Ethiopia's staggering \nmortality rate, it is unable to agree to the gag rule.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, could I ask my colleague from Nevada to \nyield for the purpose of a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield to my friend for a question as long as the \nquestion doesn't take more than 1 minute and without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I want to first tell my colleague I have been watching \nhim in the other room, and he has been doing a masterful job on the CJS \nbill, and now on what has happened in the first 1,000 days of the Bush \nPresidency.\n  An area of particular concern to me, which I know my colleague has \ntouched on, has been the judges. I simply ask my colleague if he says \nthe judicial vacancies--it is on the chart. I can't read it, but I \nthink it is down from 9 percent to 4.7 percent. He has been around here \na lot longer time than I have. But does my colleague recall a time when \nwe moved so many--knowing his knowledge of the history of the Senate--\njudges so quickly and when any President could have gotten such a high \npercentage of the judges which he has asked for? Does my colleague \nagree with this? He might want to talk about this at some point. He was \ntalking about the gag rule, but I was so interested in what he said on \njudges I wanted to come to the floor.\n\n  It is ridiculous, when 168 of 172 judges have been approved, to call \nthe minority ``obstructionists'' given the record they have. I am \nhearing from many people in New York that we are letting too many \njudges through.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to respond to my friend. I will answer my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from New York, who is the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee that has the burdensome job of weighing the \nmerits and demerits of each of these judges. It is a difficult job.\n  The Senator has sifted pretty hard. There have been 168 judges come \nthrough your subcommittee of the full committee that have been \napproved. I say to my friend, the mystery as far as I am concerned is \nwe are going to spend 30 hours starting Wednesday night and going until \nThursday at midnight on 4 judges who have not been approved by the \nranking member's subcommittee and the full committee.\n  I cannot imagine how we could do better. We have the lowest vacancy \nrate in some 15 years. We have approved, I repeat, 168 judges.\n  My friend is absolutely right. This side of the aisle is being \ncriticized because too many bad judges are getting through. We have \nmade a decision to only take the worst of the worst. That is why we \nstick together on these so well. We do not turn down everybody. We \nturned down less than 2 percent.\n  As I said earlier today, rather than turning down 2 percent, if we \nturn down 1.5 percent of the judges, would that cut the time down for \ntaking away from valuable Senate time to maybe 25 hours? If we cut the \nrate down to 99 percent, maybe they would cut it down to 15 hours. Does \nthis mean the Constitution of the United States says we should approve \nevery judge they give to us? We are the minority. There are 49 of us. \nIt does not take a mathematical scientist to tell you they vote en \nbloc. Once in a while we get a courageous Senator who joins in judges, \nbut that is a rarity.\n  We have under the rules of this body something called cloture. It is \nused all the time. It has been used with judges before. We have used \nvery discriminately, rarely, our ability to block judges. We have done \nit four times. That does not prevent them from getting a vote on the \njudge. They just have to get 60 votes. They have to get 60 votes. They \nhave not been able to do that. That is why they are lamenting these \nfour.\n  I don't know if the Senator from New York was here earlier today when \nI talked about the huge number of unemployed we have in America today, \napproaching 10 million. Wouldn't it be nice if we spent that 30 hours, \nor part of it, talking about the unemployed in America today instead of \nthe 4 people who have good jobs? Miguel Estrada makes over half a \nmillion yearly, the others make about half a million a year. They are \njudges and have jobs. None of them are out of work. Rather than spend \n30 hours on people who have jobs, shouldn't we spend time on people who \ndo not have jobs? Would it not be better that we spend some time \ntalking about minimum wage? I have talked about it a little bit today. \nI had to be careful what I talked about the first 3 hours; it had to be \ndirectly on the bill. As I told the staff earlier, later I may want to \ntalk about the color of the ties and the color of her pretty shoes. We \ncan talk about all kinds of things. Now the rules are that I can talk \nabout anything.\n\n  One of the things that is not just anything is minimum wage. Wouldn't \nit be nice if people who went to work in interstate commerce in \nAmerica, which covers it all, got at least $5.30 an hour, $5.50 an \nhour, or $6 an hour? The rate now is $5.15. They will not give us a \nvote on that. I would hope we could spend part of that 30 hours on \nminimum wage.\n  My friend from Michigan is here. The Senate is a much better place \nnow that we have women in the Senate. I speak from experience. It is a \nmuch better place.\n  Minimum wage is not just employment for a kid flipping hamburgers at \nMcDonald's. Sixty percent of the workers who draw minimum wage are\n\n[[Page S14305]]\n\nwomen, and a majority of the women need that money for their families. \nWould it not be nice if we spent time doing some work for our hard-\nworking people who are doing everything they can to make a living? Most \nof these minimum-wage jobs certainly have no benefits, no pension \nbenefits, they have no medical benefits. They are bad jobs, but they \nare jobs. They are jobs the American people need.\n  It is important we do something that is worth the dignity of the \nSenate. I don't know how the history books will report this. Here we \nare, a country that is staggering in debt. We started off with a \nnational surplus when Clinton left office of over $7 trillion. We have \nnow a debt of $5 trillion. When President Clinton was President the \nlast 3 or 4 years, we were actually spending less money than we were \ntaking in. We were paying down the debt. Now we are building the debt. \nWe will have the largest debt in the history of this country this year, \nthe largest deficit.\n  The percentage of unemployed is going up; poor people, going up; \nuninsured, going up. Everything we should be working on is going up, \nand we should be trying to get these percentages down. But we will not \ntalk about that. We are going to talk about judicial vacancies, which \nare going down. How in the world can people take the Senate seriously \nwhen we have a world that is overcome with pollution, crime, kids \ncannot go to school, public schools are beaten down, old, decrepit, \nteachers need help, we have a war going on in Iraq--I don't know how \nmany were killed over the weekend--and we are going to spend 30 hours \ntalking about 4 people the dastardly Democrats turned down. How could \nthey vote against these people? We are going to spend 30 hours. How is \nhistory going to account for the time we spent on this?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for the purpose of one \nadditional question.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield for a question without losing the floor, and \nif the question exceeds more than 3 minutes I will retake the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Even on the issue of judges, and my colleague is exactly \non point, with all these other problems we have, to talk about four \njudges sounds like a totally misplaced priority. No one puts it better \nthan he.\n  I ask one other question about another point. To solve the problem of \nthe judges, when we are not able to come together, it would seem to me, \nand I ask my good friend from Nevada to comment, it is not that we need \nmore talking. The other side will spend 30 hours talking about this, or \nnow maybe 15 because of my friend from Nevada and his astute \nparliamentary request. Do you think they will say anything new? We have \nheard the arguments over and over and over and over and over and over \nagain. No one is going to be educated about this. We all know their \nviewpoint.\n  It seems to me, and I ask my colleague this question, what we need on \njudges is not more speeches telling us what our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle think--Lord knows we know that. We do not agree, but \nwe know--but, rather, the President and the leaders of the Senate and \nthe Judiciary Committee, sitting down with our side, and asking, Could \nwe come to some agreement on who the judges ought to be? There is the \nconstitutional role of advice and consent which has existed in this \ncountry for a very long time, and I tell the Senator as the ranking \nDemocrat, I am never consulted about judges in New York. By the way, in \nNew York we are filling all the vacancies because we have come to an \nagreement. I do not get every judge I want or even judges who are \nphilosophically exactly like me, but there is some comity and some \nagreement.\n\n  So my question to my colleague is, Doesn't it seem that if they \nreally want to solve the problem on the judges, instead of spending 30 \nhours repeating, ad nauseam, the same arguments we have heard over and \nover and over again, that, rather, they would sit down with us and, in \ngood faith, say: How can we come to some kind of agreement instead of \nwhat they do say: My way or the highway. If you don't give us all 172, \nwe're mad. I ask my colleague that question and yield the floor back to \nhim.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we take an oath right over here, each \none of us. We raise our hand and swear to uphold the Constitution of \nthe United States. I think one of the requirements I have is to advise \nand give consent to the President, as outlined in the Constitution of \nthe United States. I think it would be better for him, but I do not \nunderstand this administration. They just want to jam us on everything.\n  Now, as I said to the ranking member of the committee the Senator \nfrom Vermont, earlier today, I do not like all the judges you guys have \nput out, quite frankly. I do not like some of them, I say through the \nChair to my friend from New York. But I understand it is a winnowing \nprocess, and we have only been asked to respond to the worst of the \nworst.\n  Now, Miguel Estrada, I do not say he is a bad person. All I say is, \nif he wants a job, fill out the job application and give us the \ninformation so we know for whom we are voting. He could be the nicest \nguy in the world. I never met him. I have nothing against him \npersonally. But he would have set a very bad standard for this country \nby just saying: I don't have to answer anything. I don't have to fill \nout this application. Those papers you wanted, no deal. President Bush \nsaid I don't have to answer them. I'm not going to answer them. He \nsaid: I don't have to give you that information--even though they have \nbeen given before, by Bork and others, Civiletti.\n  So I say to my friend, we, in turning down Estrada, Owen, Pryor, and \nPickering, did our constitutional duty in and what we believed were bad \npeople for good jobs. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why we \nshould spend 30 hours talking about those people. As my friend from New \nYork has said, I have heard the speeches--I have been here--about how \nthey have been maltreated, they want an up-or-down vote--even though we \nhad our own judges, and they did not give us up-or-down votes.\n  I read something from the majority leader today--he sends out to a \nlot of people e-mail that I get here, among others--that never has \nthere been a filibuster of a Federal judge before. Absolutely false. \nWhoever gives the majority leader that information should be \nembarrassed because it is simply not true. I have been on the Senate \nfloor when there have been filibusters. We had cloture motions filed, \nand we voted on them.\n  So we are going to go through this deal on Wednesday and into \nThursday--a waste of valuable time that we could be spending on these \nthings that are going up that should have been going down, such as the \nuninsured.\n  In my first elective job--I was first a city attorney, and that was \nan appointed job. Many years ago, my first elected job, in 1966, was to \nbe on the board of trustees of the then-largest hospital district in \nNevada, Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital. Now it is a teaching \nhospital. It was not then.\n\n  At that time I learned a lot about people who had no insurance. It \nwas difficult. It is so much worse today. Forty-four million people \nhave no health insurance, and we are not spending time talking about \nthat. It is a serious problem.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield in just 1 minute.\n  The poor: America should not be proud of the fact that, as we speak, \nthe rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. I have \nnothing against rich people. Before I came back here some would say I \nwas rich. I have spent all my money. I don't have much anymore. But I \nhave nothing against rich people. I think it is fine to be rich. But we \nalso have an obligation, as a nation, to do something to take care of \npeople who are poor through no reason of their own.\n  The homeless: I left my home today in downtown Washington, and I went \nout for my morning run. Every morning I go by there, and here are these \nmen, and sometimes women. They are asleep--and they are not asleep, I \nam sure; they are just waiting for the day to go by as quickly as it \ncan. They are poor people. They have no place to sleep. On occasion I \nsee them roll up their sleeping bags and climb into a car and drive \noff.\n  Shouldn't we have some time spent on the Senate floor dealing with \nthose people who are sleeping in the Nation's Capital? There are poor \npeople who are unemployed.\n\n[[Page S14306]]\n\n  I spent a lot of time here today talking about the unemployed. I \ntalked about a program called Nevada Partners, where they work with \npeople who have never had a job--never had a job. There are lots of \npeople who are not kids who are in their thirties and their forties who \nhave never had a job. They can be trained to work. This organization \nhas had over an 80-percent success rate. They train them, they put them \nout on the Strip where they have good jobs. They have benefits.\n  But shouldn't we be spending some time dealing with the unemployed, \nhow we can have more programs like Nevada Partners? It would never have \nstarted but for the largess of Kirk Kerkorian, a very wealthy man who \nwanted to start a program. Then the Government took it over.\n  Wouldn't it be nice if we spent some time on the budget deficit or \nthe national debt and everything that is shown going up on this chart \nthat we should be talking about? But we are going to talk about \nsomething that is going down, judicial vacancies.\n  So I would be happy to yield to my friend from Michigan for a \nquestion only, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much, I say to my friend and colleague \nand our leader from Nevada.\n  Before asking a question, I first want to rise on behalf of the \npeople of Michigan to thank you today for coming to this floor and \nspeaking about what is most important to the people I represent.\n  As you have said so eloquently, this 30 hours we are going to be \ndoing is about four people who already have jobs who want to be \npromoted.\n  Well, in Michigan, we, right now, have over 263,000 people without \njobs. They are not up for promotions. They do not have work at all \nbecause of, primarily, the loss of manufacturing jobs. They are \ngrateful, as I am, that you have come to the floor to speak about this.\n\n  I want to just share with you today a few headlines from the papers. \nI have been traveling around northern Michigan this last weekend, and \neverywhere I go--Baldwin, MI, Reed City, Lake City--all around the \nState I hear the same thing about the loss of furniture makers, the \nloss of tool and die makers, the loss of other auto suppliers.\n  Here we have a headline from the Grand Rapids Press: ``2,700 Jobs in \nDanger as Electrolux Considers Closing Greenville Refrigerator Plant.'' \nThe Holland Sentinel: ``Ford Sets Timetable for Plant Closings.'' Also, \nGM is laying off one shift in Lansing, my hometown.\n  Here is another headline: ``Straits Steel Closing Sad News for \nPlant's 180 Employees.'' From the Ann Arbor news: ``Eaton Plant to \nBecome Condos.'' From the Lansing State Journal: ``Jobless Rate Could \nRise in Winter.''\n  I ask my friend, as we look at what is happening, and as they talk \nabout the change in the growth and the positive indicators in the \neconomy, isn't it true that we are not seeing new jobs created? In many \nStates, such as mine, we are seeing the best paying jobs, manufacturing \njobs, evaporating for many different reasons? And isn't that something \nwe should be talking about on the floor of the Senate, the loss of \nmanufacturing jobs?\n  They cannot just all be in the service industry. We need to make \nthings in this country.\n  That is what I do. That is what people in my State do very well, and \nthey want to continue. Wouldn't my friend say we should be talking \nabout the loss of manufacturing jobs and the people and the families?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. I talked about the State \nof Michigan earlier today. I talked about my having asked you a \nquestion last week, and you responded that 9 million people live in the \ngreat State of Michigan. A quarter of 1 million people are out of work \nthat we know of. Those are the people who are still carried on the \nunemployment rolls. There are probably 150,000 more who have been on so \nlong they are not even counted on the rolls. The Senator is absolutely \nright.\n  I finalize my answer to the Senator's question by referring to a \nletter I received from a woman today from Elko County, NV, a place \ncalled Spring Creek.\n  She wrote that she would work a part-time job or two part-time jobs. \nShe would do anything she could. She has a desperate situation at home. \nShe has a husband who is disabled. He can't move. For every job that \nopens, 50 people apply for the job. She ends her letter to the \nPresident and me by saying:\n\n       Gentleman. This is the greatest country in the world. The \n     middle class needs a break. I don't want a free ride. I just \n     want a job or jobs that will supply the basic needs of our \n     family.\n\n  That is all that people are asking. They want a job to take care of \ntheir families. I am at a loss. I am concerned. What are we doing here, \nspending 30 hours talking about four people who have jobs, when we have \nmillions, we are approaching 10 million people who don't have jobs? We \nhave millions of people who are not even counted on the rolls anymore \nbecause they have been out of work so long.\n  As I established earlier today, the average person is out of work in \nAmerica today 5 months. If you lose a job, unless you are real lucky, \nyou are not going to find another job until December, January, \nFebruary, March, April--if you are lucky. That is the average. But you \nmay have to wait until August or, if you get lucky, you might get one \nin February.\n  The point is, why can't we spend time on jobs for people who count, \nnot the four, the big four, so to speak, we are going to spend 30 hours \non?\n  The Senator from Michigan has read the press just as I have: This is \nsomething we have to do. We have to have the Senate be the Senate.\n  What does that mean? Does that mean we have to approve every judge \nwho comes through? If we do that, if we are good boys and girls over \nhere, they will let us go home at night or maybe let us spend a little \nbit of time talking about the environment. Do you ever think we might \nwant to talk about the environment?\n  You know the Clean Water Act came to be not because somebody got a \nbright idea: Wouldn't it be great to have a Clean Water Act. It came to \nbe because the Cayuga River in Ohio kept catching fire, a river kept \nburning. It was so polluted, it burned. President Nixon and others \nsaid: Well, you know--I don't know if he said this, but I am sure they \nthought it--I don't think that is a good idea to have rivers on fire. \nMaybe there is something wrong. And we passed the Clean Water Act. A \nRepublican President, Democratic Congress, we passed the Clean Water \nAct. Why? Because rivers were on fire.\n\n  Wouldn't it be nice if we spent a little time on the environment? \nPollution is causing kids all across America to have respiratory \nproblems. Asthma is something that kids get. It is something that was \nrarely heard of in children. Now a lot of them have asthma and all \nkinds of respiratory problems. I would like to talk about the \nenvironment. Maybe not for 30 hours but a few hours would be nice if we \nhad a debate here on that.\n  Of course unemployment, we need to talk about that. I appreciate very \nmuch the Senator from Michigan being as diligent as she is. I have \ntalked a lot today about the minimum wage. Let me give you a few facts \nabout that.\n  Three million more Americans are in poverty today than when President \nBush took office. We are not talking about a few people; 3 million more \npeople have gone into poverty than live in the State of Nevada in the \nlast 3 years. The State of Nevada, if you stretch it, could get up to \nmaybe 2.4 or 2.5 million people. More people than live in the State of \nNevada have gone into poverty in the last 3 years. Is that something on \nwhich we should spend a few minutes?\n  Why is there so much poverty? What is going on? Why is the middle \nclass shrinking? And the rich, that class is getting bigger and bigger \nand the poor are growing bigger and bigger. The middle class is going \naway. Today more than 34 million people live in poverty. Of that, 12 \nmillion are children, babies.\n  I remember, I wasn't raised with a lot of material things, but I was \nnever hungry. I always had plenty to eat. I can remember in the little \ntown of Searchlight, one of my friends--I don't know how old we were, \nmaybe 11, I think that is about right--was hungry. I never had seen \nanything like this before. There was a refrigerator. He went into the \nrefrigerator and there was nothing there except a bottle of syrup. And \nthere was hardly anything in the bottle. So he went to the sink and\n\n[[Page S14307]]\n\nshook that up and drank that. That kid was hungry. There was nothing in \nthe refrigerator. He shook up that little bit of syrup and he drank it. \nAnd I am sure it gave him a little bit of energy.\n  But 34 million people live in poverty, 12 million children. Some of \nthose kids are like my friend was, who had nothing to eat and drank a \nbottle of weakened syrup. It was not Vermont pure maple, I will tell \nyou that.\n  Among full-time, year-round workers, poverty has doubled since the \n1970s, from about 1.3 million, and now we have an unacceptably low \nminimum wage as part of the problem. The minimum-wage employees work 40 \nhours a week, 52 weeks a year, earn $10,700 a year--more than $4,500 \nbelow the poverty line for a family of three. And we can't get on this \nfloor even to debate the minimum wage. They won't let us. They stop us.\n  No, we are not going to talk about the minimum wage. We are more \nworried about tax cuts for the elite of this country. We can spend a \nlot of time talking about tax cuts for the elite, what we can do to \nmake things better for rich people.\n  But poor people, people who live on the minimum wage--if a person \nworks 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year of course, they are not getting \nany vacation time--they make less than $11,000 a year. It is below the \npoverty line, $4,500 below the poverty line. The current minimum wage \nfails to provide enough income to enable minimum-wage workers to afford \nadequate housing any place in the country. Every day the minimum wage \nis not increased, it continues to lose value and workers fall further \nand further and further behind.\n\n  Minimum-wage workers have already lost all the gains of the 1997 \nincrease. When we raised it, we didn't raise it enough to keep up with \npast problems. I think it is interesting to note the real value of the \nminimum wage is more than $3 below what it was in 1968. So whatever the \nminimum wage was in 1968, we are $3 below that.\n  The minimum wage today should be $8.15 to have the purchasing power \nit had in 1968. It is $5.15. Nearly 7 million workers would directly \nbenefit from our proposed minimum-wage increase. And listen to who \nthese workers are: 35 percent are their family's sole earner; 62 \npercent are women; one-third of these women, that is the money they get \nfor the kids and them, that is all they have; 16 percent are African \nAmericans; 19 percent are Hispanic Americans. A $1.15 increase for a \nfull-time, year-round worker would add $3,000 to their income.\n  A gain of $3,000 would have an enormous impact on minimum-wage \nworkers and families, even though it still wouldn't give them the \nbuying power they had in 1968. It would be enough money for a low-\nincome family of three to buy 11 months of groceries, 7 months of rent, \n14\\1/2\\ months of utilities, and maybe, maybe send one of the kids to \nschool at a community college.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will without my losing my right to the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Just one more question for my friend. I thank the \nSenator again very much for laying out what we ought to be doing, our \npriorities, all of our debates about values and priorities. The Senator \nhas certainly laid out what the values and priorities should be for our \nfocus of time. As you were reading the list of items, I was thinking \nabout that mom on minimum wage who is caring for her children. She \nprobably has sleepless nights hoping they won't get sick because she is \nprobably not covered for health insurance either.\n  As we look at the number of people in the country and in my State who \nhave lost their jobs, and the number of people on minimum wage, they \nare not just losing a job; in most cases, they are losing their health \ncare as well.\n  In Michigan now, one out of four people under the age of 65 has no \nhealth care. Many, as the Senator has talked about, are low-income \npeople; but many of them are high-income manufacturing workers who have \nlost their jobs.\n  Would the Senator not agree that what we are seeing now, when people \nlose their jobs, is not just the loss of the income but a loss of the \nstability of the families and the ability to care for the health of the \nfamily because their health insurance is gone as well? Should we not be \ntalking about what is happening in this country in terms of those who \nhave no health insurance or the businesses that are trying to pay for \nthe health insurance?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I tell my friend that I read the list of \nhundreds of companies today that, in the last few months, have laid off \npeople. With rare exception, every one of those jobs is a job where \nthey had health insurance. They are thrown off the rolls because \nCOBRA--that means you can buy the insurance, but they don't have the \nmoney to do that. So what happens is they go to an emergency room, \nwhich is the highest cost of care in America. That is where they are \nforced to go. It is a scandal and an embarrassment that we don't do \nmore to help solve the health insurance crisis we have in America.\n  Wouldn't it be nice, I say to anybody within the sound of my voice, \nif we had a debate on the Senate floor about health insurance? Why do \nwe have 44 million people with no health insurance? That number is \ngoing up. Every day, that number is going up. The first thousand days \nof the Bush administration should not be days he looks at proudly.\n  One of the very important issues we have to deal with--I have not \ntalked about it at all today--is, What are we going to do about \nprescription drugs?\n  I am very fortunate. We in the Senate have a good health insurance \nplan. My wife asked me today, when I came to work, if I would call \nGrubbs Pharmacy--which is on the Hill, and they are very good to work \nwith--if I would call her Las Vegas physician and have him call Grubbs \nfor a couple of prescriptions she needs. We have the money to do that. \nThere wasn't a question of whether we could afford it. I am in a \nposition where we have health insurance.\n  Most people in America don't have that luxury. Prescription drugs for \nthe elderly and for working-class Americans is very difficult. I want \nto say before my friend leaves, no one out of the 535 Members of \nCongress--I hope everybody in Michigan knows this--leadership or \nnonleadership, has worked as hard and been more devoted to trying to \nfind a solution to the problem of prescription drugs than the junior \nSenator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow. She understands the issue. She \nworks hard on the issue. Wouldn't it be nice if, next Wednesday at 6 \no'clock, we had a debate between the junior Senator from Michigan and \nanybody who wants on the other side? You would win the debate hands \ndown. This is an issue we would be happy to debate. Let's take that \ntime and start talking about prescription drugs. Why can we not do \nthat--not only for seniors within the confines of Medicare but do \nsomething for everybody?\n\n  So we should be, as an institution, somewhat concerned--as busy as we \nare--with the issues about which we have talked. We have so many \ndifferent things about which to talk. We have veterans. I have not \nspent time today talking about veterans. Tomorrow I will spend some \ntime talking about veterans because they deserve some attention, too.\n  Are we going to talk about veterans on Wednesday at 6 o'clock? Not \none word. In fact, Miguel Estrada--and it would not make any \ndifference--is not a veteran. I don't see Pryor's service record, and \nthe two women have not been in the military. So we are talking about \nfour people, as far as I know, with no military experience. We are not \ngoing to spend any of the time talking about them from 6 o'clock on \nWednesday until 12 o'clock Thursday.\n  Maybe we should talk about veterans a little bit or about emergency \ndisaster assistance or about homeland security or education for at-risk \nchildren. We have not talked about pensions. We need to talk about the \nEqual Rights and Equal Dignity for Americans Act. That is important. It \naffects millions of people. There is plenty we need to talk about that \nwill not be allowed to proceed, and we should not be bogged down by 30 \nhours, covering Wednesday night and all day Thursday into Thursday \nnight, talking about Estrada, who was treated so badly--oh, out of the \n30 hours, we will give him 25 percent of the time; we will spend 25 \npercent of the 30 hours on Owen from Texas; and then we will spend some \ntime on Pickering because we should do that--he is entitled to 25 \npercent of the 30 hours--\n\n[[Page S14308]]\n\nand then, of course, we can wrap it up by spending the rest of the time \non the attorney general of Alabama, recognizing that every one of these \npeople has a good job.\n  So we are going to talk for 30 hours about people who have jobs--four \npeople. We are not spending 30 seconds on the 9 million-plus Americans \nwho have no jobs. We are not spending 30 seconds on the 44 million \nAmericans who have no health insurance. We are not talking about the \nmillions who are going into poverty as we speak, about the people I \nread about on the charts who are losing jobs now, as we speak. As we \nspeak, decisions are being made to lay people off in America. And then \nwe have the budget deficit and the national debt. That is what we \nshould be doing. But no, we are not going to do that.\n  Finally, Mr. President, completing my statement for minimum wage, I \nindicated that if we gave a $1.50 an hour increase, we could give a \nfamily of three 11 months of groceries, 7 months of rent, 14\\1/2\\ \nmonths of utilities, and they could even pay tuition for most community \ncolleges.\n  History shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative \nimpact on jobs, employment, or inflation. In the 4 years after the last \nminimum-wage increase was passed, the economy experienced the strongest \ngrowth in more than 30 years. Nearly 11 million new jobs were added at \na pace of 218,000 a month. There were 6 million new service and \nindustrial jobs and a half a million retail jobs.\n  A fair increase is long overdue. Congress should act quickly to pass \na minimum-wage increase to reflect the losses suffered as a result of \nthe shameful inaction of the past. No one who works for a living should \nhave to live in poverty.\n  Mr. President, we, as Members of the Senate, are always concerned \nabout the schedule.\n  (Mr. CORNYN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. I am sure the Senator from Texas, in the few years he has \nbeen in the Senate, has asked his leadership a hundred times: When are \nwe going to vote? What is the vote going to be on? People who have been \nhere longer have asked thousands of times.\n  It is very important that Senators have some idea of what their \nschedule is going to be. It is very important that the minority be part \nof setting that schedule. There are certain rules of courtesy and \nfairness that need to be followed in the Senate. When we learn over \nhere that out of nowhere--we read it in the paper, that is where we \nfirst read it, that they, the majority, were going to spend 30 hours--\n30 hours talking about four people who haven't gotten their jobs. It \ncouldn't be anything else. They are the ones who didn't get their jobs. \nWe approved everyone else. They say: We want to talk about other \nthings. I don't know what else they can ask for. We have four people \nwho didn't get their jobs--four people.\n  I assume tonight before we go out they will file cloture on a couple \nmore judges. We can vote on a couple more on Wednesday. I assume that \nis possible also, if we want to spend more time on judges and not on \nappropriations bills. Maybe by the time Wednesday comes, instead of 4, \nit will be 5 out of 168, or 6 out of 168.\n  I really am at a loss to understand why things have to go the way \nthey are. Why we are going to spend all this valuable time talking \nabout people who are fully employed?\n  There are many important provisions in this Commerce-Justice-State \nlegislation. It is an important bill. I know how important \nappropriations bills are. I have worked very hard on them in the past. \nOne of the items in this bill is the National Endowment for Democracy. \nIt is a great organization. We fund it and its affiliate institutions. \nIt is about the promotion of democracy. I am glad it is funded in this \nbill. They have been growing very well, very strong for 20 years now, \nconducting important work to support fledgling democracies across the \nworld.\n  As many people know--I refer to the National Endowment for Democracy \nas NED--NED has four affiliate institutions: the Free Trade Union \nInstitute, the Center for International Private Enterprise, the \nNational Republican Institute, and the National Democratic Institute. I \nam most familiar with the National Democratic Institute for \nInternational Affairs, or NDI. NDI's president, Ken Wollack, and board \nmember, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, have done a \nremarkable job in dozens of countries throughout the world. This \ndoesn't take away from the other three institutes, but I just know more \nabout this institute.\n  I have met with field representatives in Africa, Asia, and the former \nSoviet Union. These individuals are on the front line of a ditch of \nsorts. They are on the front line in the battle of ideas for freedom \nand justice. They generally arrive on scene in the midst of conflict or \njust following some internal revolution, without any kind of fanfare. \nThey go about their important business of providing assistance to civic \nand political leaders helping build political and civic organizations, \nsafeguarding elections, promoting citizen participation, openness and \naccountability in government.\n  There is no doubt the work they carry out on behalf of the American \npeople is absolutely critical to ensuring peace, security, and \ndemocracy, and making sure they are sustainable in some of the toughest \nplaces in strategic hotspots in the world.\n\n  Democracy promotion, whether carried out by NDI, NRI, NED, Peace \nCorps, or any other American, is incredibly important to advancing our \ninterests of freedom and justice across the globe. People deserve to \nlive in freedom. It is an inherent right, but, unfortunately, it is not \na right enjoyed by all. Much work still remains.\n  With this background, I was pleased to hear the President speak last \nweek about the importance of promoting democracy in the Middle East. I \nam sorry, however, his comments came 3 years too late. I am sorry the \nwords of the President are just that, words, because they have not been \nsupported by actions.\n  Indeed, with regard to Iraq, for those of us who voted to support the \nPresident to use force in Iraq--I was one of them--I note I not only \nvoted to support the President last fall, but I voted to support the \nPresident's father in 1990 and 1991. So I am certainly no dove, as you \nwould see, when it comes to military action.\n  One thing we pleaded with the President to do was come up with a plan \nfor postwar Iraq. How would we win this most difficult peace? I always \nsaid we could win the war, but can we win the peace? We were pushed \naside. We were told we would be thrown bouquets as victors, but we have \nbeen thrown bombs as invaders.\n  We were told the Iraq oil revenues would pay for reconstruction. We \nwere told occupation would be short and Iraqis would take over quickly. \nWe were told costing dollars and U.S. lives would not be great. But the \nprice Americans have paid in their national treasure--the sons and \ndaughters--has been huge. Obviously, the financial cost is into the \nhundreds of billions of dollars. I suspect next year we will be asked \nto appropriate even more to rebuild this shattered country.\n  Why would the administration launch the attack without sufficient \nplanning, without regard to development of a civil society, without \nregard to democracy promotion, without regard to our allies? Why do it, \nand then 3 years after the President takes office, 6 months after the \nwar begins, talk about the importance of democracy promotion in the \nMiddle East? If the cart was ever before the horse, this was it.\n  I suppose some would say it is consistent with the view of foreign \npolicy adopted by this administration. In foreign policy, I think it is \nfair to say, you reap what you sow. I am sorry to say that for 3 years, \nthis administration has sown some bad weather.\n  Let's talk about some specifics. Upon taking office, the \nadministration pulled the plug on the Kyoto Treaty, pulled out of the \nABM Treaty, disavowed the International Criminal Court, and cut off the \nengagement the Clinton administration had begun with the Iranians and \nNorth Koreans. Now, of course, we are back to talking with the North \nKoreans, and I am glad. I suspect we will even reverse course and soon \nbe talking again to those young Iranians so interested in democracy. I \nhope so.\n  The President promised to get out of the conflict between the \nIsraelis and the Palestinians, and he did just that. Predictably, \nspiraling violence ensued. It has been the worst that part of the\n\n[[Page S14309]]\n\nworld has ever seen, except when they were in actual war.\n  Something else happened, too, over these last 3 years. Our State \nDepartment, led by one of America's heroes--I really do mean that \nsincerely. Colin Powell is one of the great Americans of our time. But \nhis Department took a back seat to Secretary Rumsfeld and Under \nSecretary Paul Wolfowitz.\n\n  Democracy, public diplomacy, and other so-called soft aspects of our \nforeign policy took a back seat to Pentagon planners. National security \nwas unilaterally, singly, viewed in the prism of the five walls of the \nPentagon. I am sorry Colin Powell, Aid for International Development, \nand nongovernmental organizations, such as the National Endowment for \nDemocracy and others, were not factored into our national security \nequation.\n  Don't get me wrong, I am and have been one of the most vocal \nsupporters of our troops fighting the ongoing war on terror. Sadly, we \nlive in a world where we have to strike at the enemy before they strike \nus. This is not preemption as the administration calls it. This is our \nright and long-understood concepts of self-defense.\n  Nevadans understand this. They are leading the fight on terrorism in \nevery corner of the globe. Our predator fleet, for example, which is \nbased at Indian Springs Air Force Base, which is part of Nellis Air \nForce Base, is one of the most effective tools in the arsenal in the \nwar on terror. Our fighter pilots who are trained at Nellis and Fallon \nare also on the front line of Iraq and Afghanistan. Our National Guard \nis fighting in every major theater of operation.\n  I am proud of what they have done for the freedom and defense of this \ncountry. I couldn't be more proud of our troops, but I have stated I \nalso couldn't be more disappointed with our policymakers.\n  For me, fighting terrorism should have always been a two track \napproach. Track one, of course, is the military track. We need the most \nlethal, agile, sophisticated, well-trained military anyplace in the \nworld, because of the threats we face each day. We have that military \nforce in place. We cannot sit back and wait for the terrorists to hit \nus. When we know where they are and where they are training, we need to \ngo after these terror groups with speed and force.\n  Track two, however, is a nonmilitary approach. It is a track focused \non diplomacy, engagement, leadership, and democratic values. These two \ntracks must run parallel to each other. Concurrently, they must run.\n  Track one deals with the current threats. Track two ensures that new \nthreats do not emerge. It focuses on education, a civil society, \ndemocratic institutions, the rule of law, health care, and other \nfactors that make society strong, so they can reject the extremism of \ntoday; strong so ideals of freedom, equality, and justice becomes the \nfuel that drives the engines of their societies, not hate, not fear, \nand not violence.\n  In the well-reported leak of the Rumsfeld memo a couple of weeks ago, \nhe asked just that question. Secretary Rumsfeld asked: What are we \ndoing to address the input side of the terrorist equation? It is a \nquestion he should have asked. I am glad he asked it. Again, I am sorry \nhe asked it a few years late. But the short answer, Secretary Rumsfeld, \nis that we are doing nothing to address the input side because there is \nno second track to our approach to national security.\n  Young, uneducated, poverty stricken youth continue to flock to the \nmadrassas where they learn to hate and become attracted to violence. So \nwhen the President shows up at the National Endowment for Democracy and \ntalks about the importance of democracy, about the importance of \ndemocracy promotion and democracy development, I say, Mr. President, \nwhere have you been? Why have you waited so long? Why has this not been \na priority of your administration and why was the power of American \nideas not projected as loudly as the power of our military during the \ncourse of this administration? Why has your administration been \ncontrolled by bureaucrats at the Pentagon?\n  Speaking of bureaucrats, we learned last week that Richard Perle, a \nDefense Department adviser, was out in the Middle East last year \nconducting negotiations on behalf of the United States. Under what \nauthority, I do not know. But he was rejecting offers from Iraqi \nauthorities to head off the war.\n  I do not know how serious these offers were but that really is not \nthe issue. The incident reflects the enormous authority played by the \nDefense Department and not the State Department in conducting our \nforeign policy. I hope to be able to ask Secretary Rumsfeld for a full \naccounting of the Perle negotiations and under what authority he was \nacting.\n  Others have already asked that question. I am not sure how a so-\ncalled adviser to the Defense Department, who apparently holds a very \nlucrative consulting contract with defense companies, was negotiating \nmajor foreign policy decisions for the American people. It is \nmysterious and preposterous. At the same time, I hope the Secretary of \nDefense has an explanation.\n  Back to the issue at hand, I do hope the President's speech at the \nNational Endowment of Democracy will be more than just words. He does \nhave 1 year left to prove that there will be action to follow up on \nsweeping rhetoric. No. 1, will he renew the commitment to Afghanistan, \na country teetering on the edge of failure? No. 2, will he become \nengaged at the highest level in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? No. \n3, will he give up some degree of political control in Iraq so NATO can \ntake some of the burden off our troops who are already stretched so \nthin and so the U.N. can come back in and take over some of the \nreconstruction efforts? No. 4, will democracy promotion and civil \nsociety develop? Will it become a central plank of our foreign policy? \nWill we put in the necessary resources in order to make our effort \nsuccessful? Will the President engage our allies again as President \nReagan did, as President Bush, Sr., did?\n\n  This engagement and leadership substantially helped the efforts at \ndemocratization in Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s. It should \nnot be forgotten that the western Europeans, the European Union, NATO, \nand others played such a huge role in these democratization efforts, \nand we did not do it by ourselves. We should not do it by ourselves in \nIraq, either. We cannot. It will not work.\n  So I wait anxiously to see whether there will be action by this \nadministration, action to make democracy a reality, action to make \npeace and security a reality, action that will make Afghanistan, Iraq, \nand other nations teetering on the edge a reality, make them more \nsecure. Talking about democracy will not be enough.\n  Although you have discovered the National Endowment of Democracy 3 \nyears in your administration, Mr. President, I say, better late than \nnever. Let's now see what your administration can do. On this front, \nyou have my full support. I will do everything I can to make this \nPresident's initiative a success.\n  I mention just briefly again how important minimum wage is. People \nwho seek a higher minimum wage, they do not have lobbyists bringing and \ndropping them off in limousines. They do not have the $1,500 suits like \nlobbyists trying to help them. Nobody is trying to help them. The \npeople who seek minimum wage have no lobbyists. They are on their own. \nNo one is paying the huge fees we read about in the newspaper. Some \nlobbyists, on one account, receive hundreds of thousands of dollars a \nmonth. Regardless of how much is being paid, the people on minimum wage \nare paid, who are lobbyists for people on minimum wage? Nobody is a \nlobbyist for them. We are their lobbyists. The 535 Members of Congress \nare their lobbyists. We have to try to help them. We have to try to \nhelp these desperate people who want to work, and we need to make work \nbetter than welfare.\n  I watched a very interesting piece the other evening on 60 Minutes, I \nthink that is what it was--no, it was not. No, it was not. I take that \nback. It was in a movie. It was a movie ``Bowling for Columbine.'' I \nwatched that, and they had the story there about this woman who--a \nnumber of people who were on welfare and they got a job. They had to \ndrive 50 miles one way, 100 miles every day, and how difficult it was \nfor them. Of course, they are minimum-wage jobs. It would be nice if \nthose people I saw depicted in that movie got a little bit of an \nincrease.\n\n[[Page S14310]]\n\n  I have indicated that in Nevada we have about 65,000 people who work \nfor minimum wage. More would work for minimum wage if there were more \njobs. If we increase the minimum wage to $6.65, that will raise it \n$1.50 an hour. This raise would help the economic security of thousands \nof Nevada's low-wage workers.\n\n  A worker earning the minimum wage must work 125 hours per week in \norder to afford a two-bedroom apartment in Nevada. Eight percent of \nNevadans live in poverty. The last raise in the minimum wage did not \nhave a negative effect on Nevada's economy. In fact, after the last \nraise of the minimum wage, Nevada experienced a great economic growth. \nOver 180,000 new jobs were created.\n  While retail is often cited as the industry hit hardest by an \nincrease in the minimum wage, 39,700 new retail jobs were created in \nNevada after we last passed an increase.\n  Additionally, unemployment dropped for 4 years, after we passed an \nincrease, from 5.5 to 4.2. So it is time to set aside the old \nmisconceptions about increasing the minimum wage. Congress should act \nnow to give thousands of Nevadans the raise they deserve.\n  Some people will disagree. They will say, we cannot do that because \nif we do that people will have to be laid off. The facts do not bear \nthat out, but that is what they say. What I say to that is those people \nwho were talking about that have lobbyists. They have lobbyists who are \npushing hard against minimum wage. They are paid large amounts of money \nevery month to make sure nothing pops up on minimum wage.\n  On the other hand, these people who are seeking minimum-wage \nincreases have nobody to help them, other than us, and we need to do \nsomething. We really need to do something to increase minimum wage.\n  Wouldn't it be nice if we had some time to talk about that, to talk \nabout health care? I think it would be worth it to devote a little bit \nof our time to something that is certainly important.\n  We are going to spend our time for the next little bit talking about \njudges, starting, as I said, Wednesday, and then until Thursday night \nat midnight. I think it would be good if we talked a little bit about \nAfghanistan.\n  I read a book by James Michener. I read a lot of his books. He wrote \na book called ``Caravans,'' which was about Afghanistan. That was the \nname of the book, ``Caravans.'' It was a very good book, written in the \ntypical fashion of Michener, where he worked through the different \ngenerations until modern times in Afghanistan. I was struck by what a \ndifficult time that country had always had. It is a country that \ndoesn't have very much in the way of natural resources. Very unlike \nIraq, they don't have oil; very limited amounts of water; it is \nextremely cold; their farm season is short. I would like to spend some \ntime debating this, what more could we do to help?\n  We know the President has made a decision, basically, to protect just \nKabul, the capital. We haven't done much to bring peace to the rest of \nthat country. We should. It could be done. The rest of the country is \nbeing run by warlords. We can't leave Afghanistan again. We did it once \nand that brought about the Taliban. We need to do more than what we \nhave done.\n  I want to talk about a problem that we have in Afghanistan, a serious \nproblem. The CJS bill affects not only the Department of Justice but \nalso the State Department. There is one problem that concerns me \ngreatly that affects both of these Departments, the Department of \nJustice and the State Department. It is a problem that not only has \nserious implications for drug abuse and crime, but also on our \nrelations with other nations in the world. That is the problem of \ncultivating poppies, which are used to produce heroin that finds it way \ninto our cities and poisons our neighborhoods.\n  Heroin is an awful product. I mentioned before on occasion, and I \nwill do it again, when I started practicing law in Nevada we did not \nhave a public defender anyplace in the State--not a Federal public \ndefender, nor any of the counties. As a young lawyer, I was appointed \nby the then-chief justice, David Zenoff, to represent a man by the name \nof Humbert Gregory Torus. He was known as Greg Torus.\n  When I went to see him in the old Clark County jail and looked \nthrough those bars, I was excited because it was my first criminal \nappointment. But as I looked through those bars, I saw a handsome young \nman, about 21, 22 years old--stunningly handsome. He was there on a \ncouple of burglary charges. Why? He was addicted to heroin. He had been \na heroin addict. He came from New York. He had been a heroin addict \nsince he was 16 years old. His IQ was off the charts. It benefited him \nonly in his ability to scheme deviously to get more heroin.\n  As my first criminal appointment, I spent many days of my life \nworking with him. We were able to work out a deal. He got out of jail. \nHe married a beautiful showgirl from Las Vegas, a girl from Ireland \nwith beautiful red hair named Maurine. I haven't talked to her in a \nnumber of years, a beautiful woman. She didn't know what she was \ngetting herself into. But she was forced to deal with a man she loved \nwho was addicted to a poison, a substance called heroin. He would lie, \nhe would cheat, he would steal his own family's money to satisfy his \ncraving for this substance.\n  His wife had a baby while he was in prison. He got out of prison; he \nstole from his family again. I could go on for a long time about this \ntragedy of this man who could have been anything he wanted but for \nheroin as a 16-year-old boy. The last I heard from him, he was in \nprison someplace up in the Northwest. His wife had left, finally \ndivorced him. She even traveled, lived in Carson City so she could be \nnear her husband at the prison up there.\n\n  Heroin is bad. It is a poison. Is poisons our neighborhoods, and \nthere are thousands and thousands of Gregory Torus's in the world. I \nhope he is OK now. I hope he is leading a good life someplace and has \nbeen able to kick that habit. The problem with heroin is very few \npeople can kick the habit. The recidivism for heroin is upwards of 90 \npercent. They cannot kick it. It is a craving they can't overcome. \nThere aren't many old heroin addicts. They are either in prison or \ndead.\n  But heroin comes from a lot of places. One of the places it is coming \nfrom in large quantities now is Afghanistan. The Washington Post ran a \nstory today headlined, ``Afghan Poppies Sprout Again. Production Nears \nRecord Levels, Worrying Anti-Drug Officials.''\n\n       Two years ago, Afghanistan was virtually poppy free. . . . \n     But in recent months . . . opium poppies have made a \n     spectacular comeback, nearly reaching the record-high \n     production levels of the 1990s.\n       According to a crime report released last month by the U.N. \n     Office of Drugs and Crime, Afghan poppies--whose sap was the \n     basis of three-fourths of the opium and heroin consumed \n     illegally abroad--are being grown on 197,000 acres across 28 \n     of the country's 32 provinces. This year the country is \n     expected to produce [almost 4,000 tons] of opium worth about \n     $2.3 billion, which is equal to half of Afghanistan's gross \n     domestic product.\n\n  Afghanistan is not the only place where the cultivation of poppies is \na problem for us. The same thing goes for our southern neighbor with \nwhom we share a 2,000-mile border where economic conditions are \nparticularly bad right now. Desperate people take desperate measures. \nMany people in Mexico are desperate.\n  A few years ago, Mexico seemed on the verge of an economic \nbreakthrough. But today, Mexico's growth rate is half of what it was in \nthe 1990s. More than half of all Mexicans, more than 50 million people, \nhave an annual income of less than $1,400. Almost one-fourth of all \nMexicans have an annual income of about $720, less than $2 a day.\n  There is little hope for these people in the Mexican countryside \nwhere coffee prices have plummeted, where homes and land values are \nfalling because of the badly broken system of private property \nownership. So these desperate people take desperate measures. Maybe \nthey flee to Mexico City for a while, but there is not much hope there, \neither.\n  There is a debate going on in the world of which city is the most \npolluted, Cairo, Egypt, or Mexico City, Mexico. Our Foreign Service \nofficers who serve there are given extra pay because the health \nconditions are so bad in those two cities. Most refugees from the \ncountryside wind up in crowded shanty towns, breathing horrible air, \nliving in filth. Or maybe they remain on the land, but instead of \ngrowing coffee, turn to illegal crop production,\n\n[[Page S14311]]\n\ngrowing either poppies or marijuana, or perhaps they put their lives in \nthe hands of unscrupulous coyotes who promise to lead them across the \ndesert to the land of plenty. If they don't die trying, they reach the \nUnited States where they place an added burden on our security \nofficials and social services.\n  I don't condone illegal immigration. I certainly don't condone \nfarmers growing illegal crops. But I understand desperate people doing \ndesperate things in desperate conditions in Mexico affecting the United \nStates. That is why I sponsored an amendment recently to the State \nDepartment authorization bill that extends a helping hand to our \nneighbor Mexico. It provides $10 million for microcredit lending to \nsmall businesses and for entrepreneurial development aid to small \nfarmers and persons who have been affected by the collapse of coffee \nprices. It calls for programs to support Mexico's private coffee \nownership system which is in dire need of repair.\n  My friend, Senator Ensign, supports this. He says this is what the \nfree enterprise system is all about. I am grateful to all of my \ncolleagues who voted for this amendment. It won't solve these problems \novernight, but we have to start somewhere. Our neighbor needs help. We \ncan't turn a blind eye to our friends in Mexico. This is not a handout; \nit is a commitment to a free-market-based program that will support \nlong-term development and growth in rural areas of Mexico.\n  By extending a hand to our neighbor, we are also keeping our own \nNation strong and keeping it secure. That is what our State Department \nshould be looking at. That is what we need to do.\n  I remind everyone why we are here today. We have been doing very well \nthis year, in spite of the very close makeup of the Senate. We have 51 \nRepublicans and 49 Democrats. Senator Daschle and I said this is not \npayback time. We want to work for the good of this country. These \naren't just words. Look at our record. Our record was recited by the \nmajority whip today, Senator McConnell. We have passed 10 \nappropriations bills this year. As the Presiding Officer knows, in his \nlimited time here--and he is a person who is certainly versed in the \nway we govern. He had a very impressive record before coming here as a \nSenator. As the Senator knows, in the Senate nothing happens unless \nthere is unanimous consent. We all have to agree. On an appropriations \nbill, it is even more than that; you have to have a will to pass these \nbills. People love to offer amendments. They have been stopped from \noffering amendments in which they believe.\n  We have had to work on this side with Senators saying: We need to \nmove these appropriations bills. It is for the good of the country. Let \nus work to move these appropriations bills. What can we do to help move \nthis along?\n  We have worked. There have been many things we could do and many \nthings that we have done to move these appropriations bills along. As a \nresult, we have a great record. We passed 10 appropriations bills. \nSenator Daschle decided--and even though people didn't like it over \nhere--OK, we are going to work on these appropriations bills, and we \nare even going to agree to work today, November 10, and on a national \nlegal holiday. We are going to work Veterans Day. He said and I said \nthat the veterans will understand that. We have the business of the \ncountry to do. Veterans, above all, will understand that.\n  With a little bit of lamenting on our side from some Members saying, \nHow can you do this, it is a national holiday, they followed the \nleadership of Senator Daschle: OK, we will work Monday and Tuesday. \nThen, talk about a sucker punch.\n  The great Houdini got himself out of a lot of binds. He was a small \nman but would let the biggest man in the world hit him right in the \nstomach. No matter how big that man was, Houdini would let him hit him. \nBut Houdini one time stood up and was not prepared to be hit. He was \nhit and it killed him. That was a sucker punch. He didn't know it was \ncoming. That is what happened to us--a sucker punch.\n\n  We didn't know there was a plan to take up the sad plight of four \npeople who are making a half million dollars a year. We are going to \nspend 30 hours of the Senate's time dealing with that. Well, that is \nenough. As I said here on the Senate floor, we turned the other cheek \nand maybe we should have turned it another time, but you can only be \nslapped around so many times. We thought that was a little much after \nhow we have cooperated in an effort to do the business of this country. \nWe agreed to work on November 10, and we even agreed to work on a \nnational holiday, and they are going to spend--the leadership--30 hours \non Estrada, Owen, Pickering, and Pryor when we have, as I have talked \nabout today, approaching 9 million people out of work.\n  Everybody else has heard it. I see my friend from Illinois in the \nChamber. Everything is going up--unemployment, poverty, uninsured, \ndeficit, national debt. Everything is going up. We don't talk about \nthat. We are going to spend 30 hours talking about what is going down--\nthe lowest vacancies in almost 15 years with Federal judges. And we are \ngoing to spend 30 hours talking about four people who have good jobs. \nOne of them makes over half a million dollars. The rest make half a \nmillion dollars. And we are going to spend time on those judges? I \ndon't think that is really fair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield to my friend from Illinois, without losing the \nfloor, for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for bringing this to the attention of \nthe Senate and those who are following this proceeding.\n  Can the Senator from Nevada tell us--apparently there is a belief on \nthe Republican side of the aisle that there is a disproportionate \nnumber of judicial nominees suggested by President Bush who have not \nbeen approved--the number of judges approved for President Bush and how \nmany have been held up here in the Senate as of this time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that is something that is easy to answer. We \nhave approved 168 judges, and we have turned down 4. I gave you their \nnames: Estrada, Pickering, Owen, and Pryor. We have turned them down. \nMaybe the magic number is not 98 percent. Whether it is his way or no \nway, maybe we should have approved all of them. Maybe we should have \nswallowed very hard and approved people who the American people I am \nsure, if they understood what this is all about, wouldn't like very \nmuch. But they want to spend 30 hours on four judges.\n  My friend from Illinois came here in 1982. He is someone for whom I \nhave great affection. I say to him through the Chair, when we were told \nwe would be in on Monday: What is going to happen? I do not know. Well, \nwe will have some votes. When? We will decide later when those votes \nwill be. Maybe somebody knew. We didn't know. And Tuesday? Well, we \ndon't know. Maybe some people on the east coast can go back to the \nfestivities and the parades on Veterans Day.\n  We aren't a part of what is going on here. What this is all about \ntoday is the Senate is a partnership between the majority and the \nminority, especially when you have a difference of one--49 to 51. That \nis why the Republican majority must understand that we have to be part \nof what is going on around here. We cannot be taken for granted. We \ncannot be thought of as nothing. We cannot be treated as if we were \nMembers of the House of Representatives. I have been in the House. I \nunderstand how the majority works. I have been there. If you are in the \nminority in the House of Representatives, you can be pushed around \npretty hard. But in the Senate, the Constitution of the United States \nprotects the minority. The Constitution was written not to protect the \nmajority. The majority can always take care of themselves.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield for a question without losing the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to go back to this point. Since President \nBush was elected to be President, he has had 168 of his judicial \nnominees approved by this Senate, and 4 have not been approved--the 4 \nthe Senator from Nevada mentioned earlier.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada, am I mistaken that in \nthis Constitution which we are all sworn to uphold, article II, section \n2, it says that the President shall have the power to make his \nappointments with the advice and consent of the Senate? I would\n\n[[Page S14312]]\n\nlike to ask the Senator what that phrase could possibly mean--advice \nand consent--if it is the position of the Republicans that every \nnominee has to be approved. If they believe that approving 98 percent \nis not adequate, that we have to approve 100 percent, I would like to \nask the Senator from Nevada what the phrase ``advice and consent'' \nmeans. Shouldn't it just be ``consent''?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend from Illinois, who I know is not \nonly a lawyer but my recollection is that he was a parliamentarian of \nthe Illinois State Senate and certainly understands parliamentary \nprocedure. He certainly understands parliamentary procedure. I believe \nthe words ``advice and consent'' mean just what they say. It means we \nhave the obligation as a Senate to work with the President, to give him \nadvice as to what we think should be done on some appointments set \nforth in the Constitution, and others not so directly defined, to give \nadvice, and once we work with him, give him consent to select whoever \nhe wants.\n\n  I say to my friend, I am not overjoyed with all 168, but the minority \nof the Judiciary Committee has done an extremely good job in sifting \nout people who just do not meet basic standards. I appreciate the work \ndone by the Judiciary Committee. I have not served on the Judiciary \nCommittee either in the House or the Senate, but I served in the \nJudiciary Committee when I was in the State legislature in Nevada.\n  Why bring in the Judiciary Committee? There are so many things you \ncan work on and many things we need to work on here that we are not \nspending time on because of the time we are spending on judges. We have \ndone a good job of getting rid of the backlog. It is the lowest in \napproximately 13 years.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question without \nlosing the floor?\n  Clearly, the Constitution gives the Senate the authority to say no to \na judicial nominee. Is this a question of fairness? Are the Democrats \nin the Senate treating this Republican President unfairly by only \ngiving him 98 percent of the people he has nominated? Is it fair to \nconclude when there was a Democratic President, the Republicans in \ncontrol gave that President 100 percent of his judicial nominees? Does \nthe Senator feel the Republicans are going through a display for 30 \nhours because we are fundamentally unfair in treating them in a fashion \nthat they did not treat President Clinton?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, when we talked about this early in the \nday, Senator Daschle made a decision there is no payback time. We are \nnot trying in any way to get even with the Republicans for holding up \njudges. If we did that, if we were trying to get even, there would not \nbe 168 judges agreed to.\n  Here is a partial list of some of the difficulties we had when \nPresident Clinton was President. People are saying there has been no \nneed to file cloture. Berzon, Paez, Barkett, you can say whatever you \nwant, these were not serious cloture votes--and I don't know the \ndifference between a serious and nonserious cloture--the only way these \npeople could become judges is by filing cloture. For people to say we \nare not treating the judges fairly is simply wrong. We are treating the \njudges fairly. We are treating President Bush fairly. He has gotten 168 \njudges and we have turned down 4.\n  We are going to spend the valuable time of this Senate, 30 hours, on \n4 people who already have jobs, when we have almost 10 million \nunemployed people, and we have done nothing about the minimum wage. We \nare doing nothing about the environment. We are doing nothing on \nappropriations bills. We have conference reports we have not taken up. \nWe have pending a conference report on the Armed Services Committee \nthat could be acted on at any time, Military Construction. We have the \nSyria Accountability Act. The defense authorization was not completed. \nI did not ask unanimous consent on that. I did on Military Construction \nand the Syria Accountability Act. I agreed that instead of taking 90 \nminutes we would take 30 minutes each and debate it just for an hour. \nNo, they are more interested in these 4 people who already have jobs \nthan the approximately 10 million people who do not have jobs. People \nare being driven into poverty, the deficit is going up, the debt is \nincreasing.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for another question without \nyielding the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I understand this correctly, there is no \nconstitutional basis for the Republicans to argue that we cannot turn \ndown a nominee from the President. In fact, the Constitution is \nexplicit that we have the power of advice and consent. The facts show \nus that 98 percent of the nominees sent by the President have been \napproved; 168 have been approved, and only 4 have been held back.\n  The Republicans cannot argue they treated President Clinton any \nbetter. In fact, the record reflects there were 60 nominees sent to the \nSenate by President Clinton who were never even given a hearing before \nthe Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  It leads me to a question of the Senator from Nevada, through the \nChair, Why then are we going to take 30 hours to debate the obvious? If \nwe have the constitutional right to say no to a nominee, if we have \nsaid yes to 98 percent of the President's nominees, if the Republicans, \nwhen they were in control, turned down an even greater percentage of \nPresident Clinton's nominees, why then wouldn't we get about the \nbusiness of the people of this country, pass the important \nappropriations bills, try to do something to help the economy, instead \nof wasting 30 hours debating the obvious?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, through the Chair, I don't know. I am \nat a loss. I am not at a loss that when the Senate is in action, it \ntakes both sides. You cannot do both things as a dictator. The majority \nleader of this Senate is not the Speaker of House of Representatives. \nHe is the majority leader and leads under very delicate rules. To think \nwe were just going to say, OK, we have worked like dogs, we have gotten \na great record here, passing 10 appropriations bills and 3 other bills \nwe could do, and we will take 30 valuable hours of the Senate time. We \ncould debate the many things I talked about here, beginning with the \nenvironment. We could talk about minimum wage. We could talk about \npeople who have lost their jobs in America today. We could talk about \nthe need for a transportation bill. We could talk about the need for \ninfrastructure development in this country. We could talk about farm \nprograms we need to look at. The Senator from Nebraska talked about \ndroughts all over the Midwest. We need to spend some time on that. But \nwe do not have time to do that. No, because we are going to spend 30 \nnonstop hours on an agenda dealing with four people.\n  Let me go over this again. This is over four people. We do not want \nto lose track of what we are doing. The fact of the matter is, we as \nDemocrats determined that under our rules, our advise and consent \nobligations, there were four people we thought should not have the \nsupport of the Senate Democrats.\n  Why did we have some concern about Miguel Estrada? Miguel Estrada \ncould be the nicest person in the world. I don't know. But the fact is \nhe was either given bad advice or had made some very bad decisions. We \nthought it would be important that Miguel Estrada fill out all the \nquestions we asked him in his application. He would not do that. He was \nvague. He appeared to think he was smarter than anyone else and he did \nnot have to answer those questions. When we said, OK, we want you to do \nthat and we also want you to give us the memos when you were at the \nSolicitor's Office, what did he say? Drop dead; I will not give that to \nyou. Some say, that would violate the attorney-client privilege. Come \non. I know about attorney-client privilege. I know it has been done in \nthe past. Other people who wanted to get Senate approval gave us those \nmemos. I don't know if he did not give us those memos because he did \nnot want to or he was afraid of what we would find. There is more, but \nbasically that is why we did not approve Miguel Estrada.\n  Why didn't we approve Charles Pickering? As I have said before, I \nthink the world of Thad Cochran. I think the world of Trent Lott. I \nwork with them on the Senate floor. Just because of having worked with \nthem so many years, and their close feelings toward\n\n[[Page S14313]]\n\nPickering, it would have been nice if we could have done that; but we \ncould not.\n\n  We could not because the man had created a record that was so in \nopposition to what fairness calls for in this country, that every human \nrights, civil rights group in America said: Please don't approve this \nguy.\n  Some of the most dynamic speeches I ever heard was when a group of \ncivil rights people came to this Capitol and talked about why they did \nnot want Charles Pickering. One of the fine speeches that day was given \nby Representative John Lewis, an American hero who has been beaten many \ntimes as a civil rights advocate at the left arm of Martin Luther King. \nHe told us: You can't do that. He does not deserve it.\n  Then Priscilla Owen, we turned her down. She is a judge on the Texas \nSupreme Court. Her opinions are out of the mainstream of American \njurisprudence. Even the President's own attorney said so.\n  Then we go to William Pryor, the attorney general of Alabama. His \nrecord is not very good, and that is an understatement.\n  So we turned them down. We turned all four of them down.\n  Now, I say to people who are watching this debate, that is 168 \napproved, 4 disapproved. Complain about it. Say we were wrong, we made \nbad decisions over here, but do not take 30 hours of the Senate's time \nand think you can just run over us and say: We're going to do that. If \nyou don't like it, what can you do about it?\n  Well, we are showing you a little bit what we can do about it. The \nSenate only works if there is cooperation, if there is teamwork. So I \nsay, Mr. President, this teamwork is going to have to be reenergized, \nreinvigorated, started over again.\n  The Senate is a body where one person can throw a monkey wrench into \nalmost everything, and that monkey wrench has been thrown into it today \nby the Senator from Nevada simply because I thought it was fair to take \ncare of people on this side of the aisle who did not know when votes \nwere going to occur--we could not be told when they would occur--and \njust basically to show that there are 49 of us over here. You have to \nlisten to us. You just cannot do things that we are not talked with, \ncounseled with.\n  We know the powers the majority has. They can bring legislation to \nthe floor. But as far as setting schedule, we have a lot to say about \nthat. We are going to continue to have a lot to say about it. We cannot \nbe treated the way we have been treated.\n  I know there are some who say we should be doing other things here \ntoday, and I would like to be doing other things today. I guess \neverybody is locked into the 30-hour debate, and it is too bad we are \ngoing to find ourselves in that position.\n  We could have finished last week--had this thing not occurred--we \ncould have finished the Agriculture appropriations bill in 1 day \ninstead of 2. This bill could have already been completed, and we would \nbe going to the other appropriations bills. We could be doing Foreign \nOperations. We could be doing VA-HUD. I think that would just about \ncomplete all of our work. We could be doing that. But we are not doing \nthat today.\n  We certainly could have completed, by Thursday, at midnight, all our \nappropriations bills--by Thursday, at midnight.\n  (Mr. ENSIGN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we hear a lot about the ``special \ninterests'' and how the general public lacks the lobbyists to look out \nfor the public interests here in Washington, DC.\n  In fact, I talked about the people who get minimum wage, how they \nhave no lobbyists to help them. But I rise today to draw attention to \nthe exception to what does often seem the rule. This week, the \nEnvironmental Working Group, called EWG, will celebrate its 10-year \nanniversary of shaping the public debate on issues ranging from farm \npolicy to the many other issues dealing with the environment.\n  The EWG was founded by Ken Cook 10 years ago to fill a void in the \npublic interest community. While there were groups out there doing \nresearch and making policy proposals in the environmental arena, very \nfew had the mission to readily translate that research and policy to \nthe national stage and to the media.\n  Using the Internet and other Web-based tools, the Environmental \nWorking Group has effectively taken those debates to the people, arming \nthem with the information necessary to communicate with their elected \nRepresentatives. As important, EWG's work has helped to transform those \ndebates in the media.\n  I extend my appreciation for the work they have done. They are an \noutstanding organization that gets facts to people who have never \ngotten facts before, such as through the Internet. I applaud and \ncommend them on their very good work.\n  There are a number of other issues we need to talk about. One of the \nissues I wish to talk about is the Energy bill that is in conference. \nSome say that could come back any day. I traveled with the ranking \nDemocrat on that committee who is involved in the Energy bill and the \nMedicare bill. Over the weekend, I traveled with him, and he thought \nthe Energy bill would be worked out today. But as we flew into Dulles \nAirport last night, we got a Blackberry that said, no, it was not going \nto happen. I hope something like that does happen soon.\n  I know the conference report is not going to look like the bill we \npassed out of the Senate in July. I wish it did. I have not seen it \nyet, but I understand one of the terrible provisions negotiators intend \nto slip into the conference report will let the oil companies off the \nhook for cleaning up the mess they made with the MTBE. I don't know if \nthat is the case, but I hope that is not the case.\n  MTBE is a human carcinogen and when leaked into water, even in small \namounts, it causes water to take on the taste and smell of turpentine, \nrendering it undrinkable. We have had this problem in the Lake Tahoe \narea.\n  MTBE leaking from underground storage tanks, recreational watercraft, \nand abandoned automobiles has led to growing detections of MTBE in \ndrinking water. In fact, the U.S. Geological Survey has estimated the \nMTBE may contaminate roughly one-third of drinking water supplies \nnationwide.\n  MTBE poses a different threat to drinking water relative to the other \nharmful constituents of gasoline because MTBE is more soluble, more \nmobile, and degrades slower than those other constituents.\n  Oil companies began adding MTBE to gasoline at least as early as \n1979, using 215,000 tons in that year alone. By 1986, oil companies \nwere adding 54,000 barrels of MTBE to gasoline each day. By 1991, 1 \nyear before the Clean Air Act oxygenate requirement went into effect, \noil companies were using more than 100,000 barrels of MTBE each day. By \n1997, the volume of MTBE production was the second highest of any \nchemical in the United States.\n\n  These basic facts underscore two extremely important points about the \ncommittee's consideration of solutions to the MTBE contamination \nproblem.\n  First, proposals that simply remove the Clean Air Act oxygenate--I \nhave been here a little too long today maybe. At any rate, first, \nproposals that simply remove the CAA oxygenate requirement from the law \nwithout affirmatively banning MTBE will simply not end MTBE use. As \nnoted above, MTBE was used for octane enhancement long before the Clean \nAir Act amendments of 1990. There is no reason to believe it would not \nbe continued to be used if the Clean Air Act oxygenate requirement were \nremoved from the law but no ban put in place.\n  In another example, in May 1999, two oil companies in the San \nFrancisco area were found to have been adding substantial volumes of \nMTBE to gasoline. At the time, that area complied with air standards \nand, therefore, the Clean Air Act did not require the addition of an \noxygenate. Again, companies were adding MTBE to gasoline for reasons \nwholly independent of the Clean Air Act amendments.\n  Second, these facts belie the oil companies' arguments that Congress \nmade oil companies use MTBE and, therefore, lawsuits against oil \ncompanies should be terminated by Congress and taxpayers should pay to \nclean up MTBE contamination. MTBE was in use well before the passage of \nthe Clean Air Act amendments.\n  The CAA does not mandate the use of MTBE. And the fact that there was \nany oxygenate requirement in those\n\n[[Page S14314]]\n\namendments at all was due, in part, to oil industry lobbying.\n  For example, in 1989 testimony before the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, an ARCO official strongly recommended \nthat the committee include a mandate for MTBE in the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 1990, touting MTBE's benefits but not disclosing its \ndevastating impact on drinking water. Hearings Before the Subcommittee \non Environmental Protection of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks on S. 1630, S. Hrg. 101-331 at 458, Sept. 28, 1989. Despite such \nlobbying, Congress did not adopt an MTBE mandate, but rather prescribed \nthat reformulated gasoline contain an oxygenate without specifying a \nparticular product.\n  At the time of such lobbying, oil companies knew they were \nrecommending a product that would have a devastating impact on drinking \nwater. Indeed, where courts have heard oil industry claims that they \nshould not be held liable for MTBE contaminated drinking water \nsupplies, they have not only rejected those claims but have found that \ncompanies acted with malice in not disclosing the risks of using MTBE.\n  In fact, over a dozen communities have sued oil companies for \nknowingly introducing a defective product into the marketplace. Several \noil companies recently settled one such suit, South Tahoe Public \nUtility District v. Atlantic Richfield Company, et al., for $60 \nmillion. In South Tahoe, it was determined that oil companies were \nguilty of irresponsibly manufacturing and distributing MTBE because \nthese companies knew it would contaminate drinking water.\n  It was also found by clear and convincing evidence that two companies \nhad acted with ``malice'' by failing to warn of the environmental \ndangers of MTBE.\n  Together, documents and sworn testimony in South Tahoe demonstrated \nthat several oil companies knew as early as 1980 that MTBE posed a \nsignificant threat to the Nation's drinking water, that they promoted \nMTBE to the State and Federal Governments without disclosing internal \ninformation demonstrating that threat, and that they attempted to \ndiscredit public scientific studies that began to demonstrate that \nthreat.\n  Documents and sworn testimony in South Tahoe also revealed that oil \ncompany officials, showing a callous disregard for our environment, \neven gave MTBE telling nicknames such as ``Most Things Biodegrade \nEasier,'' ``Menace Threatening Our Environment'' and ``Major Threat to \nBetter Earnings.'' Further the case also revealed that Shell and ARCO, \nthe first refiners to add MTBE to gasoline, estimated that 20 percent \nof all underground storage tanks--tanks likely containing MTBE--were \nleaking. Several oil companies were shown to have both developed and \npromoted the concept of using reformulated gasoline to reduce air \nemissions.\n  For example, ARCO officials testified that ``EPA did not initiate . . \n. reformulated gasoline'' and that ``[T]he oil industry brought \n[reformulated gasoline] forward as an alternative to what the EPA had \ninitially proposed.'' Documents and sworn testimony also revealed that \nin 1987 an ARCO representative testified before the Colorado Air \nQuality Control Commission that MTBE would aid in reducing air \nemissions but did not warn of the drinking water contamination threat. \nThis representative testified that he also assisted Arizona and Nevada \ndevelop oxygenate programs that relied upon MTBE without disclosing the \ndanger.\n  In 1986, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection issued a \nscientific report describing the threat posed by MTBE. Documents and \nsworn testimony in South Tahoe revealed a concerted strategy by the oil \nindustry to discredit the article at the same time that internal \nindustry documents admitted the soundness of the Maine warning. When \nthe Maine paper prompted EPA to issue a notice to oil companies for \nmore information regarding MTBE, ARCO responded in 1987 that there was \nlittle information to suggest MTBE was a threat despite internal ARCO \ndocuments showing the contrary.\n  As South Tahoe demonstrates, terminating the right of communities to \nseek legal redress against oil companies for MTBE contamination would \nbe a grave injustice. It has not been embraced by the committee, it \nshould not be embraced by the Senate, and it should not become law.\n  The first hearing of this committee on MTBE was chaired by Senator \nBoxer in December 1997, after Santa Monica lost the majority of its \ndrinking water to contamination caused by a then little known fuel \nadditive. Since Senator Boxer's first call to ban MTBE now over 5 years \nago, this committee has conducted scores of hearings, considered \nalternate legislative approaches and ultimately approved various \nversions of legislation similar to S. 791.\n  Such legislation approved by this committee has consistently called \nfor MTBE's phaseout. It has also consistently rejected terminating the \nright of communities affected by MTBE to seek redress against oil \ncompanies in court. As consideration of S. 791 moves to the full \nSenate, these two principles that have guided committee consideration \nof the MTBE issue must remain intact if the MTBE problem is to be truly \nand equitably solved.\n  We have in this bill dealing with Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations a provision that funds the Board of Immigration Appeals. \nI would like to take a few minutes to discuss the board, immigration \npolicy, and the importance of the Dream Act. In the past year, the Bush \nadministration has attempted to dismantle the only judicial review \nprocess we have for our Nation's immigrants. The board is responsible \nfor applying the immigration nationality laws uniformly throughout the \nUnited States. Accordingly, the board has given nationwide jurisdiction \nto review the orders of immigration judges and other immigration-\nrelated decisions. Decisions of the board are subject to judicial \nreview in the Federal courts.\n  In September 2002, the Bush administration consolidated the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs appellate procedures by turning its three-judge panel \nprocess to a single judge. Review by three judges is only required \nwhere the BIA must correct clear errors of fact, interpret the law, or \nprovide guidance regarding the exercise of discretion. The 2002 rule \npermits a single-judge decision-only brief. No written opinion is \nnecessary. The purpose of this legislation was to enable the board to \nresolve simple cases quickly. The effect, however, has been anything \nbut efficient.\n  In a 12-month period, the number of immigration administrative agency \nappeals filed in Federal court has tripled. The American Immigration \nLawyers Association, or AILA, which represents over 8,000 of our \nNation's immigration lawyers and law professors who practice and teach \nimmigration law, has been a long-time human rights advocacy \norganization and has stated that in a 1-year period, the rate of \nrejected appeals has skyrocketed from 59 percent to 86 percent. The \nindependence and impartiality of our immigration court system must be \nsafeguarded. The Supreme Court, in Plyer v. Doe, stated that:\n\n       Whatever his status under immigration laws, an alien is \n     surely a person. Aliens, even aliens whose presence in this \n     country is unlawful, have long been recognized as persons \n     guaranteed due process of law by the 5th and 14th amendments \n     to our Constitution.\n\n  In October of 2003, the American Bar Association called upon the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals to discard its new procedures and set \nforth suggested reforms to the backlog of cases. And we have the \nAmerican Bar Association report, which we will get to at a later time. \nStreamlining the Board of Immigration Appeals process is just one \nexample of an ongoing effort by this administration to shortchange our \nNation's hard-working immigrants. While our Nation's immigration laws \nmust be enforced to the fullest extent, I can't help but wonder why our \nGovernment is attacking the very people who help us build up our \nNation. I think this is just an example of an ongoing effort by the \nadministration to shortchange our Nation's hard-working immigrants.\n  I think our Nation's immigration laws must be enforced to the fullest \nextent. I cannot help but wonder why our Government is attacking the \nvery people who help us build up our Nation. I think this is just an \nexample of the ongoing efforts by the administration to shortchange our \nNation's hard-working people. Our Nation's immigration laws\n\n[[Page S14315]]\n\nmust be enforced to the fullest extent. I cannot help but wonder why \nour Government is attacking the very people who help us build up our \nNation rather than targeting those who tear it down.\n  For example, in October 2003, Federal agents detained about 300 \nsuspected illegal immigrants in a nationwide investigation of cleaning \ncrews at Wal-Mart stores. The authorities took the immigrants into \ncustody as they finished the night shift in 61 stores in 21 States.\n  Certainly, they would not want to interfere with Wal-Mart and arrest \nthem before their shift was completed. The store might be dirty. We \nneed the immigration policy along the lines of the DREAM Act that was \nintroduced by Senators Hatch and Durbin, and I also cosponsored that. \nThe DREAM Act gives States the discretion to grant State residency to \ncertain youth and authorizes the Federal Government to grant \nundocumented students who are hoping to enter an institution of higher \neducation conditional legal permanent resident status.\n  Currently, unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for Federal \nfinancial aid, are not legally allowed to work, and are vulnerable to \nremoval from the country, regardless of the number of years they have \nlived there. The DREAM Act would allow college-bound, undocumented \nstudents to apply for Federal financial aid if they meet certain \ncriteria, including continuous residency for the previous 5 years, a \nhigh school diploma or its equivalent, and good moral character.\n  This is the kind of immigration policy we should be enacting. I \nwelcome the CGS committee report language for 2004, which states funds \nsaved in this streamlined process are being spent three times over by \nthe civil division, which must defend BIA's decisions in Federal court. \nAccordingly, the committee directed BIA to submit a report to the \nCommittees on Appropriations no later than March 21, 2004, listing the \nsingle-judge decisions that have been appealed to the Federal courts \nand the civil division's cost to defend these decisions over the past 3 \nyears.\n  I hope this body will enact the necessary immigration laws in this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I want to read a story that appeared in the newspaper \non October 25:\n\n       Every night for months, Victor Zavala, Jr., who was \n     arrested on Thursday in a 21-State immigration raid, said he \n     showed up at the Wal-Mart store in New Jersey to clean \n     floors. As the store's regular employees left at 11 p.m., he \n     said, they often asked him whether he ever got a night off. \n     Zavala, identified by Federal agents as a cleaning immigrant \n     from Mexico, told the Wal-Mart workers that he and 4 others \n     employed by a cleaning contractor worked at the Wal-Mart in \n     Old Bridge every night of the year, except Christmas and New \n     Years.\n       Now Mr. Zavala feels cheated, saying he worked as hard as \n     he could pursuing the American dream, only to face an \n     immigration hearing that could lead to deportation for \n     himself, his wife, Eunice, and their 3 children, 10, 7, and 5 \n     years old. He is one of 250 janitors employed by Wal-\n     Mart contractors who were arrested at 60 Wal-Mart stores \n     before dawn on Thursday.\n\n  Again, I think it is interesting that they waited until the stores \nwere clean before they picked them up. They would not even consider \noffending Wal-Mart by having a dirty store for their workers. Maybe, \nyou know, if these illegal immigrants were not hired and Wal-Mart gave \nthese people workable wages, maybe they would hire other people--maybe \npeople who were legal immigrants. But Wal-Mart can sell stuff pretty \ncheap because they don't pay them anything; they have no health care \nbenefits, no retirement benefits. So they get by pretty cheaply.\n  I think it was nice of Immigration and Naturalization to wait until \nthey cleaned the stores before they picked them up. That would give the \ncontractor time to go find some other cheap labor. Maybe for a while \nthey will have to pay a little more than what they were paying. Wal-\nMart is great for low prices but the low prices are also given to their \nemployees.\n  Most Wal-Mart employees--we have seen things written about this \nrecently--have no health benefits, no retirement benefits, and no \nvacation benefits. They work for very low wages and most of the time \nnot for 40 hours. They make sure they don't because they might be \nallowed some kind of benefits.\n\n       ``My family is not happy about this,'' Mr. Zavala said. He \n     said he paid $2,000 to smuggle him into the U.S. 3 years ago. \n     ``My children don't want to leave and go back to Mexico.''\n\n  I am sure that is true.\n\n       A Federal law enforcement official who spoke on condition \n     of anonymity, said yesterday that several current and \n     contract cleaning contractors for Wal-Mart, the Nation's \n     biggest retailer, were cooperating with the Government in its \n     investigation. On Thursday, Federal officials acknowledged \n     that they had wiretaps and recordings of conversations in \n     meetings among Wal-Mart executives and contractors. Federal \n     officials said as part of the Thursday raid, they searched \n     the office of midlevel management at Wal-Mart headquarters in \n     Bentonville, AR. Officials said the Government believed that \n     Wal-Mart executives knew the cleaning contractors were using \n     illegal immigrants.\n  Of course they did.\n\n       Federal officials noted that 102 illegal immigrants working \n     for Wal-Mart cleaning contractors had been arrested in 1998, \n     2001, and 13 Wal-Mart cleaning contractors had pleaded guilty \n     after those arrests. Those pleas remain under court seal. \n     Wal-Mart said yesterday it had begun an internal \n     investigation and would dismiss anybody who did not have \n     proper immigration papers. Wal-Mart also told its officials \n     to preserve any documents that might be relevant to the \n     Federal inquiry.\n\n  Isn't that nice?\n\n       Wal-Mart officials said the raid surprised them.\n\n  I'll bet.\n\n       They acknowledged yesterday that 10 immigrants arrested on \n     Thursday in Arizona and Kentucky were employed directly by \n     Wal-Mart. The company officials said they brought these \n     workers in-house after certain stores phased out the use of \n     contractors for whom the immigrants had worked. Wal-Mart \n     officials also said the company required contractors to hire \n     legal workers only.\n\n  Well, I say that Wal-Mart is involved in this, and I think it is an \nindication of why they can sell stuff so cheaply. They do it under the \nauspices of low prices.\n  I spent a lot of time here today. I thought I would do a little \nreading from my book. I wrote a book and not everybody has heard of it. \nI didn't sell too many, to be honest with you. I was hoping it would be \na best seller. The only place it is a best seller is in Searchlight. Of \ncourse, Searchlight is not very big, so that doesn't mean too much. But \nI am going to skip the introduction and get right to the meat of the \nbook.\n       Searchlight is like many Nevada towns and cities: it would \n     never have come to be had gold not been discovered. Situated \n     on rocky, windy, and arid terrain without artesian wells or \n     surface water of any kind, the place we call Searchlight was \n     not a gathering spot for Indian or animal.\n       Only fourteen miles to the east is the Colorado River. Ten \n     miles to the west is a modest mountain range, with fragrant \n     cedars, stately pines, and a few sheltered meadows, home to \n     an ancient Indian camp referred to as Crescent.\n\n  Mr. President, I am doing this because I have been talking for 5\\1/2\\ \nhours, or so, on a lot of substance. I think at least during the time I \nam going to talk, I should at least teach a little bit about \nSearchlight. I know the Presiding Officer is an expert on Searchlight \nand need not hear this. I am sorry he got the luck of the draw. I hope \nhe will bear with me.\n\n       To the northeast lies the canyon called Eldorado. In the \n     eighteenth century the Spaniards explored and then mined this \n     area. The same location was exploited by Brigham Young, who \n     directed some of his Mormon followers to present-day Nevada \n     in search of minerals for his Utah civilization. To the \n     southwest, about fifteen miles distant, is the site of a U.S. \n     military frontier outpost, Fort Piute or Piute Springs.\n\n  Also, reading here, I might drum up some sales for my book. I hadn't \nthought of that. That would be something--although I don't directly \nbenefit from that. I have a separate foundation and the proceeds go to \nSearchlight.\n  Anyone who wants to buy this book can get it on the Internet: \n``Searchlight, The Camp the Didn't Fail.'' Proceeds go to the little \ntown of Searchlight.\n\n       The mighty Colorado River was used for various routes along \n     the navigable portion of its course. The main impediment to \n     through passage from the north was the Grand Canyon, but the \n     river was usable for about a hundred miles above Searchlight \n     to as far south as the border of present-day Mexico.\n       During the Civil War the U.S. military tried to find better \n     routes for moving men and supplies. Captain George Price, who \n     had been commissioned by his superiors to find an easier \n     route from the area of Salt Lake City to the southern part of \n     the Utah Territory, led one such effort. He left Camp \n     Douglas, near Salt Lake, on May 9, 1864, and worked his way \n     south to Fort Mojave, near what is now Laughlin, Nevada. The \n     trip was\n\n[[Page S14316]]\n\n     uneventful until he reached present-day Cedar City, Utah. The \n     route over the desert from there to Las Vegas was extremely \n     harsh and inhospitable. From Las Vegas to Eldorado was \n     easier, but the journey from Eldorado to Fort Mojave was \n     particularly brutal. The route then proceeded to Lewis Holes, \n     an area west of Piute Springs named after Nat Lewis, and \n     early Eldorado Canyon miner. After arriving at Fort Mojave, \n     Captain Price declared that the route was unsafe and \n     unsuitable for military use.\n       As an interesting note, during Price's journey his company \n     came upon a stray cow at a watering spot near Lewis Holes and \n     a place called Government Wells. Price's men killed and ate \n     the cow, and the watering hole was formally named Stray Cow \n     Wells in recognition of the event.\n       The accepted route that Captain Price and others traveled \n     was called the Eldorado Canyon Road, which went from Eldorado \n     Canyon to the Lanfair Valley and wound its way through the \n     Castle Mountains, ending at Lewis Holes. Many prospectors \n     traveled over the road, but written accounts have focused on \n     the condition of travel rather than describing the trail \n     itself.\n       This pioneer route came very close to present-day \n     Searchlight. As Dennis Casebier points out in his Mojave Road \n     Guide, ``Eldorado Canyon is usually a dry side canyon coming \n     in to the Colorado River from the west about 25 miles below \n     Hoover Dam. The route to the mines in the Canyon from Los \n     Angeles took the Mojave Road to this point. From here the \n     road angled off to the northeast via Lewis Holes toward the \n     present Searchlight, then turned northward to Eldorado \n     Canyon. Connections were developed from the Eldorado Canyon \n     to Las Vegas and the main Salt Lake Trail. This point was a \n     major road junction of the day. Here travelers had to decide \n     whether to go northeast toward Utah or continue directly east \n     on the Mojave Road toward Arizona and New Mexico. This \n     intersection fulfilled the same purpose as the present \n     junction of I-15 and I-40 in Barstow, California.''\n       Eldorado Canyon was the object of Anglo exploration long \n     before Brigham Young's forays and the U.S. Army's \n     expeditions, however. Clearly, the first white man to pass \n     through or near Searchlight was Father Francisco Garces in \n     1776. He left no physical sign of his passing, but his \n     journals are sufficiently detailed to indicate that he came \n     near the town.\n       Several of the mines in Eldorado Canyon have a long \n     unwritten history that some believe goes back two centuries. \n     Even though there is no written account of any Spanish or \n     Mexican mining enterprise in the canyon, it is clear that \n     such activity did take place. John Townley reports that \n     mining likely went on there between 1750 and 1850. The mining \n     operations never spilled over into Searchlight, but the \n     explorations came very close.\n       From its earliest days, Searchlight had significant \n     interaction with Eldorado Canyon. By the time Searchlight was \n     founded, Eldorado had long been in operation. The contact was \n     closest before the railroad came to Searchlight, when the \n     mines and the people depended more on the river. The landing \n     at the mouth of Eldorado Canyon was more important to the \n     mines, however, than the river at Cottonwood was to \n     Searchlight.\n       Reports like the following from a conversation with John \n     Riggs contrast the operations in Eldorado and Searchlight: \n     ``John Powers, who is still living and who at one time owned \n     the Wall Street Mine, told me one evening about 1882 that an \n     outfit of Mexicans of the better class rode up to his camp at \n     the Wall Street, and asked him if he owned he mine. He \n     replied that he did. They then said that they had a very old \n     map of this country and that the Wall Street was marked on \n     the map. The map was evidently correct as they had come \n     straight to the mine. They stated that the map had been \n     made very long ago, probably by early Spaniards.'' The \n     Wall Street was one of the big producers of gold in \n     Eldorado Canyon for many years. Conversely, no mine in \n     Searchlight, with perhaps the exception of the Quartet, \n     was worked successfully for more than ten years.\n       Though we do not know when the activity in Eldorado Canyon \n     actually began, we do know that the mining district had a \n     hectic and eventful history in the latter part of the \n     nineteenth century. One account puts as many as 1,500 people \n     there during the Civil War.\n       The first documented records of contemporary mining in the \n     Searchlight area were provided by a mining company called \n     Piute, which was formed in 1870. This company owned 130 mines \n     in California and in southeastern Nevada. The most prominent \n     of the Nevada mines was the Crescent, located about ten miles \n     west of Searchlight. The company's promotional documents \n     described a road that passed near present-day Searchlight and \n     went to Cottonwood Island, below Searchlight on the Colorado \n     River. The road was said to be favorable, with a broad, \n     smooth path, much of it along a dry ravine.\n       In the early 1870s, a promoter named Johnny Moss attempted \n     to develop a city just off Cottonwood Island. The town, which \n     would be called Piute, was to be the freight head for the \n     mines headquartered at Ivanpah, some forty miles to the west. \n     The project never went beyond an artist's rendering, however. \n     The proposed mines were later developed, but San Bernardino \n     rather than Ivanpah emerged as the shipping terminus.\n       Indians traveled from the mountains above Searchlight to \n     the river, creating relatively extensive foot traffic near \n     the town's present location, and miners passed through the \n     area in their never-ending quest for the gold and silver of \n     their dreams.\n       When Searchlight was established at the end of the \n     nineteenth century, the mining camp with the unusual name had \n     a very primitive infrastructure, but it swiftly became \n     modern. Within a few years Searchlight was as fashionable as \n     any western town of its day. Its amenities were noticeably \n     contemporary. A modern water system was quickly created, \n     incorporating pumping facilities, a new storage tank, piping, \n     fire hydrants, and meters. The town even had a telephone \n     system, which for the time was very advanced, and a telegraph \n     system. An outdated railroad was soon replaced by a more \n     modern line that included passenger travel. Surprisingly, \n     early Searchlight had a modern system of electricity and its \n     own power plant.\n       The places of business in town were many and varied, \n     including a barbershop, several saloons and hotels, a \n     lumberyard, clothing stores, sundry shops, cafes, union \n     halls, boardinghouses, schools, garages, and stables. The \n     town even boasted a hospital with doctors and, of course, a \n     newspaper or two.\n       When the mines' production waned after 1908, the businesses \n     slowly began to cut back and in many instances simply failed. \n     The decline, though sporadic, was technologically regressive. \n     By the late 1940s and 1950s there was very little left of the \n     modern Searchlight. Fires and a lack of prosperity had \n     ravaged the once thriving community, and now there were no \n     barbershops, no hotel, no lumberyard, no clothing store, no \n     sundry shops, no union hall, and not even the trace of a \n     union. Of course, the need for a hospital had long since \n     ceased. There was no doctor, not even on a part-time basis.\n       In the town's early days, especially with the coming of the \n     railroad, the grocery stores carried a full line of food and \n     merchandise. Fresh produce came from the farms around the \n     area, including the river and Lanfair Valley, and beef came \n     by rail, stage, and truck, as well as from the nearby \n     ranches. Near its beginning, Searchlight had its own dairy, \n     but the dairy and the farms didn't survive for long. A \n     handful of ranches operated until the early 1990s, when \n     arrangements were made to ban all cattle grazing from the \n     area in order to comply with the federal Endangered Species \n     Act.\n       Searchlight may have not been favored by nature, but in the \n     years after gold was discovered, this desert place developed \n     into a microcosm of a frontier settlement worthy of \n     historical study.\n\n  Chapter 2, ``Money from Massachusetts''--what was the title of my \nfirst chapter? ``The Beginning.''\n  Chapter 2, ``Money from Massachusetts.''\n\n       The first accounts of the area around present-day \n     Searchlight came from nearby Summit Springs, which, except \n     for the workings at Eldorado Canyon twenty miles north, was \n     the main center of habitation. The site was believed to be \n     about three miles east of Searchlight, probably at what is \n     now known as Red Well, which is just off the blacktop road to \n     Cottonwood Cove, part of the new Lake Mohave formed after the \n     construction of Davis Dam.\n       More than a century before the discovery of gold at \n     Searchlight, prospectors combed the entire desert west of the \n     Colorado River for numerous minerals and hard metals, \n     including gold, virtually without success. They found float \n     (loose rocks that when panned showed some value) in some of \n     the washes, but no outcroppings of ore surfaced.\n       The discovery in Searchlight did not result from this \n     initial investigation. The area had been closely prospected \n     for many years; in Eldorado Canyon mineral exploration had \n     been routinely conducted since the days of Spanish rule. The \n     Colorado River, relatively close to Searchlight, had been \n     freely navigated during the nineteenth century. The \n     intercontinental railroad (the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa \n     Fe) was built only twenty-eight miles to the south, and the \n     U.S. Army and the U.S. mail were moved over the pass near \n     Piute Springs even before the Civil War. So the geography of \n     searchlight was not unexplored territory.\n       Some dispute exists as to whether the mining camp that \n     would become Searchlight was discovered in 1896 or 1897. The \n     latter date has been commonly used for almost a hundred \n     years, principally because all federal government \n     publications used it. The pioneers who settled Searchlight \n     and their descendants later disputed that claim and have \n     advocated the earlier date.\n       It seems clear that Fred Dunn, of Needles, California, \n     about fifty miles south of Searchlight, had for many years \n     corresponded with various eastern capitalists to secure \n     investments in his mining properties. One of those with whom \n     he communicated was a Boston investor named Colonel C.A. \n     Hopkins. In one of Dunn's letters, Hopkins read a description \n     of the Sheep Trail Mine, near Needles. The colonel replied to \n     Dunn, expressing interest in the claim, but by the time the \n     mail was delivered to Dunn, the Sheep Trail Mine was no \n     longer available for purchase.\n       Dunn again wrote to Hopkins in Boston and told him that \n     although he had been unable to secure an option on the \n     property Hopkins originally desired, other mining claims were \n     available. When he wrote the letter, however, Dunn actually \n     had no properties to offer, so he hired John C. Swickard to \n     locate claims for the consideration of $1 per claim. Swickard \n     began work immediately, concentrating his efforts in the \n     Crescent and present-day Searchlight areas. At\n\n[[Page S14317]]\n\n     that time the Crescent Mountains, ten miles west of \n     Searchlight, were the site of vigorous mining activity \n     because of significant recent discoveries of turquoise. So \n     the general Searchlight area was being investigated with some \n     success before 1896.\n       When Dunn believed he had enough claims to interest \n     Hopkins, he invited him to come for a visit to inspect the \n     property. Hopkins came to the prospected area but \n     purchased nothing, though he did retain Dunn to look for \n     other properties.\n       Hopkins exhibited interest in the area around Searchlight \n     because of the preponderance of low-grade ore, which was more \n     than enough to intrigue him. Unfortunately for Hopkins, \n     although Dunn had retained Swickard, the latter owned almost \n     all the property that would eventually make up the claims \n     that became the famous Quartette Mine. The only claims that \n     Swickard did not own were two small fractions of 49.5 feet at \n     either end of the vein that he first saw when he began his \n     work for Dunn. These fractions were claimed by Fred Colton \n     and Gus Moore in 1897. In order to obtain sole ownership of \n     the entire outcropping of the vein, Swickard traded the soon-\n     to-be-duplex mining claim to Colton and Moore in exchange for \n     the fractional claims he wanted.\n       It seems clear that prospecting in the Searchlight area was \n     inspired not only by Hopkins's investment interest but also \n     the long-standing interest on the part of Dunn, Swickard, and \n     others in the triangle area where Nevada, Arizona, and \n     California met, near the Colorado River. By 1897 successful \n     mineral exploration activities had already been undertaken in \n     the Eldorado Canyon, Goodsprings, and Crescent areas.\n       Swickard was proud of his Quartette, and the meticulous \n     work he performed for Dunn was evident many years later. His \n     location monuments were unique. A Searchlight Bulletin more \n     than ten years after the association carries a description of \n     the monuments, which resembled a pawnbroker's sign consisting \n     of two stones and a pebble. To locate a claim, a prospector \n     would usually put in place a small post and attach a tobacco \n     can to it with the claim notice inside. Because he was being \n     paid $1 for each claim he located, Swickard moved forward in \n     a rapid and wide-ranging fashion, claiming outcropping after \n     outcropping.\n       Swickard decorated the Quartette property with large signs \n     that carried this message: ``Any sheepherding sons of bitches \n     that I catch digging in these here claims I will work \n     buttonholes in their pock-marked skins.'' Since Swickard was \n     always heavily armed, his threats were heeded.\n       Even though Swickard was extremely protective of his \n     claims, he shortly sold them to the trio of Benjamin \n     Macready, a Mr. Hubbard, and C. C. Fisher for a team of \n     mules, camping equipment, and $1,100. Though proud of his \n     effort in locating the Quartette claim, he sold because he \n     had no faith in the property; he believed the outcroppings \n     were a blowout of the vein and would have no depth. By \n     today's standards the consideration he received for his claim \n     seems paltry, but by the standards of 1898 and 1899 the \n     payoff was significant. It had been known since 1896 that \n     low-grade ore existed in the area that became Searchlight, \n     yet no exploration of more than a hundred feet in depth had \n     taken place, not even by 1899, when Macready sold the \n     Quartette to Hopkins. There is some evidence that Macready \n     obtained the interests of Hubbard and then combined his \n     holdings with Dunn's before selling to Hopkins and \n     Associates. The selling price this time was $150. Before \n     Hopkins could accept the deal, the price was raised to $200. \n     Highly insulted, Hopkins felt he should not consider the new \n     price. His mining engineer, Leo Wilson, intervened and for an \n     additional $50 Hopkins increased his fortune.\n       Dunn and Macready were forced to sell the Quartette \n     property because they had been unable to raise the capital \n     for an ongoing mining operation. After the sale, however, \n     they remained involved in the new operation. Dunn served as \n     the resident agent of the corporation, and Macready acted as \n     Hopkins's superintendent. Each maintained a minor ownership, \n     but the real financial force was the Bostonian, Colonel \n     Hopkins.\n       Money from Massachusetts had a similar impact on another \n     mining venture, in 1904, in the Robinson mining district of \n     White Pine County, Nevada. James Phillips Jr., a New York \n     financier, and Mark Requa, one of the owners of claims in the \n     Comstock Lode, persuaded the Loring brothers of Boston to \n     capitalize the Nevada Consolidated Copper company, which \n     later led to Kennecott's massive copper mine and processing \n     facilities near Ely. Some say that without Massachusetts \n     money, that important Nevada operation could never have been \n     developed. In fact, a look back through history shows that \n     nearly all of Nevada's mining enterprises were funded from \n     outside the state, except for a few operations developed \n     later in the century by Nevadans like George Wingfield.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield to the Senator, without losing my right to \nretain the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hate to interrupt the Senator's history of Searchlight, \nNV, because it is something I would like to know a little bit more \nabout. I think the Senator from Searchlight is going to fill me in \nabout the history of his hometown, but I would like to ask the Senator, \nfor those who may have just joined in this debate, if he could bring me \nup to speed as to where we are in terms of the business of the Senate \nwith pending appropriation bills.\n  I ask, through the Chair, are there still appropriations bills that \nneed to be worked on and resolved before this Senate will have finished \nits work? If so, could the Senator tell me if the schedule announced by \nthe Republican majority leader this week is conducive to finishing that \nschedule?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, through the Chair, we have worked very \nhard to complete a schedule the country could be proud of. The \ndistinguished majority whip came to the floor today and talked about \nthe accomplishments of this Senate. He talked about the 10 \nappropriations bills we have passed. Well, what he did not mention--and \nI am sure it was an oversight--is that that could not have been done \nwithout the absolute, total cooperation of the Senate Democrats. Those \nbills passed because we worked to help them be passed.\n  I say to my friend, we called our floor leader, who does a wonderful \njob, and he worked with me to make sure we worked with the majority to \npass the appropriations bills. The Senator from Illinois is a \ndistinguished member of the Appropriations Committee. We worked hard to \nget that done.\n  In fact, I repeat--and repetition is part of the answer--we had \nagreed, the minority agreed, with what the majority leader wanted: Let \nus work November 10, let us even work November 11, so we can complete \nthese appropriations bills. We said, okay. We went back to our \nSenators. They were not happy about that, but they understand Senator \nDaschle is our leader and we follow the leader, with rare exception.\n  The decision was made almost 2 weeks ago to work on November 10 and \n11, and we worked so hard. We wanted to get out of this place. We have \npeople at home to take care of. Our responsibilities are more than in \nWashington, DC. We have hearings we need to conduct at home. We have \nevents we need to go to, constituents to take care of, offices to \noversee. So, I say to my friend, we worked so hard.\n\n  All of a sudden, we turn around and there is a hot poker that sticks \nme right in the eye. What is this hot poker? There is a decision made, \nin spite of all our hard work, we are going to spend 30 hours, starting \nWednesday at 6 o'clock until 12 o'clock Thursday night, to talk about \nhow poorly the majority has been treated about judges, even though the \njudicial vacancies in our Federal courts are at a decade-and-a-half \nlow, although we have approved 168 judges for this President. We have \nturned down four judges--well, not judges. We have turned down two \njudges who want to become different kinds of judges. We turned down \nanother man who works downtown and makes a lot of money, and we turned \ndown the attorney general of Alabama--4 out of 168.\n  The Senator from Illinois works on the Appropriations Committee. OK, \nso we learned that is going to happen. Some questions come up:\n\n       What are we going to do Monday?\n       I don't know.\n       Are there going to be votes?\n       I think so.\n       When?\n       I don't know.\n       What are we going to do Tuesday?\n       Well, we'll decide later.\n\n  Tuesday is a legal holiday, by the way.\n  What is going on here today is an effort to show the world that the \nSenate is unlike any other institution in the world. In the U.S. \nSenate, one person has a lot of things he can do to be involved in what \nis going on here. I am here today representing my Democratic Senators. \nThere may be one or two who disagree with me, but not more than that. \nThey know that I am here speaking for them. They know they are not \nMembers of the House of Representatives, which works like the British \nParliament. If you are in the minority, tough; you are going to get run \nover. Not the Senate.\n  So the majority leader, who is new at his job--I like him a lot. He \nis a fine man, dedicating his life to public service. I appreciate it \nvery much. He is a distinguished surgeon. He is a man who devotes \nwhatever little off time he has to helping those in countries far away \nless privileged than he. I have a great\n\n[[Page S14318]]\n\ndeal of respect and admiration for the majority leader.\n  But he has to learn, as I am sure he is, that the Senate is a \npartnership, a partnership between the majority and the minority. We \nwant to be treated fairly in this partnership. To have 30 hours spent \non an issue that involves four people, who have jobs--they are working, \nthey have jobs--30 hours for four people is not fair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield to my friend from Illinois without my losing \nthe floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada, is he representing that \nthe Democrats in the Senate are prepared to work with the Republicans \nin the Senate to pass the remaining appropriations bills so we meet our \nobligation under the Constitution in a timely fashion? Is this a \nfilibuster to stop taking up the appropriations bills?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we not only can say what we will do, \nbut we can talk about what we have done. We have a record of \naccomplishment of working with the majority. We worked very hard, not \nonly on appropriations bills but other important pieces of legislation. \nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act, that was difficult to get up from our \nside. We got it up. We had a very fine debate. That bill is now on its \nway, we hear, to becoming law.\n\n  The Healthy Forests initiative--that was a hard piece of legislation \nto get passed out of this Senate, but we did it. We did it because we \ncooperated. Either one of those two bills I mentioned, Fair Credit \nReporting and the Healthy Forests initiatives--it would have been easy \nto spend a week on each one of those. We didn't do that.\n  We have a record of accomplishment. We share the accomplishments that \nwere laid out by the Senator from Kentucky today. And I say also, \nrespectfully, the only reason we did not pass more appropriations bills \nlast year is we didn't get the same cooperation that the majority has \ngotten from us. But that has happened in the past, and we are now here \nwhere we are today.\n  We are part of the process. When the history books are written--and \nthey will be written--I think they will look back on this decision made \nto address, out of the very important things focused in the eye on the \nAmerican people--a war in Iraq, a war in Afghanistan, a war on \nterrorism globally. It is difficult to comprehend why that alone, \ntogether with the economy which is in such desperate shape, and \nproblems dealing with health care, those who are medically uninsured, \npeople who are desperately poor and need to be helped, our educational \nsystem--we could talk about any one of those and historians would think \nthat is something we should do.\n  No, we are going to take 30 hours. When is the last time this \nCongress has spent 30 straight hours doing anything? Anything? What are \nwe going to spend 30 hours doing? Thirty straight hours we are going to \nspend talking about four judges who, combined, make $1 million a year, \none of whom makes a half a million dollars a year, all of whom have \njobs. I think our priorities are a little out of kilter here--as I go \nback to my book.\n  Mr. President, Chapter 3:\n       One of the real difficulties facing early prospectors in \n     southern Nevada was that to file a claim, they had to travel \n     more than 200 miles to Pioche, a trip that took at least ten \n     days. This presented great hardship, especially in the winter \n     months, when the weather conditions around Pioche could be \n     severely inclement.\n       As early as 1898, articles appeared in periodicals touting \n     the discoveries made in the Searchlight area. The references \n     were actually to Summit Springs, with directions to the \n     specific site, for Searchlight had not yet been named. The \n     most definitive citation observed the following: ``At this \n     point, fifty miles north of Needles, California and some ten \n     miles west of the Colorado River, there is some excitement \n     caused by a promising gold strike made by a Mr. Colton. His \n     first shipment of the selected ore yielded at the rate of 72 \n     ounces per ton. He is now shipping a carload that is expected \n     to produce some 200 dollars per ton. Conservative miners who \n     have recently visited the locality are pleased with the \n     outlook in this vicinity.''\n       On July 20, 1898, the mining district of Searchlight was \n     formed. The place chosen for the undertaking was the only \n     frame or wooden building in the whole camp, a little shack \n     located near the present-day Cyrus Noble Mine, not far from \n     where the Santa Fe Railroad depot would later be situated. \n     The founders were described nine years later as a ``small \n     bunch of adventuresome spirits who had undertaken the task of \n     unbuckling the girdling of the gold that encompasses this \n     immediate mineralized section, and [took] advantage of the \n     privileges allowed them under the United States mining \n     laws.''\n       The group of miners and prospectors involved in forming the \n     district drew up a set of bylaws and regulations. Rather than \n     drafting a list of crude, misspelled rules, they put into \n     effect a concise, systematic, and businesslike set of \n     standards covering every point necessary for the filing of a \n     mine claim.\n       The formation of the mining district did not obviate the \n     need for the ultimate filing with the county recorder in \n     Pioche, the seat of Lincoln County. Because Pioche was so far \n     away and winter weather often made travel impossible, \n     principals were allowed to establish the priority of the \n     claim by filing it initially with the district recorder, then \n     transfer the documentation to Pioche at a convenient time. \n     This arrangement prevented many claim disputes. The original \n     papers of formation were written on ordinary notebook paper \n     in handwriting and then pasted in a rusty book, which as of \n     July 19, 1907, was still preserved in the recorder's office.\n       Those who signed the formative papers were E.J. Coleman, \n     who acted as chairman; G.F. Colton, who acted as recorder; \n     Samuel Foreman; S. Baker; F.C. Perew; F.W. Dunn; H.P. \n     Livingston; C.C. Fisher; T.B. Bassett; J.F. Dellitt; W.O. \n     Camp; W.G. Lewis; G.B. Smith; and E.R. Bowman. It is \n     interesting that the two accounts of the formation of the \n     district agree on everything except one of the signatories of \n     the handwritten document establishing the mining district. \n     The Searchlight Bulletin of July 14, 1911, lists a woman by \n     the name of Mrs. Hattie Cook as one of the signers, but an \n     earlier account in the same paper on July 19, 1907, does \n     not mention her name. It may have been merely an oversight \n     that the name of the only woman who signed was left out, \n     or it might have been a subtle denial of a woman's role in \n     the founding of the town. Hattie Cook did, however, \n     subsequently locate her own mining claim, the Flat Iron.\n       Many claims had been recorded in Pioche before the \n     formation of the Searchlight district, including Fred \n     Colton's initial discovery, which started the rush to the \n     Searchlight area. But the first claim actually recorded as \n     ``Searchlight,'' called the Happy Jack, was located on May 3, \n     1898, just a few days before the formation of the new \n     Searchlight district. This initial claim was located by J.F. \n     Dellitt, one of the people who formed the district. The \n     discovery of the big claim by G.F. (Fred) Colton on May 6, \n     1897, was not actually recorded in Pioche until the next \n     January. From this example alone it is clear why it was \n     necessary to form the district.\n       By October the mining camp had its own post office. That \n     same winter many more claims were filed, with the \n     accompanying speculation that all of them would yield riches. \n     These reports sparked an increase in the flow of people to \n     the new camp.\n       The development of Searchlight came at an opportune time in \n     the history of Nevada, since the Comstrock Lode was all but \n     exhausted by the time Colton struck gold in 1897. The \n     shipment of ore from the Searchlight district followed a \n     twenty-year slump in Nevada mining and gave the state \n     increased visibility nationwide.\n       It later became apparent that any ore of significant value \n     in Searchlight would be found at depths of more than 200 \n     feet. Extracting ore at that depth was usually prohibitively \n     expensive for individual prospectors; consequently, many \n     operations followed the example of the Quartette and \n     consolidated their efforts.\n       The Engineering and Mining Journal often reported on such \n     consolidations. Among the transactions recorded there was the \n     New Era Mining Company, which incorporated in 1900 with \n     $300,000 in capital, a significantly large amount of money at \n     the time. The Duplex claim was developed with financing out \n     of Riverside, California, allowing the construction of a \n     mill and extensive underground development. The \n     Searchlight Mining and Milling Company, known thereafter \n     as the M, was capitalized in 1899 with sufficient \n     financial resources for continuous work until ore was \n     finally found in 1904.\n       But the Quartette was the mine that propelled Searchlight \n     out of the ranks of insignificant Nevada mining towns. The \n     Quartette was a great mine by any standard, and its dramatic \n     success allowed Searchlight to become a mining camp of world-\n     class proportions.\n       The finest mine in Searchlight almost never came into \n     existence, however. The original capitalization by the \n     Hopkins group was soon expended, but more money was sunk into \n     developing the mine. Suddenly, Fred Dunn, the company's \n     resident agent, acting on instructions from the owners in \n     Massachusetts, ordered the foreman, Jack Russell, to stop \n     work. Russell politely but firmly informed Dunn that he took \n     orders only from superintendent Macready, who was in Los \n     Angeles. Dunn then contacted Macready in Los Angeles by \n     telegraph, ordering him to close down the mine. Macready \n     could not return to Searchlight for four days, since the \n     train from Goffs to Manvel ran only three days a week. He did \n     not receive the message from Dunn until Thursday, so he had \n     to wait for the Monday train. Instead of biding his time \n     until the train ran, Macready wired two words to his foreman: \n     ``Crosscut south,'' instructing the men to continue work but \n     to extend the work at an angle rather than straight down.\n\n[[Page S14319]]\n\n       When Hopkins originally purchased the Quartette, the shaft \n     was 100 feet deep. At the time of the apparent depletion of \n     funding, the shaft had reached the 300-foot level, and the \n     findings were not encouraging. In fact, the ore was averaging \n     only $3.84 in gold per ton. Since all of the ore in other \n     Searchlight mines was being found at depths of less than 100 \n     feet, Benjamin Macready was actually charting unknown \n     territory when he ignored the instructions from his owners \n     and ordered the miners to continue. When he arrived in the \n     camp four days later, they had struck a bonanza--and they had \n     reached the ore after only two more shifts. By the time the \n     mining boom ended, the Quartette accounted for more than 50 \n     percent of all the gold taken out of the Searchlight mining \n     district.\n       Twenty-three miles southwest of Searchlight was a railroad \n     connection, originally called Barnwell after the first \n     telegraph operator at the station. The Quartette and other \n     Searchlight operations had to haul ore over this twenty-three \n     miles of incredibly rough terrain in freight wagons to the \n     small railroad line, originally called the Nevada Southern \n     and then the California Eastern. From here, the ore was \n     shipped to the central complex of smelters and mills in \n     Needles, California. It was a time-consuming and expensive \n     operation. To curry favor with the Atchinson, Topeka, and \n     Santa Fe, to which this thirty-mile line connected, in 1893 \n     the small railroad changed the name of Barnwell to Manvel, \n     for the Santa Fe president. The small railroad was taken over \n     by the Atchinson, Topeka, and Santa Fe in 1901. Shortly after \n     Searchlight was discovered, the president died, and the name \n     of the site was changed back to Barnwell. Ultimately, the \n     railroad built a line to Searchlight.\n       With the significant gold production at the Quartette, and \n     the long, hard haul to Barnwell, management agreed to finance \n     the construction of a mill at the Colorado River, about \n     fourteen miles east of Searchlight. The haul to the river \n     made sense because the load would be heavy going downhill and \n     the freight cars would be empty on the arduous trek back up \n     the hill. The construction of the mill at the river also \n     solved the problem of the lack of water in the immediate \n     Searchlight area. In fact, even at the 300-foot level, where \n     the big strike had occurred, there was no sign of water, at \n     the Quartette or at any other place in the camp.\n       Building the mill was not a difficult engineering task, but \n     constructing a railroad to the river was more complex and \n     expensive. It was, however, necessary in order to save costs \n     in the production and processing of the ore, and so the \n     decision was made to proceed. The construction of the mill \n     and narrow-gauge railroad took nearly a full year, until May \n     1902. The mill ran continuously until June of the following \n     year.\n       A significant water supply was finally reached at the \n     Quartette about the 500-foot level, at just about the time \n     when the mill and railroad construction was completed. The \n     discovery of water in the mine reduced the need for the \n     riverside mill.\n\n  I am up to chapter 4. We are marching along with my book. As I said, \nit was quite a job to write it. I am sure it has been a harder task for \nsome people to read it, but it is something I am proud of. As I said, \nit sold well at Searchlight. But, of course, that is not much in the \nway of large sales. I have about 25 more chapters to go. The chapters \nare not long. That is the good news.\n  I will take a little sip of water. That is pretty good today. That is \nall the water I have drunk. I have been pretty careful in my water \nintake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I remember the first \ntime I talked for an expended period of time beginning my first year. \nSenator Byrd was the leader. He has never taken credit for this, but I \nthink he probably was behind this. He kept bringing me water, and I \ndidn't realize that was something I shouldn't have been doing. So I \nhave learned my lesson since then. It is fairly easy to do. Not \ndrinking a lot of water is more comfortable.\n       Theories about how the town of Searchlight was named have \n     provided ongoing controversy among the area's residents \n     almost since the founding of the town. One of the first \n     mentions of the name Searchlight occurred in a mining journal \n     of February 11, 1899: ``Miners flocking to the Searchlight \n     camp located about 100 miles north of Needles. Highgrade gold \n     quartz veins have been discovered.'' Note that the \n     specification of Searchlight's location is off by almost \n     fifty miles--Searchlight is only fifty miles from Needles, \n     not a hundred miles.\n       After Colton's initial discovery, the exploration and \n     mining activity began in earnest. It is noteworthy that even \n     though Colton and his family lived in Searchlight throughout \n     most of the next fifteen years, with brief visits to \n     California, neither he nor the family commented on the \n     initial prospected discovery. No interviews with George \n     Frederick Colton, the founder of Searchlight, can be located \n     in which he explains the details of his location of the \n     Duplex, or even how the name Searchlight was assigned. \n     Several competing versions of the town's naming have been \n     proffered, and Colton neither confirmed nor objected to those \n     differing versions. For example, descriptions of how the camp \n     got its name appeared in early Searchlight newspapers at a \n     time when Colton was a prominent citizen of the town. In the \n     decades following the decline of Searchlight, he came in and \n     out of the town, and members of his family lived in nearby \n     Las Vegas, but he left no traceable interview in which he \n     discusses the naming of the camp.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I have to finish a sentence. This is a significant point of \nthe story.\n\n       During this time, however, other theories emerged about the \n     naming of Searchlight.\n\n  We are getting to a point--I want your attention, Mr. President. We \nare getting to a point now in this book where we are going to find out \nhow Searchlight got its name. I hope the Chair will give me your full \nattention because it is one of the most asked questions there is: How \ndid Searchlight get its name? That is what this chapter is all about. I \nhope you will give me your full attention.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from Illinois for a question without \nmy losing the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada anticipated my \nquestion. I was going to ask him how Searchlight got its name. I \nunderstand he will reach that point in the book.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the case.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask a question of the Senator from Nevada. There are a \nnumber of colleagues asking, in terms of the presentation of the \nSenator from Nevada, if he has a goal in mind in terms of what he would \nlike to present to the Senate before we reach a point where we might \ntake a vote; has the Senator thought of that point?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to respond to that. I have not heard anything \nabout votes in the last 6\\1/2\\ or 7 hours. That is a reason I am here.\n  I will put this exciting book down for a minute and respond to my \nfriend. I know the Chair wants to hear that before the 8 p.m. hour \narrives so he does not have to come back and ask me tomorrow. That is \none of the reasons we are here. We were not told, other than there will \nbe a vote sometime today. I personally thought--and I think my \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, agreed--that really \nwas not fair. We tried to probe and find out what there would be. We \nknow there are 30 hours starting Wednesday. We read about that first in \nthe newspapers. As far as votes, I want to make sure those people with \nplanes coming from the West will not be jammed with an early vote. I \nheard there would be votes at 2 or 3 and people would leave so they \ncould go to their events on Veterans Day. We did not know.\n  As I said earlier, I say to my friend from Illinois, around here we \nhave to work together. No one knows that better than the Presiding \nOfficer, with whom I worked on a close basis on the Ethics Committee. I \ncannot say enough about the Senator from Kansas and his leadership. It \nwas significant, strong. It was for the good of the institution.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, around here we have to get along. \nTo get along, we have to work together. As I said, speaking for my \nSenators, including the Senator from Illinois, who is not only a fellow \nSenator but a close personal friend, someone I care about a great \ndeal--we have been together here for 21 years. I say to him, I don't \nknow. Somebody can let me know, and I guess someone from the majority \ncan ask me to yield and ask me a question, Did I know they were \nscheduling a vote at such-and-such a time? I don't know if they want \nmore votes tonight. I don't know.\n\n  In the meantime, I am a soldier with a mission. That mission is to \ntell people around the world, C-SPAN and people within the breadth and \nwidth of my voice, about Searchlight and how it got its name.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forward march.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope someday we can do maybe like a \nDemocratic retreat, maybe a Senate retreat, in Searchlight. We only \nhave one motel, but we are working on others. We have a McDonald's now, \none of the highlights of the economic life of the last 25 years of \nSearchlight. You can get a McFlurry there, a Big Mac, really good \nfries. I am not a big fry fan. Good fries. I am kind of a McFlurry fan, \nmyself. I am very happy; some of my\n\n[[Page S14320]]\n\nfriends built that place. They have a concession, the Herbst family. \nThey have a flag that flies over McDonald's, and I am not exaggerating, \nit must be 50 feet high, and I don't know how long it is. You can see \nit for miles around.\n  Anyway, Searchlight is coming along, and before too long maybe we can \nhave a Senate retreat there. Colorado is not far. Below Searchlight we \nhave the beautiful Lake Mohave, part of Lake Mead Recreation Area. \nSearchlight is a good place, and we need to find out how it got its \nname.\n\n       One version insists that it was named for an early miner in \n     the area, Lloyd Searchlight. There is, however, no record of \n     anyone by that name who ever lived nearby. The confusion \n     developed when a man known only as Mr. Lloyd started the \n     Lloyd-Searchlight Mining Company, a company that didn't begin \n     operations until the Searchlight mining district had long \n     been formed and named.\n       A Bulletin headline in 1906 read, Santa Barbarans pay \n     $40,000 for Bonanza Prospect. Lucky owners retain large \n     interest--will be known as Lloyd-Searchlight. The article \n     goes on to state that the development work would be under the \n     direction of Mr. Lloyd. ``Although the local management is \n     preserving clam-like silence, it is learned on the best of \n     authority that the Lloyd-Searchlight has struck it rich. In \n     point of discovery and development Lloyd-Searchlight is the \n     foremost property at Camp Thurman, fifteen miles south. Its \n     owners all reside in Santa Barbara, California.''\n\n  I only have two paragraphs for Mr. Lloyd but, frankly, that is about \na paragraph more than he deserved. It was hard to fill all these pages. \nI gave him an extra paragraph.\n  I say to these pages, some of whom I am sure will be historians, I \nhope they will remember as they study history, this history lesson \ntonight. It may not be the best, but it is history and it is certainly \nbetter than some of the speeches we have heard.\n\n       A second version is more humorous. Prospectors congregating \n     at Summit Springs before the formation of the Searchlight \n     district used to joke about the miners John Swickard and Joe \n     Boland, who patiently ground their very low-grade ore in a \n     mule-drive crusher, saying, ``There is ore there alright, but \n     it would take a searchlight to find it.'' It was recalled \n     that they all laughed afterward, but when Fred Colton turned \n     up some high-grade ore three miles west of Summit Springs, he \n     remembered this joke and called the location Searchlight.\n       A Searchlight newspaper article lends credence to this \n     version because Colton and various members of his family were \n     living in Searchlight when it was written. Logically, if the \n     story were inaccurate Colton would have denied it. \n     Conversely, it could also be argued that if the story were \n     not true, Colton would not want to contradict it, since the \n     tale gave him greater standing in the town.\n       The newspaper stated in 1906: ``It might be interesting \n     here to relate how the camp originally got its name. A number \n     of prospectors had discovered some float in the valleys to \n     the east and west of town and had a camp established in a \n     gulch near where the Cyrus Noble is now located. Coming into \n     camp one evening tired, sore and disgruntled, Fred Colton, \n     the first discoverer of the camp, threw his canteen on the \n     ground and exclaimed, `there is something here boys, but it \n     would take a searchlight to find it.' Two or three days later \n     he found the ledge of the present Duplex and named it \n     Searchlight. And this was the christening of the camp.''\n       Another recently unearthed version of the town's naming was \n     buried in a 1911 Bulletin article. In naming the mine and the \n     town, Fred Colton was impressed with the wonderful view from \n     the Duplex Mine, which was situated on a large hill \n     overlooking the town. He is reported to have said, ``This \n     would be a nice place to mount a searchlight.''\n       Yet another version of the unusual name Searchlight \n     originated with a box of wooden matches, . . .\n\n  Maybe these young pages don't know what a box of wooden matches is, \nbut when I grew up they were about all we had. You had a box and pulled \nout these wooden matches to light your fires. But there was a name--\nwell, anyway, let me read my book:\n\n       Yet another version of the unusual name Searchlight \n     originated with a box of wooden matches, which were essential \n     for lighting cigarettes, cigars, stoves, and for general \n     survival in the early part of this century. One of the most \n     popular brands was named Searchlight. The story is told that \n     a handy box of Searchlight matches was seen at the camp and \n     inspired miners to give the name of Searchlight to the desert \n     mining district.\n       George Colton's grandson, Gordon, has perpetuated the \n     matchbox version of the tale, spreading word that this is how \n     the town got its name. Gordon was very loquacious, but he did \n     not base his story on conversations with his grandfather. He \n     never lived in Searchlight until late in his life, and the \n     box-of-matches version of the story didn't appear until many \n     years after the camp was founded. (As an interesting side \n     note, Gordon was alleged to have played five years of high \n     school football at Las Vegas High School before embarking on \n     a professional football career with the Los Angeles Rams. His \n     classmates even assert that he was All-State at two different \n     positions. This is confirmed by his son, Stanton, a former \n     Nevada state treasurer. In his old age, Gordon became the \n     constable and deputy coronor of Searchlight.)\n       Most longtime residents of Searchlight agree that the name \n     came from Colton's being told--or saying--that one would need \n     a searchlight to find gold, but there is no surviving \n     interview at any time with the original developers of the \n     mining district that would shed light on the authenticity of \n     this version. The Searchlight newspaper opined, however, that \n     this version had ``the widest credence.''\n       The most credible version of how Searchlight got its name \n     is Colton's story of the need for a searchlight to find the \n     ore. A few have felt more support for Gordon Colton's box-of-\n     matches theory. But before a jury both his story and the \n     other versions would fail. Historian John M. Townley agrees, \n     conceding that the most logical version of the name's origin \n     is the one that centers around needing a searchlight to find \n     the gold, even though Colton never commented on the naming. \n     Townley does confirm, however, that even five years after the \n     discovery of gold in Searchlight, no one was certain as to \n     the origination of the name.\n       George F. Colton, the town's founder, was rarely \n     interviewed on any subject having to do with the beginnings \n     of the town. In 1906 he returned after about a year's absence \n     from Searchlight and said, ``I came here in 1897 and pitched \n     my tent near the present site of the Searchlight Hotel. . . . \n     This is not only a camp without a failure, but a camp with a \n     future. Jane Overy, resident historian of Searchlight and the \n     curator of its museum, insists that the place where Colton \n     pitched his tent is the present location of the post office \n     parking lot.\n       Possibly another reason that Colton did not make a big deal \n     out of his discovering the town and naming it is that perhaps \n     in his mind he didn't do either. It is clear that there was \n     significant prospecting in the area of Searchlight long \n     before 1897. This is confirmed by many sources, not the least \n     of which is a news article describing Colton as ``the father \n     of Searchlight, because of the fact that he discovered the \n     first interesting claims in the camp and built the first \n     house in town.'' The article recognizes him not as the \n     discoverer of gold in Searchlight but as the discoverer of \n     the first interesting claim. George Colton died in California \n     in 1916.\n       The same newspaper rightfully calls John Swickard the \n     father of Searchlight. In the early nineties, Swickard \n     prospected through this territory. His locations were the \n     first in the district. As early as 1896 he enlisted the \n     backing of Colonel Fred Dunn and, in 1897, he established the \n     first permanent camp, at Hall's Well.\n       In short, Searchlight is a camp with more than one father.\n\n  Mr. President, we are moving right along. We are headed into chapter \n5, which is, just to give a little preview of chapter 5, called ``The \nBig Strike.'' It talks about the only really big mine in Searchlight. \nThere are lots of mines, hundreds of them. I was there Saturday from \nabout 10 o'clock at night to about 9:15 Sunday morning. As you drive \nthrough there, you can still see all these old abandoned mining claims. \nMost of them have been ordered by law to be fenced because some of them \nare very dangerous.\n  I see my friend from Idaho on the floor today.\n  One of things I hope we can do--I know he and I have worked very hard \nto do this over many years--is to do something about the mining law \nthat is so old and so antiquated in many ways. We have been willing to \nreform that, the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Nevada, but \nthe problem has been those people who want to change the law want to \nchange it so they get everything and the people who create the \nthousands and thousands of jobs--the highest-paid blue-collar jobs in \nAmerica are in the mining industry.\n  I would hope the Senator from Idaho will work with us, as he has in \nthe past, to try to figure out a breakthrough next year on how we can \ndo that. There are some real injustices out there now. I was glad to \nsee this administration overturn the mill site opinion that was written \nby one of Secretary Babbitt's assistants, which was one of the most \nillogical legal opinions I had ever seen on mill sites. This \nadministration reversed that. I told Secretary Norton, when they did \nthat, I would applaud publicly what they did, and I did do that. That \nhelped quite a bit, having done that.\n  But one of the things I think is so bad is we are doing so many \nthings to damage the ability of mining companies to not only continue \ntheir operations but develop new operations. I hope before too long we \ncan change\n\n[[Page S14321]]\n\nthat law. There is a way we can compromise this and give the \nenvironmental community some of the things they want but also certainly \ngive the mining industry what I believe is a very powerful tool, which \nis one of the few businesses in America today that is a net exporter. \nWe produce gold, and we export gold. It is wonderful we do that. We \nneed more businesses in America where we produce more than we can use.\n  So I hope the Senator from Idaho--and I know he will--will work with \nus next year to figure out some way to make a breakthrough through this \nmorass we find ourselves in. I have been working on this for many years \nto try to come up with some kind of compromise.\n  The mining companies bent over backwards for a compromise. We had a \ncompromise in the Interior appropriations bill a number of years ago. \nWe took it to conference, and the people in the House said: No, it is \nnot good enough for us. We want everything. They got nothing. That has \nbeen now 7, 8 years ago, and that is too bad, really too bad.\n  Mr. President, chapter 5 is called ``The Big Strike.''\n\n       The purchase of the Quartette by the Hopkins group was \n     important to the success of Searchlight. Without the large \n     initial infusion of capital into the Quartette operation, the \n     mine would not have been sunk deeper than any other mine in \n     the history of Searchlight. Without the deep shaft and the \n     subsequent huge ore strike, mining in this area would never \n     have developed. The extensive mining and exploration that \n     later occurred was all based on the early success of the \n     Quartette.\n       The Searchlight, the newspaper of early Searchlight, \n     promoted the town as the ``camp without a failure.'' Until \n     1907, when the newspaper changed its name, this phrase was on \n     the masthead, proudly broadcasting the area's prosperity to \n     the state and nation. The newspaper hoped to attract new \n     capital and people to the southern part of Nevada.\n       Shortly after the fateful telegram was sent by Macready, \n     the Quartette seemed destined to become a real bonanza. by \n     1903 Searchlight was the talk not only of Nevada but, \n     according to the local newspaper, of the whole mining world. \n     At what seemed to be the height of Searchlight's success, \n     however, labor problems erupted.\n       Union activity in Searchlight was the result of \n     organizational efforts of the Western Federation of Miners \n     (WFM), founded at Butte, Montana, in 1893, shortly before the \n     discovery of gold in Searchlight.\n\n  Mr. President, this strike about which I refer was a union strike, \nabout miners who struck.\n\n       Some have written that the creation of this union was the \n     ``birth sign of the coming militant industrialism of the \n     Industrial Workers of the World. In the first decade of the \n     twentieth century this union enjoyed success in its \n     activities in goldfield and to a lesser extent in tonopah.''\n       A costly labor strike almost brought the mining boom in \n     Searchlight to a standstill in 1903. Even though the union \n     focused on the Quartette, other operations panicked, and most \n     closed down until the strike was resolved.\n       The union strike, called on June 1, 1903, was precipitated \n     by a number of disputes, primarily a law passed on February \n     23, 1093, by the Nevada Legislature that limited the workday \n     to eight hours for most mining-related jobs, particularly \n     underground positions.\n       On June 1, the mine owners posted a notice ordering all \n     workers not affected by the new law to work nine hours. This \n     gave the union an issue. It is interesting to note, however, \n     that the only workers affected by the Quartette order were \n     three men who did not work in the mine or the smelter but \n     were hoistmen and trammers who were not covered by the new \n     law. The law stipulated an eight-hour workday not only for \n     underground miners but also for those who worked in smelters \n     and all other positions involving the reduction of refining \n     ores and metals. The strike was ostensibly called because of \n     these three men, but it also provided an opportunity for this \n     new labor organization to flex its muscles.\n       Initially the union had the support of most people in town, \n     who thought that the workers deserved better pay and \n     improvements in working conditions. Even the newspapers that \n     covered Searchlight, the Searchlight and the DeLamar Lode, \n     appeared to favor the goals of the striking workers. It also \n     was clear that the real issue was not the basic economic one \n     but whether labor or management was to control the \n     Searchlight workforce.\n       After the company's notice was posted, the union committee \n     asked the mine superintendent what would happen if the union \n     called the workers off the job. Management replied that the \n     mine would be closed. In fact, the mine was closed on June 1, \n     without the union's ordering work stoppage.\n       Anticipating union action, the owners of the Good Hope Mine \n     and the Duplex also terminated operations the day after the \n     shutdown by the Quartette owners. The provocative nature of \n     the mine owners' actions is clear when one realizes that in \n     all three of these mines, only three men were working nine-\n     hour shifts, and that was at the Quartette.\n       At first, public comment about the way the union was \n     conducting the strike was very positive. The press and \n     Searchlight residents were favorably impressed that there was \n     no violence. In fact, the union helped foster positive public \n     relations by allowing four of its union men to be engaged in \n     working the pumps at the lower levels in the Quartette, where \n     water would have accumulated, damaging equipment and the \n     workings in the shaft and drifts, if the pumps had not been \n     kept operating.\n       The union movement in the western United States was in its \n     infancy at this time, especially in the mining industry. \n     Strategies for resolving impasses between labor and \n     management were not well developed, and the two parties were \n     experimenting with ways to end disputes like this. The union \n     wanted to appear tough and strong, even resilient, and the \n     mine owners wanted to put an end to the union before it \n     gathered strength.\n       In the early days of the strike there was considerable talk \n     of arbitration, but that was very short-lived. In the DeLamar \n     Lode of June 23, the prospects for settlement were more vague \n     than ever. In fact, the mine owners and managers had left for \n     Los Angeles almost as soon as the strike started. The owners \n     indicated they would receive union representatives only in \n     Los Angeles, stipulating that all negotiations would have to \n     be conducted somewhere other than in Searchlight. This action \n     only made relations between the warring parties worse, since \n     during the early days of the strike various union \n     representatives from the national office often visited \n     Searchlight with the intent of negotiating with the \n     owners. They soon learned there was no management to meet \n     with unless they went to Los Angeles. The papers reported: \n     ``J.H. Vaughan, representative of the miners union, was in \n     the city Monday to see if the mine owners had anything to \n     say, or to see if they were desirous of a conference.'' \n     The same newspaper article observed: ``John C. Williams, \n     Vice President of the Western Federation of Miners, is \n     expected to be in camp tonight to take hold of the union \n     and end the strike.''\n       The local newspaper strongly condemned the owners' and \n     managers' retreat to California at the strike's inception. \n     Precisely, the Searchlight also reported in its June 26 \n     edition that it was the employers' intention to create an \n     issue to discredit the union. Again, the paper and the \n     townspeople clearly were on the side of the miners and not \n     the owners.\n       Because unionism was new in Nevada, and this type of labor \n     unrest was fresh in the western states, the union \n     representatives were continually trying to justify their \n     ability to sustain a long strike. When the owners, in effect, \n     refused to negotiate, the union announced that it had ample \n     funds to support the union miners for an indefinite period of \n     time. The company responded by announcing a policy inviting \n     nonunion men to apply for jobs.\n       As the contention continued, so did the competition for the \n     most marketable story describing the strike. Since the \n     Searchlight was published in Searchlight and was the paper \n     closet to the controversy, it seemed always to paint a \n     picture of peace and serenity during this time, wanting only \n     to project the image of a boomtown. The DeLamar Lode was the \n     newspaper in the town of Delamar, located in what was then \n     the upper part of Lincoln County, about 30 miles from \n     Caliente and 150 miles from Searchlight. On August 4, only \n     two months after the beginning of the dispute, the Lode \n     opined that only the bad people in the county were left in \n     Searchlight. The Lyon County Times, published in Yerington, \n     about 350 miles north of Searchlight, reported that the \n     miners at the Quartette struck to have their workday reduced \n     from twelve hours to eight. Such a report was ridiculous; at \n     no time in Searchlight's brief history had the miners been \n     required to work more than nine hours. The Searchlight wrote \n     a rare scathing editorial, attacking those who engaged in \n     perpetuating false rumors and emphasizing that the strike was \n     being conducted in a peaceful, orderly manner, on issues that \n     were strictly a matter of principle.\n       On July 3, 1903, Judge M.A. Murphy of the state district \n     court struck down the law establishing the eight-hour day in \n     mining-related work, ruling it unconstitutional. The court \n     declared that the legislation, being class in nature, was \n     invalid because it separated mining and milling from other \n     types of employment, violating the state constitution by \n     taking property without due process. In effect, the court \n     ruled that the Nevada Legislature had no right to dictate \n     hours to miners and mill workers when it did not set the same \n     standards for other types of work. Because of this, the \n     owners were being forced to work their property under \n     conditions that unfairly paralyzed them by having their \n     employees work fewer hours than other workers.\n       Immediately thereafter, the union, through John Williams, a \n     vice president, approved the strike despite the court's \n     interpretation of the recently passed law. The union again \n     declared its ability to withstand a long strike, since the \n     WFM had supplied the funding necessary for the duration of \n     the union activities.\n       Even though the owners and managers were not often in the \n     vicinity of Searchlight,\n\n[[Page S14322]]\n\n     they had obviously been plotting to ruin the union and end \n     the strike. Their first move was to form the Desert Mine \n     Operators Association. Although the association's bylaws \n     prohibited discrimination against union members, everyone \n     knew that the purpose of the organization was to stamp out \n     the union. The association even included mines in California, \n     as well as Searchlight's Quartette, Duplex, Good Hope, New \n     Era, Cyrus Noble, Southern Nevada, and Ranioler. The \n     formation of this association was the beginning of the end of \n     the effectiveness of the labor movement in Searchlight. The \n     owners began to investigate ways to reopen the mines with or \n     without the union miners.\n       The commercial interests in town formed a citizens' \n     committee to arrange a conference with the owners and the \n     union and to act as a liaison, carrying messages of hope \n     between the two warring parties. The Quartette officials, \n     representing all the other companies, refused to talk to \n     the union but professed a willingness to resume operations \n     and to take back all former employees--with the same wages \n     and hours that were in effect before the strike. Company \n     officials also indicated that when the mines began making \n     a profit again they would entertain a different wage \n     scale. This decision by the owners meant that underground \n     workers, as well as blacksmiths and engineers (who were \n     traditionally treated like miners), would work eight hours \n     and aboveground men would work nine hours. All others, \n     such as laborers and those on temporary jobs, would work \n     nine-hour shifts. The union rejected that offer, holding \n     out for a fifty-cent raise and an eight-hour day for all \n     mine-related work.\n       It didn't take long for businesses to start feeling the \n     effects of the mines' closure. Though there was significant \n     independent prospecting being conducted during the labor \n     unrest, it generated very little commercial trade.\n       The first strikebreakers, two miners from Los Angeles, \n     arrived in September. They didn't stay long, since they were \n     persuaded by the union not to go to work. Several days later, \n     two stagecoaches arrived with men who were to begin work at \n     the Quartette. The Searchlight of September 25 reported that \n     the Quartette had gone back into operation with thirty-five \n     men on its payroll, including miners and guards. Even though \n     this is a small number of employees, the company's action \n     demonstrated its determination to get the valuable property \n     back into production. Conversely, the union was doing \n     everything it could to prevent the mine from adding \n     employees, even stationing pickets at various locations, like \n     Manvel, Ibex, Needles, Goffs, and San Bernardino, to deter \n     the further importation of strikebreakers and other anti-\n     union activities. The union also appealed to other labor \n     organizations in Los Angeles and San Francisco, urging them \n     to make every effort to keep workers from coming to \n     Searchlight until the strike was settled, and it advertised \n     in the Joplin, Missouri, area--the home base of the union--to \n     warn hirelings of the situation in Searchlight.\n       By early October, however, the Quartette had started a \n     stamp mill, located next to the mine. It was obvious to all \n     that for the mill to operate the mine had to be producing \n     ore. Nevertheless, the union still talked as if it was \n     winning the dispute, even though it was apparent that the \n     mine was operating with nonunion workers.\n       One incident that added to the excitement during these \n     tense times was when the union learned that thirty \n     strikebreakers were en route by train to Manvel, on their way \n     to the Searchlight mines. The union organized a march along \n     the twenty-three miles from Searchlight to Manvel to \n     intercept them. After the long, grueling walk, however, they \n     learned that not a single strikebreaker was on the train.\n       The editorial position of the Searchlight took its first \n     turn against the union on October 2, noting that the union \n     was hurting its own cause by not working harder to resolve \n     the dispute. Recognizing that nonunion men were already being \n     shipped in to work, the editor further elaborated that the \n     new law, on the basis of which the strike had been called, \n     had since been declared illegal. The article made the case \n     that the two sides were crushing the life out of the new town \n     of Searchlight and stated that the business of the town was \n     being ruined and the storekeepers forced to operate at a \n     loss. This was the first editorial calling for an end to the \n     strike.\n       Just a week after this editorial appeared, the Quartette, \n     the Good Hope, and the Southern Nevada mines were back to \n     full operation. Simultaneously, the union suffered several \n     other setbacks, including the arrival of twenty-one workers \n     from Joplin, Missouri, and several more from the mines of \n     Colorado. The strikebreakers went to work under the \n     conditions that had existed before the strike began.\n       About this time, the Quartette opened its own general store \n     and even built bunkhouses for its workers, which provoked \n     extremely negative reactions from both the merchants and the \n     general population. The Quartette, located about a mile and a \n     half from the center of the city, was becoming its own town.\n       The Searchlight condemned the actions of the mine owners. \n     They were particularly galling to the paper because it had \n     recently run editorials supporting these companies. In \n     desperation the paper called on the union to end the \n     strike, but the union remained defiant. The newspaper \n     finally declared that the union had lost the goodwill and \n     sympathy of the community.\n       Even at its most intense, however, the strike in \n     Searchlight was orderly and nonviolent. The sheriff from the \n     county seat of Pioche periodically visited Searchlight to \n     monitor the situation, always returning with reports of \n     nothing more than rumors of disturbances. The entire period \n     of the strike was unusually calm.\n       The peaceful nature of the Searchlight strike was similar \n     to the minimal labor strife that the Comstock has experienced \n     a generation earlier. The Western Federation of Miners formed \n     its first union in southern Nevada in Tonopah in the summer \n     of 1901, and Tonopah escaped any real labor problems until \n     after World War I.\n       At nearby Goldfield, however, there were significant labor \n     disputes, marked by numerous episodes of violence. The unions \n     had obviously learned from the losses of the wfm in \n     Searchlight, for they became powerful in Tonopah and \n     Goldfield. In 1907 Goldfield was an armed camp. Several \n     shootings occurred, with one reported death. Eventually \n     President Theodore Roosevelt, at Governor John Spark's \n     request, sent federal troops to quell the quarreling \n     factions. In comparison, Searchlight had been very calm.\n       In January 1904 the courts again surprised the entire \n     Nevada mining community with a long overdue decision. The \n     Nevada Supreme Court overruled the district court and \n     declared the wages-and-hours law constitutional. The reason \n     for the strike had come full circle. But like its \n     predecessor, this final decision did not change the fact that \n     the union had been broken. The union continued operating in a \n     strike mode for the next year, even though almost all of the \n     union men had gone back to work. Those who returned to the \n     mines were required to sign a card agreeing not to \n     participate in union activities, pursuant to the Desert Mine \n     Operators Association rules.\n       In 1907 the same card system was put into a place in \n     Goldfield just before Roosevelt ordered federal troops to \n     Esmeralda County. The right of the companies to have \n     employees sign such a card was affirmed by the Nevada state \n     legislature in 1907.\n       The strike had a tremendous impact on the new town. The \n     merchants suffered in not being able to develop commercial \n     enterprises as quickly as they otherwise could have. Many \n     people experienced economic hardship as a result of the \n     strike, and workers with known union sympathies were laid \n     off. For example, James Lappin, foreman of the Quartette \n     Mine, was laid off as a result of his union leanings. His \n     wife, Lula, opened an ice cream parlor to provide income for \n     the family, but the store failed and the Lappins migrated to \n     Southern California where, at age fifty, James began a second \n     career as a farmer. He died in Anaheim, in 1908, at age \n     fifty-five, just about five years after being run out of \n     Searchlight. James Lappin's story was repeated numerous times \n     in the lives of the early inhabitants of this boomtown.\n       The labor-management problem in early Searchlight had a \n     very limited effect, however, setting the progress of the \n     town back for only about three months. Though the union and \n     townspeople kept referring to the ``strike,'' in reality it \n     didn't exist--the strike was actually broken early in the \n     dispute.\n       As mentioned above, much of the friction was caused by the \n     competing newspapers, the DeLamar Lode and the Searchlight. \n     The Lode, for example, had the strike settled by September 20 \n     when it reported: ``The backbone of the strike is broken. The \n     Quartette landed a number of men on its property yesterday to \n     begin work and to date things were moving as of old.'' The \n     Searchlight was more cautious. In its October 2 issue, it \n     reported: ``The strike situation that past week has shown \n     little change.''\n       The strike did have other, unintended consequences, \n     however. It was because of the pro-union stance taken by the \n     Searchlight and some of its advertisers that the Quartette \n     Company decided to start its own general store and other \n     competing businesses at the mine site. The action was clearly \n     an attempt to punish those businesses that went along with \n     the union leaders.\n       The dispute also caused the company to focus on labor \n     relations instead of on ways to improve the mine. One of the \n     Quartette's managers said in December 1903 that if the strike \n     had not occurred the company would have built a railroad from \n     Ibex to the camp.\n       In just three short months, the union was vanquished. \n     Though the exact date of the defeat is debatable, the \n     conclusion is not. Union activity disappeared and to this day \n     has never reappeared in Searchlight.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the end of chapter 5.\n  I got a call. The cloakroom called. I have a note that one woman from \nFrederick, MD, called. She likes the book. She called Barnes & Noble \nwho said it would take 2 weeks to get a copy. She said it would be good \nif I would speak more slowly so she can hear and understand the book.\n  I don't think I can do that. I don't speak very fast to begin with. I \nappreciate her being interested, though. You can get it at Barnes & \nNoble. If she came to Searchlight, she could buy one right there.\n  As I said, Searchlight was part of the busiest two-lane road in all \nof Nevada. But we have been able to get four lanes there now, half the \nway. That helped a\n\n[[Page S14323]]\n\nlot. They opened it a couple of weeks ago. It is not hard to go to \nSearchlight. Lots of people go there. As I indicated earlier, we have a \ngreat new McDonald's there. We had a store there that was opened by a \nwoman who was a fantastic artist. That young woman died at an early \nage, about a month ago. That closed that operation. But there is kind \nof a curio shop there. They would call it an antique shop here. They \nhave old mining equipment and things of that nature. We have a nice \nrestaurant and casino there. A long-time friend of mine added to \ninflation a lot about a year ago. For many years she advertised a \nnickel cup of coffee. She raised that to a dime. So now in Searchlight, \nyou can drive through there and get a cup of coffee for a dime. You \ndon't have to get anything else. I don't know how many people it draws, \nbut she has a dime cup of coffee.\n  She hired a new chef. She had one many years ago named Bill. He loved \nto fish. The lake is only 14 miles away. He would get huge amounts of \nfish, save them up, and then Bill the cook would have a fish fry for \nthe whole town. Great fish. But after he died, I have to tell you the \nfood was not very good there. They no long refer to him as a cook. Now \nthere is a chef in town. We have a chef in Searchlight. Every day, you \nsee the special--things like stuffed pork chops, spareribs; he even had \ngoulash one night. This guy knows what he is doing.\n  My wife and I look forward to going into Searchlight. My home is \nabout a mile and a half, 2 miles out; we are still in the metropolitan \narea, I guess you would call it.\n  The town has grown since I grew up there. There must be 1,000, 1,200 \npeople in the area. We love to go there now for one of the specials. So \nSearchlight is moving along.\n  We have a sewer system on one side of Searchlight. If you live on the \neast side of the highway, you have sewer. If you live on the west side, \nno luck: septic tanks.\n  I, was born there. I really left when I became a freshman in high \nschool. I went back, of course, to visit with my parents. I fell in \nlove with Searchlight. It is a place where I was born, where I grew up, \nand really developed a lot of the things I thought were right and \nwrong.\n  For many years in my congressional service, I didn't even have a real \nhouse. I had a mobile home I bought from my uncle, but I never felt \ngood in it. So 2 years ago this next month, my wife and I, after we had \ngotten our five children through school and college, built ourselves a \nmodest home in Searchlight. I love that place. It is such a nice \nretreat, going from the metropolitan Washington area out there 55 miles \nfrom Las Vegas.\n  We made a few mistakes in building that house. My wife actually did \nit. One of the mistakes she made was she put in a little sprinkler \nsystem and planted some stuff around the house. Well, the stuff was \neaten by rabbits in about a week. They hadn't had a feast like that \never, probably. So we went to the extension service and said: We would \nlike you to tell us what we can put in there that the rabbits won't \neat--rabbitproof. They loved that. They came back in a week or so. We \nspent some more money planting again.\n  This was even better. The rabbits learned there was something there, \nand they finished this off in 3 days--3 nights. They won't eat in the \ndaytime. Here we were. What were we going to do?\n  Looking around the desert, I noticed they didn't eat cactus, or I \nthought they didn't eat cactus. They didn't eat desert cactus. They ate \nmy cactus. We planted a bunch of cactus. I can't imagine how they can \ndo it, but they eat some cactus--not all of them. I don't know the \nnames of the cactus they don't eat. Some of the names I know. They \ndon't eat the cholla. They don't eat the beaver tails. They don't eat a \nplant that is not native to Searchlight, Ocotilla from Arizona, a long \nstringy plant with stems that go up very high. They don't eat those.\n  So I have replanted my house several times. They are good, these \nrabbits. What I did was, some of our big cactus, I told the cactus \nguy--Cactus Joe is his name--in Las Vegas. He brings his truck. ``Come \nand see what they ate, and bring something they don't eat.'' Oh, sure, \nthey are happy to bring Tommy Lee and his crew out. They planted--oh, \nman, some of these things were big, beautiful green cactus. I got up \nthe next morning, and they had ravaged my cactus.\n  They looked like these big things with big holes in them. They \nchomped them through. I called one of my friends in Las Vegas and said \nI needed some help--my friend Gary Bates. He responded and came out \nwith some wire, pliers, and all that kind of stuff. We picked some of \nthese cactus these rabbits wouldn't eat. Do you know, they figured a \nway to get through that wire. I don't know how they did that. I don't \nknow how they got those big ears through there, but they did. They \ndidn't ravage them; they just kind of chomped on them a little bit. I \nmight be able to save some of them.\n  So that is my story of my cactus.\n  I was out there, as I said, Saturday night. I had dinner with a \ncouple of my Senator friends in Searchlight. The first thing I did was \nlook at my cactus crop. It was dark, and I couldn't see. I was pleased \nit wasn't worse than it was. We planted some more Ocotilla, which is \nrabbitproof, proven from prior plantings of my Ocotilla.\n  These rabbits are interesting animals. I used to always like those \ncottontails. In Searchlight, we have cottontails, cute little rabbits \nabout so big. Then we have the big jackrabbits. I developed a strong \ndislike for cottontails because they are worse on my cactus than the \njackrabbits.\n  Anyway, I will take a sip of water and go to chapter 6. I guess there \nis no word about votes around here, so I will just keep reading.\n  Let's see, at 8:16 it will be 7 hours. My only regret is I should \nhave started earlier on my book. I was a little bit repetitive.\n  Before I start chapter 6, let me just say this. I understand the \nrules of the Senate pretty well, and I know today there could have been \na vote offered by somebody if I hadn't gotten the floor. There could \nhave been a vote on a motion to table somebody's amendment. I know the \nSenator from Arizona was going to offer an amendment because he told me \nso. Maybe it was an amendment the other side didn't like. I don't know. \nAnd tomorrow, or whenever we come in again, another amendment can be \noffered.\n  Under the rules of the Senate normally followed, when someone offers \nan amendment, the person who offers the amendment speaks on its behalf; \nthose opposed to the amendment speak against that amendment. The person \nwho offers it can speak for as long as they want, and the person who \nopposes it can speak for as long as they want. I wanted to make sure \ntoday that because of what we were told would happen, I was going to do \nwhat I could to see if it wouldn't happen.\n  I don't miss many votes. The only votes I have missed in recent years \nhave been for my friend, the junior Senator from Nevada. I have paired \nwith him on a number of occasions because of family issues; he has a \nyoung family, and I have been happy to do that. I don't mind missing a \nfew votes. I was not missing them. I was here. But I am happy to pair. \nWe used to do it a lot in the Senate. It was the thing to do. If \nsomebody had something important, we would vote yes or no.\n  We have become so interested in voting records. We vote on things \nhere that don't mean anything of importance. Most everything we vote on \nhere passes overwhelmingly, but we have to have votes: I can't miss \nthat judge's vote; oh, I can't do that. I say: It is going to pass; \neverybody is going to vote for him or her. Why worry about it? I can't \nmiss a vote.\n  But anyway, I have paired with my friend from Nevada on occasion. The \nlast time I paired with him, he had not been able to watch any of his \nson's football games the whole year because they don't play on Friday \nor Sunday.\n  He said: I sure would like to watch Trevor's game. I said: Go watch \nTrevor's game. It is more important than what we do on this occasion \nbecause a year from now, 2 years from now, your son's football game is \ngoing to be more important than the votes that happen here. I am glad \nhe watched his son's football game.\n  My friend, Senator Ensign, is glad he watched his son's football \ngame. The only point I am making is we have votes all the time. We can \nhave a vote tonight. I do not care. I am going to be\n\n[[Page S14324]]\n\nhere. It does not matter what time we have it. I am here all the time. \nWe can have votes tomorrow, but I understand the rules of the Senate, \nand we have to work together.\n  I want the record to be spread, as it has been, that this 30-hour \njudges thing is not the way to run this place. It is simply not right. \nIf we tried something like this I hope I would have the integrity to \nspeak out against it. I believe I would. I hope I do.\n  When we have so many important things to do in this Congress, we do \nnot have the time to spend 30 hours on our turndown of 4 judges that \nPresident Bush has put forward: We have approved 168 judges, turned \ndown 4. That is not the way to operate things.\n  I am very cooperative most of the time. I apologize if I have caused \nany inconvenience to any of my friends today, but I want to make sure \nthat the inconvenience caused to some today is something that will help \nus in the future have a more organized, friendly, cooperative \npartnership in the Senate. It is going to be hard for the next few days \ndoing that when we are going to spend 30 hours, starting Wednesday at 6 \ngoing until midnight on Thursday, talking about how badly--that is \nwrong--we have treated Miguel Estrada, Justice Owen, Judge Pickering, \nand General Pryor, people who, I repeat, have well-paying jobs.\n  Is it important that we devote our time to that? I mean, have a vigil \nfor 3 hours, not 30 hours. There is not going to be anything new said \nin 30 hours that could not be said in 3 hours. I am interested to see \nif anything new will be said in the whole 30 hours that has not been \nsaid already.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question without yielding \nthe floor?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to my friend from Illinois without losing the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada, through the \nChair, as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, each of these \nnominees who has been contested, four nominees who have been \ncontested--it is my understanding 168 of the President's nominees have \nbeen approved and four have been held, and as a member of this \ncommittee I can say to the Senator from Nevada, in preparation for my \nquestion, Miguel Estrada, I might mention there was a lengthy hearing. \nIt may have been two hearings, if I am not mistaken, and a lot of \nquestions asked by individual Senators and then several lengthy debates \non the floor of the Senate leading to the cloture votes.\n  In the case of the nominee, Priscilla Owen, who is a Texas Supreme \nCourt Justice, she was not only given a hearing and considered \npreviously and rejected, she was brought again for another \nconsideration by the committee and more debate on the floor.\n  When it comes to Attorney General Pryor of Arkansas, I can recall it \nwas a very lengthy hearing in the large hearing room over at the Hart \nBuilding, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and then with Judge \nPickering, another district court judge from Mississippi, who received \ntwo separate hearings, and then after those hearings was rejected, then \nbrought back again, more lengthy debate. So I ask the Senator from \nNevada, through the Chair, is it his belief that any of these four \nnominees have been treated rudely by the committee or denied an \nopportunity for a hearing or given a chance in the Senate to have had \ntheir qualifications considered before the votes were taken?\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, through the distinguished \nChair, there has never been any suggestion that these nominees were \ntreated like President Clinton's nominees and not given hearings. The \nanswer is, no.\n  I also say to my friend, assuming for purposes of this debate only, \nthat every one of the decisions we made--that is the Senate Democrats \nmade--with these four nominees, that we were wrong, we should not have \ndone it, is that any reason to take the time of this Senate to spend 30 \nhours on four nominees? I am only stating this for purposes of this \ndebate, that even if we made four wrong decisions, should we spend 30 \nhours of our time talking about what is going on? Thirty hours? I just \ncannot believe that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question, through the \nChair, without yielding the time?\n  Mr. REID. I would do that. Any time I hear someone shuffling around \nthe room, I am always hoping it is people coming to hear more about my \nbook. I am on chapter 6 and I can tell everybody it gets better. This \nis kind of the buildup. I thought the naming of the town was pretty \ngood. I thought the strike was pretty good.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would yield?\n  Mr. REID. I would say I thought my dissertation on the rabbits and \ncactus was okay. In fact, I wish I had known at the time how bad those \nrabbits were, and I may have talked about them in my book. I am \nbecoming more of a coyote fan all the time, hoping that they win more \nbattles with the rabbits.\n  Anyway, I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois for a \nquestion only, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, being from Illinois, I cannot get into the rabbit \nand cactus debate as some of my colleagues, perhaps my colleague from \nArizona might be able to, but I ask my colleague from the State of \nNevada, through the Chair, the following question: Is it his hope this \nevening we will lead to a point where there is a vote so that Members \nwill have a chance to vote before the end of the day? Is that the \nSenator's goal in taking the floor as he has?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I personally do not care whether we \nvote or not. I think it is late. I am not sure we need a vote. I am not \nsure people are here to vote, but I really do not care. I simply want \neveryone to know, as I have said on several occasions, that someone who \ncan be maybe not the most cooperative--but I think I am in the top 20 \nor so of being cooperative around here--I am happy to be cooperative in \nthe future. But I repeat, on more than one occasion I have said today \nthat we cannot be treated this way. We are part of the program here.\n  We cannot tell people who live in California there is going to be a \nvote. They ask, well, what time is that vote going to be on Monday?\n  Well, we don't know.\n  What is it going to be on?\n  We don't know, maybe something dealing with the Commerce-State-\nJustice.\n  Well, what if an amendment is going to be brought up, is it not going \nto be debated?\n  I don't know.\n  I had a call from somebody who had a schedule in the eastern part of \nthe United States today. He said: Should I come?\n  I said: I don't know. I am going to try to protect you, but I don't \nknow if I can.\n  Here we are. To compound things, tomorrow is a national holiday that \nSenator Daschle originally agreed to work and have votes on so we could \nget out of here.\n  So I don't know if there is going to be a vote. I don't know. I don't \nknow if there is going to be a vote. I really don't know, but maybe \nwhen I finish there will be a decision made on that. Maybe tomorrow we \nwill have a better idea of what the schedule is. I hope that in the \nscheduling for tomorrow we will have some definition tonight what that \nscheduling is going to be.\n  Those people in the West have lost their day. They cannot go West to \nenter into functions sponsored by veterans on Veterans Day. They cannot \ndo that now. They have been brought back here for various and sundry \nreasons, none of which they understand. If people had some idea \ntonight, there are still things on the East Coast that people could \nstill do tomorrow. I am sure maybe the Senator from Illinois, if he \nknew what the schedule was tomorrow he could return to the Chicago area \nor other parts of Illinois and do things. But those of us in the West \ncannot do that. So that is where we are.\n  Chapter 6, ``The Big Mine,'' M-I-N-E.\n\n       If one travels to Searchlight today and drives or walks \n     around the area, he or she will see scores of mines, mine \n     dumps, tailing remnants, gallows frames, and even collapsed \n     mill sites. The names of the mines are entertaining and \n     curious: Empire, Good Hope, Good Enough, New Era, Blossom, \n     Key, Tiger, Barney Riley, Rajah, Yucca, Shoshone, Ironclad, \n     Parallel, Searchlight Mining and Milling (M), Western, \n     Berdie, Pan American, Elvira, Mesa, Pompeii, Southern Nevada, \n     Telluride, Empire, Red Bird, Blue Bird, Saturn, Santa Fe, \n     Philadelphia, Eddie, Ora Flame, Carrie Nation, Magnolia, \n     Hyacinth, Poppy, Parrot, Spokane, Cushman, Dubuque, Golden \n     Garter, Silk Stocking, Eclipse, June Bug, Little Bug, \n     Cushman, Duplex, Water Spout, Cyrus Noble, Golden Rod,\n\n[[Page S14325]]\n\n     Water Wagon, Bellevue, Chief of the Hills, Crown King, Quaker \n     Girl, Iditarod, Greyhound, New York, Stratford, Quintette, \n     Columbia, Gold Legion, Calivada, Annette, Gold Coin, Gold \n     Dyke--these are but a sampling of the myriad claims that make \n     up the Searchlight mining district. A few of the mines were \n     sporadically good producers, especially the Duplex, Blossom, \n     Good Hope, and Good Enough.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield for a question not to exceed 1 minute, Mr. \nPresident, without my losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished Senator. While sitting in my \ncapacity as the acting Presiding Officer, going back to chapter four of \nyour book, I got a little confused as to how the city of Searchlight \nactually was named Searchlight. I got mixed up between Lloyd \nSearchlight and the kitchen matches. I was wondering if you, with your \nintimate knowledge of who is a chef and who is a cook and poor Bill who \nhas died--obviously you don't have any fish fries anymore, but I am \ninterested in the goulash--but with your intimate knowledge of \nSearchlight, do you have a theory, a pet theory as to how Searchlight \nactually got its name, of the three hypotheses that you mentioned?\n  Mr. REID. I actually know how Searchlight got its name, I say to my \nfriend through the distinguished Presiding Officer. Searchlight got its \nname because someone said, ``I found gold,'' and someone said he would \n``need a searchlight to find it.'' I feel fairly certain that was it.\n  I think, as I said in my book, if I took the naming of Searchlight to \na jury I would win, but not every time. We know the Lloyd Searchlight \nthing is history that, as I said, only deserved one paragraph. I gave \nit two. But it is not much of a theory.\n  But the one dealing with the matches is pretty good. I think that is \nsomething that a jury once in a while--if we did it 10 times, maybe 2 \nout of the 10 would find that.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the distinguished Senator would yield one more time--\n  Mr. REID. Under the same conditions.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Those were kitchen matches, not the modern?\n  Mr. REID. Oh, yes, I say to my friend who remembers those little \nwooden matches.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. He remembers those wooden matches. They still have them now \nbut usually they are hard to find and usually they have the real long \nones they use for lighting fireplaces.\n  Yes, the Senator from Kansas, I know, remembers those wood matches. I \ncompliment the Senator from Kansas for being so attentive. You did pick \nup a lot. You were here for quite a few chapters.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, if I could just ask one more additional \nquestion of the Senator?\n  Mr. REID. Under the same conditions.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Did you ever solve the problem with the rabbits with \nregard to the cactus they would eat or wouldn't eat? And I was \nwondering if you thought about just basically desert rocks? They have \nsome beautiful rocks out there and I doubt seriously if the rabbits \nwould have eaten the rocks.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the cactus is an ongoing saga. The cactus, I \nam working on that. I am not going to say in front of everybody how \nmuch money I have spent on cactus. My wife knows and is not very happy \nabout it. I hope she is not watching because I just spent a few more \ndollars.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Rubber tires, perhaps?\n  Mr. REID. Oh, no, my home is much nicer than rubber tires. In fact, \nwe do have a magnificent rock. I am glad you mentioned that.\n  In front of a great Joshua tree, we have a rock that was hauled to my \nhome that is as big as, oh, probably, four of these Senate desks put \ntogether. The reason it is so meaningful to me is, in the days as I was \na boy growing up, my father and uncles--and people in Searchlight--\nwould engage in single-jacking contests. Single-jacking contests are \ncontests where a man with a piece of hardened steel that has been \nsharpened very sharp, with a big hammer that you handled with one hand \nbut which had a great big head on it, not like a carpenter's hammer--\nthey would have contests during a 10-minute period of time to see how \ndeep you could dig into that rock.\n  Now I have that rock, where a number of contests were held, driving \nthese pieces of steel with a single-jack into these rocks. My dad \nparticipated in some of these events. As I drive into my home, there is \nthis great big rock and I take people out and show them these holes. I \ndon't know specifically which ones my dad was involved in, but he was a \nsingle-jacker in his earlier days.\n  I am glad you mentioned the rock.\n  My cousin, who has a master's degree--never used it--started mining \nfrom the time he was a few years younger than me. He started mining up \nat Crescent. I talked about him in the first part of my book because \nhis dad was very into that.\n  His son, never having worked in mines, decided that was what he was \ngoing to do. He spent the last 25 years or so working up there, making \nvery little money until the last few years. He didn't make any money \nfrom gold. But a Searchlight contractor came to him and saw this \nbeautiful rock that he dug out. It had no gold in it but it was red and \nall variations in color. He said: How about selling me some of this? So \nhe entered into a contract.\n  We build thousands of homes every year in Las Vegas. With water being \nas scarce as it is, there is a lot of desert landscaping going on in \nLas Vegas. My cousin has made a lot of money in recent years selling \nrock.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, if I could just ask one more question and \nI will desist.\n  Mr. REID. Under the same conditions, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thought perhaps with your cousin, again, you could \nreplace those cactus with rocks and I know the rabbits wouldn't eat the \nrocks. But in any case I think the operative thought would be to simply \n``rock on.''\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Kansas is absolutely right. \nWe probably should rock on.\n  I know this is not drawing a lot of people and certainly is not going \nto take away from Monday night football, but I did get a call from my \nfriend who is a Congressman from Nevada by the name of Jim Gibbons. Jim \nis somebody who has a distinguished military record. On the first \nflights that went to Iraq the first time, he was in the first formation \nof airplanes that went into Iraq through all that flak and other stuff.\n  He is an American war hero. He is a lawyer and a geologist. He served \nin the Nevada State Legislature. He is now a long-time Congressman. \nWhen he was in the State legislature, he initiated an action that led \nto the amending of the Nevada State Constitution to require a two-\nthirds vote on all tax issues.\n  Jim said: I am from Sparks; say something nice about Sparks. So I \nwill do that.\n  My first remembrance of Sparks, I say to my friend, Congressman Jim \nGibbons, was when I was a little boy. My hair was not as red as that of \none of the pages. She is not here tonight. But she has really red hair. \nPeople thought I had red hair, strawberry blonde, or red. It has turned \ngray.\n  The first thing I say to Congressman Gibbons about Sparks is, when I \nwas a little boy, the bus used to stop in Searchlight. A woman got off \nthe bus. I didn't know she had come from Sparks. Sparks is where the \nmental institution is. I was just standing there, this poor little kid. \nI must have been about 8 years old. She got off the bus and said: You \nlittle SOB, you have been following me. I am tired of it.\n  I was scared to death. That is my first memory of Sparks. I learned \nlater she had just gotten out of the insane asylum. This woman haunted \nme for weeks. My parents explained to me that she had come from an \ninsane asylum and she had not gotten it all together.\n  I say to Congressman Gibbons from Sparks, we still have the State \nmental institution. Sparks is a workingman's town. Sparks is connected \nto Reno. There is no space between the two towns. Sparks was a railroad \ntown. They are working on a better version of a railroad museum that \nneeds to be developed there. The railroad still goes through Sparks. It \nis still an important part of Sparks. It is a resort area. It is a very \nnice resort with a hotel and casino. It is a very nice place.\n\n[[Page S14326]]\n\n  So, Congressman Gibbons, Sparks is a great place. It is part of what \nmakes Nevada. One of the things that makes Nevada as good as it is is \nthe people who come from Nevada, not the least of whom is Congressman \nGibbons.\n  I probably should say something about Senator Ensign. I will have to \nsay a few things, I guess, about everybody. I don't want to hurt \nanyone's feelings. Senator Ensign and I have comparable backgrounds in \nmany respects. Senator Ensign is a long-time Nevadan. He spent most of \nhis time in Nevada as he was growing up in the Lake Tahoe area. I don't \nremember exactly, but I think about 6th through the 10th grades. He was \nan athlete there. He still calls Lake Tahoe one of his favorite places \nin Nevada. Senator Ensign, as we all know, served in the House of \nRepresentatives. Prior to doing that, he was a veterinarian in Las \nVegas. Senator Ensign and I hold the distinction of being alternates to \nthe military academy. And we say for those people who want to go to the \nacademy, if they can't make it to one of the academies, maybe they can \nwind up being a Senator. That is what happened to Senator Ensign, and \nthat is what happened to me.\n  John has a wonderful family. His father and I have been friends for \nmany years. Our congressional delegation is really growing. For many \nyears--from the time we became a State in 1864 until 1982--we only had \none Member of Congress. Now we have three House Members and two \nSenators. My old House seat is now held by Congresswoman Shelley \nBerkley.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Michigan in the Chamber. \nHe knows Shelley Berkley, a wonderful woman. She is so good at what she \ndoes. She has been a member of the State legislature in Nevada. She has \nbeen a member of the Board of Regents in Nevada. Now she is in her \nfourth term as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. She is a \nwonderful woman. She is married to a fine physician who is tremendously \nsupportive of her. She has had some very difficult elections, but not \nanymore. That is her congressional district which she represents \nextremely well.\n  We have a new seat. The seat Congressman Gibbons holds is a heavily \nRepublican district. The seat Congresswoman Berkley holds is a heavily \nDemocratic district. The seat Congressman Jon Porter holds is one of \nthe seats divided between Democrats and Republicans. He served \npreviously as mayor of Boulder City, then as a member of the Nevada \nState Senate, and was elected in the first term as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I appreciate Congressman Gibbons. If he or his staff, or both, are \nwatching what we are doing here today, as I said, I talked about \nSearchlight and Congressman Gibbons wanted to make sure I said \nsomething about Sparks. I am happy to do that. It is a pleasure to work \nwith the people who serve in the Nevada Congressional Delegation. They \nare wonderful people. I am proud of each one of them.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to. I know that by yielding for a question \nI don't give up the floor, but I always say ``without giving up my \nright to the floor'' just to make sure. Because the Chair changes all \nthe time, I want to make sure the Chair understands I don't have to say \n``without losing my right to the floor.''\n  I will be happy to yield for a question of my friend from Michigan as \nlong as the question doesn't exceed 2\\1/2\\ or 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I tried to catch as much as I possibly \ncould about the Senator's exposition of Searchlight on the monitor in \nour offices. It is an absolutely fascinating history which he has \nshared with the Senate.\n  I point out that the Senator who is doing this tonight is surely one \nof the most patient, determined, and beloved Members of the Senate. I \nask this question of him as somebody who I think in the Senate on both \nsides of the aisle is admired, as somebody who tries to keep this \ninstitution working, and who has accommodated every Member of this \nSenate over the years, be it Republicans or Democrats.\n  My question relates to Searchlight. I want to just see if the place I \nactually went through with my wife on our way to Death Valley, CA, \nmight have been Searchlight. We went through it at night. It was a town \nin Nevada--a very long town. It was in a valley. It was probably 10 \ntimes longer than it was wide. It was one of those nights where all the \nlights of the town sparkled. I am sure Nevada probably has some of the \nclearest air in the world. I wonder whether or not that is the shape of \nSearchlight. Is it a very long, rectangular town?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say to my friend, my friend went \nthrough Pahrump, not Searchlight. That was Pahrump. Searchlight is very \nshort. You are through Searchlight in less than a mile on the highway.\n  Pahrump is a town that is, by the way, now more than 40,000 people, \nunincorporated. It is a town that was blessed with large amounts of \nwater. Pahrump is some Indian term dealing with water. It has lots of \nwater. They actually grew cotton in large quantities in Pahrump for \nmany decades. It is very water intense.\n  With the growth of Las Vegas, Pahrump has become almost a bedroom \ncommunity for Las Vegas. It is one of gateways to Death Valley. It is a \nplace just as the distinguished Senator described, a long, narrow town \nthat goes on for miles. As I said, it is growing significantly and is \npart of Nye County, which is the second largest county in America, \nsecond only to San Bernardino County.\n\n  Let me say to my friend, I want the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan to know what a solace it is to me the Senator from Michigan is \nthe leading Democrat, the number one Democrat, the ranking member on \nthe Armed Services Committee. There are a lot of different \npersonalities and character traits we all have in the Senate. The \nSenator from Michigan has a couple, all positive. One is, nothing gets \nby the Senator from Michigan. There is not a sentence in the bill the \nSenator is involved in that he does not understand. There is not any \nagreement they enter into that the Senator is a part of that he does \nnot understand. When we deal with the defense and security of this \nNation, it does my heart good to know the Senator from Michigan is \ninvolved in helping make our country safe and secure.\n  I appreciate his kind comments. In an effort to indicate to the \nSenate my fondness for the Senator from Michigan, the first time I met \nthe senior Senator from Michigan, I was a member of the House of \nRepresentatives. We met. I proudly said to the Senator from Michigan, I \ncame to Washington with your brother, Sandy Levin. I said how much I \ncared about him. The Senator from Michigan said it very quickly: My \nbrother Sandy is not only my brother; he is my friend.\n  Having three brothers, that meant so much to me. I have always looked \nat the Senator from Michigan in the context of what he told me about \nhis brother Sandy.\n  I also say to my friend from Michigan, I had other things to do today \nthan be here and do what I am doing today. We are talking about \nSearchlight now. But for 3 hours I had to be aware of the Pastore rule \nand talk about the bill. I talked about that for approximately 3 more \nhours, about substantive issues. I tried to lay the groundwork in this \nbody to show that we, as the Senate, should be concerned about a number \nof things.\n  We should be concerned, as in this chart, about the things that are \ngoing up. Uninsured medical, going up. This is during the Bush term of \noffice, almost 3 years now. The number of poor is going up. The \nunemployed numbers are going way up. The budget deficit, the largest \never in this country; the national debt, going way up. I thought it \nwould be better that we as the Senate talk about the issues that are \ngoing up rather than spending 30 hours on something going down, the \nlowest rate of Federal vacancies in the Judiciary in almost 15 years.\n  The Senator understands procedures of this body as well as I do. The \nSenator understands the Senate was developed by our Founding Fathers \nnot to protect the majority; it was developed to protect the minority. \nThe minority has trouble protecting itself and the majority never does. \nIt was developed for more than protecting the Senate minority, but it \nwas set up to protect the minority so that in pieces of legislation \nwhere people had no advocacy\n\n[[Page S14327]]\n\nand only the moneyed interests were pushing through, the minority could \ndo something about it.\n  One area of responsibility we have as Senators is to protect what \ngoes on in the Senate. The distinguished majority whip came to the \nfloor the first thing this morning and said, I think it is unfair we \nhave been criticized for poor leadership--we, the Republicans. We have \ndone great things. We passed 10 appropriations bills; you only passed \nthree. We have done lots of good things.\n\n  What he failed to say--and anyone who knows anything about the Senate \nknows you cannot do things on a one-party basis here. They passed 10 \nappropriations bills because we let them, because we thought it was \ngood for this country.\n  When we were in the majority, they would not let us pass them, as we \nall remember. But this, as I said before, is not payback time. This is \ntime to be responsible.\n  We were on the path to pass all 13 appropriations bills. I talked to \nSenator Stevens on several occasions about ways to help him. The \nPresiding Officer knows we could have passed the Agriculture bill in \nless than 1 day. Why didn't we? Because as we are working hard, \nagreeing to work today, November 10th and on a holiday, November 11th, \nthere is a program being conducted to keep us in session from Wednesday \nat 6 until Thursday at midnight. To do what? To talk about \nunemployment? To talk about unemployment benefits? To talk about \nminimum wage? To talk about health care? To talk about the environment? \nTo talk about all the important issues we have to deal with? No, we are \ngoing to talk about Federal judges for 30 hours. Can you imagine that? \nThirty hours to talk about Federal judges.\n  What have we done that is such a bad job with judges? As I said to \nthe Senator from Illinois a little while ago, I say to my friend, \nassume the four judges we turned down--Estrada, Owen, Pickering, and \nPrior--assume we were wrong. Just for purposes of argument, we were \nwrong, we made a bad decision on every one of them. Is that any reason \nto hold up the Senate, and the country, for 30 hours? But the fact is, \nwe were not wrong. The fact is, we did the right thing for this country \nto keep out a man by the name of Pickering, who every civil rights \ngroup in America opposed. Every one. Every one. I am saying we did the \nright thing by keeping Miguel Estrada from going onto the bench. Why? \nBecause he thought he was somebody who did not have to answer questions \nlike everyone else. He thought because he was so smart and graduated \nfirst in his class that his intellectual abilities before the dumb \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee--he didn't have to deal with those \npeople. He could just waltz through. He didn't have to tell people how \nhe felt. He showed more of his arrogance when he said, I don't have to \ngive you the memorandum I wrote while I was in the Solicitor's Office. \nWe did the country a favor by turning him down.\n  We have done the country a favor by turning down Justice Owen, a \nTexas Supreme Court Justice who even the President's lawyer doesn't \nwant to be on the court. That is what he said in some of his opinions--\nhe dissented, she didn't--in Texas.\n  William Pryor--give me a break. We did the country another favor.\n  So we are going to spend 30 hours of this Senate's valuable time \ntalking about 4 judges who were turned down. How many have we approved? \nOne hundred sixty-eight. How many more on the calendar will we approve? \nI don't know, but we just have to arrange votes for them. I said to \nMembers of the Judiciary Committee who came here today, I don't like a \nlot of the 168 we voted on and approved, but I believe the President \nshould have wide latitude in picking these judges. We have given him \nwide latitude. We have only sifted out the very worst.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question without losing your \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to do that for my friend from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Are there not two other factors involved here: One, that \nin all four cases there has been significant debate on each of those \nfour judges before the votes that were cast, the cloture votes which \nwere cast? As a matter of fact, there is a suggestion there may be \nadditional cloture votes for which debates would be totally \nappropriate. If the majority is going to bring up additional cloture \nvotes on any of those judges, there would be debate before cloture on \nthose judges. But what the 30-hour proposal is, is something which does \nnot lead to votes.\n\n  Is the Senator from Michigan correct, there are no votes at the end \nof the 30-hour use of the Senate's time?\n  (Mr. BENNETT assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Michigan is absolutely correct. I say to \nthe Senator from Michigan, until Friday, all the time was going to be \ntaken by the majority. After public statements crying for fairness, in \nthe unanimous consent agreement here Friday they said we can take half \nthe time.\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend from Michigan, of course they have \nhad hearings. Some of these people we voted on numerous times, and \nevery time we vote on them it is the same argument. I can give the \narguments. I have listened to them so many times on the other side. We \nare going to spend 30 hours. Is there going to be a single new thing \nbrought up other than to berate us for destroying the system?\n  I repeat, Mr. President, on my blackberry here today I got something \nfrom the majority leader. Let me see if I can pull down to it here. I \nhave been getting a lot of messages I have not returned today. Let's \nsee what I can find. It is here on my blackberry. Here it is. Here is \nwhat it says: ``What we are doing to move our judicial nominations \nforward.'' That is the title of the deal here: Judges.\n  This year the Senate has suffered an unprecedented obstruction of a \nPresident's judicial nominees by filibuster. In the history of our \nNation this has never been done before.\n  Of course it has been done before. It has been done while I have been \nhere. I have not been here that long. It has been done just the last \nfew years. I do not have it here--yes, I do. Lisa has it up here. We \nknow that right here we have many judges who never even got a hearing, \nbut for Barkett, Paez, Berzon, we had to file a petition to invoke \ncloture, and cloture was invoked before we got to vote on these.\n  Now, on these, remember, you need 41 votes to stop a cloture. They \nalmost got it with Paez. For Berzon they got 34 votes; Barkett, 37 \nvotes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. So I say to my friend, what makes it even worse than these \npeople is what happened to my friend from Michigan. For my friend from \nMichigan, they would not even give his people hearings. They ignored \nhim. They are gone.\n  So I say to my friend from Michigan, we have been fair. We have been \nfair in the treatment of judges. We have done what we feel is fair, \n168. One hundred sixty eight, let's understand that. This is not \nanything that is too hard to understand. I know I am being somewhat \nfacetious here: 168 to 4--168 to 4--168 judges approved during the less \nthan 3 years this man has been President. We have turned down 4--1, 2, \n3, 4. That is how many we have turned down.\n  Now, does that deserve something? Does that deserve 30 hours in the \nlast few days, the waning hours of this Congress? I do not think so. I \ndo not think so.\n  Now, we have said many times this is not payback time. And that is \nestablished by this 168 to 4. Look at what happened--look at what \nhappened--during the Clinton years. Nominees blocked: 63. Percent \nblocked: 20 percent. Bush: 2 percent.\n  Now, as I said here earlier today, if we only blocked 2, and it \ndropped to 1 percent, do you think 15 hours is what they deserve for \ntalking about judges--15 hours, I say to my friend?\n\n  Well, I think we have treated them fairly. I do not know how many of \nthese 63 people who were treated poorly were from the State of \nMichigan, but I know of a couple because I have had conversations with \nmy friend from Michigan. I so appreciate the Senator bringing this to \nthe attention of the Senate through the questions that he has asked.\n  That is why we are here. As I said earlier, I have other things to \ndo. We all do. But I am here today not as Harry Reid, a Senator from \nNevada. I am here today as Harry Reid, the person representing the \nDemocrats who feel it is unfair that we are going to spend 30 hours, \nbeginning at 6 o'clock\n\n[[Page S14328]]\n\non Wednesday, going until midnight on Thursday, when we have such \nimportant things to do, and when we have bent over backward to make \nthis new majority leader's life a pleasant life. We have been so easy \non him because we believe that is our function.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield for a question without losing the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Without losing your right to the floor.\n  I wonder if your staff could put that other chart on with the judges \nbecause I just want to expand on one or two points. Some of the judges \nwhich the good Senator from Nevada pointed out were judges where \ncloture votes were required by the opponents of the judges; is that not \ncorrect, during the Clinton years, and it was required there be 60 \nvotes in order to get those cloture motions adopted?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We have here Rosemary Barkett, Eleventh Circuit, where \na cloture motion had to be filed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Now, does that not mean, for people who might be watching \nthis, that it was required that the supporters of that judge produce 60 \nvotes?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, that is absolutely right. Barkett, \nPaez, and Berzon all required 60 votes--60 votes. Without 60 votes, \nthese people could not serve. And so for someone to have the audacity \nto say: By filibuster, the first time it has been done in the history \nof our Nation; it has never been done before--it has been done not only \nhere but other times. Other times it has happened.\n  Now, I say to my friend, there have been other occasions where the \nfilibuster was conducted, and it was obvious to the nominee that person \nwas not going to be able to break the impasse, so to speak, and they \nquit. We know that Abe Fortas, who wanted to become the Chief Justice \nof the Supreme Court, he withdrew when he saw he could not get enough \nvotes to break the filibuster. So that is simply the fact. That is a \nfact of life.\n  So, please, I say to my friend, the majority leader, or anyone else, \ndo not say it has never happened before. We have done it four times \nthis year to protect our role. As the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, pointed out earlier today, our role, which article II, section \n2 of the Constitution of the United States states, is that we advise \nand consent to the President of the United States. We believe that is \nour role as it relates to those Federal judges.\n  These are lifetime appointments. These are very important positions. \nThey are prestigious. They are important. These judges have the ability \nof life and death through the stroke of a pen--life and death of an \nindividual, of a company, a course of action, a labor union, a \nbusiness.\n\n  So I think what we have done is appropriate. Would it be better for \nus to not have the advise and consent role--just say: President Bush, \nsend them all up. We will take them all. In fact, we will vote on 20 at \na time. Just bring them up. We will vote on them 20 at a time. We have \nnothing to say about it, so just put them on through.\n  Now the majority is going to come and say: Well, yes, but let's give \nthem up-or-down votes. What they are saying is: We do not want to play \nby our rules. We want to play by somebody else's rules.\n  They demanded filibusters, and we were able to break those. Thank \ngoodness there were some people on the other side who recognized this \nwas not right. But do not say we have never had filibusters. We have \nhad them.\n  I heard my friend, the distinguished Senator from Utah, the senior \nSenator, say: Yes, but those were friendly filibusters. Come on. What \nis a ``friendly filibuster''? I do not understand what that means. Even \nif that were not the case, there have been filibusters in the past.\n  So I say to the Senator from Michigan, I appreciate him being here \ntonight and talking about some of these issues with us. It is important \nthat we understand that the reason the majority has been able to do as \nwell as they have with the legislation this year is because we have \nworked with them.\n  I have no regrets about that. I think what we have done has been \ngood. But I also say to the very experienced senior Senator from \nMichigan, the Senate is not a place where you can just run over people. \nThe majority leader has a title, but it is not dictator. It is not: You \ndo whatever I say.\n  The only way he is going to continue to be successful is if we work \nwith him. And we will continue to do that. But we are not going to be \nstampeded.\n  When is the vote?\n  Oh, I don't know. Sometime on Monday.\n  Early or late?\n  Well, no, I haven't decided yet.\n  We have people living on the west coast who went home this weekend \nfor various reasons. They have to live by a rule like that when \ntomorrow is a national legal holiday?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for an additional \nquestion without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I will do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Nevada, probably more than anybody, has \nmade it possible for this Senate to run as smoothly as it does, even \nthough there are huge numbers of bumps in the road. There would be 100 \ntimes as many bumps in the road but for the willingness of the Senator \nfrom Nevada to work with Members on both sides of the aisle to get \nlegislation passed. He is constantly here in the well of the Senate \nasking people if they could cut the time down on their amendments, \ncould they drop amendments, could they work cooperatively with somebody \nto work jointly on a bill. It is a constant effort to keep the wheels \ngreased so we can accomplish as much as we do.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada this question: As somebody who is known \nto every Member of this Senate as someone who makes it possible for us \nto get a whole lot of things done, which we could not get done but for \nthat effort, is part of the cooperation which makes it possible for us \nto act cooperatively, to act with a sense of comity, which we do most \nof the time, is it not true that part of that is that there be a \nwillingness to share scheduling information with the minority so the \nminority can schedule airplanes, come back when there are going to be \nvotes, and that that is an essential part of a spirit of cooperation \nwhich is so essential to be President of the Senate, and whether that \nis something which the Senator is referring to when he talks about an \nunwillingness to give information about whether there would be votes \nand on what subjects today and tomorrow?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, Senator Daschle agreed that we would \nwork today and tomorrow, when all of a sudden we learned toward the \nmiddle of last week that the schedule this week was going to be \ninterrupted by 30 hours talking about four judges. We were dumbfounded. \nWe thought the report we first got had been mistaken, that they had \nmade it up. But we came to the realization that it is true. The \nmajority leader made a deal with somebody that they could spend 30 \nhours talking about these four judges. So then we agreed to go to \nAgriculture, which we figured we would do that. We could have finished \nthat more quickly than we did, but some of the Members were pretty \nupset. They were going to have to work Monday and Tuesday, when they \nhad lots of things to do at home.\n  Then when it came time for the schedule today and tomorrow, it is so \nvague. It is obvious they are doing things to protect people over here \nand not telling us who they are protecting and why.\n\n  This isn't some big cabal to take over the Senate, but it is a cabal \nof one to make sure people understand around here that if the Senate is \ngoing to be productive, it takes both Democrats and Republicans to be \nproductive.\n  We have set an exemplary record, as the history books will recount, \nof being very productive this year. We have allowed the production to \ngo forward because we thought it was in the best interest of the \ncountry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield for one additional question.\n  Mr. REID. I yield without losing the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the likelihood that we will be able to finish all the \nappropriations bills reduced when we spend 30 hours on some other \nsubject which, again, does not lead to a vote on those judges, but \nnonetheless is it less likely that we will be able to finish all the \nappropriations bills as a result of allocating that time to that debate \nand, as a result, if we do not finish the appropriations bills \nindividually, does this\n\n[[Page S14329]]\n\nmean it is more likely that we are going to end up with some kind of an \nomnibus appropriations bill which bollixes together three or four \nappropriations bills which should be and usually are treated \nseparately, amended separately, debated separately in the light of day?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, it is obvious. Think of that schedule, \n30 hours beginning at 6 o'clock Wednesday going all night, all night \nuntil midnight the next night. Is that going to bring about a fatigue \nfactor here? Of course, it will. People have to be here. All the staff \nhas to be here working hard. Of course, it is going to slow things \ndown. But not only slow down appropriations bills and conference \nreports, we have things here we should be doing.\n  I asked last week on several occasions, why can't we pass The \nMilitary Construction appropriations bill by voice vote? Well, it is \nobvious why not. They want to arrange it so that it is brought up here \nand a time for debate on it, just for lack of a better way to describe \nit, just to jerk us around. Why aren't we doing the Syria \nAccountability Act? I don't know. There is an hour and a half time set \non that.\n  I am confident the reason they didn't do it is because they have some \npeople who weren't here today. We don't know that, but that is why they \ndidn't vote on it today. We know that. They are protecting certain \npeople. None of us were protected because we weren't part of the \nschedule.\n  I would hope that we would do a better job of working together on a \nschedule. The Senator is right. We have worked together on trying to \nwork out amendments so there wouldn't be as many amendments and we \nwould have shorter time on the amendments. That is the only reason \nthese bills got passed, not only the appropriations bills but a long \nstring of bills that my friend from Kentucky this morning talked about, \nthings that they have accomplished.\n  They haven't accomplished them. We have accomplished them. No one, no \nRepublican or Democrat in the Senate can do it alone. This is a body \nwhere it takes, virtually for everything, unanimous consent. We all \nhave to work on it.\n  I would certainly hope that we would do a better job working together \nin the future and not try to do all this freelancing. I thank the \nSenator for his participation.\n  Mr. President, I began a long chapter here. I am going to proceed \nwith the town that my friend from Michigan almost came to but not \nquite. I spotted it in a second. He described it perfectly. We all know \nwhat Pahrump is like. It is just as it was described by the Senator \nfrom Michigan. There are wonderful people in Pahrump. I worked with him \non a lot of different projects, not the least of which is a nice two-\nlane road which was killing so many people. The two-lane road is now a \nfour-lane road.\n\n  One of my good friends, who was a prominent person in Pahrump, he and \nI served in the legislature together. He is a Republican. I am a \nDemocrat. Tim Hafen is a fine man who has worked so hard to develop \nthat town. He owns a lot of property. It has developed a lot. My \nbrother lives in Nye County, Amargosa Valley.\n  There are a number of things going on there, not the least of which \nis a huge dairy farm, 15,000 cows, something like that. There are lots \nof them.\n  On we go with the big mine, chapter 6. I know there has been a lot of \ndisappointment in that we weren't dealing with chapter 6 earlier. I got \noff the script dealing with rabbits.\n  I would just say this: I had always wanted so hard to find a picture \nof a coyote. They are such wiley animals, not seen very often.\n  So I was in Winnemucca. Someone was a sculptor there and they had \nthis Western display in Winnemucca, NV. I said: Have you ever known \nanybody to sculpt a coyote? He said: No. I said: Would you do one for \nme? He said: Yes.\n  I have it in my office upstairs. He did a wonderful job. At the time \nI did that, I didn't realize I was pulling so hard for the coyotes and \nagainst the rabbits. Since I built my place in Searchlight, I have \nbecome even a bigger fan of coyotes than I was before.\n\n       It was, however, with anticipation and great hope that the \n     early Searchlighters approached the future. In May 1904 the \n     headline in the local newspaper blared that the area was the \n     premier desert mining district. The first years of the boom \n     created much speculation and investment. By 1904 there were \n     seven mills within a mile of one another: Cyrus Noble, \n     Quartette, Duplex, Southern Nevada, Good Hope, M, and Santa \n     Fe. Unfortunately, soon after construction, several of the \n     mills were left without any ore to process.\n       The Cyrus Noble earned its name because the claim was sold \n     for a bottle of Cyrus Noble whiskey. Ten days before the \n     assessment work on the claim was due, the owner walked into a \n     Searchlight bar and shouted, ``What am I offered for my \n     claim?'' ``I'll give a cigar,'' one patron said. The offer \n     was accepted. Immediately afterward, the new owner crowed, \n     ``What am I offered for my claim? Another miner responded, \n     ``I'll give you this bottle of Cyrus Noble.'' ``Sold,'' \n     replied the new owner. The third owner made a good bargain \n     because, unlike many others, this claim did produce some \n     gold. Adjacent to the Cyrus Noble were other claims with \n     names that related to the bottle, such as the Little Brown \n     Jug.\n\n  I might say, Mr. President, that the Cyrus Noble, a whiskey company, \nproduced a collection; they are collector's items now--the bottles of \nwhiskey called Cyrus Noble. They are beautiful. I have most of them in \nmy house in Searchlight. They are of a prospector, a man playing a \npiano, an assayer, and lots of different things. I think I have 11 of \nthem. There may be more than that. Cyrus Noble is a famous little mine, \nby Searchlight standards.\n       The Duplex was the second-best mine in Searchlight, but it \n     was a very distant second place. Another good mine was the \n     Blossom, which was staked by George Butts. It produced a \n     small amount of high-grade ore, but Butts didn't have the \n     money to work it. While trying to sell the mine, he lived on \n     the property in abject poverty in a hut built of Joshua \n     trees. For more than a year he lived in these harsh \n     conditions, holding out for his price. George Butts was given \n     many offers for the claim, but he held out for $25,000, a \n     huge price in that day. After almost two years had gone by, \n     he got his $25,000. He died three days after the sale.\n       Speculation was not limited to minerals. In December 1907 \n     news reached Searchlight that oil had been struck midway \n     between the town and Needles. According to the story, the \n     Wayne Oil Company was confident that a large oil deposit lay \n     beneath the surface. Like many other strike rumors, this one \n     also went bust. The story was never mentioned again, but the \n     anticipation must have been intense.\n       The only real world-class mine in the history of \n     Searchlight was the Quartette. From 1899, when Macready \n     disobeyed the order to stop further work in the Quartette, \n     this mine became Searchlight's biggest and best. For the \n     first decade of Searchlight's existence, the Quartette was \n     the premier mine. Anyone writing or talking about the camp \n     lifted up the mighty Quartette as a beacon of Searchlight's \n     progress. Even after mining had all but disappeared in the \n     area, it was still a fine mine, continuing to produce small \n     amounts of gold up until the 1960s. it was the best in \n     Searchlight.\n       During the decade of mining dominance, from 1899 to 1908, \n     not only was the Quartette the biggest producer in the whole \n     of southern Nevada, but several times it was also the largest \n     producer in Nevada and one of the biggest in the entire \n     United States.\n       From its inauspicious beginning, the Quartette developed \n     into a mine with multiple shafts. The main shaft, or the \n     glory hole, was sunk to a depth of 1,350 feet. As with many \n     mines of the day, an air shaft was usually sunk to help with \n     the circulation of air in the main shaft, its drifts, \n     crosscuts, and other diggings. The Quartette was no \n     different; it used an air shaft that initially started at the \n     600-foot level and then was raised to the surface. Eventually \n     the shaft was extended down to the 900-foot level when bad \n     air necessitated that fresh air be circulated to the lower \n     levels. Other shafts sunk over the years were distinguished \n     by the names the Carlton, the Crocker, and Shaft #3. These \n     were not cut to great depths, and most were used for ore \n     exploration purposes.\n       W.J. Sinclair, one of the first dozen men to enter Tonopah \n     and one of the wealthiest men of Nevada, stated in 1904: ``I \n     doff my hat to Searchlight, for you certainly have in the \n     Quartette, the biggest gold mine in the country. I have seen \n     many wonderful showings, but never the equal of the \n     Quartette.''\n\n  Mr. President, I have an illustration in my book that shows the \nhundreds and hundreds of mining claims in Searchlight history. It was a \nvery big dig for a decade or more.\n\n       The Searchlight newspaper opined shortly thereafter: \n     ``Searchlight is justly proud of the Quartette mine for it \n     is, as it stands today, the biggest and best mine in the \n     Southwest. As a free milling proposition it is unequalled by \n     any mine in the United States, and considering the amount of \n     development done it is one of the largest in the world.''\n       There was a strong basis for this optimism. In November \n     1903 the mine was working three full shifts, and the mill \n     would begin working three shifts by early 1905. Modern \n     equipment was installed that allowed electric arc lights to \n     shine in the night desert\n\n[[Page S14330]]\n\n     sky, pointing out the location of the famous hole in the \n     ground. The electric lights on the surface were duplicated in \n     the underground workings as well. In 1904 the Quartette \n     milling operations were electrified. There were telephones on \n     the surface and in certain stations underground. At no time, \n     however, did the Quartette Company share its electrical power \n     generation capabilities with the town. Searchlight would \n     later have to develop its own system of electricity.\n       After the cessation of mining activities in the mine, there \n     was still much talk of the width and depth of the Quartette \n     ore vein; it was indeed the stuff of which legends are made. \n     At the 700-foot level the ore body was described as being \n     more than 14 feet high and averaging $100 per ton, a figure \n     representing more than four ounces per ton. By today's \n     standard this gold would be worth more than $1,500 per ton. \n     Currently, gold ore in Nevada is mined at significantly less \n     than four ounces per ton; many times are worked when the ore \n     grade has only one tenth of an ounce per ton and sometimes \n     even less. At just one station at the 700-foot level, the \n     stope (a steplike excavation underground for the removal of \n     ore that is formed as the ore is mined in successive layers) \n     was described as being 18 feet by 40 feet and needing 18,000 \n     square feet of timbers for just that one station. By 1906, \n     when the mine had reached the 900-foot level, the vein was \n     measured to be 60 feet wide. In addition to these huge bodies \n     of moderately good ore, another strike occurred on the 700-\n     foot level, which assayed an astounding forty-four ounces per \n     ton; by today's standard, the ore would be worth more than \n     $17,750 per ton. The huge stopes dug out to retrieve the ore \n     were basically underground caverns supported by timbers or \n     by pillars of dirt not removed during excavation, even \n     though valuable, but left to provide support to keep the \n     ground from collapsing.\n       The early mining in the Quartette, and in all of the mines \n     in Searchlight, was performed by hand. Two methods of \n     drilling were used. The first was single jacking: one man \n     with a large hammer simultaneously hit and turned a sharpened \n     piece of steel. The other method was double jacking: one man \n     held a large, long-handled hammer or mallet with both hands, \n     striking a piece of steel that was held and turned by another \n     man. After the holes were drilled, dynamite was packed into \n     the cavities; a cap attached to a fuse was lit, causing the \n     cap to explode and ignite the dynamite charge. This same \n     method was used in shafts and for tunneling work.\n       Occupational safety was almost an afterthought. Miners \n     didn't wear hard hats in Searchlight until World War II. They \n     wore cloth hats with a mount on the front upon which to hook \n     their carbide lanterns. Carbide is a binary compound that \n     produces an ignitable gas when combined with water, thus \n     allowing miners to see underground.\n       After Hopkins purchased the Quartette, the work gradually \n     became mechanized. Gasoline combustion engines were used to \n     power hoists for removing muck and ore from the shafts. Hand \n     power was used to tram the material to the shaft from the \n     various tunnels--drifts, crosscuts, winces, and raises. This \n     waste and ore was placed in cars and trams that ran on iron \n     tracks laid like a miniature railroad. At the shaft, the \n     bucket or tram was put on skids and hoisted to the top.\n       In the smaller mines, the ore and waste products were \n     brought to the surface by various means, the cheapest being a \n     windlass. A windlass was normally a rounded wooden shaft with \n     a crank on one side end, which had the rope or cable wound \n     around it. When the crank was turned, the rope or cable wound \n     around the shaft, bringing the materials to the surface. \n     Other more elaborate hoisting methods used horses or mules to \n     turn the crank and bring the earth up to the surface.\n       Even the quarters for the mine bosses at the Quartette were \n     impressive. In 1905 new quarters constructed for the \n     superintendent and other supervisory personnel included \n     lounging and reading rooms. Colonel Hopkins had a complete \n     private suite, even though he spent most of his time \n     outside the district, in either Los Angeles or Boston.\n       It was reported in 1905 that even more modern provisions \n     would come to the depths of the mine, in the form of new \n     drilling equipment. A new compressor on the surface would \n     supply a new drilling apparatus for drilling uppers, making \n     it easier to place drill holes on the upper reaches of the \n     adit. This method replaced the single and double jacking for \n     much of the work in the Quartette. About the same time, a \n     small timber mill was installed, including a tip saw, swing, \n     cut-off, and wedge saw for the preparation of the mine \n     timbers.\n       When the main shaft reached the 800-foot level, the modern \n     hoisting equipment allowed the skip, which held three \n     thousand pounds of ore or waste, to go to the bottom and back \n     to the top in three minutes. The hoist was operated by a 60-\n     horsepower Fairbanks-Morse engine, at the time the largest \n     made in the world. Despite all the expenditures for supplies \n     and equipment, it was determined in the summer of 1905 that \n     it cost only $5 per ton to mine and process the Quartette's \n     ore.\n       Throughout its entire period of operation, the Quartette \n     required timbers in large quantities for square-set \n     timbering. The square-set process was invented by Philip \n     Deidesheimer, who was brought to Virginia City during the \n     Comstock era to solve the extremely dangerous problem of \n     cave-ins, which frequently caused injury and death. He \n     developed the system in just two weeks. His plan was to frame \n     timbers together in rectangular sets, each set being composed \n     of a square based, placed horizontally, formed of four \n     timbers, sills, and crosspieces from four to six feet long, \n     surmounted at the corners by four posts from six to seven \n     feet high, and capped by a framework similar to the base. The \n     cap pieces forming the tip of any set simultaneously \n     functioned as the sills or base of the next set above. These \n     sets could readily be extended to any required height and \n     could be spread over any given area, forming a series of \n     horizontal floors, built up from the bottom sets like the \n     successive stories of a house. The spaces between the timbers \n     were filled with waste rock, forming a solid cube, whenever \n     the maximum degree of firmness was desired.\n       Not only did this method of timbering provide strength, but \n     it also allowed the timbers to move with shifts in the \n     ground. The slight shifting of the ground would twist \n     normal braces of timbers loose, but with Deidesheimer's \n     square-set method, the bracing remained firm. In \n     Searchlight much of the ground required the square-set \n     method, and experienced timberers were always at a \n     premium.\n       The Quartette constantly had trouble finding a sufficient \n     supply of wood for its timbering. In September 1905 it was \n     reported that it became so difficult to get the timber from \n     Southern California suppliers that the company ordered \n     500,000 feet of the product from the Northwest. It was a time \n     when huge amounts of timbers were needed because the shaft \n     was reaching the 1,000-foot level.\n       In addition to the timbering method of shoring up the loose \n     and dangerous ground, many of the stopes were buttressed by \n     leaving pillars of ore to hold the ground from caving in. In \n     the later leasing years, even though the procedure was \n     dangerous, the pillars of ore would be taken, leaving the \n     ground without support.\n       The Quartette used timbering only as a last resort. This is \n     clear from early statements made by Colonel Hopkins, who, \n     when asked in 1906 if the company could take more ore than it \n     was currently processing, replied, ``It is not because we \n     have not the desire to take out as much metal as possible in \n     a given time, but simply because we are compelled to protect \n     our mine from the possibility of collapse owing to the \n     character of the walls. With an increased output it would be \n     for us necessary to do much costly timbering to keep the mine \n     from caving in that it would not be worthwhile, whereas at \n     present we are safe from disaster and are doing very well \n     indeed with our investment. In the course of time we will \n     reach a stage we can work upward and then will be asked to \n     mine on a larger scale.''\n       By June 1905 the Quartette had already produced more than \n     $800,000.\n\n  (Ms. MURKOWSKI assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that was a huge amount of money in 1905.\n\n       Before the end of the same year, the mine would have \n     produced more than $1 million, a huge sum of money for just \n     after the turn of the century. In August 1905, 325 men were \n     employed in the mines in Searchlight, this figure did not \n     include the many supporting workers such as teamsters, \n     millers, and the businesses that supported the town and the \n     mine workers. Seventy-five of these men were employed in \n     assessment work and by contract--that is, they were not \n     employed for wages as other miners were. By far the largest \n     employer in the county was the Quartette Company.\n       As late as 1908 there were those who wrote that because \n     gold was still present at depths of nearly 1,000 feet, the \n     mine would have a virtually inexhaustible supply of good ore.\n       About the same time that the Quartette's river mill began \n     operating with ore supplied by the company's own railroad, \n     water was hit at the mine. In fact, one of the interesting \n     phenomena in the Searchlight area was that some of the mines \n     hit water at relatively shallow depths. The Santa Fe, located \n     about a mile and a half from the Quartette, found water at \n     less than a hundred feet. The Quartette didn't hit water \n     until about the 500-foot level. The local newspaper reported: \n     ``It is supposed to be the scarcest article in the desert, \n     but mine after mine here is developing water in unheard of \n     quantities.'' Even though the water came at relatively deeper \n     levels in Searchlight, when water was reached, it appeared in \n     large quantities. At the beginning of 1908, the Quartette was \n     pumping 200,000 gallons a day out of the mine.\n       The dewatering of the mine allowed the company to build a \n     mill closer to the mine site. By October 1906 the twenty-\n     stamp mill was crushing 2,000 tons monthly. Like the rest of \n     its operation, the mills of the Quartette were state-of-the \n     art facilities. By the end of the year the company had added \n     another full twenty-stamp mills and was then milling more \n     than 4,000 tons each month. These mill were used well into \n     the 1920s before they were replaced by ball mills, which were \n     much more efficient and less costly, requiring significantly \n     less maintenance.\n       By the summer of 1909 the 1,200-foot level had been reached \n     in the main shaft. In August ore of a very high value was \n     found in one of the drifts at the 1,100-foot level. At the \n     same time a new ore body was announced at sites between 400 \n     feet and 500 feet down in the workings.\n\n[[Page S14331]]\n\n       The bowels of this magnificent mine were extraordinary. \n     Even as early as 1906, the description of the mine was \n     inspirational: ``It would take several hours to make even a \n     hurried trip through the several miles of underground \n     workings. The mystical maze of drifts, slopes, upraises, \n     crosscuts and winces confuses one . . . and the visitor \n     simply loses what mental balance he has left and becomes \n     simply a human exclamation point and ejaculates an endless \n     strings of Oh's and Ah's.''\n       From the main shaft extended various drifts, nearly \n     horizontal mine passageways driven on or parallel to the \n     course of the vein. On the 200-foot level the drift west was \n     driven more than 1,000 feet.\n\n  Madam President, I have a couple pages more, and then I understand we \nwill have the closing script, and I will take a look at it.\n\n       It is difficult to imagine the danger and hardship of \n     working in these huge caverns. The only preserved account of \n     the adversity came in 1934, from someone who had been in the \n     Quartette in 1912: ``The temperature was at 105 degrees, at \n     the 1,200 and 1,300 foot levels, with the ground being very \n     soft. The working conditions on the east face of the 1,200 \n     and 1,300 foot levels were almost impossible even though the \n     ore was still good. The work at almost all levels was most \n     difficult because the stoping had been done improperly.''\n       This letter was written many years later, when Charles \n     Jonas, formerly the superintendent for Hopkins and a \n     subsequent lessee, was attempting to get financing for the \n     mine. He had firsthand knowledge of the operation because he \n     had been involved in the mine since at least 1912. Jonas \n     observed that ore was removed in such a manner that no others \n     would later be able to work the mine in the area where the \n     stoping had occurred. Not only was the ground bad and the \n     underground working hot, but miners were also constantly \n     fighting the never-ending encroachment of water. As late as \n     the 1940s, residents of Searchlight could still feel and hear \n     the Quartette's big stopes caving.\n       In 1909 the Great Quartette Mine was still producing \n     $500,000 a year, but even as early as 1908, there were rumors \n     that the mine was beginning to fail, and the owners were \n     reported to be negotiating a sale to an English syndicate for \n     $4 million.\n       The demise of the Quartette began when Colonel Hopkins \n     decided he wanted to turn the management over to others. In \n     January 1910 Hopkins's son, Walter, became the assistant mine \n     manager. Immediately afterward came the first mention of \n     leasing out operations, even though the reports showed \n     that the mine was doing well. But in June, thirty-five of \n     the forty stamps in the mill were silenced.\n       By the end of 1911 the Quartette was being leased to many \n     different individuals, much like sharecropping in the South. \n     Different areas of the old mine would be mined by lessees, \n     and the Quartette Company would receive a royalty or \n     percentage of the ore taken out by the lessees.\n       From a review of the mining statistics for the year ending \n     December 1909, the figure for Clark County, almost 12,000 \n     tons, basically referred to mining in Searchlight--no \n     significant mining activity had gone on elsewhere in the \n     county during the preceding decade. For the same period in \n     1910, the tonnage dropped to 2,400 tons. The main obstacle to \n     further success was the extremely high cost of taking ore \n     from such deep areas of the mine. It is clear that the \n     leasing emerged for primarily economic reasons.\n       By July nine lessees were operating above the 100-foot \n     level in the Quartette. It was said that the mine was a \n     leaser's mecca because the lessees had some good luck \n     reworking the tailings. Most of the work was at the upper \n     levels of the mine, with some miners sinking new shallow \n     shafts. By the end of 1922 a significant amount of work was \n     being conducted near the surface of the old glory hole, the \n     shaft Macready had opened to start the Quartette. In January \n     and February lessees hit ore at 20 feet, 40 feet, and 1,350 \n     feet.\n       Most of the mining camps in Nevada experienced much the \n     same evolution as Searchlight, with leasing following the \n     initial production. Tonopah, however, was unusual in that the \n     leasing came first. Within a year of the initial discovery of \n     gold in Tonopah, Jim Butler, the discoverer, had granted more \n     than a hundred leases on his property. He received a 25 \n     percent royalty on the production of the ore. In Searchlight \n     the formation of the large mining companies came shortly \n     after the discovery of the valuable minerals. In Tonopah the \n     large companies came after the leasing era.\n       Some believed that the labor unrest of 1903 encouraged \n     miners to secrete certain valuable ore deposits during and \n     shortly after the strike. This information was a good basis \n     for the mystic mind of the miner who envisioned hidden \n     treasures of gold deposits. In the report to investors in \n     1934, Jonas would write, ``The prior leasing operations \n     success depended upon the secret knowledge held by certain \n     people who had secured this information from the unscrupulous \n     group who operated the mine prior to 1905.''\n       Leasing of any consequence at this great mine was basically \n     concluded by 1917. The success of the lessees is not fully \n     known. Though some miners did quite well, most made \n     insignificant profits. Montgomery-Jones earned $40,000; Post, \n     $20,000; Holmes-Jones, $80,000; Hockbee, $15,000; Pemberton, \n     $5,000; Hudgens, $40,000; and McCormick, $40,000. The \n     discovery of new ore deposits was negligible, with most of \n     the value coming from the recovery of ore left by the \n     Quartette Company for safety reasons. The lessees would \n     simply remove the dirt pillars, causing further degradation \n     of the mine. Several had good luck near the surface, such as \n     John Hudgens, who worked the surface east of the air shaft. \n     He removed $40,000 of ore from the Quartette by going after \n     some ore left behind by the Hopkins group. But years later, \n     in 1931, his son and grandson obtained another lease on the \n     Quartette. They took out about 60 tons that assayed at $50 \n     per ton. This was a good find considering it came from an \n     area no larger than twenty feet by fifteen feet. McCormick \n     removed his value on the 600-foot level at a point of a drift \n     400 feet from the main shaft. This block of ore was \n     deliberately hidden by the crooked management of the 1903 era \n     and ran more than $200 per ton.\n       The mine that made Searchlight would continue to be \n     excavated for many years to come, but the glory hole was \n     rendered unusable, as were most all of the areas in the \n     Quartette that had been worked before 1917. The mine, with \n     its large caverns, was too dangerous even for the most \n     courageous and, at times, foolhardy miners. Most of the work \n     in the future would be promotional at best; never again would \n     the magnificent mine produce ore of any consequence. But \n     neither did any of the other mines in the district.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the end of chapter 6. I see here a closing \nscript. Let us see what is going to happen tomorrow, if I may just \nglance over this. I understand the leader is on his way.\n  I think this is an excellent schedule for tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to my friend from Vermont for a \nquestion only, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as always, I am impressed with my dear \nfriend, the senior Senator from Nevada, one of the finest people out of \nthe several hundred Senators with whom I have served in 29 years. I \nknow the senior Senator from Nevada to be one who cares deeply about \nthis institution and the way it works. He has been speaking at great \nlength and on matters of great interest to all of us today.\n  I ask my distinguished friend from Nevada, is it not true the senior \nSenator from Nevada, like the senior Senator from Vermont and the \nsenior Senator from Michigan who is on the floor, would have been very \npleased if we had been doing the appropriations bills that by law we \nshould have finished on September 30 rather than having to try to \nfigure out the schedule the other side has put us in, a schedule that \naccomplishes, in this Senator's mind, absolutely nothing?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Vermont, in answering his question, \nthrough the Chair, I have experienced on this floor many times my \nadmiration and respect for the senior Senator from Vermont. As I said \nearlier today, I am proud of the record of the minority with the \nJudiciary Committee during the time we have been in the minority. I am \nproud of what we did when we were in the majority. I say to the former \nchairman, now the ranking member, we have done some outstanding things \nfor this President, not the least of which is approving 168 judges. I \nhope the American people understand this, that what we have going on \nthis coming Wednesday does not deal with anything important in this \ncountry. There is not a thing that will be said that will be different. \nWe have heard the speeches ad nauseam.\n  The first time I ever heard this--I am not sure it was original with \nhim--but my friend Mo Udall from Arizona, when he was in the House, \nwhen there was a big battle dealing with franking, he was chairman of \nthe franking committee and there was some kind of a dispute, and he \nsaid, everything has been said but not everyone has said it.\n  As I say, I do not know if that is original with him, but that is the \nfirst time I heard it. And with Estrada, with Pickering, with Owen, and \nwith Pryor, everything has been said more than once. What in the world \ndo we accomplish as a country, as a Senate, by spending this inordinate \namount of time on these judges? These two judges and two other people \nwho want to be judges.\n\n  I have a chart here that is right next to my friend. We have 20 \npercent of President Clinton's nominees who were blocked. They were \nblocked by filibusters or simply not holding hearings. There are \ndifferent ways of blocking judges.\n  What we have done is, we have held hearings. I commend my friend, the\n\n[[Page S14332]]\n\nsenior Senator from Vermont. You have held hearings in this process, \nduring the 3 years he has been President--and there will be a lot more. \nI bet by year's end that will be maybe 175, something like that, maybe \neven more than that. But it will be a larger number than 168. We have \nturned down 4.\n  So 20 percent of President Clinton's nominees blocked, 2 percent of \nPresident Bush's nominees blocked. Did we hold a vigil? We complained. \nBut as then-Majority Leader Trent Lott said: When he goes home, he \ndoesn't ever have anybody come up to him saying, Why aren't you doing \nsomething about the judges? He said it is a nonissue in Mississippi. It \nis a nonissue all over the country, except in the minds of these people \nwho, for some reason, think we have no obligation under the \nConstitution to give advice and consent to the President of the United \nStates. I think it is in the Constitution, and we are doing that. We \ndon't do it very often. We don't advise very much because we are not \nasked very much, but we should advise more. We are advising the \nPresident without having been asked. Four of these nominees, we don't \nthink they should be judges. To protect the American people, we have \nfailed to invoke cloture.\n  I will be happy to yield to my friend for a question without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I could ask him a question without his losing his right \nto the floor, I am sure the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada is \naware of this, but he has talked about the record. Does he believe that \npeople, including the press, might be surprised to know that in the 17 \nmonths the Democrats controlled the Senate during President Bush's \ncurrent term, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees and during \nthe 17 months the Republicans were in charge of the Senate, they \nconfirmed 68?\n  My point is not to say what a poor record they have; 68 would be a \nfine record, and they confirmed those 68 with the support of most of \nthe Democratic Senators.\n  But my question to the senior Senator from Nevada is, does it seem \nlike a little bit of crocodile tears when we hear from our friends on \nthe other side, What is this terrible slow-up, when actually during the \n17 months the Democrats were in charge, we confirmed more of President \nBush's nominees, considerably more, than the Republicans had during the \n17 months they have been in charge?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reclaiming my time, let me also remind the \ncountry--I don't need to remind the senior Senator from Vermont--during \nthat period of time we had some difficult times. The Senator from \nVermont received an anthrax threat; Senator Daschle, an anthrax threat \nthat made people sick. We don't know where they came from. People died \nas a result of that anthrax. It closed down the Hart Office Building. \nBut in spite of that, we held hearings.\n  I can remember going to a hearing in the basement of this Capitol--\njam-packed. It would have been easy for the Senator from Vermont to say \nwe don't have room. We had the hearing.\n  One of the people the long hearing was held on was Judge Pickering. \nWe held a hearing on Pickering. That was one when I was there. I know \nthat.\n  There were lots of problems. In spite of all the many problems, we \ncould have had lots of excuses, but we didn't say the Judiciary \nCommittee room was blocked, that Senators on the Judiciary Committee \ncouldn't go to their own offices. We didn't do that. We went ahead and \nprocessed these judges.\n  I extend my appreciation to the Senator from Vermont for an exemplary \njob as a committee chair.\n  I hope that, in the months to come, we will have a few more questions \nasked by the administration: What do you think about this person? Do \nyou think he would be good? Let's talk about it.\n  We haven't had that. This is a White House where it is their way or \nno way.\n  It is amazing to me that we as a Senate, when we have a war going on \nas we speak--I have been here in the Chamber. I don't know what the \nnews is. It is daytime now in Iraq. I don't know if there have been any \nmore deaths today. There were three yesterday. I don't know what is \ngoing on in Afghanistan. But maybe we should spend some time talking \nabout Afghanistan, Iraq, and the general war on terrorism rather than \non four people who have jobs. I think that would be a pretty good use \nof the Senate's time.\n  I think we have a schedule that looks pretty good for tomorrow. I \nhope we can work this out pretty soon, have the leader come and do \nwhatever closing business there is.\n  I have had a time today where I have been able to express what I \nthink are the sentiments of the Senate on what we should be doing this \ncoming Wednesday and how we could have, if you had used the time today \nand tomorrow to move toward the completion of this body's business. We \ncould have had a more productive day on Wednesday and Thursday and \nFriday, except for this reasoning which is lost on me, where we are \ngoing to spend 30 hours on four people who have good jobs. Miguel \nEstrada, I understand, makes half a million dollars a year. The rest of \nthe judges make about a half a million dollars between them.\n  We have staggering unemployment in this country--over 9 million \npeople for sure. Many people are not on the rolls because they have \nbeen out of work so long.\n  I spent a lot of time today talking about the minimum wage and how \ndesperate people are who work 40 hours a week at minimum wage, earning \n$10,700 a year--a year.\n  I read into the Record letters I got from people in Nevada where they \nare desperate for a job. One woman said for every opening, 50 people \napply.\n  One woman wrote and said: I worked for the airlines for 38 years. \nThey laid me off. I don't know what I'm going to do. She must be at \nleast 58 years old. I assume she went to work for TWA when she was 20. \nShe was laid off by American Airlines.\n  One of the women who wrote to me said she worked two minimum-wage \njobs just to get money for her family. Her husband is disabled. She \nwould move, but she can't afford to move. She is stuck.\n  We don't talk at all about these programs. As I said on several \noccasions, everything is going up; that is, the uninsured, the poor, \nthe unemployed. Many such things that are going up should be going \ndown. We aren't going to talk about those. No, we are going to talk \nabout something that is going down--judicial vacancies. This is the \nlowest rate in almost 15 years.\n\n  So we have a lot of important work to do in the Senate, and a \ntremendous kink has been thrown into the apparatus. But I hope today, \nand I hope in a dignified way, we have shown the majority and the \nAmerican people that the Senate is a partnership, a partnership between \nRepublicans and Democrats. We can't get anything done here unless we \nwork together. Secret schedules don't work--trying to let your Members \nknow that on Monday we will have a couple of votes but we haven't \nordered them.\n  What are we going to vote on? They haven't told us.\n  What time should our people come back? Well, votes during the day. On \nwhat? Well, State-Commerce-Justice.\n  As we all know, one Senator can offer an amendment and speak on it \nfor 2 minutes or 2 hours. Another Senator has a right to offer an \namendment. But what happens if suddenly the majority offers an \namendment and moves to table that amendment immediately? They can do \nthat.\n  They can do that. They have the majority. They can get a second on \nthat.\n  It wasn't fair to our folks over here. We have been so fair to the \nmajority. As the Senator from Michigan indicated, we work hard \ntogether. That is why it is disappointing when the majority whip came \non the floor today and talked about all of their accomplishments and \nhow little we accomplished when we were in the majority. The difference \nis that we worked with them to get things done. Now we stop things from \nhappening. We can stop things from happening. We showed that today. I \nhope we don't have to do this on a regular basis. I think there is work \nthat needs to be done, but it will only come to be if we work as \npartners and go back to the way we were a couple of weeks ago when we \nwere working hard to pass amendments to get appropriations bills \npassed; where again we developed meaningful conferences where we saw \npeople debating as has been the history of this body.\n  Fair credit reporting: Because of the tremendous relationship that \nthe\n\n[[Page S14333]]\n\nchairman of the committee has with our ranking member, Senator \nSarbanes, we were happy to go to conference on that which would be \nfair. I know Senator Shelby votes with both the majority and minority.\n  We have a lot to do in the Senate with so little time to complete it.\n  We live in a troubled world where people are so evil that they place \nexplosive devices in cars and drive these cars and blow themselves up \nas well as many people as they can.\n  In Saudi Arabia over the weekend, with this war on terrorism, they \ndrove into an area where there were no Americans but there were Arab \nworkers. I don't know how many have died or who are going to die as a \nresult of that but more than a score. Because of these senseless acts \nof violence, we need to work to bring about a higher standard of \nliving--something these terrorists won't be able to appeal to the \npeople who face very difficult economic conditions.\n  That is why I hope in Iraq we can have more involvement from the \ninternational community in the way of helping us pay for that \nsituation, helping us bring in peacekeepers so they can help bring \nabout peace in Iraq and work for a stable government run by Iraqis. \nIraqis are so much more fortunate than the people of Afghanistan \nbecause of their great natural resources.\n  Senators Daschle, Frist, McConnell, and I met a short time ago with \nthe Iraqi Governing Council. They said: People say we have the second \nlargest oil reserves in the world. We don't have the second largest oil \nreserves in the world. They have the largest oil reserves in the world. \nThey said in less than 2 years they will be producing 6 million barrels \nof oil a day.\n  In addition to the oil which they have, which is immense, they also \nhave water. The Tigris and Euphrates Valley was spoken about. In early \nhistory, it was the garden basket of the world. They are very fortunate \nto live in a country with such economic potential.\n  Afghanistan doesn't have that same ability to develop. They need our \nhelp. They haven't been getting help as indicated by the supplemental \nappropriations bill. Virtually all of that went to Iraq. Hardly any \nwent to Afghanistan. If there were ever a place for a grant, it would \nbe Afghanistan. If there were ever a place for a loan, it is Iraq. Loan \nthem the money and collateralize it with oil which will be produced in \nthe future. I think it would be better for the Iraqis knowing they \naren't getting handouts. That doesn't seem to be the way things are \ngoing. We need to continue to work our way through all of this.\n\n  I hope when we come back the two leaders will decide that the \nCommerce-State-Justice bill is something we should pass. I hope we can \ndo it quickly. It is something that needs to be done. It is an \nimportant bill. I have gone over it in some detail.\n  One thing I wanted to do is talk a little bit about Veterans Day. I \nhave talked about the veterans on several occasions today, but I hope \nleaders will do a good job of taking care of veterans in the future.\n  Like many soldiers who die on the battlefield, when Marine LCpl \nDonald Sparks died on the battlefield, the U.S. Government extended a \nhelping hand to Tina, his widow, paying her a small death benefit of \n$6,000. With the other hand, however, Uncle Sam is reaching into her \npocketbook to tax the same benefits.\n  As outrageous as it may be, taxing death benefits is just a symptom \nof a larger problem because of our failure to provide adequate benefits \nand incentives for the veterans and current troops of the All-Volunteer \nArmy.\n  Fifty-nine years ago, we passed the GI bill for the 16 million \nveterans who served in World War II. Most of them went for a couple of \nyears as the United States mobilized on a scale we hoped to never see \nagain. The GI bill helped these veterans return to civilian life by \nproviding opportunities for education and housing that they would not \nhave otherwise enjoyed.\n  Today, our military is different. We rely on volunteers, and our \nsecurity depends on our ability to maintain a steady force by \nrecruiting and training good troops. It is in our national interest to \nkeep turnover at a minimum.\n  How are we trying to accomplish this? Certainly not with a fat \npaycheck.\n  I let the majority leader know that whenever he is ready to come \nforward, I will be happy to yield the floor to him.\n  I heard from a constituent who was shocked that the Army had included \napplications for food stamps in the orientation material for his son-\nin-law, a sergeant with a young family. The fact is that soldiers' pay \nis barely enough for subsistence. Of course, nobody joins the military \nto get rich. Volunteers want to serve their country, and they \nappreciate the experience of military life. But in return for keeping \nour Nation secure, they deserve some security of their own. To provide \nthat security, we need the GI bill which offers tax breaks, better \nhealth care, and expanded education benefits for veterans and their \nmilitary families.\n  The Senate and House both passed military tax reform last week. \nPresident Bush should sign it into law as quickly as possible. These \nbills would double the death benefit to survivors to $12,000 and make \nit tax free. They also would allow military personnel to sell their \nhomes without paying capital gains taxes regardless of whether they \nlive in their houses long enough to claim a standard exemption.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. As I was just reading this, I think the tax law in this \ncountry is that if you sell a home you don't pay taxes on it.\n  I will be happy to yield to my friend from Michigan without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one of the areas which the Senator from \nNevada has led us to is the question of concurrent receipts. We are \ngoing to make some progress on that this year. I say that 90 percent of \nthe credit for the progress we are going to make in that area belongs \nto the Senator from Nevada. He was modest in mentioning it here in \nterms of what is before the Senate. The success we have had in \novercoming a veto threat from the administration--that if we finally \nallow people who are disabled to receive both the disability benefit as \nwell as a retirement benefit and not take away one benefit when they \nreceive the other--we were finally able to accomplish that because of \nthe leadership of the senior Senator from Nevada.\n  I want to ask him whether it is not accurate that one of the bills \nwhich awaits our consideration would be the conference report that \naccompanies the Defense authorization bill which contains the provision \nI just mentioned which would finally allow for at least the people who \nhave 50-percent disability or more the concurrent receipt of both their \ndisability benefit and their retirement benefit, and end the unfairness \nthat you cannot get a retirement benefit.\n\n  Mr. REID. My friend is absolutely right. That is such an important \nbill and important element of the bill. I know that some veterans \ngroups are dissatisfied. We have done so well to get as much as we \nhave. We will work for more in the future. I compliment the Senator \nfrom Michigan and Senator Warner for the good work they have done. I \nadmire and respect them for the work they have done.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. I indicate that what I have \ntalked about, this new bill, is not all encompassing. We also need to \nextend the child tax credit for working families; we need to renew the \ncommitment we made in the original GI bill and restate that taking care \nof Veterans Day and military families should be as high a priority for \nour Nation as rebuilding Iraq. It is a key to maintaining a well-\ntrained voluntary fighting force.\n  I say to the majority leader, if he is here ready to close, that is \ngood. If he is not, I will have to go back to my book.\n  I say to my friend, I have done pretty well. If I could have the \nleader's attention, I hope the leader has been advised as to the \napology that I made on the Senate floor. I tell the Senator that I \nindicated the remarks I made at the press conference last Friday were \nill-chosen and showed my frustration. I apologize. I have already done \nthat. But the leader is here and I am happy to do that. Although I did \nnot mention his name specifically, I don't think it would be hard to \nfigure out I was referring to the majority leader. I apologize for the \nchoice of words. The Senator from Tennessee may be a lot of things but \ncertainly he is not amateur. Previously today I talked about the deep\n\n[[Page S14334]]\n\nrespect I have for the Senator from Tennessee, for his commitment to \npublic service, having been a very dedicated and now famous surgeon who \nuses his skills all over the world when we are not in session.\n  I apologize, and I have done it publicly on two occasions, for using \nthat choice of words. It showed my frustration as to what had gone on \nhere. There is no need to talk about it now other than to say that \nhopefully Wednesday we can move on to bigger and better things.\n  Madam President, I appreciate everyone's patience and courtesy to me \ntoday. I especially apologize to the staff for keeping them as long as \nI have. I hope that I have been of some benefit to my friends on this \nside of the aisle. I hope I have not been too offensive to those on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, with the concurrence of the distinguished \nmajority leader, let me say that the majority leader, of course, is a \ndear friend, but the senior Senator from Nevada has been a very dear \nfriend for many, many years. We campaigned the same year, I for \nreelection, he for the Senate. I have always been very proud of him.\n  When historians look back, they will see he did a great service for \nthe Senate today in trying to put a lot of things in perspective. I \nwill speak longer at a another time. I am doing this at the concurrence \nof the leader showing his usual courtesy. I will not exceed that. I \nwill speak at a later time.\n  I appreciate my friend and also appreciate my friend from Tennessee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I know Members have been wondering about \nthe schedule. There will be no rollcall votes tonight. We were prepared \nto have votes throughout today and this evening, procedural or \notherwise, but I think that will not serve any useful purpose at this \nlate hour. The best course is probably to step back for the evening and \nbegin fresh tomorrow, which we will do.\n  Today we were to begin considering a very important appropriations \nbill, Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. As a matter of fact, \nthat bill has been pending since shortly after 1 o'clock today. \nUnfortunately, we were able to make no progress on that bill today. \nThat was successfully obstructed.\n  I indeed respect every Senator's right to do just that, and the \ndistinguished minority whip was within his rights to hold the floor \nthroughout the entire afternoon and this evening.\n  We were prepared to offer and vote in relation to amendments to the \nCommerce-Justice-State bill, but that was not possible. We were told \nlast week the other side of the aisle would not be offering their \namendments today, on Monday. The two managers were working together to \nmove forward on amendments that would be offered by Members on this \nside of the aisle today. Indeed, Republican Members were present today \nto offer and debate those amendments. I take it the other side of the \naisle did not show up to do the Nation's business as it pertained to \nthis Commerce-Justice-State bill.\n  I have stated repeatedly in the Senate that there is much, much work \nto do and that there is little time remaining to do it. Later this \nweek, indeed, we will focus on judges as part of the unfinished \nbusiness that remains before this body. I will continue to bring to the \nfloor to the best of my ability each and every appropriations bill. If \nthe other side of the aisle does not want to debate and discuss those \nbills as they are brought to the floor, that is their right.\n  Today our focus was on continuing the appropriations process. It is \nobvious that delay will occur on every front. Then, indeed, I think \nthat is unfortunate given the amount of business we have to do.\n  I am sure that at some point in the future we will hear speeches \nabout work that we did or did not get done or we were late in doing, \nand there will be Senators bemoaning the fact that the Senate has been \nunable to finish our business. Today was a missed opportunity to make \nprogress on these important appropriations bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/10/senate-section/article/S14334-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe one such crime that occurred in Greensburg, \nPA. Ian Bishop, 16, allegedly hated his 18-year old brother, Adam, \nbecause he thought he was gay. After beating his brother in the head at \nleast 18 times with a claw hammer and wooden club, Ian dumped Adam's \nbody in the bathtub, then went to a nearby shopping mall where he \ndescribed the attack and laughed about his brother's death.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/10/senate-section/article/S14334-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INTERNET TAX NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak to an amendment S. 150, \nthe Internet Tax Non-Discrimination Act of 2003.\n  Over the past few weeks some have mischaracterized my position \nconcerning the Internet tax moratorium and suggested that I supported \ntaxing the Internet or, even more inaccurately, that I supported taxing \ne-mail.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth, and I welcome the \nopportunity to set the record straight on the floor of the U.S. Senate. \nI have never and will never support taxing e-mail. That's patently \nridiculous.\n  On October 31, 2003, the Cincinnati Enquirer correctly reported my \nopposition on this very important issue:\n\n       Senator George Voinovich of Ohio has been boiled in a \n     witches' cauldron this week by critics angered that he helped \n     block an expanded ban of taxes on Internet services. The \n     current Internet Tax Moratorium, which he supports, expires \n     Saturday. Anti-tax groups making Voinovich out to be the \n     devil incarnate are roasting the wrong guy. Voinovich favors \n     keeping the tax moratorium on Internet access. He helped \n     negotiate the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998, supported its \n     renewal in 2001 and opposes new taxes on telecommunications \n     services. And yes, he strongly opposes a tax on e-mail.\n\n  This newspaper and others like it in Ohio have captured the essence \nof my argument. The debate on S. 150 is not about taxing e-mail. This \ndebate is about federalism, unfunded mandates, and protecting the \nStates' rights to govern their own affairs.\n  To clarify my position, I will offer an amendment that expresses the \nsense of the Senate that e-mail should not now, nor in the future, be \ntaxed by Federal, State, or local governments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/10/senate-section/article/S14334-4", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. SPECTER, from the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \n     with an amendment in the nature of a substitute and an \n     amendment to the title:\n       S. 1156.

A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to provide for FamilyCare coverage for parents of enrolled \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nEdward Kennedy of Massachusetts, in reintroducing the FamilyCare Act of \n2003, which has strong bipartisan support. First developed in 2001, \nFamilyCare extends health insurance coverage to more Americans by \nexpanding eligibility for the Medicaid and State-Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  Increasing access to the health insurance for the uninsured is as \nvexing an issue as Congress will consider, and no issue is as \ncompelling. The diagnosis is clear--over 44 million Americans aren't \ngetting the health care they need because they lack the money to pay \nfor it. And as the most recent Census data shows, the number of \nAmericans without health insurance is increasing--by 2 million in 2002 \nalone.\n  And yet, the number of uninsured Americans could be even higher. If \nit were not for Medicaid and S-CHIP, over a million more people would \nnot have had health coverage in 2002. The percentage of children with \nprivate coverage fell from 66.7 percent in 2001 to 63.9 percent in \n2002; for adults, it slipped from 73.7 percent to 72.3 percent. \nFortunately, at the same time, the number and percentage of children \nand non-elderly adults covered by public health insurance--primarily \nMedicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)--\nincreased.\n  The number of children who lost private health insurance coverage was \noffset from increased enrollment in public programs, which rose from \n23.6 percent in 2001 to 27.1 percent in 2002; and the percentage of \nnon-elderly adults covered rose from 9.4 percent to 10.3 percent. Taken \ntogether, this means that about 2.5 million more children and 1.6 \nmillion more non-elderly adults had health insurance coverage in 2002 \nbecause Medicaid and SCHIP expanded during the economic downturn.\n\n[[Page S14336]]\n\n  We all know about the problem. The question now is, what is the best \npossible cure? And while we know that there is no one answer, I think \nwe can all agree that the solutions are long overdue. I find it \nastonishing that here we are in the 21st century, in one of the \nwealthiest countries in the world, and still our citizens are going \nwithout basic coverage and care. We're talking about working families--\nclose to three-quarters of the nearly seven million lower-income, \nuninsured parents in America have jobs. They just don't have access to \naffordable coverage.\n  Year after year Congress has debated this issue. Last Congress we \ninvested $28 billion in a reserve fund to help increase the rolls of \nthe insured in America. Then the President, in his fiscal year 2003 \nbudget, allocated $89 billion to help the uninsured. And finally, this \nCongress in its fiscal year 2004 budget established a $50 billion \nreserve fund. Yet, no action has been taken that actually extends \ncoverage to the uninsured.\n  Now is the time to act. The news that an additional 2 million \nAmericans joined the ranks of the uninsured in 2002 should be a wake-up \ncall. We must work together to find common ground so that we finally \ncan take the steps necessary to help the millions of working Americans \nand their families who cannot afford health insurance coverage.\n\n  And while my colleagues and I are not claiming that the FamilyCare \nbill is the entire answer, we do believe it is a workable, \nuncomplicated proposal based on a proven approach that has the \npotential of reaching in the neighborhood of 13 million American \nchildren and their families. With so much at stake, we ought to be \nbuilding on what works, and the S-CHIP program fits the bill. In just \nthe six short years since this program passed under the leadership of \nSenators Kennedy, Hatch, Rockefeller and the late John Chafee, this \nfederal-state partnership has extended coverage to over 5 million low-\nincome children.\n  In my own home State of Maine under the ``Cub Care'' program, the \nnumber of children without health insurance has dropped dramatically. \nIn 2003 alone, Maine extended health insurance coverage to more than \n12,800 low-income children. Unfortunately, roughly 16,600 or one in \nseventeen children are still without health insurance in Maine. We can \nand must do more.\n  We should applaud states for taking the lead and helping to show us \nthe answer to this crisis. But a massive national problem requires a \nnational solution--and a good place to start is with the over four \nmillion children nationwide who are eligible for SCHIP benefits but \nremain unenrolled mostly because parents simply don't know the program \nexists.\n  Our FamilyCare measure narrows that ``coverage gap'' while at the \nsame time adding to the roles of the insured in America by covering the \nparents of low income children. Low-income Americans--those with \nincomes below 200 percent of the poverty level, or about $36,000 for a \nfamily of four--comprise 65 percent of the uninsured. We take this \napproach because the facts tell us it works. We know that states that \ncovered parents through S-CHIP saw a 16 percent increase in the number \nof children enrolled in their program versus only 3 percent for states \nthat enrolled only children. . .\n  We also know from the Commonwealth Fund's May 2001 report that almost \n90 percent of low-income children who have insured parents themselves \nare insured as compared to just 348 percent of children with an \nuninsured parent . . . And we know that low-income children with \ninsured parents are more than twice as likely to have health insurance \nas children with uninsured parents.\n  That's because states can insure parents at the same time they insure \nthe children--offering ``one-stop-shopping'' that also helps ensure \nthat services hit their intended target and provides for family-based \ncontinuity of care. The FamilyCare bill adopts this proven approach and \nwith so many pieces already in place we should be able to get moving on \nthis because, frankly, if not now, when? And if not now, why? In these \ntimes of trouble, how could we face the American people and tell them \nwe are unwilling to help address one of our nation's highest \npriorities? How could we explain that we reneged on our obligation to \nright this national wrong?\n  That's why we want to work with our Committee leadership to see that \nFamilyCare is included to the greatest extent possible in any proposal \nthat the Finance Committee considers when it develops its proposal to \nextend coverage to the uninsured. Because, like a letter mailed without \nan address, benefits that aren't delivered to our children are benefits \nthat might as well not exist. The bottom line is, parental coverage \nensures that children will be more likely to be enrolled in S-CHIP, and \nthe FamilyCare Act of 2003 will help us provide insurance to as many as \n13 million parents and children.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that this bill \ngets passed and I urge you all to support this bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator Snowe in \nintroducing the Family Care Act to expand health coverage to millions \nof families. The Family Care Act builds on the success of the Child \nHealth Insurance Program, by expanding it to cover the parents of low \nincome children, so that the whole family is eligible for affordable \ncoverage. This expansion is the next logical step toward the day when \nthe basic right to health care will be a reality for every American.\n  Parents across America get up every day, go to work, and play by the \nrules. But all their hard work does not buy them the health insurance \nthey need to keep themselves and their loved ones healthy or to protect \ntheir family when serious illness strikes. They can't afford the \ncoverage on their own, and their employers don't provide it. Family \nCare is a practical solution for millions of hardworking families, and \nit deserves to be a national priority.\n  Six years ago, Congress passed bipartisan legislation to cover \nuninsured children in families whose income is too high for Medicaid \nbut not high enough to afford private coverage. Today, the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program brings quality health care to over 5 million \nchildren. But there are still millions of children who are uninsured, \neven though they are eligible for coverage, and even those who are \ninsured cannot truly enjoy a healthy life when their parents are sick \nand can't afford the care they need.\n  Our bill is an important step to build on the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. Over 80 percent of children who are uninsured or \nenrolled in Medicaid or CHIP have uninsured parents. Expanding CHIP to \ncover parents as well as children will make a huge difference to \nmillions of working families.\n  The legislation will also help sign up the large number of children \nwho are already eligible for health coverage through CHIP or Medicaid, \nbut who have never enrolled. The numbers are dramatic. Ninety-five \npercent of low-income uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid or \nCHIP. If we can enroll all of these children, we will be taking a giant \nstep toward the day when every child has the opportunity for a healthy \nstart in life.\n  Our legislation makes it easier for families to register and stay \ncovered. We also know that many families lose coverage because \ncomplicated applications and burdensome requirements make it hard to \nstay insured. Under our bill families will have a simple application \nand they won't have to enroll over and over again. When parents enroll, \nthey will enroll their children, too.\n  These are long-overdue steps to give many more Americans the health \ncoverage they deserve. Family Care is a health care bill of rights for \nmillions of hardworking parents and their children, and I urge its \nprompt consideration and adoption by the Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 1844.

ALLOWANCE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Allocations in General.--\n       (1) For the emission limitation programs under this title, \n     the Administrator shall allocate annual allowances for an \n     affected unit, to be held or distributed by the designated \n     representative of the owner or operator in accordance with \n     this title as follows--\n       (A) sulfur dioxide allowances in an amount equal to the \n     annual tonnage emission limitation calculated under section \n     413, 414, 415, or 416, except as otherwise specifically \n     provided elsewhere in subpart 1 of part B, or in an amount \n     calculated under section 424 or 434,\n       (B) nitrogen oxides allowances in an amount calculated \n     under section 454, and\n       (C) mercury allowances in an amount calculated under \n     section 474.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the \n     contrary, the allocation of any allowances for any unit or \n     facility under sections 424, 434, 454, and 474 shall not be \n     enjoined.\n       (3) Allowances shall be allocated by the Administrator \n     without cost to the recipient, in accordance with this title.\n       (b) Allowance Transfer System.--Allowances allocated or \n     sold by the Administrator under this title may be transferred \n     among designated representatives of the owners or operators \n     of affected facilities under this title and any other person, \n     as provided by the allowance system regulations promulgated \n     by the Administrator. With regard to sulfur dioxide \n     allowances, the Administrator shall implement this subsection \n     under 40 C.F.R. Part 73 (2002), amended as appropriate by the \n     Administrator. With regard to nitrogen oxides allowances and \n     mercury allowances, the Administrator shall implement this \n     subsection by promulgating regulations not later than 24 \n     months after the date of enactment of the Clear Skies Act of \n     2003. The regulations under this subsection shall establish \n     the allowance system prescribed under this section, \n     including, but not limited to, requirements for the \n     allocation, transfer, and use of allowances under this title. \n     Such regulations shall prohibit the use of any allowance \n     prior to the calendar year for which the allowance was \n     allocated and shall provide, consistent with the purposes of \n     this title, for the identification of unused allowances, and \n     for such unused allowances to be carried forward and added to \n     allowances allocated in subsequent years, except as otherwise \n     provided in section 425. Such regulations shall provide, or \n     shall be amended to provide, that transfers of allowances \n     shall not be effective until certification of the transfer, \n     signed by a responsible official of the transferor, is \n     received and recorded by the Administrator.\n       (c) Allowance Tracking System.--The Administrator shall \n     promulgate regulations establishing a system for issuing, \n     recording, and tracking allowances, which shall specify all \n     necessary procedures and requirements for an orderly and \n     competitive functioning of the allowance system. Such system \n     shall provide, by twenty-four months prior to the compliance \n     year, for one or more facility-wide accounts for holding \n     sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides allowances, and, \n     if applicable, mercury allowances for all affected units at \n     an affected facility. With regard to sulfur dioxide \n     allowances, the Administrator shall implement this subsection \n     under 40 C.F.R. Part 73 (2002), amended as appropriate by the \n     Administrator. With regard to nitrogen oxides allowances and \n     mercury allowances, the Administrator shall implement this \n     subsection by promulgating regulations not later than 24 \n     months after the date of enactment of the Clear Skies Act of \n     2003. All allowance allocations and transfers shall, upon \n     recording by the Administrator, be deemed a part of each \n     unit's or facility's permit requirements pursuant to section \n     404, without any further permit review and revision.\n       (d) Nature of Allowances.--A sulfur dioxide allowance, \n     nitrogen oxides allowance, or mercury allowance allocated or \n     sold by the Administrator under this title is a limited \n     authorization to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide, one ton of \n     nitrogen oxides, or one ounce of mercury, as the case may be, \n     in accordance with the provisions of this title. Such \n     allowance does not constitute a property right. Nothing in \n     this title or in any other provision of law shall be \n     construed to limit the authority of the United States to \n     terminate or limit such authorization. Nothing in this \n     section relating to allowances shall be construed as \n     affecting the application of, or compliance with, any other \n     provision of this Act to an affected unit or facility, \n     including the provisions related to applicable National \n     Ambient Air Quality Standards and State implementation plans. \n     Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a \n     change of any kind in any State law regulating electric \n     utility rates and charges or affecting any State law \n     regarding such State regulation or as limiting State \n     regulation (including any prudency review) under such a State \n     law. Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying \n     the Federal Power Act or as affecting the authority of the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under that Act. Nothing \n     in this title shall be construed to interfere with or impair \n     any program for competitive bidding for power supply in a \n     State in which such program is established. Allowances, once \n     allocated or sold to a person by the Administrator, may be \n     received, held, and temporarily or permanently transferred in \n     accordance with this title and the regulations of the \n     Administrator without regard to whether or not a permit is in \n     effect under title V of the Clean Air Act or section 404 of \n     the Clear Skies Act of 2003 with respect to the unit for \n     which such allowance was originally allocated and recorded.\n       (e) Prohibition.--\n       (1) It shall be unlawful for any person to hold, use, or \n     transfer any allowance allocated or sold by the Administrator \n     under this title, except in accordance with regulations \n     promulgated by the Administrator.\n       (2) It shall be unlawful for any affected unit or for the \n     affected units at a facility to emit sulfur dioxide, nitrogen \n     oxides, and mercury, as the case may be, during a year in \n     excess of the number of allowances held for that unit or \n     facility for that year by the designated representative as \n     provided in sections 412(c), 422, 432, 452, and 472.\n       (3) The owner or operator of a facility may purchase \n     allowances directly from the Administrator to be used only to \n     meet the requirements of sections 422, 432, 452, and 472, as \n     the case may be, for the year in which the purchase is \n     made or the prior year. Not later than 36 months after the \n     date of enactment of the Clear Skies Act of 2003, the \n     Administrator shall promulgate regulations providing for \n     direct sales of sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides \n     allowances, and mercury allowances to an owner or operator \n     of a facility. The regulations shall provide that--\n       (A) such allowances may be used only to meet the \n     requirements of section 422, 432, 452, and 472, as the case \n     may be, for such facility and for the year in which the \n     purchase is made or the prior year,\n       (B) each such sulfur dioxide allowance shall be sold for \n     $2,000, each such nitrogen oxides allowance shall be sold for \n     $4,000, and each such mercury allowance shall be sold for \n     $2,187.50, with such prices adjusted for inflation based on \n     the Consumer Price Index\n\n[[Page S14339]]\n\n     on the date of enactment of the Clear Skies Act of 2003 and \n     annually thereafter,\n       (C) the proceeds from any sales of allowances under \n     subparagraph (B) shall be, in accordance with paragraph (j), \n     deposited in the Compliance Assistance Account,\n       (D) except for allowances subject to (E), the allowances \n     directly purchased for use for the year specified in \n     subparagraph (A) shall be, on a pro rata basis, taken from, \n     and reduce, the amount of sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen \n     oxides allowances, or mercury allowances, as the case may be, \n     that would otherwise be allocated under section 423, 453, or \n     473 starting for the second year after the specified year and \n     continuing for each subsequent year as necessary,\n       (E) if the designated representative does not use any such \n     allowance in accordance with paragraph (A) the designated \n     representative shall hold the allowance for deduction by the \n     Administrator. The Administrator shall deduct the allowance \n     without refund or other form of recompense.\n       (4) Allowances may not be used prior to the calendar year \n     for which they are allocated but may be used in succeeding \n     years. Nothing in this section or in the allowance system \n     regulations shall relieve the Administrator of the \n     Administrator's permitting, monitoring and enforcement \n     obligations under this Act, nor relieve affected facilities \n     of their requirements and liabilities under the Act.\n       (f) Competitive Bidding for Power Supply.--Nothing in this \n     title shall be construed to interfere with or impair any \n     program for competitive bidding for power supply in a State \n     in which such program is established.\n       (g) Applicability of the Antitrust Laws.--(1) Nothing in \n     this section affects--\n       (A) the applicability of the antitrust laws to the \n     transfer, use, or sale of allowances, or\n       (B) the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission under any provision of law respecting unfair \n     methods of competition or anticompetitive acts or practices.\n       (2) As used in this section, ``antitrust laws'' means those \n     Acts set forth in section 1 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. \n     12), as amended.\n       (h) Public Utility Holding Company Act.--The acquisition or \n     disposition of allowances pursuant to this title including \n     the issuance of securities or the undertaking of any other \n     financing transaction in connection with such allowances \n     shall not be subject to the provisions of the Public Utility \n     Holding Company Act of 1935.\n       (i) Interpollutant Trading.--Not later than July 1, 2009, \n     the Administrator shall furnish to the Congress a study \n     evaluating the environmental and economic consequences of \n     amending this title to permit trading sulfur dioxide \n     allowances for nitrogen oxides allowances and nitrogen oxides \n     allowances for sulfur dioxide allowances.\n       (j) Compliance Assistance Account.--An account shall be \n     established by the Secretary of Energy in consultation with \n     the Administrator:\n       (1) Payments or monies deposited in this account in \n     accordance with this title shall be used for the purpose of \n     developing emission control technologies through direct \n     grants to affected units that demonstrate new control \n     technologies regulated under this title.\n       (2) The Secretary of Energy in consultation with the \n     Administrator shall promulgate regulations with notice and \n     opportunity for comment to establish criteria for affected \n     units to quality for this subsection.\n\n     SEC. 404.

Any such permit issued by the Administrator, or \n     by a State with an approved permit program, shall prohibit--\n       (1) annual emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, \n     and mercury in excess of the number of allowances required to \n     be held in accordance with sections 412(c), 422, 432, 452, \n     and 472,\n       (2) exceeding applicable emissions rates under section 441,\n       (3) the use of any allowance prior to the year for which it \n     was allocated and\n       (4) contravention of any other provision of the permit.\n\n     No permit shall be issued that is inconsistent with the \n     requirements of this title, and title V as applicable.\n       (b) Compliance Plan.--Each initial permit application shall \n     be accompanied by a compliance plan for the facility to \n     comply with its requirements under this title. Where an \n     affected facility consists of more than one affected unit, \n     such plan shall cover all such units, and such facility shall \n     be considered a ``facility'' under section 502(c). Nothing in \n     this section regarding compliance plans or in title V shall \n     be construed as affecting allowances.\n       (1) Submission of a statement by the owner or operator, or \n     the designated representative of the owners and operators, of \n     a unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of \n     sections 412(c), 413, 414, and 441, that the unit will \n     meet the applicable emissions limitation requirements of \n     such sections in a timely manner or that, in the case of \n     the emissions limitation requirements of sections 412(c), \n     413, and 414, the owners and operators will hold sulfur \n     dioxide allowances in the amount required by section \n     412(c), shall be deemed to meet the proposed and approved \n     compliance planning requirements of this section and title \n     V, except that, for any unit that will meet the \n     requirements of this title by means of an alternative \n     method of compliance authorized under section 413 (b), \n     (c), (d), or (f), section 416, and section 441 (d) or (e), \n     the proposed and approved compliance plan, permit \n     application and permit shall include, pursuant to \n     regulations promulgated by the Administrator, for each \n     alternative method of compliance a comprehensive \n     description of the schedule and means by which the unit \n     will rely on one or more alternative methods of compliance \n     in the manner and time authorized under subpart 1 of part \n     B or subpart 1 of part C.\n       (2) Submission of a statement by the owner or operator, or \n     the designated representative, of a facility that includes a \n     unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of \n     sections 422, 432, 452, and 472 that the owner or operator \n     will hold sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxide \n     allowances, and mercury allowances, as the case may be, in \n     the amount required by such sections shall be deemed to meet \n     the proposed and approved compliance planning requirements of \n     this section and title V with regard to subparts A through D.\n       (3) Recording by the Administrator of transfers of \n     allowances shall amend automatically, and will not reopen or \n     require reopening of, any or all applicable proposed or \n     approved permit applications, compliance plans and permits.\n       (c) Permits.--The owner or operator of each facility under \n     this title that includes an affected unit subject to title V \n     shall submit a permit application and compliance plan with \n     regard to the applicable requirements under sections 412(c), \n     422, 432, 441, 452, and 472 for sulfur dioxide emissions, \n     nitrogen oxide emissions, and mercury emissions from such \n     unit to the permitting authority in accordance with the \n     deadline for submission of permit applications and compliance \n     plans under title V. The permitting authority shall issue a \n     permit to such owner or operator, or the designated \n     representative of such owner or operator, that satisfies the \n     requirements of title V and this title.\n       (d) Amendment of Application and Compliance Plan.--At any \n     time after the submission of an application and compliance \n     plan under this section, the applicant may submit a revised \n     application and compliance plan, in accordance with the \n     requirements of this section.\n       (e) Prohibition.--\n       (1) It shall be unlawful for any person to operate any \n     facility subject to this title except in compliance with the \n     terms and requirements of a permit application and compliance \n     plan (including amendments thereto) or permit issued by the \n     Administrator or a State with an approved permit program. For \n     purposes of this subsection, compliance, as provided in \n     section 504(f), with a permit issued under title V which \n     complies with this title for facilities subject to this title \n     shall be deemed compliance with this subsection as well as \n     section 502(a).\n       (2) In order to ensure reliability of electric power, \n     nothing in this title or title V shall be construed as \n     requiring termination of operations of a unit serving a \n     generator for failure to have an approved permit or \n     compliance plan under this section.\n       (f) Certificate of Representation.--No permit shall be \n     issued under this section to an affected unit or facility \n     until the designated representative of the owners or \n     operators has filed a certificate of representation with \n     regard to matters under this title, including the holding and \n     distribution of allowances and the proceeds of transactions \n     involving allowances.\n       (g) Multiple Owners.--No permit shall be issued under this \n     section to an affected unit until the designated \n     representative of the owners or operators has filed a \n     certificate of representation with regard to matters under \n     this title, including the holding and distribution of \n     allowances and the proceeds of transactions involving \n     allowances. Where there are multiple holders of a legal or \n     equitable title to, or a leasehold interest in, such a unit, \n     or where a utility or industrial customer purchases power \n     from an affected unit (or units) under life-of-the-unit, firm \n     power contractual arrangements, the certificate shall state:\n       (1) that allowances and the proceeds or transactions \n     involving allowance will be deemed to be held or distributed \n     in proportion to each holder's legal, equitable, leasehold, \n     or contractual reservation or entitlement, or\n       (2) if such multiple holders have expressly provided for a \n     different distribution of allowances by contract, that \n     allowances and the proceeds of transactions involving \n     allowances will be deemed to be held or distributed in \n     accordance with the contract.\n\n     A passive lessor, of a person who has an equitable interest \n     through such lessor, whose rental payments are not based, \n     either directly or indirectly, upon the revenues or income \n     from the affected unit shall not be deemed to be a holder of \n     a legal, equitable, leasehold, or contractual interest for \n     the purposes of holding or distributing allowances as \n     provided in this subsection, unless expressly provided for in \n     the leasehold agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this \n     subsection, where all legal or equitable title to or interest \n     in an affected unit is held by a single person, the \n     certification shall state that all allowances received by the \n     unit are deemed to be held for that person.\n\n     SEC. 405. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND RECORDKEEPING \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Applicability.--\n\n[[Page S14340]]\n\n       (1)(A) The owner and operator of any facility subject to \n     this title shall be required to install and operate CEMS on \n     each affected unit subject to subpart 1 of part B or subpart \n     1 of part C at the facility, and to quality assure the data, \n     for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, opacity, and volumetric \n     flow at each such unit.\n       (B) The Administrator shall, by regulations, specify the \n     requirements for CEMS under subparagraph (A), for any \n     alternative monitoring or compliance system that is \n     demonstrated as providing information which is reasonably of \n     the same precision, reliability, accessibility, and \n     timeliness as that provided by CEMS, and for recordkeeping \n     and reporting of information from such systems. Such \n     regulations may include limitations on the use of \n     alternative compliance methods by units equipped with an \n     alternative monitoring system as may be necessary to \n     preserve the orderly functioning of the allowance system, \n     and which will ensure to a reasonable extent the emissions \n     reductions contemplated by this title. Where two or more \n     units utilize a single stack, a separate CEMS shall not be \n     required for each unit, and for such units the regulations \n     shall require that the owner or operator collect \n     sufficient information to permit reliable compliance \n     determinations for each such unit.\n       (2)(A) The owner and operator of any facility subject to \n     this title shall be required to install and operate CEMS to \n     monitor the emissions from each affected unit at the \n     facility, and to quality assure the data for--\n       (i) sulfur dioxide, opacity, and volumetric flow for all \n     affected units subject to subpart 2 of part B at the \n     facility,\n       (ii) nitrogen oxides for all affected units subject to \n     subpart 2 of part C at the facility, and\n       (iii) mercury for all affected units subject to part D at \n     the facility.\n       (B)(i) The Administrator may specify an alternative \n     monitoring or compliance system for determining mercury \n     emissions. In specifying such alternative monitoring or \n     compliance systems, the lack of commercially available \n     appropriate and reasonable vendor guarantees shall constitute \n     a reasonable and permissible basis for specifying alternative \n     monitoring or compliance systems for mercury.\n       (ii) The regulations under clause (i) may include \n     limitations on the use of alternative compliance methods by \n     units equipped with an alternative monitoring system as may \n     be necessary to preserve the orderly functioning of the \n     allowance system, and which will ensure to a reasonable \n     extent the emissions reductions contemplated by this title.\n       (iii) The regulations under clause (i) shall not require a \n     separate CEMS or other monitoring system for each unit where \n     two or more units utilize a single stack and shall require \n     that the owner or operator collect sufficient information to \n     permit reliable compliance determinations for such units.\n       (b) Deadlines.--\n       (1) New utility units.--Upon commencement of commercial \n     operation of each new utility unit under subpart I of part B, \n     the unit shall comply with the requirements of subsection \n     (a)(1).\n       (2) Deadline for affected units under subpart 2 of part b \n     for installation and operation of cems.--By the later of the \n     date 12 months before the commencement date of the sulfur \n     dioxide allowance requirement of section 422, or the date on \n     which the unit commences operation, the owner or operator of \n     each affected unit under subpart 2 of part B shall install \n     and operate CEMS, quality assure the data, and keep records \n     and reports in accordance with the regulations issued under \n     paragraph (a)(2) with regard to sulfur dioxide, opacity, and \n     volumetric flow.\n       (3) Deadline for affected units under subpart 3 of part b \n     for installation and operation of cems.--By the first covered \n     year or the. date on which the unit commences commercial \n     operation, the owner or operator of each affected unit under \n     subpart 3 of part B shall install and operate CEMS, quality \n     assure the data, and keep records and reports in accordance \n     with the regulations issued under paragraph (a)(2) with \n     regard to sulfur dioxide and volumetric flow.\n       (4) Deadline for affected units under subpart 2 of part c \n     for installation and Operation of cems.--By the later of the \n     date the nitrogen oxides allowance requirement under section \n     452, or the date on which the unit commences operation, the \n     owner or operator of each affected unit under subpart 2 of \n     part C shall install and operate CEMS, quality assure the \n     data, and keep records and reports in accordance with the \n     regulations issued under paragraph (a)(2) with regard to \n     nitrogen oxides.\n       (5) Deadline for affected units under part d for \n     installation and operation of cems.--By the later of the date \n     12 months before the commencement date of the mercury \n     allowance requirement of section 472 applies to such unit and \n     commences commercial operation, or the date on which the unit \n     commences operation, the owner or operator of each affected \n     unit under part D shall install and operate CEMS, quality \n     assure the data, and keep records and reports in accordance \n     with the regulations issued under paragraph (a)(2) with \n     regard to mercury.\n       (c) Unavailability of Emissions Data.--If CEMS data or data \n     from an alternative monitoring system approved by the \n     Administrator under subsection (a) is not available for any \n     affected unit during any period of a calendar year in which \n     such data is required under this title, and the owner or \n     operator cannot provide information, reasonably satisfactory \n     to the Administrator, on emissions during that period, the \n     Administrator in coordination with the owner shall calculate \n     emissions for that period pursuant to regulations promulgated \n     for such purpose. The owner or operator shall be liable for \n     excess emissions fees and offsets under section 406 in \n     accordance with such regulations. Any fee due and payable \n     under this subsection shall not diminish the liability of the \n     unit's owner or operator for any fine, penalty, fee or \n     assessment against the unit for the same violation under any \n     other section of this Act.\n       (d) Implementation.--With regard to sulfur dioxide, \n     nitrogen oxides, opacity, and volumetric flow, the \n     Administrator shall implement subsections (a) and (c) under \n     40 C.F.R. Part 75 (2002), amended as appropriate by the \n     Administrator. With regard to mercury, the Administrator \n     shall implement subsections (a) and (c) by issuing proposed \n     regulations not later than 36 months before the commencement \n     date of the mercury allowance requirement under section 472 \n     and final regulations not later than 24 months before that \n     commencement date.\n       (e) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for the owner or \n     operator of any facility subject to this title to operate a \n     facility without complying with the requirements of this \n     section, and any regulations implementing this section.\n\n     SEC. 406. EXCESS EMISSIONS PENALTY; GENERAL COMPLIANCE WITH \n                   OTHER PROVISIONS; ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Excess Emissions Penalty.--\n       (1) Amount for oxides of nitrogen.--The owner or operator \n     of any unit subject to the requirements of section 441 that \n     emits nitrogen oxides for any calendar year in excess of the \n     allowances the operator holds for the unit for that calendar \n     year shall be liable for the payment of an excess emissions \n     penalty, except where such emission were authorized pursuant \n     to section 110(f). That penalty shall be calculated on the \n     basis of the number of tons emitted in excess of the number \n     of allowances held by the operator for the unit for that \n     calendar year multiplied by $2,000.\n       (2) Amount for sulfur dioxide before 2008.--The owner or \n     operator of any unit subject to the requirements of section \n     412(c) that emits sulfur dioxide for any calendar year before \n     2008 in excess of the sulfur dioxide allowances the owner or \n     operator holds for use for the unit for that calendar year \n     shall be liable for the payment of an excess emissions \n     penalty, except where such emissions were authorized pursuant \n     to section 110(f) or (g). That penalty shall be calculated as \n     follows:\n       (A) the product of the unit's excess emissions (in tons) \n     multiplied by $2,000, if within thirty days after the date on \n     which the owner or operator was required to hold sulfur \n     dioxide allowances--\n       (i) the owner or operator offsets the excess emissions in \n     accordance with paragraph (b)(1); and\n       (ii) the Administrator receives the penalty payment \n     required under this subparagraph.\n       (B) if the requirements of clause (A)(i) or (A)(ii) are not \n     met, the product of the unit's excess emissions (in tons) \n     multiplied by $4,000.\n       (3) Amount for sulfur dioxide after 2007.--If the units at \n     a facility that are subject to the requirements of section \n     412(c) emit sulfur dioxide for any calendar year after 2007 \n     in excess of the sulfur dioxide allowances that the owner or \n     operator of the facility holds for use for the facility for \n     that calendar year, the owner or operator shall be liable for \n     the payment of an excess emissions penalty, except where such \n     emissions were authorized pursuant to section 110(f). That \n     penalty shall be calculated under paragraph (4)(A) or (4)(B).\n       (4) Units subject to sections 422, 432, 452, or 472.--If \n     the units at a facility that are subject to the requirements \n     of section 422, 432, 452, or 472 emit sulfur dioxide, \n     nitrogen oxides, or mercury for any calendar year in excess \n     of the sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides allowances, \n     or mercury allowances, as the case may be, that the owner or \n     operator of the facility holds for use for the facility or \n     units for that calendar year, the owner or operator shall be \n     liable for the payment of an excess emissions penalty, except \n     where such emissions were authorized pursuant to section \n     110(f). That penalty shall be calculated as follows:\n       (A) the product of the units' excess emissions (in tons or, \n     for mercury emissions, in ounces) multiplied by the annual \n     average price of sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides \n     allowances, or mercury allowances, as the case may be, sold \n     between allowance holders and recorded in the Allowance \n     Tracking System, if within sixty days after the date on which \n     the owner or operator was required to hold sulfur dioxide, \n     nitrogen oxides allowance, or mercury allowances as the case \n     may be--\n       (i) the owner or operator offsets the excess emissions in \n     accordance with paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3), as applicable; \n     and\n       (ii) the Administrator receives the penalty required under \n     this subparagraph.\n       (B) if the requirements of clause (A)(i) or (A)(ii) are not \n     met, the amount of the units' excess emissions (in tons or, \n     for mercury emissions, in ounces) multiplied by the average \n     annual price of sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides \n     allowances, or mercury allowances, as the case may be, sold \n     between allowance holders and recorded in the Allowance \n     Tracking System.\n       (5) Payment.--Any penalty under paragraph 1, 2, 3, or 4 \n     shall be due and payable without demand to the Administrator \n     as provided in regulations issued by the Administrator. With \n     regard to the penalty under\n\n[[Page S14341]]\n\n     paragraph 1, the Administrator shall implement this paragraph \n     under 40 CFR Part 77 (2002), amended as appropriate by the \n     Administrator. With regard to the penalty under paragraphs 2, \n     3, and 4, the Administrator shall implement this paragraph by \n     issuing regulations no later than 24 months after the date of \n     enactment of the Clear Skies Act of 2003. Any such payment \n     shall be deposited in the Compliance Assistance Account.\n       (b) Excess Emissions Offset.--\n       (1) The owner or operator of any unit subject to the \n     requirements of section 412(c) that emits sulfur dioxide \n     during any calendar year before 2008 in excess of the sulfur \n     dioxide allowances held for the unit for the calendar year \n     shall be liable to offset the excess emissions by an equal \n     tonnage amount in the following calendar year, or such longer \n     period as the Administrator may prescribe. The Administrator \n     shall deduct sulfur dioxide allowances equal to the excess \n     tonnage from those held for the facility for the calendar \n     year, or succeeding years during which offsets are required, \n     following the year in which the excess emissions occurred.\n       (2) If the units at a facility that are subject to the \n     requirements of section 412(c) emit sulfur dioxide for a year \n     after 2007 in excess of the sulfur dioxide allowances that \n     the owner or operator of the facility holds for use for the \n     facility for that calendar year, the owner or operator shall \n     be liable to offset the excess emissions by an equal amount \n     of tons in the following calendar year, or such longer \n     period as the Administrator may prescribe. The \n     Administrator shall deduct sulfur dioxide allowances equal \n     to the excess emissions in tons from those held for the \n     facility for the year, or succeeding years during which \n     offsets are required, following the year in which the \n     excess emissions occurred.\n       (3) If the units at a facility that are subject to the \n     requirements of section 422, 432, 452, or 472 emit sulfur \n     dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or mercury for any calendar year in \n     excess of the sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides \n     allowances, or mercury allowances, as the case may be, that \n     the owner or operator of the facility holds for use for the \n     facility for that calendar year, the owner or operator shall \n     be liable to offset the excess emissions by an equal amount \n     of tons or, for mercury, ounces in the following calendar \n     year, or such longer period as the Administrator may \n     prescribe. The Administrator shall deduct sulfur dioxide \n     allowances, nitrogen oxide allowances, or mercury allowances, \n     as the case may be, equal to the excess emissions in tons or, \n     for mercury, ounces from those held for the facility for the \n     year, or succeeding years during which offsets are required, \n     following the year in which the excess emissions occurred.\n       (c) Penalty Adjustment.--The Administrator shall, by \n     regulation, adjust the penalty specified in subsection (a)(1) \n     and (a)(2) for inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index, \n     on November 15, 1990, and annually thereafter.\n       (d) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for the owner or \n     operator of any unit or facility liable for a penalty and \n     offset under this section to fail--\n       (1) to pay the penalty under subsection (a); or\n       (2) to offset excess emissions as required by subsection \n     (b).\n       (e) Savings Provision.--Nothing in this title shall limit \n     or otherwise affect the application of section 113, 114, 120, \n     or 304 except as otherwise explicitly provided in this title.\n       (f) Other Requirements.--Except as expressly provided, \n     compliance with the requirements of this title shall not \n     exempt or exclude the owner or operator of any facility \n     subject to this title from compliance with any other \n     applicable requirements of this Act. Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, no State or political \n     subdivision thereof shall restrict or interfere with the \n     transfer, sale, or purchase of allowances under this title.\n       (g) Violations.--Violation by any person subject to this \n     title of any prohibition of, requirement of, or regulation \n     promulgated pursuant to this title shall be a violation of \n     this Act. In addition to the other requirements and \n     prohibitions provided for in this title, the operation of any \n     affected unit or the affected units at a facility to emit \n     sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or mercury in violation of \n     section 412(c), 422, 432, 452, and 472, as the case may be, \n     shall be deemed a violation, with each ton or, in the case of \n     mercury, each ounce emitted in excess of allowances held \n     constituting a separate violation.\n\n     SEC. 407. ELECTION FOR ADDITIONAL UNITS.\n\n       (a) Applicability.--The owner or operator of any unit that \n     is not an affected EGU under subpart 2 of part B and subpart \n     2 of part C and whose emissions of sulfur dioxide and \n     nitrogen oxides are vented only through a stack or duct may \n     elect to designate such unit as an affected unit under \n     subpart 2 of part B and subpart 2 of part C. If the owner or \n     operator elects to designate a unit that is solid fuel-fired \n     and emits mercury vented only through a stack or duct, the \n     owner or operator shall also designate the unit as an \n     affected unit under part D. If elected unit fires only \n     gaseous fuels, designation may be made under subpart 2 of \n     part C only.\n       (b) Application.--The owner or operator making an election \n     under subsection (a) shall submit an application for the \n     election to the Administrator for approval.\n       (c) Approval.--If an application for an election under \n     subsection (b) meets the requirements of subsection (a), the \n     Administrator shall approve the designation as an affected \n     unit under subpart 2 of part B and subpart 2 of part C and, \n     if applicable, under part D, subject to the requirements in \n     subsections (d) through (m).\n       (d) Establishment of Baseline.--\n       (1) After approval of the designation under subsection (c), \n     the owner or operator shall install and operate GEMS on the \n     unit, and shall quality assure the data, in accordance with \n     the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) and subsections (c) \n     through (e) of section 405, except that, where two or more \n     units utilize a single stack, separate monitoring shall be \n     required for each unit unless all units utilizing the single \n     stack are designated as affected units.\n       (2) The baselines for heat input and sulfur dioxide and \n     nitrogen oxides emission rates, as the case may be, for the \n     unit shall be the unit's heat input and the emission rates of \n     sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides for a year starting after \n     approval of the designation under subsection (c). The \n     Administrator shall issue regulations requiring the unit's \n     baselines for heat input and sulfur dioxide and nitrogen \n     oxides emission rates to be based on the same year and \n     specifying minimum requirements concerning the percentage of \n     the unit's operating hours for which quality assured CEMS \n     data must be available during such year. The baseline heat \n     input and emissions baselines in this subparagraph shall be \n     calculated, at the election of the owner or operator of the \n     relevant unit, under (i) or (ii):\n       (i) for heat input, the average of the unit's highest heat \n     input for three years of the five years before the year for \n     which the Administrator is determining the allocations and \n     for emissions baselines, the average of the relevant \n     emissions for the same years used to determine heat input.\n       (ii) for heat input, the average of any period of twenty-\n     four consecutive months during a ten-year period immediately \n     prior to submission of an application under subsection (b), \n     and for emissions baselines, the average of the relevant \n     emissions for the same twenty-four month period used to \n     calculate heat input.\n       (3) The regulations implementing subparagraphs (2) shall \n     authorize the use of any reliable data on emissions of sulfur \n     dioxide and nitrogen oxides in addition to, and other than, \n     data collected pursuant to paragraph (1), including, but not \n     limited to, alternative data that has been used to determine \n     compliance with a regulatory or monitoring requirement under \n     this Act or a comparable State law if the data establishes \n     a reliable measure of heat input and sulfur dioxide and \n     nitrogen oxides emissions over a simultaneous period of \n     time; or if such data is not available, the Administrator \n     may prescribe a baseline based on alternative reliable \n     data. In determining the reliability of data, the \n     Administrator may consider the cost of generating more \n     reliable data compared to the quantitative importance of \n     the resulting gain in quantifying emissions.\n       (e) Emission Limitations.--After approval of the \n     designation of the unit under paragraph (c), the unit shall \n     become:\n       (1) an affected unit under subpart 2 of part B, and shall \n     be allocated sulfur dioxide allowances under paragraph (f), \n     starting the later of January 1, 2010, or January 1 of the \n     year after approval of the designation;\n       (2) an affected unit under subpart 2 of part C, and shall \n     be allocated nitrogen oxides allowances under paragraph (f), \n     starting the later of January 1, 2010, or January 1 of the \n     year after approval of the designation; and\n       (3) if applicable, an affected unit under part D, and shall \n     be allocated mercury allowances, starting the later of \n     January l, 2010, or January 1 of the year after approval of \n     designation.\n       (f) Allocations.--\n       (1) Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.--The Administrator \n     shall promulgate regulations determining the allocations of \n     sulfur dioxide allowances and nitrogen oxides allowances for \n     each year during which a unit is an affected unit under \n     subsection (e). The regulations shall provide for allocations \n     equal to 70 percent of the following amounts beginning \n     January 1, 2010, and 50 percent of the following amounts \n     beginning January 1, 2018 the unit's baseline heat input \n     under subsection (d) multiplied by the lesser of--\n       (A) the unit's baseline sulfur dioxide emission rate or \n     nitrogen oxides emission rate as the case may be; or\n       (B) the unit's most stringent State or Federal emission \n     limitation for sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides applicable \n     to the year on which the unit's baseline heat input is based \n     under subsection (d).\n       (2) Mercury.--The Administrator shall promulgate \n     regulations providing for the allocation of mercury \n     allowances to solid fuel-fired units designated under this \n     section for each year after January 1, 2010 during which a \n     unit is a designated unit under this section. The regulations \n     shall provide for allocations equal to the lesser of the \n     following amounts--\n       (A) the unit's annual allowable emissions rate for mercury \n     under the national emissions standards for hazardous air \n     pollutants for boilers and process heaters multiplied by the \n     unit's baseline heat input; or\n       (B) the unit's most stringent State or Federal emission \n     limitation for mercury emissions rate multiplied by the \n     unit's baseline heat input.\n       (3) Limitation.--Allowances allocated to electing units \n     under subparagraphs (1) and (2) shall comprise a separate \n     limitation on emissions from sections 423, 433, 453, 473, or \n     other section of this Act. These allowances\n\n[[Page S14342]]\n\n     for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or mercury, as the case \n     may be, shall be tradeable with allowances allocated under \n     sections 414, 424, 454, 474, as applicable, provided that\n       (A) electing units may only trade nitrogen oxides within \n     the respective zones established under section 452 within \n     which the electing unit is located, and\n       (B) affected units within the WRAP States may only purchase \n     sulfur dioxide allowances allocated or otherwise distributed \n     by the Administrator to electing units within the WRAP \n     States, and will not be counted for purposes the affected \n     unit's emissions within the meaning of the WRAP Annex.\n       (4) Incentives for early reductions.--The Administrator \n     shall promulgate regulations within 18 months authorizing the \n     allocation of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury \n     allowances to units designated under this section that \n     install or modify pollution control equipment or combustion \n     technology improvements identified in such regulations after \n     the date of enactment of this section and prior to January 1, \n     2010. No allowances shall be allocated under this paragraph \n     for emissions reductions attributable to: pollution control \n     equipment or combustion technology improvements that were \n     operational or under construction at any time prior to the \n     date of enactment of this section; fuel switching; or \n     compliance with any Federal regulation. The allowances \n     allocated to any unit under this paragraph shall be in \n     addition to the allowances allocated under paragraphs (1) and \n     (2) and sections 414, 424, 434, 454 and 474 and shall be \n     allocated in an amount equal to one allowance of sulfur \n     dioxide and nitrogen oxides for each 1.05 tons of reduction \n     in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, \n     respectively, and 1.05 ounces of reduction in the emissions \n     of mercury achieved by the pollution control equipment or \n     combustion technology improvements starting with the year in \n     which the equipment or improvement is implemented.\n       (g) Withdrawal.--The Administrator shall promulgate \n     regulations withdrawing from the approved designation under \n     subsection (c) any unit that qualifies as an affected EGU \n     under subpart 2 of part B or subpart 2 of part C, or part D \n     after the approval of the designation of the unit under \n     subsection (c).\n       (h) Regulations.--The Administrator shall promulgate \n     regulations implementing this section within 18 months of the \n     date of enactment of the Clear Skies Act of 2003.\n       (i) Application Period.--Applications for designation of \n     units under this section shall be accepted by the \n     Administrator beginning not later than 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this section and the Administrator shall \n     approve or disapprove of each application within 90 days of \n     receipt.\n       (j) Neshap Applicability.--\n       (1) A unit that is designated as an affected unit under \n     this section shall not be subject to any national emissions \n     standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) promulgated \n     pursuant to section 112(d) after November 10, 2003, except \n     that units that are boilers or process heaters shall be \n     subject on and after January 1, 2010 to the emissions \n     limitation for mercury, and associated monitoring and \n     compliance requirements, that would be applicable to such \n     units under the NESHAP for boilers and process heaters \n     promulgated pursuant to section 112(d).\n       (2) Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of \n     this section, the Administrator shall publish and make \n     available for public comment, a peer reviewed preliminary \n     report characterizing the emissions and public health effects \n     that may reasonably be anticipated to occur from the \n     implementation of paragraph (1) and subsection (f). No NESHAP \n     for boilers and process heaters shall be promulgated under \n     section 112(d) until the conclusion of, and considering, this \n     report. Under section 112(n)(1)(A), the Administrator shall \n     publish a final report, including responses to the comments \n     received, not later than 30 months after such date. The \n     requirements of section 112(n)(1)(A), for purposes of this \n     paragraph, shall be amended as follows. The report shall \n     include:\n       (A) an estimate of the numbers and types of sources that \n     are expected to be designated under this section;\n       (B) an estimate of any increase or decrease in the annual \n     emissions of criteria pollutants and of those hazardous air \n     pollutants subject to emission limitations under the NESHAPs \n     identified in paragraph (1) from such sources that may \n     reasonably be expected to occur for each year through 2018;\n       (C) an estimate of any increase or decrease in the annual \n     emissions of criteria pollutants and of those hazardous air \n     pollutants subject to emission limitations under the NESHAPs \n     identified in paragraph (1) from such sources that might \n     reasonably be expected to occur for each year through 2018, \n     if such sources estimated in subparagraph (A) are not \n     designated under this section; and\n       (D) a description of the public health and environmental \n     impacts associated with the emissions increases and decreases \n     described in subparagraphs (B) and (C).\n\n     Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Administrator shall have \n     the authority to regulate emissions of hazardous air \n     pollutants listed under section 112(b), other than mercury \n     compounds, from sources designated under this section in \n     accordance with the regime set forth in section 112(f)(2). \n     The Administrator shall make a determination based on the \n     study and other information satisfying the criteria of the \n     Data Quality Act whether to establish emissions limitations \n     under section 112(f) for sources designated under this \n     section, not later than 24 months after the final report is \n     published. The determination shall be a final agency action \n     subject to judicial review under section 307 and the \n     Administrative Procedures Act.\n       (k) Other Combustion Sources.--The owner or operator of an \n     affected unit designated under this section may elect to \n     designate other combustion sources, such as kilns and \n     furnaces (including sources that are not operated to generate \n     electricity) that are located on the same property as \n     affected units under this section provided that the emissions \n     from such sources are vented through a stack or duct. A \n     source that is designated as an affected unit under this \n     section shall not be subject to any national emissions \n     standards for hazardous air pollutants promulgated pursuant \n     to section 112(d) after August 2003. The Administrator shall \n     have the authority to regulate emissions of hazardous air \n     pollutants listed under section 112(b), other than mercury \n     compounds, by units designated as affected units under this \n     section in accordance with the regime set forth in sections \n     112(n)(1)(A) and 112(f)(2) through (4). Any such regulation \n     shall not require compliance with emissions limitations for \n     such pollutants before January l, 2018.\n       (l) Exemption From Major Source Preconstruction Review \n     Requirements and Best Available Retrofit Control Technology \n     Requirements.--\n       (1) Major source exemption.--A unit designated as an \n     affected unit under this section shall not be considered a \n     major source, or a part of a major emitting facility or major \n     stationary source for purposes of compliance with the \n     requirements of parts C and D of title I.

For nonutility units, the term \n     ``actual 1985 emission rate'' means the annual sulfur dioxide \n     or nitrogen oxides emission rate in pounds per million Btu as \n     reported in the NAPAP Emission Inventory, Version 2.\n       (2) The term ``allowable 1985 emissions rate'' means a \n     federally enforceable emissions limitation for sulfur dioxide \n     or oxides of nitrogen, applicable to the unit in 1985 or the \n     limitation applicable in such other subsequent year as \n     determined by the Administrator if such a limitation for 1985 \n     does not exist. Where the emissions limitation for a unit is \n     not expressed in pounds of emissions per million Btu, or the \n     averaging period of that emissions limitation is not \n     expressed on an annual basis, the Administrator shall \n     calculate the annual equivalent of that emissions limitation.\n       (3) The term ``alternative method of compliance'' means a \n     method of compliance in accordance with one or more of the \n     following authorities--\n       (A) a substitution plan submitted and approved in \n     accordance with subsections 413(b) and (c); or\n       (B) a Phase I extension plan approved by the Administrator \n     under section 413(d), using qualifying phase I technology as \n     determined by the Administrator in accordance with that \n     section.\n       (4) The term ``baseline'' means the annual quantity of \n     fossil fuel consumed by an affected unit, measured in \n     millions of British Thermal Units (``mmBtu's''), \n     calculated as follows:\n       (A) For each utility unit that was in commercial operation \n     prior to January 1, 1985, the baseline shall be the annual \n     average quantity of mmBtu's consumed in fuel during calendar \n     years 1985, 1986, and 1987, as recorded by the Department of \n     Energy pursuant to Form 767. For any utility unit for\n\n[[Page S14344]]\n\n     which such form was not filed, the baseline shall be the \n     level specified for such unit in the 1985 (NAPAP) Emissions \n     Inventory, Version 2, (NURF) or in a corrected data base as \n     established by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (3). \n     For nonutility units, the baseline in the NAPAP Emissions \n     Inventory, Version 2. The Administrator, in the \n     Administrator's sole discretion, may exclude periods during \n     which a unit is shutdown for a continuous period of 4 \n     calendar months or longer, and make appropriate adjustments \n     under this paragraph. Upon petition of the owner or operator \n     of any unit, the Administrator may make appropriate baseline \n     adjustments for accidents, strikes, disruptions of fuel \n     supplies, failure of equipment, other causes beyond the \n     reasonable control of the owner or operator of the unit that \n     caused prolonged outages.\n       (B) For any other nonutility unit that is not included in \n     the NAPAP Emissions Inventory, Version 2, or a corrected data \n     base as established by the Administrator pursuant to \n     paragraph (3), the baseline shall be the annual average \n     quantity, in mmBtu consumed in fuel by that unit, as \n     calculated pursuant to a method which the Administrator shall \n     prescribe by regulation to be promulgated not later than 18 \n     months after November 15, 1990.\n       (C) The Administrator shall, upon application or on his own \n     motion, by December 31, 1991, supplement data needed in \n     support of this subpart and correct any factual errors in \n     data from which affected Phase II units' baselines or actual \n     1985 emission rates have been calculated. Corrected data \n     shall be used for purposes of issuing allowances under this \n     subpart. Such corrections shall not be subject to judicial \n     review, nor shall the failure of the Administrator to correct \n     an alleged factual error in such reports be subject to \n     judicial review.\n       (5) The term ``basic Phase II allowance allocations'' \n     means:\n       (A) For calendar years 2000 through 2009 inclusive, \n     allocations of allowances made by the Administrator pursuant \n     to section 412 and subsections (b)(1), (3), and (4); (c)(1), \n     (2), (3), and (5); (d)(1), (2), (4), and (5); (e); (f); \n     (g)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5); (h)(1); (i) and (j) of \n     section 414.\n       (B) For each calendar year beginning in 2010, allocations \n     of allowances made by the Administrator pursuant to section \n     412 and subsections (b)(1), (3), and (4); (c)(1), (2), (3), \n     and (5); (d)(1), (2), (4) and (5); (e); (f); (g)(1), (2), \n     (3), (4), and (5); (h)(1) and (3); (i) and (j) of section \n     414.\n       (6) The term ``capacity factor'' means the ratio between \n     the actual electric output from a unit and the potential \n     electric output from that unit.\n       (7) The term ``commenced'' as applied to construction of \n     any new electric utility unit means that an owner or operator \n     has undertaken a continuous program of construction or that \n     an owner or operator has entered into a contractual \n     obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable \n     time, a continuous program of construction.\n       (8) The term ``commenced commercial operation'' with regard \n     to a unit means the start up of the unit's combustion chamber \n     and commencement of the generation of electricity for sale.\n       (9) The term ``construction'' means fabrication, erection, \n     or installation of an affected unit.\n       (10) The term ``existing unit'' means a unit (including \n     units subject to section 111) that commenced commercial \n     operation before November 15, 1990.

ALLOWANCE ALLOCATION.\n\n       (a) Except as provided in sections 414(a)(2), 415(a)(3), \n     and 416, beginning January 1, 2000, the Administrator shall \n     not allocate annual emission allowances for sulfur dioxide \n     from utility units in excess of 8.90 million tons except that \n     the Administrator shall not take into account unused \n     allowances carried forward by owners and operators of \n     affected units or by other persons holding such allowances, \n     following the year for which they were allocated. If \n     necessary to meeting the restrictions imposed in the \n     preceding sentence, the Administrator shall reduce, pro rata, \n     the basic Phase II allowance allocations for each unit \n     subject to the requirements of section 414. Subject to the \n     provisions of section 417, the Administrator shall allocate \n     allowances for each affected until at an affected source \n     annually, as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) and section \n     404. Except as provided in sections 416, the removal of an \n     existing affected unit or source from commercial operation at \n     any time after November 15, 1990 (whether before or after \n     January 1, 1995, or January 1, 2000), shall not terminate or \n     otherwise affect the allocation of allowances pursuant to \n     section 413 or 414 to which the unit is entitled. Prior to \n     June 1, 1998, the Administrator shall publish a revised final \n     statement of allowance allocations, subject to the provisions \n     of section 414(a)(2).\n       (b) New Utility Units.--\n       (1) After January 1, 2000 and through December 31, 2007, it \n     shall be unlawful for a new utility unit to emit an annual \n     tonnage of sulfur dioxide in excess of the number of \n     allowances to emit held for the unit by the unit's owner or \n     operator.\n       (2) Starting January 1, 2008, a new utility unit shall be \n     subject to the prohibition in subsection (c)(3).\n       (3) New utility units shall not be eligible for an \n     allocation of sulfur dioxide allowances under subsection \n     (a)(1), unless the unit is subject to the provisions of \n     subsection (g)(2) or (3) of section 414. New utility units \n     may obtain allowances from any person, in accordance with \n     this title. The owner or operator of any new utility unit in \n     violation of subsection (b)(1) or subsection(c)(3) shall be \n     liable for fulfilling the obligations specified in section \n     406.\n       (c) Prohibitions.--\n       (1) It shall be unlawful for any person to hold, use, or \n     transfer any allowance allocated under this subpart, except \n     in accordance with regulations promulgated by the \n     Administrator.\n       (2) For any year 1995 through 2007, it shall be unlawful \n     for any affected unit to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the \n     number of allowances held for that unit for that year by the \n     owner or operator of the unit.\n\n[[Page S14345]]\n\n       (3) Starting January 1, 2008, it shall be unlawful for the \n     affected units at a source to emit a total amount of sulfur \n     dioxide during the year in excess of the number of allowances \n     held for the source for that year by the owner or operator of \n     the source.\n       (4) Upon the allocation of allowances under this subpart, \n     the prohibition in paragraphs (2) and (3) shall supersede any \n     other emission limitation applicable under this subpart to \n     the units for which such allowances are allocated.\n       (d) In order to ensure electricity reliability, regulations \n     establishing a system for issuing, recording, and tracking \n     allowances under section 403(b) and this subpart shall not \n     prohibit or affect temporary increases and decreases in \n     emissions within utility systems, power pools, or utilities \n     entering into allowance pool agreements, that result from \n     their operations, including emergencies and central dispatch, \n     and such temporary emissions increases and decreases shall \n     not require transfer of allowances among units nor shall it \n     require recording. The owners or operators of such units \n     shall act through a designated representative. \n     Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the total tonnage of \n     emissions in any calendar year (calculated at the end \n     thereof) from all units in such a utility system, power pool, \n     or allowance pool agreements shall not exceed the total \n     allowances for such units for the calendar year concerned, \n     including for calendar years after 2007, allowances held \n     for such units by the owner or operator of the sources \n     where the units are located.\n       (e) Where there are multiple holders of a legal or \n     equitable title to, or a leasehold interest in, an affected \n     unit, or where a utility or industrial customer purchases \n     power from an affected unit (or units) under life-of-the-\n     unit, firm power contractual arrangements, the certificate of \n     representation required under section 404(f) shall state--\n       (1) that allowances under this subpart and the proceeds of \n     transactions involving such allowances will be deemed to be \n     held or distributed in proportion to each holder's legal, \n     equitable, leasehold, or contractual reservation or \n     entitlement, or\n       (2) if such multiple holders have expressly provided for a \n     different distribution of allowances by contract, that \n     allowances under this subpart and the proceeds of \n     transactions involving such allowances will be deemed to be \n     held or distributed in accordance with the contract.\n\n     A passive lessor, or a person who has an equitable interest \n     through such lessor, whose rental payments are not based, \n     either directly or indirectly, upon the revenues or income \n     from the affected unit shall not be deemed to be a holder of \n     a legal, equitable, leasehold, or contractual interest for \n     the purpose of holding or distributing allowances as provided \n     in this subsection, during either the term of such leasehold \n     or thereafter, unless expressly provided for in the leasehold \n     agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, \n     where all legal or equitable title to or interest in an \n     affected unit is held by a single person, the certification \n     shall state that all allowances under this subpart received \n     by the unit are deemed to be held for that person.\n\n     SEC. 413. PHASE I SULFUR DIOXIDE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Emission Limitations.--\n       (1) After January 1, 1995, each source that includes one or \n     more affected units listed in table A is an affected source \n     under this section. After January 1, 1995, it shall be \n     unlawful for any affected unit (other than an eligible phase \n     I unit under section 413(d)(2)) to emit sulfur dioxide in \n     excess of the tonnage limitation stated as a total number of \n     allowances in table A for phase 1, unless--\n       (A) the emissions reduction requirements applicable to such \n     unit have been achieved pursuant to subsection (b) or (d), or\n       (B) the owner or operator of such unit holds allowances to \n     emit not less than the unit's total annual emissions, except \n     that, after January 1, 2000, the emissions limitations \n     established in this section shall be superseded by those \n     established in section 414. The owner or operator of any unit \n     in violation of this section be fully liable for such \n     violation including, but not limited to, liability for \n     fulfilling the obligations specified in section 406.\n       (2) Not later than December 31, 1991, the Administrator \n     shall determine the total tonnage of reductions in the \n     emissions of sulfur dioxide from all utility units in \n     calendar year 1995 that will occur as a result of compliance \n     with the emissions limitation requirements of this section, \n     and shall establish a reserve of allowances equal in amount \n     to the number of tons determined thereby not to exceed a \n     total of 3.50 million tons. In making such a determination, \n     the Administrator shall compute for each unit subject to the \n     emissions limitation requirements of this section the \n     difference between--\n       (A) the product of its baseline multiplied by the lesser of \n     each unit's allowable 1985 emissions rate and its actual 1985 \n     emissions rate, divided by 2,000, and\n       (B) the product of each unit's baseline multiplied by 2.50 \n     lbs/mmBtu divided by 2,000, and sum the computations. The \n     Administrator shall adjust the foregoing calculation to \n     reflect projected calendar year 1995 utilization of the units \n     subject to the emissions limitations of this subpart that the \n     Administrator finds would have occurred in the absence of the \n     imposition of such requirements. Pursuant to subsection (d), \n     the Administrator shall allocate allowances from the reserve \n     established hereunder until the earlier of such time as all \n     such allowances in the reserve are allocated or December 31, \n     1999.\n       (3) In addition to allowances allocated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1), in each calendar year beginning in 1995 and \n     ending in 1999, inclusive, the Administrator shall allocate \n     for each unit on Table A that is located in the States of \n     Illinois, Indiana, or Ohio (other than units at Kyger Creek, \n     Clifty Creek and Joppa Steam), allowances in an amount equal \n     to 200,000 multiplied by the unit's pro rata share of the \n     total number of allowances allocated for all units on Table A \n     in the 3 States (other than units at Kyger Creek, Clifty \n     Creek, and Joppa Steam) pursuant to paragraph (1). Such \n     allowances shall be excluded from the calculation of the \n     reserve under paragraph (2).\n       (b) Substitutions.--The owner or operator of an affected \n     unit under subsection (a) may include in its section 404 \n     permit application and proposed compliance plan a proposal to \n     reassign, in whole or in part, the affected unit's sulfur \n     dioxide reduction requirements to any other unit(s) under the \n     control of such owner or operator. Such proposal shall \n     specify--\n       (1) the designation of the substitute unit or units to \n     which any part of the reduction obligations of subsection (a) \n     shall be required, in addition to, or in lieu of, any \n     original affected units designated under such subsection;\n       (2) the original affected unit's baseline, the actual and \n     allowable 1985 emissions rate for sulfur dioxide, and the \n     authorized annual allowance allocation stated in table A;\n       (3) calculation of the annual average tonnage for calendar \n     years 1985, 1986, and 1987, emitted by the substitute unit or \n     units, based on the baseline for each unit, as defined in \n     section 411(4), multiplied by the lesser of the unit's actual \n     or allowable 1985 emissions rate;\n       (4) the emissions rates and tonnage limitations that would \n     be applicable to the original and substitute affected units \n     under the substitution proposal;\n       (5) documentation, to the satisfaction of the \n     Administrator, that the reassigned tonnage limits will, in \n     total, achieve the same or greater emissions reduction than \n     would have been achieved by the original affected unit and \n     the substitute unit or units without such substitution; and\n       (6) such other information as the Administrator may \n     require.\n       (c) Administrator's Action on Substitution Proposals.--\n       (1) The Administrator shall take final action on such \n     substitution proposal in accordance with section 404(c) if \n     the substitution proposal fulfills the requirements of this \n     subsection. The Administrator may approve a substitution \n     proposal in whole or in part and with such modifications or \n     conditions as maybe consistent with the orderly functioning \n     of the allowance system and which will ensure the emissions \n     reductions contemplated by this title. If a proposal does not \n     meet the requirements of subsection (b), the Administrator \n     shall disapprove it. The owner or operator of a unit listed \n     in table A shall not substitute another unit or units without \n     the prior approval of the Administrator.\n       (2) Upon approval of a substitution proposal, each \n     substitute unit, and each source with such unit, shall be \n     deemed affected under this title, and the Administrator shall \n     issue a permit to the original and substitute affected source \n     and unit in accordance with the approved substitution plan \n     and section 404. The Administrator shall allocate allowances \n     for the original and substitute affected units in accordance \n     with the approved substitution proposal pursuant to section \n     412. It shall be unlawful for any source or unit that is \n     allocated allowances pursuant to this section to emit sulfur \n     dioxide in excess of the emissions limitation provided for in \n     the approved substitution permit and plan unless the owner or \n     operator of each unit governed by the permit and approved \n     substitution plan holds allowances to emit not less than the \n     unit's total annual emissions. The owner or operator of any \n     original or substitute affected unit operated in violation of \n     this subsection shall be fully liable for such violation, \n     including liability for fulfilling the obligations specified \n     in section 406. If a substitution proposal is disapproved, \n     the Administrator shall allocate allowances to the original \n     affected unit or units in accordance with subsection (a).\n       (d) Eligible Phase I Extension Units.--\n       (1) The owner or operator of any affected unit subject to \n     an emissions limitation requirement under this section may \n     petition the Administrator in its permit application under \n     section 404 for an extension of 2 years of the deadline for \n     meeting such requirement, provided that the owner or operator \n     of any such unit holds allowances to emit not less than the \n     unit's total annual emissions for each of the 2 years of the \n     period of extension. To qualify for such an extension, the \n     affected unit must either employ a qualifying phase I \n     technology, or transfer its phase I emissions reduction \n     obligation to a unit employing a qualifying phase I \n     technology. Such transfer shall be accomplished in accordance \n     with a compliance plan, submitted and approved under section \n     404, that shall govern operations at all units included in \n     the transfer, and that specifies the emissions reduction \n     requirements imposed pursuant to this title.\n       (2) Such extension proposal shall--\n       (A) specify the unit or units proposed for designation as \n     an eligible phase I extension unit;\n\n[[Page S14346]]\n\n       (B) provide a copy of an executed contract, which may be \n     contingent upon the Administrator approving the proposal, for \n     the design engineering, and construction of the qualifying \n     phase I technology for the extension unit, or for the unit or \n     units to which the extension unit's emission reduction \n     obligation is to be transferred;\n       (C) specify the unit's or units' baselines, actual 1985 \n     emissions rates, allowable 1985 emissions rates, and \n     projected utilizations for calendar years 1995 through 1999;\n       (D) require CEMS on both the eligible phase I extension \n     unit or units and the transfer unit or units beginning no \n     later than January 1, 1995; and\n       (E) specify the emission limitation and number of \n     allowances expected to be necessary for annual operation \n     after the qualifying phase I technology has been installed.\n       (3) The Administrator shall review and take final action on \n     each extension proposal in Page order of receipt, consistent \n     with section 404, and for an approved proposal shall \n     designate the unit or units as an eligible phase I extension \n     unit. The Administrator may approve an extension proposal in \n     whole or in part, and with such modifications or conditions \n     as may be necessary, consistent with the orderly functioning \n     of the allowance system, and to ensure the emissions \n     reductions contemplated by the subpart.\n       (4) In order to determine the number of proposals eligible \n     for allocations from the reserve under subsection (a)(2) and \n     the number of the allowances remaining available after each \n     proposal is acted upon, the Administrator shall reduce the \n     total number of allowances remaining available in the reserve \n     by the number of allowances calculated according to \n     subparagraph (A), (B) and (C) until either no allowances \n     remain available in the reserve for further allocation or all \n     approved proposals have been acted upon. If no allowances \n     remain available in the reserve for further allocation before \n     all proposals have been acted upon by the Administrator, any \n     pending proposals shall be disapproved. The Administrator \n     shall calculate allowances equal to--\n       (A) the difference between the lesser of the average annual \n     emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or the projected \n     emissions tonnage for calendar year 1995 of each eligible \n     phase I extension unit, as designated under paragraph (3), \n     and the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by an \n     emission rate of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000;\n       (B) the difference between the lesser of the average annual \n     emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or the projected \n     emissions tonnage for calendar year 1996 of each eligible \n     phase I extension unit, as designated under paragraph (3), \n     and the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by an \n     emission rate of 2.501bs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000; and\n       (C) the amount by which (i) the product of each unit's \n     baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, \n     divided by 2,000, exceeds (ii) the tonnage level specified \n     under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection \n     multiplied by a factor of 3.\n       (5) Each eligible Phase I extension unit shall receive \n     allowances determined under subsection (a)(1) or (c) of this \n     section. In addition, for calendar year 1995, the \n     Administrator shall allocate to each eligible Phase I \n     extension unit, from the allowance reserve created pursuant \n     to subsection (a)(2), allowances equal to the difference \n     between the lesser of the average annual emissions in \n     calendar years 1988 and 1989 or its projected emission \n     tonnage for calendar year 1995 and the product of the unit's \n     baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, \n     divided by 2,000. In calendar year 1996, the Administrator \n     shall allocate for each eligible unit, from the allowance \n     reserve created pursuant to subsection (a)(2), allowances \n     equal to the difference between the lesser of the average \n     annual emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or its \n     projected emissions tonnage for calendar year 1996 and the \n     product of the unit's baseline multiplied by an emission rate \n     of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000. It shall be unlawful for \n     any source or unit subject to an approved extension plan \n     under this subsection to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the \n     emissions limitations provided for in the permit and approved \n     extension plan, unless the owner or operator of each unit \n     governed by the permit and approved plan holds allowances to \n     emit not less than the unit's total annual emissions.\n       (6) In addition to allowances specified in paragraph (4), \n     the Administrator shall allocate for each eligible Phase I \n     extension unit employing qualifying Phase I technology, for \n     calendar years 1997, 1998, and 1999, additional allowances, \n     from any remaining allowances in the reserve created pursuant \n     to subsection (a)(2), following the reduction in the reserve \n     provided for in paragraph (4), not to exceed the amount by \n     which (A) the product of each eligible unit's baseline times \n     an emission rate of 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000 exceeds \n     (B) the tonnage level specified under subparagraph (E) of \n     paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n       (7) After January 1, 1997, in addition to any liability \n     under this Act, including under section 406, if any eligible \n     phase I extension unit employing qualifying phase I \n     technology or any transfer unit under this subsection emits \n     sulfur dioxide in excess of the annual tonnage limitation \n     specified in the extension plan, as approved in paragraph (2) \n     of this subsection, the Administrator shall, in the calendar \n     year following such excess, deduct allowances equal to the \n     amount of such excess from such unit's annual allowance \n     allocation.\n       (e) Early Reductions.--\n       (1) In the case of a unit that receives authorization from \n     the Governor of the State in which such unit is located to \n     make reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide prior to \n     calendar year 1995 and that is part of a utility system that \n     meets the following requirements--\n       (A) the total coal-fired generation within the utility \n     system as a percentage of total system generation decreased \n     by more than 20 percent between January 1, 1980, and December \n     31, 1985; and\n       (B) the weighted capacity factor of all coal-fired units \n     within the utility system averaged over the period from \n     January 1, 1985, through December 31, 1987, was below 50 \n     percent, the Administrator shall allocate allowances under \n     this paragraph for the unit pursuant to this subsection. The \n     Administrator shall allocate allowances for a unit that is an \n     affected unit pursuant to section 414 (but is not also an \n     affected unit under this section) and part of a utility \n     system that includes 1 or more affected units under section \n     414 for reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide made \n     during the period 1995-1999 if the unit meets the \n     requirements of this subsection and the requirements of the \n     preceding sentence, except that for the purposes of applying \n     this subsection to any such unit, the prior year concerned as \n     specified below, shall be any year after January 1, 1995 but \n     prior to January 1, 2000.\n       (2) In the case of an affected unit under this section \n     described in subparagraph (A), the allowances allocated under \n     this subsection for early reductions in any prior year may \n     not exceed the amount which (A) the product of the unit's \n     baseline multiplied by the unit's 1985 actual sulfur dioxide \n     emission rate (in lbs. per mmBtu), divided by 2,000 exceeds \n     (B) the allowances specified for such unit in Table A. In the \n     case of an affected unit under section 414, the allowances \n     awarded under this subsection for early reductions in any \n     prior year may not exceed the amount by which\n       (A) the product of\n       (i) the quantity of fossil fuel consumed by the unit (in \n     mmBtu) in the prior year multiplied by--\n       (ii) the lesser of\n       (I) 2.50 or\n       (II) the most stringent emission rate (in lbs. per mmBtu) \n     applicable to the unit under the applicable implementation \n     plan, divided by 2,000 exceeds\n       (B) the unit's actual tonnage of sulfur dioxide emission \n     for the prior year concerned.\n\n     Allowances allocated under this subsection for units may be \n     allocated only for emission reductions achieved as a result \n     of physical changes or changes in the method of operation \n     made after November 15, 1990, including changes in the type \n     or quantity of fossil fuel consumed.\n       (3) In no event shall the provisions of this paragraph be \n     interpreted as an event of force majeure or a commercial \n     impracticability or in any other way as a basis for excused \n     nonperformance by a utility system under a coal sales \n     contract in effect before November 15, 1990.\n\n            TABLE A--AFFECTED SOURCES AND UNITS IN PHASE I AND THEIR SULFUR DIOXIDE ALLOWANCES (TONS)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       Phase I\n                     State                                      Plant name                Generator   allowances\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama........................................

For electric utilities \n     not subject to the jurisdiction of a State regulatory \n     authority such plan shall have been approved by the \n     Administrator.\n       (iv) In the case of qualified energy conservation measures \n     undertaken by a State regulated electric utility, the \n     Secretary of Energy has certified that the State regulatory \n     authority with jurisdiction over the electric rates of such \n     electric utility has established rates and charges which \n     ensure that the net income of such electric utility after \n     implementation of specific cost effective energy conservation \n     measures is at least as high as such net income would have \n     been if the energy conservation measures had not been \n     implemented. Upon the date of any such certification by the \n     Secretary of Energy, all allowances which, but for this \n     paragraph, would have been allocated under subparagraph (B) \n     before such date, shall be allocated to the electric utility. \n     This clause is not a requirement for qualified renewable \n     energy.\n       (v) Such utility or any subsidiary of the utility's holding \n     company owns or operates at least one affected unit.\n       (C) Period of applicability.--Allowances under this \n     subsection shall be allocated only with respect to kilowatt \n     hours of electric energy saved by qualified energy \n     conservation measures or generated by qualified renewable \n     energy after January 1, 1992, and before the earlier of (i) \n     December 31, 2000, or (ii) the date on which any electric \n     utility steam generating unit owned or operated by the \n     electric utility to which the allowances are allocated \n     becomes subject to this subpart (including those sources that \n     elect to become affected by this title, pursuant to section \n     417).\n       (D) Determination of avoided emissions.--\n       (i) Application.--In order to receive allowances under this \n     subsection, an electric utility shall make an application \n     which--\n       (I) designates the qualified energy conservation measures \n     implemented and the qualified renewable energy sources used \n     for purposes of avoiding emissions;\n       (II) calculates, in accordance with subparagraphs (F) and \n     (G), the number of tons of emissions avoided by reason of the \n     implementation of such measures or the use of such renewable \n     energy sources; and\n       (III) demonstrates that the requirements of subparagraph \n     (B) have been met.\n       (ii) Approval.--Such application for allowances by a State \n     regulated electric utility shall require approval by the \n     State regulatory authority with jurisdiction over such \n     electric utility. The authority shall review the application \n     for accuracy and compliance with this subsection and the \n     rules under this subsection. Electric utilities whose retail \n     rates are not subject to the jurisdiction of a State \n     regulatory authority shall apply directly to the \n     Administrator for such approval.\n       (E) Avoided Emissions from Qualified Energy Conservation \n     Measures.--For the purposes of this subsection, the emission \n     tonnage deemed avoided by reason of the implementation \n     of qualified energy conservation measures for any calendar \n     year shall be a tonnage equal to the product of \n     multiplying--\n       (i) the kilowatt hours that would otherwise have been \n     supplied by the utility during such year in the absence of \n     such qualified energy conservation measures, by\n       (ii) 0.004, and dividing the product so derived by 2,000.\n       (F) Avoided emissions from the use of qualified renewable \n     energy.--The emissions tonnage deemed avoided by reason of \n     the use of qualified renewable energy by an electric utility \n     for any calendar year shall be a tonnage equal to the product \n     of multiplying--\n       (i) the actual kilowatt hours generated by, or purchased \n     from, qualified renewable energy, by\n       (ii) 0.004, and dividing the product so derived by 2,000.\n       (G) Prohibitions.--\n       (i) No allowances shall be allocated under this subsection \n     for the implementation of programs that are exclusively \n     informational or educational in nature.\n       (ii) No allowances shall be allocated for energy \n     conservation measures or renewable energy that were \n     operational before January 1, 1992.\n       (3) Savings Provision.--Nothing in this subsection \n     precludes a State or State regulatory authority from \n     providing additional incentives to utilities to encourage \n     investment in demand-side resources.\n       (4) Regulations.--The Administrator shall implement this \n     subsection under 40 C.F.R. Part 73 (2002), amended as \n     appropriate by the Administrator. Such regulations shall list \n     energy conservation measures and renewable energy sources \n     which may be treated as qualified energy conservation \n     measures and qualified renewable energy for purposes of this \n     subsection. Allowances shall only be allocated if all \n     requirements of this subsection and the rules promulgated to \n     implement this subsection are complied with. The \n     Administrator shall review the determinations of\n\n[[Page S14350]]\n\n     each State regulatory authority under this subsection to \n     encourage consistency from electric utility and from State-\n     to-State in accordance with the Administrator's rules. The \n     Administrator shall publish and make available to the public \n     the findings of this review no less than annually.\n       (g) Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve.--The \n     Administrator shall establish a Conservation and Renewable \n     Energy Reserve under this subsection. Beginning on January 1, \n     1995, the Administrator may allocate from the Conservation \n     and Renewable Energy Reserve an amount equal to a total of \n     300,000 allowances for emissions of sulfur dioxide pursuant \n     to section 411. In order to provide 300,000 allowances for \n     such reserve, in each year beginning in calendar year 2000 \n     and until calendar year 2009, inclusive, the Administrator \n     shall reduce each unit's basic Phase II allowance allocation \n     on the basis of its pro rata share of 30,000 allowances. \n     Notwithstanding the prior sentence, if allowances remain in \n     the reserve on January 1, 2010, the Administrator shall \n     allocate such allowances for affected units under section 414 \n     on a pro rata basis. For purposes of this subsection, for any \n     unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of \n     section 414, the term ``pro rata basis'' refers to the ratio \n     which the reductions made in such unit's allowances in order \n     to establish the reserve under this subsection bears to the \n     total of such reductions for all such units.\n       (h) Alternative Allowance Allocation for Units in Certain \n     Utility Systems With Optional Baseline.--\n       (1) Optional Baseline for Units in Certain Systems.--In the \n     case of a unit subject to the emissions limitation \n     requirements of this section which (as of November 15, \n     1990)--\n       (A) has an emission rate below 1.0 lbs/mmBtu,\n       (B) has decreased its sulfur dioxide emissions rate by 60 \n     percent or greater since 1980, and\n       (C) is part of a utility system which has a weighted \n     average sulfur dioxide emissions rate for all fossil fueled-\n     fired units below 1.0 lbs/mmBtu, at the election to the owner \n     or operator of such unit, the unit's baseline may be \n     calculated\n       (i) as provided under section 411, or\n       (ii) by utilizing the unit's average annual fuel \n     consumption at a 60 percent capacity factor. Such election \n     shall be made no later than March 1, 1991.\n       (2) Allowance Allocation.--Whenever a unit referred to in \n     paragraph (1) elects to calculate its baseline as provided in \n     clause (ii) of paragraph (1), the Administrator shall \n     allocate allowances for the unit pursuant to section 412(a), \n     this section, and section 414 (as Basic Phase II allowance \n     allocations) in an amount equal to the baseline selected \n     multiplied by the lower of the average annual emission rate \n     for such unit in 1989, or 1.0 lbs./mmBtu. Such allowance \n     allocation shall be in lieu of any allocation of allowances \n     under this section and section 414.\n\n     SEC. 414. PHASE II. SULFUR DIOXIDE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Applicability.--\n       (1) After January l, 2000, each existing utility unit as \n     provided below is subject to the limitations or requirements \n     of this section. Each utility unit subject to an annual \n     sulfur dioxide tonnage emission limitation under this section \n     is an affected unit under this subpart. Each source that \n     includes one or more affected units is an affected source. In \n     the case of an existing unit that was not in operation during \n     calendar year 1985, the emission rate for a calendar year \n     after 1985, as determined by the Administrator, shall be used \n     in lieu of the 1985 rate.\n       (2) In addition to basic Phase II allowance allocations, in \n     each year beginning in calendar year 2000 and ending in \n     calendar year 2009, inclusive, the Administrator shall \n     allocate up to 530,000 Phase II bonus allowances pursuant to \n     subsections (b)(2),(c)(4), (d)(3)(A) and (B), and (h)(2) of \n     this section and section 415.\n       (3) In addition to basic Phase II allowances allocations \n     and Phase II bonus allowance allocations, beginning January \n     1, 2000, the Administrator shall allocate for each unit \n     listed on Table A in section 413 (other than units at Kyger \n     Creek, Clifty Creek, and Joppa Stream) and located in the \n     States of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Georgia, Alabama, \n     Missouri, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, or Tennessee \n     allowances in an amount equal to 50,000 multiplied by the \n     unit's pro rata share of the total number of basic allowances \n     allocated for all units listed on Table A (other than units \n     at Kyger Creek, Clifty Creek, and Joppa Stream). Allowances \n     allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to \n     the 8,900,000 ton limitation in section 412(a).\n       (b) Units Equal to, or Above, 75 MWe and 1.20 lbs/mmBtu.--\n       (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3), after \n     January 1, 2000, it shall be unlawful for any existing \n     utility unit that serves a generator with nameplate capacity \n     equal to, or greater, than 75 MWe and an actual 1985 emission \n     rate equal to or greater than 1.201bs/mmBtu to exceed an \n     annual sulfur dioxide tonnage emission limitation equal to \n     the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by an emission \n     rate equal to 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000, unless the \n     owner or operator of such unit holds allowances to emit not \n     less than the unit's total annual emissions or, for a year \n     after 2007, unless the owner or operator of the source that \n     includes such unit holds allowances to emit not less than the \n     total annual emissions of all affected units at the source.\n       (2) In addition to allowances allocated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) and section 412(a) as basic Phase II allowance \n     allocations, beginning January 1, 2000, and for each calendar \n     year thereafter until and including 2009, the Administrator \n     shall allocate annually for each unit subject to the \n     emissions limitation requirements of paragraph (1) with an \n     actual 1985 emissions rate greater than 1.20 lbs/mmBtu and \n     less than 2.50 lbs/mmBtu and a baseline capacity factor of \n     less than 60 percent, allowances from the reserve created \n     pursuant to subsection (a)(2) in an amount equal to 1.20 lbs/\n     mmBtu multiplied by 50 percent of the difference, on a Btu \n     basis, between the unit's baseline and the unit's fuel \n     consumption at a 60 percent capacity factor.\n       (3) After January 1, 2000, it shall be unlawful for any \n     existing utility unit with an actual 1985 emissions rate \n     equal to or greater than 1.20 lbs/mmBtu whose annual average \n     fuel consumption during 1985, 1986, and 1987 on a Btu basis \n     exceeded 90 percent in the form of lignite coal which is \n     located in a State in which, as of July 1, 1989, no county or \n     portion of a county was designated nonattainment under \n     section 107 of this Act for any pollutant subject to the \n     requirements of section 109 of this Act to exceed an annual \n     sulfur dioxide tonnage limitation equal to the product of the \n     unit's baseline multiplied by the lesser of the unit's actual \n     1985 emissions rate or its allowable 1985 emissions rate, \n     divided by 2,000, unless the owner or operator of such unit \n     holds allowances to emit not less than the unit's total \n     annual emissions or, for a year after 2007, unless the owner \n     or operator of the source that includes such unit holds \n     allowances to emit not less than the total annual emissions \n     of all affected units at the source.\n       (4) After January 1, 2000, the Administrator shall allocate \n     annually for each unit, subject to the emissions limitation \n     requirements of paragraph (1), which is located in a State \n     with an installed electrical generating capacity of more than \n     30,000,000 kw in 1988 and for which was issued a prohibition \n     order or a proposed prohibition order (from burning oil), \n     which unit subsequently converted to coal between January 1, \n     1980 and December 31, 1985, allowances equal to the \n     difference between (A) the product of the unit's annual fuel \n     consumption, on a Btu basis, at a 65 percent capacity factor \n     multiplied by the lesser of its actual or allowable emissions \n     rate during the first full calendar year after conversion, \n     divided by 2,000, and (B) the number of Page-69- allowances \n     allocated for the unit pursuant to paragraph (1): Provided, \n     That the number of allowances allocated pursuant to this \n     paragraph shall not exceed an annual total of five thousand. \n     If necessary to meeting the restriction imposed in the \n     preceding sentence the Administrator shall reduce, pro rata, \n     the annual allowances allocated for each unit under this \n     paragraph.\n       (c) Coal or Oil-Fired Units Below 75 MWE and Above 1.20 \n     lbs/MMBTU.--\n       (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3), after \n     January 1, 2000, it shall be unlawful for a coal or oil-fired \n     existing utility unit that serves a generator with nameplate \n     capacity of less than 75 MWe and an actual 1985 emission rate \n     equal to, or greater than, 1.20 lbs/mmBtu and which is a unit \n     owned by a utility operating company whose aggregate \n     nameplate fossil fuel steam-electric capacity is, as of \n     December 31, 1989, equal to, or greater than, 250 MWe to \n     exceed an annual sulfur dioxide emissions limitation equal to \n     the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by an emission \n     rate equal to 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000 unless the \n     owner or operator of such unit holds allowances to emit not \n     less than the unit's total annual emissions for a year after \n     2007, or the owner or operator of the source that includes \n     such unit holds allowances to emit not less than the total \n     annual emissions of all affected units at the source.\n       (2) After January 1, 2000, it shall be unlawful for a coal \n     or oil-fired existing utility unit that serves a generator \n     with nameplate capacity of less than 75 MWe and an actual \n     1985 emission rate equal to, or greater than, 1.20 lbs/mmBtu \n     (excluding units subject to section 111 of the Act or to a \n     federally enforceable emissions limitation for sulfur dioxide \n     equivalent to an annual rate of less than 1.20 lbs/mmBtu) and \n     which is a unit owned by a utility operating company whose \n     aggregate nameplate fossil fuel steam-electric capacity is, \n     as of December 31, 1989, less than 250 MWe, to exceed an \n     annual sulfur dioxide tonnage emissions limitation equal to \n     the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by the lesser \n     of its actual

INDUSTRIAL SULFUR DIOXIDE EMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Report.--Not later than January 1, 1995 and every 5 \n     years thereafter, the Administrator shall transmit to the \n     Congress a report containing an inventory of national annual \n     sulfur dioxide emissions from industrial\n\n[[Page S14354]]\n\n     sources (as defined in section 411 (11)), including units \n     subject to section 414(g)(2), for all years for which data \n     are available, as well as the likely trend in such emission \n     over the following twenty-year period. The reports shall also \n     contain estimates of the actual emission reduction in each \n     year resulting from promulgation of the diesel fuel \n     desulfurization regulations under section 214.\n       (b) 5.60 Million Ton Cap.--Whenever the inventory required \n     by this section indicates that sulfur dioxide emissions from \n     industrial sources, including units subject to section \n     414(g)(2), and may reasonably be expected to reach levels \n     greater than 5.60 million tons per year, the Administrator \n     shall take such actions under the Act as may be appropriate \n     to ensure that such emissions do not exceed 5.60 million tons \n     per year. Such actions may include the promulgation of new \n     and revised standards of performance for new sources, \n     including units subject to section 414(g)(2), under section \n     111(b), as well as promulgation of standards of performance \n     for existing sources, including units subject to section \n     414(g)(2), under authority of this section. For an existing \n     source regulated under this section, ``standard of \n     performance'' means a standard which the Administrator \n     determines is applicable to that source and which reflects \n     the degree of emission reduction achievable through the \n     application of the best system of continuous emission \n     reduction which (taking into consideration the cost of \n     achieving such emission reduction, and any nonair quality \n     health and environmental impact and energy requirements) the \n     Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated for \n     that category of sources.\n       (c) Election.--Regulations promulgated under section 414(b) \n     shall not prohibit a source from electing to become an \n     affected unit under section 417.\n\n     SEC. 419. TERMINATION.\n\n       Starting January l, 2010, the owners or operators of \n     affected units and affected facilities under sections 412(b) \n     and (c) and 416 and shall no longer be subject to the \n     requirements of sections 412 through 417.\n\n        Subpart 2--Clear Skies Sulfur Dioxide Allowance Program\n\n     SEC. 421.

EGU ALLOCATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 36 months before the \n     commencement date of the sulfur dioxide allowance requirement \n     of section 422, the Administrator shall promulgate \n     regulations determining allocations of sulfur dioxide \n     allowances for affected EGUs for each year during 2010 and \n     thereafter. The regulations shall provide that:\n       (1) 93 percent of the total amount of sulfur dioxide \n     allowances allocated each year to fossil-fuel-fired affected \n     EGUs under section 424 shall be allocated by the \n     Administrator to individual EGUs in the proportion to which \n     the number of allowances to emit sulfur dioxide allocated to \n     such EGUs under sections 413, 415, and 416 or their \n     predecessors in effect prior to enactment of the Clear Skies \n     Act of 2003 based on the aggregated number of allowances to \n     emit sulfur dioxide issue to all sources under subpart 1 of \n     part B of this title or its predecessor in effect prior to \n     enactment of the Clear Skies Act of 2003.\n       (A) The Administrator shall allocate sulfur dioxide \n     allowances to each facility's account and each general \n     account in the Allowance Tracking System under section 403(c) \n     as follows:\n       (i) For each unit account and each general account in the \n     Allowance Tracking System, the Administrator shall determine \n     the total amount of sulfur dioxide allowances allocated under \n     subpart 1 for 2010 and thereafter that are recorded, as of \n     12:00 noon, Eastern Standard time, on the date 180 days after \n     enactment of the Clear Skies Act of 2003. The Administrator \n     shall determine this amount in accordance with 40 CFR Part 73 \n     (2002), amended as appropriate by the Administrator, except \n     that the Administrator shall apply a discount rate of 7 \n     percent for each year after 2010 to the amounts of sulfur \n     dioxide allowances allocated for 2011 or later.\n       (ii) For each unit account and each general account in the \n     Allowance Tracking System, the Administrator shall determine \n     an amount of sulfur dioxide allowances equal to the \n     allocation amount under subparagraph (A) multiplied by the \n     ratio of the amount of sulfur dioxide allowances determined \n     to be recorded in that account under clause (i) to the total \n     amount of sulfur dioxide allowances determined to be recorded \n     in all unit accounts and general accounts in the Allowance \n     Tracking System under clause (i).\n       (iii) The Administrator shall allocate to each facility's \n     account in the Allowance Tracking System an amount of sulfur \n     dioxide allowances equal to the total amount of sulfur \n     dioxide allowances determined under clause (ii) for the unit \n     accounts of the units at the facility and shall allocate to \n     each general account in the Allowance Tracking System the \n     amount of sulfur dioxide allowances determined under clause \n     (ii) for that general account.\n       (2)(A) 7 percent of the total amount of sulfur dioxide \n     allowances allocated each year under section 423 shall be \n     allocated for units at a facility that are affected EGUs, but \n     did not receive sulfur dioxide allocations under subpart 1 of \n     this title.\n       (B) The Administrator shall allocate each year for the \n     units under subparagraph (A) that commenced operation before \n     January 1, 2001, an amount of sulfur dioxide allowances \n     determined by:\n       (i) For such units at the facility that are coal-fired, \n     multiplying 0.40 lb/mmBtu by the total baseline heat input of \n     such units and converting to tons.\n       (ii) For such units at the facility that are oil-fired, \n     multiplying 0.20 lb/mmBtu by the total baseline heat input of \n     such units and converting to tons.\n       (iii) For all such other units at the facility that are not \n     covered by clause (i) or (ii), multiplying 0.05 lb/mmBtu by \n     the total baseline heat input of such units and converting to \n     tons.\n       (iv) If the total of the amounts for all facilities under \n     clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) exceeds the allocation amount \n     under subparagraph (A), multiplying the allocation amount \n     under subparagraph (A) by the ratio of the total of the \n     amounts for the facility under clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) \n     to the total of the amounts for all facilities under clause \n     (i), (ii), and (iii).\n       (v) Allocating to each facility the lesser of the total of \n     the amounts for the facility under clauses (i), (ii), and \n     (iii) or, if the total of the amounts for all facilities \n     under clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) exceeds the allocation \n     amount under subparagraph (A), the amount under clause (iv).\n       (C) The Administrator shall allocate each year for units \n     under subparagraph (A) that commence commercial operation on \n     or after January l, 2001 and before January 1, 2005, an \n     amount of sulfur dioxide allowances determined by:\n       (i) For such units at the facility that are coal-fired or \n     oil-fired, multiplying 0.19 lb/\n\n[[Page S14355]]\n\n     mmBtu by the total baseline heat input of such units and \n     converting to tons.\n       (ii) For all such other units at the facility that are not \n     covered by clause (i), multiplying .005 lb/mmBtu by the total \n     baseline heat input of such units and converting to tons.\n       (iii) If the total of the amounts for all facilities under \n     clauses (i) and (ii) exceeds the allocation amount under \n     subparagraph (A), multiplying the allocation amount under \n     subparagraph (A) by the ratio of the total of the amounts for \n     the facility under clauses (i) and (ii) to the total of the \n     amounts for all facilities under clauses (i) and (ii).\n       (iv) Allocating to each facility the lesser of the total of \n     the amounts for the facility under clauses (i) and (ii) or, \n     if the total of the amounts for all facilities under clauses \n     (i) and (ii) exceeds the allocation amount under subparagraph \n     (A), the amount under clause (iv). The Administrator shall \n     allocate to the facilities under paragraphs (1) and (2) on a \n     pro rata basis (based on the allocations under those \n     paragraphs) any unallocated allowances under this paragraph.\n       (D) The Administrator shall allocate each year for units \n     under subparagraph (A) that commence commercial operation on \n     or after January 1, 2005, an amount of sulfur dioxide \n     allowances determined for each such unit at the facility by \n     multiplying the applicable National Emissions Standard under \n     section 481 by the applicable ``baseline heat input,'' \n     considering fuel and combustion type, as defined in section \n     402(5)(B) and converting to tons.\n       (E) In the event that allocation demand exceeds supply, the \n     Administrator shall allocate allowances under subparagraph \n     (A) giving first priority to units qualifying under \n     subparagraph (B), second priority to units qualifying under \n     subparagraph (C), and third priority to units qualifying \n     under subparagraph (D). Allowances allocated under \n     subparagraph (D) shall be allocated to units on a first come \n     basis determined by date of unit commencement of \n     construction, provided that such unit actually commences \n     operation. As such, allocations to units under paragraph (D) \n     will not be reduced as a result of new units commencing \n     commercial operation.\n       (b)(1) Failure To Promulgate.--For each year 2010 and \n     thereafter, if the Administrator has not promulgated \n     regulations, determining allocations under subsection (a), \n     each affected EGU shall comply with section 422 by providing \n     annual notice to the permitting authority. Such notice shall \n     indicate the amount of allowances the affected EGU believes \n     it has for the relevant year and the amount of sulfur dioxide \n     emissions for such year. The amount of sulfur dioxide \n     emissions shall be determined using reasonable industry \n     accepted methods unless the Administrator has promulgated \n     applicable monitoring and alternative monitoring \n     requirements.\n       (b)(2) Upon promulgation of regulations under subsection \n     (a) determining the allocations for 2010 and thereafter, and \n     promulgating regulations under section 403(b) providing for \n     the transfer of sulfur dioxides and section 403(c) \n     establishing an Allowance Transfer System for sulfur dioxide \n     allowances, each unit's emissions shall be compared to and \n     reconciled to its actual allocations under the promulgated \n     regulations. Each unit will have nine (9) months to purchase \n     any allowance shortfall through allowances purchased from \n     other allowance holders or through direct sale. Any unit with \n     an allowance excess shall be credited allowances in \n     accordance with section 425.\n\n     SEC. 425. SULFUR DIOXIDE EARLY ACTION REDUCTION CREDITS.\n\n       (a) The Administrator shall promulgate regulations within \n     18 months authorizing the allocation of sulfur dioxide \n     allowances to units designated under this section that \n     install or modify pollution control equipment or combustion \n     technology improvements identified in such regulations after \n     the date of enactment of this section and prior to January 1, \n     2010.\n       (b) No allowances shall be allocated under this paragraph \n     for emissions reductions: attributable to pollution control \n     equipment or combustion technology improvements that were \n     operational or under construction at any time prior to the \n     date of enactment of this section; attributable to fuel \n     switching; or required under any federal regulation.\n       (c) The allowances allocated to any unit under this \n     paragraph shall be in addition to the allowances allocated \n     under section 424 and shall be allocated in an amount equal \n     to one allowance of sulfur dioxide for each 1.05 tons of \n     reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide achieved by the \n     pollution control equipment or combustion technology \n     improvements starting with the year in which the equipment or \n     improvement is implemented. The early compliance reduction \n     allowances available under this section shall be used and \n     tradeable in the same manner as allowances under section 424.\n       (d) The Administrator shall promulgate regulations as \n     necessary to ensure affected units receive early compliance \n     allowance credit. Early compliance allowances shall be \n     allocated at the end of an early compliance year. Should the \n     Administrator fail to promulgate allocation regulations by \n     the end of a given year, early compliance allowances for each \n     year shall be allocated at the earliest possible time after \n     allocation regulations are promulgated.\n\n     SEC. 426. DISPOSITION OF SULFUR DIOXIDE ALLOWANCES ALLOCATED \n                   UNDER SUBPART 1.\n\n       (a) Removal From Accounts.--After allocating allowances \n     under section 424(a)(1), the Administrator shall remove from \n     the unit accounts and general accounts in the \n     Allowance Tracking System under section 403(c) and from \n     the Special Allowances Reserve under section 418 all \n     sulfur dioxide allowances allocated or deposited under \n     subpart 1 for 2010 or later.\n       (b) Regulations.--The Administrator shall promulgate \n     regulations as necessary to assure that the requirement to \n     hold allowances under section 422 may be met using sulfur \n     dioxide allowances allocated under subpart 1 for 1995 through \n     2009. No part of this Act shall be construed to prevent use \n     of unused pre-2010 allowances to meet the requirements of \n     section 422.\n\n     SEC. 427. INCENTIVES FOR SULFUR DIOXIDE EMISSION CONTROL \n                   TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       (a) Reserve.--The Administrator shall establish a reserve \n     of 250,000 sulfur dioxide allowances comprising 83,334 sulfur \n     dioxide allowances for 2010, 83,333 sulfur dioxide allowances \n     for 2011, and 83,333 sulfur dioxide allowances for 2012.\n       (b) Application.--Not later than 18 months after the \n     enactment of the Clear Skies Act of 2003, an owner or \n     operator of an affected EGU that commenced operation before \n     2001 and that during 2001 combusted Eastern bituminous may \n     submit an application to the Administrator for sulfur dioxide \n     allowances from the reserve under subsection (a). The \n     application shall include each of the following:\n       (1) A statement that the owner or operator will install and \n     commence commercial operation of specified sulfur dioxide \n     control technology at the unit within 24 months after \n     approval of the application under subsection (c) if the unit \n     is allocated the sulfur dioxide allowances requested under \n     paragraph (4). The owner or operator shall provide \n     description of the control technology.\n       (2) A statement that, during the period starting with the \n     commencement of operation of sulfur dioxide technology under \n     paragraph (1) through 2009, the unit will combust Eastern \n     bituminous at a percentage of the unit's total heat input \n     equal to or exceeding the percentage of total heat input \n     combusted by the unit in 2001 if the unit is allocated the \n     sulfur dioxide allowances requested under paragraph (4).\n       (3) A demonstration that the unit will achieve, while \n     combusting fuel in accordance with paragraph (2) and \n     operating the sulfur dioxide control technology specified in \n     paragraph (1), a specified tonnage of sulfur dioxide emission \n     reductions during the period starting with the commencement \n     of operation of sulfur dioxide control technology under \n     subparagraph (1) through 2009. The tonnage of emission \n     reductions shall be the difference between emissions \n     monitored at a location at the unit upstream of the control \n     technology described in paragraph (1) and emissions monitored \n     at a location at the unit downstream of such control \n     technology, while the unit is combusting fuel in accordance \n     with paragraph (2).\n       (4) A request that the Administrator allocate for the unit \n     a specified number of sulfur dioxide allowances from the \n     reserve under subsection (a) for the period starting with the \n     commencement of operation of the sulfur dioxide technology \n     under paragraph (1) through 2009.\n       (5) A statement of the ratio of the number of sulfur \n     dioxide allowances requested under paragraph (4) to the \n     tonnage of sulfur dioxide emissions reductions under \n     paragraph (3).\n       (c) Approval or Disapproval.--By order subject to notice \n     and opportunity for comment, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) determine whether each application meets the \n     requirements of subsection (b);\n       (2) list the applications meeting the requirements of \n     subsection (b) and their respective allowance-to-emission-\n     reduction ratios under paragraph (b)(5) in order, from lowest \n     to highest, of such ratios;\n       (3) for each application listed under paragraph (2), \n     multiply the amount of sulfur dioxide emission reductions \n     requested by each allowance-to-emission-reduction ratio on \n     the list that equals or is less than the ratio for the \n     application;\n       (4) sum, for each allowance-to-emission-reduction ratio in \n     the list under paragraph (2), the amounts of sulfur dioxide \n     allowances determined under paragraph (3);\n       (5) based on the calculations in paragraph (4), determine \n     which allowance-to-emission-reduction ratio on the list under \n     paragraph (2) results in the highest total amount of \n     allowances that does not exceed 250,000 allowances; and\n       (6) approve each application listed under paragraph (2) \n     with a ratio equal to or less than the allowance-to-emission-\n     reduction ratio determined under paragraph (5) and disapprove \n     all the other applications.\n       (d) Monitoring.--An owner or operator whose application is \n     approved under subsection (c) shall install and operate a \n     CEMS for monitoring sulfur dioxide and to quality assure the \n     data. The installation of the CEMS and the quality assurance \n     of data shall be in accordance with subparagraph (a)(2)(B) \n     and subsections (c) through (e) of section 405, except that, \n     where two or more units utilize a single stack, and one or \n     more units are not subject to such standards, separate \n     monitoring shall be required for each unit.\n       (e) Allocations.--Not later than 6 months after the \n     commencement date of the sulfur dioxide allowance requirement \n     of section 422, for the units for which applications are \n     approved under subsection (c), the Administrator shall \n     allocate sulfur dioxide allowances as follows:\n\n[[Page S14356]]\n\n       (1) For each unit, the Administrator shall multiply the \n     allowance-to-emission-reduction ratio of the last application \n     that the Administrator approved under subsection (c) by the \n     lesser of--\n       (A) the total tonnage of sulfur dioxide emissions \n     reductions achieved by the unit, during the period starting \n     with the commencement of operation of the sulfur dioxide \n     control technology under subparagraph (b)(1) through 2009, \n     through use of such control technology; or\n       (B) the tonnage of sulfur dioxide emission reductions under \n     paragraph (b)(3).\n       (2) If the total amount of sulfur dioxide allowances \n     determined for all units under paragraph (1) exceeds 250,000 \n     sulfur dioxide allowances, the Administrator shall multiply \n     250,000 sulfur dioxide allowances by the ratio of the amount \n     of sulfur dioxide allowances determined for each unit under \n     paragraph (1) to the total amount of sulfur dioxide \n     allowances determined for all units under paragraph (1).\n       (3) The Administrator shall allocate to each unit the \n     lesser of the amount determined for that unit under paragraph \n     (1) or, if the total amount of sulfur dioxide allowances \n     determined for all units under paragraph (1) exceeds 250,000 \n     sulfur dioxide allowances, under paragraph (2). The \n     Administrator shall allocate to the facilities under section \n     424 paragraphs (1) and (2) on a pro rata basis (based on the \n     allocations under those paragraphs) any unallocated \n     allowances under this paragraph.\n\n              Subpart 3--Western Regional Air Partnership\n\n     SEC. 431.

The Administrator may make such \n     determination only if all the WRAP States submit to the \n     Administrator a petition requesting that the Administrator \n     issue such determination and make all affected EGUs in the \n     WRAP States subject to the requirements of sections 432 \n     through 434; and\n       (B) each year after the ``covered year'' under subparagraph \n     (A).\n       (5) The term ``oil-fired'' with regard to a unit means, for \n     purposes of section 434, a unit combusting fuel oil for more \n     than 10 percent of the unit's total heat input, and \n     combusting no coal or coal-derived fuel, and any year during \n     the period from the eighth through the fourth year before the \n     first covered year.\n       (6) The term ``WRAP State'' means Arizona, California, \n     Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and \n     Wyoming.\n\n     SEC. 432. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Starting January 1 of the first covered \n     year, it shall be unlawful for the affected EGUs at a \n     facility to emit a total amount of sulfur dioxide during the \n     year in excess of the number of sulfur dioxide allowances \n     held for such facility for that year by the owner or operator \n     of the facility.\n       (b) Allowances Held.--Only sulfur dioxide allowances under \n     section 433 shall be held in order to meet the requirements \n     of subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 433. LIMITATIONS ON TOTAL EMISSIONS.\n\n       For affected EGUs, the total amount of sulfur dioxide \n     allowances that the Administrator shall allocate for each \n     covered year under section 434 shall equal 271,000 tons.\n\n     SEC. 434. EGU ALLOCATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--By January 1 of the year before the first \n     covered year, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations \n     determining, for each covered year, the allocations of sulfur \n     dioxide allowances for the units at a facility that are \n     affected EGUs as of December 31 of the fourth year before the \n     covered year by--\n       (1) for such units at the facility that are coal-fired, \n     multiplying 0.40 lb/mmBtu by the total adjusted baseline heat \n     input of such units and converting to tons;\n       (2) for such units at the facility that are oil-fired, \n     multiplying 0.20 lb/mmBtu by the total adjusted baseline heat \n     input of such units and converting to tons;\n       (3) for all such other units at the facility that are not \n     covered by paragraph (1) or (2) multiplying 0.05 lb/mmBtu by \n     the total adjusted baseline heat input of such units and \n     converting to tons; and\n       (4) multiplying by 0.95 the allocation amount under section \n     433 by the ratio of the total of the amounts for the facility \n     under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) to the total of the \n     amounts for all facilities under paragraphs (1), (2), and \n     (3); and\n       (5)(A) 5 percent of the total amount of sulfur dioxide \n     allowances allocated each year under section 433 shall be \n     allocated for units at a facility that are affected EGUs, but \n     did not receive sulfur dioxide allocations under paragraph \n     (4). These units shall be allocated allowances in accordance \n     with paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).\n       (B) Allowances allocated under subparagraph (A) shall be \n     allocated to units on a first come basis determined by date \n     of unit commencement of construction, provided that such unit \n     actually commences operation. As such, allocations to units \n     under paragraph (A) will not be reduced as a result of new \n     units commencing commercial operation.\n       (C) Allowances not allocated under subparagraph (B) shall \n     be allocated to units in paragraphs (A) and (B) on a pro rata \n     basis.\n       (b)(1) Failure To Promulgate.--For each year 2010 and \n     thereafter, if the Administrator has not promulgated \n     regulations, determining allocations under paragraph (a), \n     each affected EGU shall comply with section 422 by provided \n     annual notice to the permitting authority. Such notice shall \n     indicate the amount of allowances the affected EGU believes \n     it has for the relevant year and the amount of sulfur dioxide \n     emissions for such year. The amount of sulfur dioxide \n     emissions shall be determined using reasonable industry \n     accepted methods unless the Administrator has promulgated \n     applicable monitoring and alternative monitoring \n     requirements.\n       (2) Upon promulgation of regulations under subsection (a) \n     determining the allocations for 2010 and thereafter, and \n     promulgating regulations under section 403(b) providing for \n     the transfer of sulfur dioxides and section 403(c) \n     establishing an Allowance Transfer System for sulfur dioxide \n     allowances, each unit's emissions shall be compared to and \n     reconciled to its actual allocations under the promulgated \n     regulations. Each unit will have nine (9) months to purchase \n     any allowance shortfall through allowances purchased from \n     other allowance holders or through direct sale. Any unit with \n     an allowance excess shall be credited allowances in \n     accordance with section 435.\n\n     SEC. 435. WRAP EARLY ACTION REDUCTION CREDITS\n\n       (a) The Administrator shall promulgate regulations within \n     18 months authorizing the allocation of sulfur dioxide \n     allowances to units designated under this section that \n     install or modify pollution control equipment or combustion \n     technology improvements identified in such regulations after \n     the date of enactment of this section and prior to January 1, \n     2010.\n       (b) No allowances shall be allocated under this paragraph \n     for emissions reductions: attributable to pollution control \n     equipment or combustion technology improvements that were \n     operational or under construction at any time prior to the \n     date of enactment of this section; attributable to fuel \n     switching; or required under any federal regulation.\n       (c) The allowances allocated to any unit under this \n     paragraph shall be in addition to the allowances allocated \n     under section 434 and shall be allocated in an amount equal \n     to one allowance of sulfur dioxide for each 1.05 tons of \n     reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide achieved by the \n     pollution control equipment or combustion technology \n     improvements starting with the year in which the equipment or \n     improvement is implemented. The early compliance reduction \n     allowances available under this section shall be used and \n     tradeable in the same manner as allowances under section 434.\n       (d) The Administrator shall promulgate regulations as \n     necessary to ensure affected units receive early compliance \n     allowance credit. Early compliance allowances shall be \n     allocated at the end of an early compliance\n\n[[Page S14357]]\n\n     year. Should the Administrator fail to promulgate allocation \n     regulations by the end of a given year, early compliance \n     allowances for each year shall be allocated at the earliest \n     possible time after allocation regulations are promulgated.\n\n        Part C--Nitrogen Oxides Clear Skies Emission Reductions\n\n                      Subpart 1--Acid Rain Program\n\n     SEC. 441. NITROGEN OXIDES EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Applicability.--On the date that a coal-fired utility \n     unit becomes an affected unit pursuant to sections 413 or \n     414, or on the date a unit subject to the provisions of \n     section 413(d), must meet the NOX reduction \n     requirements, each such unit shall become an affected unit \n     for purposes of this section and shall be subject to the \n     emission limitations for nitrogen oxides set forth herein.\n       (b) Emission Limitations.--(1) The Administrator shall by \n     regulation establish annual allowable emission limitations \n     for nitrogen oxides for the types of utility boilers listed \n     below, which limitations shall not exceed the rates listed \n     below: Provided, That the Administrator may set a rate higher \n     than that listed for any type of utility boiler if the \n     Administrator finds that the maximum listed rate for that \n     boiler type cannot be achieved using low NOX \n     burner technology. The Administrator shall implement this \n     paragraph under 40 CFR Part 76.5 (2002). The maximum \n     allowable emission rates are as follows:\n       (A) for tangentially fired boilers, 0.45 lb/mmBtu; and\n       (B) for dry bottom wall-fired boilers (other than units \n     applying cell burner technology), 0.50 lb/mmBtu. After \n     January 1, 1995, it shall be unlawful for any unit that is an \n     affected unit on that date and is of the type listed in this \n     paragraph to emit nitrogen oxides in excess of the emission \n     rates set by the Administrator pursuant to this paragraph.\n       (2) The Administrator shall, by regulation, establish \n     allowable emission limitations on a lb/mmBtu, annual average \n     basis, for nitrogen oxides for the following types of utility \n     boilers:\n       (A) wet bottom wall-fired boilers;\n       (B) cyclones;\n       (C) units applying cell burner technology; and\n       (D) all other types of utility boilers.\n\n       The Administrator shall base such rates on the degree of \n     reduction achievable through the retrofit application of the \n     best system of continuous emission reduction, taking into \n     account available technology, costs and energy and \n     environmental impacts; and which is comparable to the costs \n     of nitrogen oxides controls set pursuant to subsection \n     (b)(1). The Administrator may revise the applicable emission \n     limitations for tangentially fired and dry bottom, wall-fired \n     boilers (other than cell burners) to be more stringent if the \n     Administrator determines that more effective low NOx burned \n     technology is available: Provided, That, no unit that is an \n     affected unit pursuant to section 413 and that is subject to \n     the requirements of subsection (b)(1), shall be subject to \n     the revised emission limitations, if any. The Administrator \n     shall implement that paragraph under 40 C.F.R. Parts 76.6 and \n     76.7 (2002).\n       (c) Alternative Emission Limitations.--(1) The permitting \n     authority shall, upon request of an owner or operator of a \n     unit subject to this section, authorize an emission \n     limitation less stringent than the applicable limitation \n     established under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) upon a \n     determination that--\n       (A) a unit subject to subsection (b)(1) cannot meet the \n     applicable limitation using low NOx burner technology; or\n       (B) a unit subject to subsection (b)(2) cannot meet the \n     applicable rate using the technology on which the \n     Administrator based the applicable emission limitation.\n       (2) The permitting authority shall base such determination \n     upon a reasonable showing satisfactory to the permitting \n     authority, in accordance with regulations established by the \n     Administrator, that the owner or operator--\n       (A) has properly installed appropriate control equipment \n     designed to meet the applicable emission rate;\n       (B) has properly operated such equipment for a period of 15 \n     months (or such other period of time as the Administrator \n     determines through the regulations), and provides operating \n     and monitoring data for such period demonstrating that the \n     unit cannot meet the applicable emission rate; and\n       (C) has specified an emission rate that such unit can meet \n     on an annual average basis. The permitting authority shall \n     issue an operating permit for the unit in question, in \n     accordance with section 404 and title V--\n       (i) that permits the unit during the demonstration period \n     referred to in subparagraph (B), to emit at a rate in excess \n     of the applicable emission rate;\n       (ii) at the conclusion of the demonstration period to \n     revise the operating permit to reflect the alternative \n     emission rate demonstrated in subparagraphs (B) and (C).\n       (3) Units subject to subsection (b)(1) for which an \n     alternative emission limitation is established shall not be \n     required to install any additional control technology beyond \n     low NOx burners. Nothing in this section shall preclude an \n     owner or operator from installing and operating an \n     alternative NOx control technology capable of achieving the \n     applicable emission limitation. The Administrator shall \n     implement this subsection under 40 C.F.R. Part 76 (2002), \n     amended as appropriate by the Administrator.\n       (d) Emissions Averaging.--\n       (1) In lieu of complying with the applicable emission \n     limitations under subsection (b)(1), (2), or (c), the owner \n     or operator of two or more units subject to one or more of \n     the applicable emission limitations set pursuant to these \n     sections, may petition the permitting authority for \n     alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitations for \n     such units that ensure that--\n       (A) the actual annual emission rate in pounds of nitrogen \n     oxides per million Btu averaged over the units in question is \n     a rate that is less than, or equal to,\n       (B) the Btu-weighted average annual emission rate for the \n     same units if they had been operated, during the same period \n     of time, in compliance with limitations set in accordance \n     with the applicable emission rates set pursuant to \n     subsections (b)(1) and (2).\n       (2) If the permitting authority determines, in accordance \n     with regulations issued by the Administrator that the \n     conditions in paragraph (1) can be met, the permitting \n     authority shall issue operating permits for such units, in \n     accordance with section 404 and title V, that allow \n     alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitations. Such \n     emission limitations shall only remain in effect while both \n     units continue operation under the conditions specified in \n     their respective operating permits.

However, the regulations shall not allocate \n     allowances to any affected unit in excess of the product of \n     the unit's baseline heat input multiplied by the unit's \n     allowable nitrogen oxides emissions rate, divided by 2000.\n       (B) 5 percent of the total amount of nitrogen oxides \n     allowances allocated each year under section 453 shall be \n     allocated for units at a facility that are affected EGUs, but \n     did not receive nitrogen oxides allocations under paragraph \n     (A). These units shall be allocated allowances for each year \n     by multiplying the allocation amount under section 453(a) by \n     the ratio of the total amount of the adjusted baseline heat \n     input of such units at the facility to the total amount of \n     adjusted baseline heat input to all affected EGUs in the Zone \n     1 States, including those covered in (A). However, the \n     regulations shall not allocate allowances to any affected \n     unit in excess of the product of the unit's baseline heat \n     input multiplied by the unit's allowable nitrogen oxides \n     emissions rate, divided by 2000.\n       (C) Allowances allocated under subparagraph (B) shall be \n     allocated to units on a first come basis determined by date \n     of unit commencement of construction, provided that such unit \n     actually commences operation. As such, allocations to units \n     under paragraph (B) will not be reduced as a result of new \n     units commencing commercial operation.\n       (D) Allowances not allocated under subparagraph (B) shall \n     be allocated to units in paragraphs (A) and (B) on a pro rata \n     basis.\n       (E) For each year 2008 and thereafter, if the Administrator \n     has not promulgated the regulations determining allocation \n     under subsection (a):\n       (i) each affected unit shall comply with section 452 by \n     providing annual notice to the permitting authority. Such \n     notice shall indicate the amount of allowances the affected \n     unit believes it has for the relevant year and the amount of \n     nitrogen oxide emissions for such year. The amount of \n     nitrogen oxide emissions shall be determined using reasonable \n     industry accepted methods unless the Administrator has \n     promulgated applicable monitoring and alternative monitoring \n     requirements; and\n       (ii) Upon promulgation of regulations under subsection (a) \n     for Zone 1 determining the allocations for 2008 and \n     thereafter, and promulgating regulations under section 403(b) \n     providing for the transfer of nitrogen oxides and section \n     403(c) establishing an Allowance Transfer System for nitrogen \n     oxide allowances, each unit's emissions shall be compared to \n     and reconcile its actual allocations under the promulgated \n     regulations. Each unit will have nine (9) months to submit \n     allowances to the Administrator, without recompense, for any \n     allowances shortfall. The submitted allowances may have been \n     obtained and held by any mechanism consistent with this Act \n     including, but not limited to, direct sale.

However, the \n     regulations shall not allocate allowances to any affected \n     unit in excess of the product of the unit's baseline heat \n     input multiplied by the unit's allowable nitrogen oxides \n     emissions rate, divided by 2000.\n       (B) 5 percent of the total amount of nitrogen oxides \n     allowances allocated each year under section 453 shall be \n     allocated for units at a facility that are affected EGUs, but \n     did not receive nitrogen oxides allocations under paragraph \n     (A). These units shall be allocated allowances for each year \n     by multiplying the allocation amount under section 453(a) by \n     the ratio of the total amount of the adjusted baseline heat \n     input of such units at the facility to the total amount of \n     adjusted baseline heat input to all affected EGUs in the Zone \n     2 States, including those covered in (A). However, the \n     regulations shall not allocate allowances to any affected \n     unit in excess of the product of the unit's baseline heat \n     input multiplied by the unit's allowable nitrogen oxides \n     emissions rate, divided by 2000.\n       (C) Allowances allocated under subparagraph (B) shall be \n     allocated to units on a first come basis determined by date \n     of unit commencement of construction, provided that such unit \n     actually commences operation. As such, allocations to units \n     under subparagraph (B) will not be reduced as a result of new \n     units commencing commercial operation.\n       (D) Allowances not allocated under subparagraph (B) shall \n     be allocated to units in paragraphs (A) and (B) on a pro rata \n     basis.\n       (E) For each year 2008 and thereafter, if the Administrator \n     has not promulgated the regulations determining allocation \n     under subsection (a):\n       (i) each affected unit shall comply with section 452 by \n     providing annual notice to the permitting authority. Such \n     notice shall indicate the amount of allowances the affected \n     unit believes it has for the relevant year and the amount of \n     nitrogen oxide emissions for such year. The amount of \n     nitrogen oxide emissions shall be determined using reasonable \n     industry accepted methods unless the Administrator has \n     promulgated applicable monitoring and alternative monitoring \n     requirements; and\n       (ii) Upon promulgation of regulations under subsection (b) \n     for Zone 2 determining the allocations for 2008 and \n     thereafter, and promulgating regulations under section 403(b) \n     providing for the transfer of nitrogen oxides and section \n     403(c) establishing an Allowance Transfer System for nitrogen \n     oxide allowances, each unit's emissions shall be compared to \n     and reconcile with its actual allocations under the \n     promulgated regulations. Each unit will have nine (9) months \n     to submit allowances to the Administrator, without \n     recompense, for any allowance shortfall. The submitted \n     allowances may have been obtained and held by any mechanism \n     consistent with this Act including, but not limited to, \n     direct sale. Any unit with an allowance excess shall be \n     credited allowances in accordance with section 455.\n\n     SEC. 455 NITROGEN OXIDES EARLY ACTION REDUCTION CREDITS.\n\n       (a) The Administrator shall promulgate regulations within \n     18 months authorizing the allocation of nitrogen oxides \n     allowances to units designated under this section that \n     install or modify pollution control equipment or combustion \n     technology improvements identified in such regulations after \n     the date of enactment of this section and prior to January l, \n     2010.\n       (b) No allowances shall be allocated under this paragraph \n     for emissions reductions: attributable to pollution control \n     equipment or combustion technology improvements that were \n     operational or under construction at any time prior to the \n     date of enactment of this section; attributable to fuel \n     switching; or required under any federal regulation.\n       (c) The allowances allocated to any unit under this \n     paragraph shall be in addition to the allowances allocated \n     under section 454 and shall be allocated in an amount equal \n     to one allowance of nitrogen oxides for each 1.05 tons of \n     reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides achieved by the \n     pollution control equipment or combustion technology \n     improvements starting with the year in which\n\n[[Page S14359]]\n\n     the equipment or improvement is implemented.

EGU ALLOCATIONS.\n\n       (a)(1) In General.--Not later than 24 months before the \n     commencement date of the mercury allowance requirement of \n     section 472, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations \n     determining allocations of mercury allowances for 2010 and \n     thereafter for units at a facility that commence commercial \n     operation by and are affected EGUs as of date of enactment. \n     The regulations shall provide that the Administrator shall \n     allocate each year for such units an amount determined by \n     multiplying by 0.95 the allocation amount in section 473 by \n     the ratio of the total amount of the adjusted baseline heat \n     input of such units at the facility to the total amount of \n     adjusted baseline heat input of all affected EGUs.\n       (2) 5 percent of the total amount of nitrogen oxides \n     allowances allocated each year under section 473 shall be \n     allocated for units at a facility that commence commercial \n     operation and are affected EGUs after the date of enactment. \n     These units shall be allocated allowances for each year by \n     multiplying the allocation amount under section 473 by the \n     ratio of the total amount of the adjusted baseline heat input \n     of such units at the facility to the total amount of adjusted \n     baseline heat input to all affected EGUs, including those \n     covered in paragraph (1). However, the regulations shall not \n     allocate allowances to any affected unit in excess of the \n     product of the unit's baseline heat input multiplied by the \n     unit's allowable mercury emissions rate, divided by 2000.\n       (3) Allowances allocated under paragraph (2) shall be \n     allocated to units on a first come basis determined by date \n     of unit commencement of construction, provided that such unit \n     actually commences commercial operation. As such, allocations \n     to units under paragraph (2) will not be reduced as a result \n     of new units commencing commercial operation.\n       (4) Allowances not allocated under paragraph (2) shall be \n     allocated to units in paragraphs (1) and (2) on a pro rata \n     basis.\n       (5) For each year 2010 and thereafter, if the Administrator \n     has not promulgated the regulations determining allocation \n     under subsection (a):\n       (i) each affected unit shall comply with section 472 by \n     providing annual notice to the permitting authority. Such \n     notice shall indicate the amount of allowances the affected \n     unit believes it has for the relevant year and the amount of \n     mercury emissions for such year. The amount of mercury \n     emissions shall be determined using reasonable industry \n     accepted methods unless the Administrator has promulgated \n     applicable monitoring and alternative monitoring \n     requirements; and\n       (ii) upon promulgation of regulations under subsection (a) \n     determining the allocations for 2010 and thereafter, and \n     promulgating regulations under section 403(b) providing for \n     the transfer of mercury allowances and section 403(c) \n     establishing an Allowance Transfer System for mercury \n     allowances, each unit's emissions shall be compared to and \n     reconcile with its actual allocations under the promulgated \n     regulation. Each unit will have nine (9) months to submit \n     allowances to the Administrator, without recompense, for any \n     allowances shortfall. The submitted allowances may have been \n     obtained and held by any mechanism consistent with the Act \n     including, but not limited to, direct sale. Any unit with an \n     allowance excess shall be credited allowances in accordance \n     with section 475.\n\n     SEC. 475. MERCURY EARLY ACTION REDUCTION CREDITS.\n\n       (a) The Administrator shall promulgate regulations within \n     18 months authorizing the allocation of nitrogen oxides \n     allowances to units designated under this section that \n     install or modify pollution control equipment or combustion \n     technology improvements identified in such regulations after \n     the date of enactment of this section and prior to January 1, \n     2010.\n       (b) No allowances shall be allocated under this paragraph \n     for emissions reductions: attributable to pollution control \n     equipment or combustion technology improvements that were \n     operational or under construction at any time prior to the \n     date of enactment of this section; attributable to fuel \n     switching; or required under any federal regulation.\n       (c) The allowances allocated to any unit under this \n     paragraph shall be in addition to the allowances allocated \n     under section 474 and shall be allocated in an amount equal \n     to one allowance of mercury for each 1.05 tons of reduction \n     in emissions of mercury achieved by the pollution control \n     equipment or combustion technology improvements starting with \n     the year in which the equipment or improvement is \n     implemented. The early compliance reduction allowances \n     available under this section shall be used and tradeable in \n     the same manner as allowances under section 474.\n       (d) The Administrator shall promulgate regulations as \n     necessary to ensure affected units receive early compliance \n     allowance credit. Early compliance allowances shall be \n     allocated at the end of an early compliance year. Should the \n     Administrator fail to promulgate allocation regulations by \n     the end of a given year, early compliance allowances for each \n     year shall be allocated at the earliest possible time after \n     allocation regulations are promulgated.\n\n     Part E--National Emission Standards; Research, Environmental \nAccountability; Major Source Preconstruction Review and Best Available \n                Retrofit Control Technology Requirements\n\n     SEC. 481.

Con. Res. 80\n\n       Whereas the revolution in medical technology has improved \n     our ability to respond to emerging threats and prevent, \n     identify, treat, and cure a broad range of diseases and \n     disabilities, and has the proven potential to bring even more \n     valuable advances in the future;\n       Whereas medical technology has driven dramatic productivity \n     gains for the benefit of patients, providers, employers, and \n     our economy;\n       Whereas investment from the United States medical \n     technology industry produces the majority of the \n     $175,000,000,000 global business in development of medical \n     devices, diagnostic products, and medical information \n     systems, allowing patients to lead longer, healthier, and \n     more productive lives;\n       Whereas the United States medical technology industry \n     supports almost 1,000,000 Americans in high-value jobs \n     located in every State, and the industry is a net contributor \n     to the United States balance of trade, with a trade surplus \n     of $3,300,000,000;\n       Whereas Japan is one of the most important trading partners \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas United States products account for roughly \\1/2\\ of \n     the global market, but garner only a \\1/3\\ share of Japan's \n     market;\n       Whereas Japan has made little progress in implementing its \n     commitments to cut product review times, improve their \n     reimbursement system, and consult bilaterally on policy \n     changes under the Market-Oriented Sector-Selective (MOSS) \n     Agreement on Medical Equipment and Pharmaceuticals, signed on \n     January 9, 1986, between the United States and Japan;\n       Whereas, although regulatory reviews in Japan remain among \n     the lengthiest in the world and Japan needs to accelerate \n     patient access to safe and beneficial medical technologies, \n     proposals currently under consideration in Japan would, in \n     many cases, actually increase regulatory burdens on \n     manufacturers and delay access without enhancing patient \n     safety;\n       Whereas the general cost of doing business in Japan is \n     among the highest in the world and is driven significantly \n     higher by certain factors in the medical technology sector, \n     and inefficiencies in Japanese distribution networks and \n     hospital payment systems and unique regulatory burdens drive \n     up the cost of bringing innovations to Japanese consumers and \n     impede patient access to life-saving and life-enhancing \n     medical technologies;\n       Whereas artificial government price caps such as the \n     foreign average price policy adopted by the Government of \n     Japan in 2002 restrict patient access and fail to recognize \n     the value of innovation;\n       Whereas less than \\1/10\\ of 1 percent of the tens of \n     thousands of medical technologies introduced in Japan in the \n     last 10 years received new product pricing;\n       Whereas the Government of Japan has adopted artificial \n     price caps that are targeted toward technologies \n     predominately marketed by United States companies and is \n     considering altering pricing rules to enable further cuts to \n     these products; and\n       Whereas these discriminatory pricing policies will allow \n     the Japanese government to take advantage of United States \n     research and development: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) urges Japan to honor its commitments under the Market-\n     Oriented Sector-Selective (MOSS) Agreement on Medical \n     Equipment and Pharmaceuticals, signed on January 9, 1986, \n     between the United States and Japan (hereafter in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``MOSS Agreement''), by--\n       (A) reducing regulatory barriers to the approval and \n     adoption of new medical technologies; and\n       (B) establishing reasonable agency performance goals for \n     premarket approvals and an appropriate, risk-based postmarket \n     system consistent with globally accepted practices;\n       (2) urges Japan to honor its commitments under the MOSS \n     Agreement to improve the reimbursement environment for \n     medical technologies by actively promoting pricing policies \n     that encourage innovation for the benefit of Japanese \n     patients and the Japanese economy; and\n       (3) urges Japan to honor its commitments under the MOSS \n     Agreement by--\n       (A) implementing fair and open processes and rules that do \n     not disproportionately harm United States medical technology \n     products; and\n       (B) providing opportunities for consultation with trading \n     partners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/10/senate-section/article/S14364-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2143.
