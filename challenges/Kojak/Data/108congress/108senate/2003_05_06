Mr. President, I come to the Chamber today to talk about \nthe budget circumstance in which we find ourselves, the President's \nproposal for additional tax cuts and, more largely, why I believe we \nare on a course that is utterly disconnected from reality.\n  First, let me say the news media reports of the tax cut debate are \namong the worst I have ever seen. I believe the American people \nlistening to news reports would believe that we are debating a tax cut \nof either $350 billion or $550 billion and that the President proposed \na tax cut of $726 billion. That is what you read about; that is what \nyou hear about; that is what is broadcast. But it is wrong. It is not \neven close to being right.\n  The President proposed a tax cut of $1.6 trillion. This at a time \nwhen we are running record budget deficits. Let me make this clear. The \ndeficit this year is going to be between $500 and $600 billion on a \nbudget of $2.2 trillion. That is a massive deficit, a record. We have \nnever had a unified deficit above $290 billion. Yet in that context, \nthe President proposes large and exploding tax cuts that will dig the \nhole deeper and deeper. And the press reports that he has proposed $700 \nbillion in tax cuts. How can this be?\n  It is very simple. In the budget that was passed, there are two pots \nof money for tax cuts: the so-called reconciled tax cuts, the ones \ngiven special protection from the normal legislative process; and the \nunreconciled tax cuts, those that have to move in the regular order. If \nyou put the two pots together, here is what passed the Senate and the \nHouse: $1.3 trillion of tax cuts.\n  What passed the House was $550 billion of so-called reconciled tax \ncuts; $725 billion unreconciled. The press has completely forgotten and \nleft out the $725 billion. You don't see it reported anywhere. So it is \nnot unusual.\n\n  I had a banker say to me this morning: Gee, Kent, I didn't realize \nthat the President was seeking $1.6 trillion of tax cuts. I thought it \nwas $726 billion and that the difference was between the $350 billion \nthat there was an agreement on in the Senate and the $550 billion in \nthe House. That sounds like a reasonable compromise.\n  Of course, that was missing the basic facts because the news media \nhas failed utterly in its responsibility to share full information with \nthe American public so they can make judgments about what the policy of \nthe country should be. This is a broad failure. It is truly remarkable. \nI read story after story in the most respected newspapers in America \nthat the tax cut is $550 billion or $350 billion. That is just one part \nof a much larger tax cut proposal that is before us.\n  In the Senate, we passed the following: $550 billion of reconciled \ntax cuts, protected from filibuster, given special protections in the \nSenate, and $725 billion of unreconciled tax cuts.\n  Why does any of this matter? It matters because of what has happened. \nTwo years ago we were told we could expect almost $6 trillion of \nsurpluses over the next decade. In fact, the specific number we were \ntold by the administration was $5.6 trillion of surpluses over the next \ndecade. The Congressional Budget Office agreed with that. Now we see, \njust 2 years later, instead of surpluses, if we enact the Republican \nbudget, the Congressional Budget Office tells us we will run $2 \ntrillion of deficits over that same period, 2002 to 2011. That is a \nreversal of $7.6 trillion in just 2 years.\n  Where did the money go? The President said in a speech the other day \nthat the reason for the disappearance of the surplus is the attack on \nthe country and the weak economy. Those are two reasons, but they are \nnot the biggest reason. He forgot the biggest reason. The biggest \nreason is the tax cuts, both already implemented and the additional \nones proposed by the President.\n  If you look over the same 10-year period, 36 percent of the \ndisappearance of the surplus is because of the tax cuts, both those \nalready implemented and those proposed in the Republican budget. \nTwenty-eight percent is from the increased spending as a result of the \nattack on this country; that is, the increased defense spending, \nincreased homeland security spending, the money to rebuild New York and \nthe money to rebuild the Pentagon. Twenty-seven percent is because of \nrevenue being lower than expected. Quite apart from the tax cuts, the \nrevenue is also lower than anticipated. That trend is continuing. In a \nfew moments, I will refer to the latest numbers on what is happening to \nour revenue. They are truly alarming.\n  I hope people are paying attention to the overall circumstance we \nface. We are in record budget deficit now. The President is proposing \nmassive additional tax cuts, although he is also proposing increased \nspending, not reduced spending to pay for the tax cuts, but increased \nspending. We are on the eve of the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration which will dramatically increase the cost to the Federal \nGovernment. Only 9 percent of the disappearance of the surplus is \nbecause of the economic downturn.\n  Some have suggested deficits are going to be relatively small and \nshort term. That is not what we see. We see very large deficits \ncontinuing throughout the entire decade. In fact, they never get below \n$300 billion on an operating basis. Those are massive budget deficits \nby any calculation. These numbers probably substantially understate the \ndeficit.\n\n  Let me repeat that. These numbers are according to the Congressional \nBudget Office. They exclude Social Security, setting Social Security \naside, as it should be. You never have deficits over the entire next 10 \nyears of less than $300 billion.\n  But that badly understates how serious the deficit situation is going \nto be. There is no money in here for the reconstruction or the \noccupation of Iraq. There is no money in here to fix the alternative \nminimum tax, which is a ticking timebomb. Right now 2 million people \nare affected by the alternative minimum tax. By the end of this decade, \nit is going to be 40 million people affected. It costs $600 billion to \nfix. There is no money in this budget for that. In truth, the revenue \nis still falling far short of expectations. That is not in these \nnumbers, either.\n  This, although it is dire, understates the seriousness of the budget \ndeficits we will face. Goldman Sachs just did an analysis. This is what \nthey found. They concluded that instead of $2 trillion of deficits over \nthe 2002 to 2011 period, if we enact the President's plan over the next \ndecade, the deficits will be over twice that: $4.2 trillion over the \n2004 to 2013 period. Remember, just 2 years ago we were told there was \ngoing to be $5.6 trillion of surpluses. Now Goldman Sachs has done an \nanalysis saying the true deficits are going to be closer to $4 trillion \nover the 2004 to 2013 time period. That is an absolutely stunning \nreversal in just 2 years.\n  We were told 2 years ago that if we enacted the President's plan, we \nwould pay off virtually all of the publicly held debt by 2008.\n  Now we see instead the gross debt of the United States exploding--\n$6.7 trillion today. If the President's plan is enacted, and what has \nbeen passed in Congress goes through, the debt will increase--gross \ndebt--to $12 trillion in 2013, and this at the worst possible time. Why \nthe worst possible time? Because the baby boom generation is going to \nstart to retire. They are going to double the number of people eligible \nfor Social Security and Medicare.\n  It is not surprising, then, that at the very time the President is \nasking for a big, new tax reduction, Republicans are asking for the \nbiggest expansion of the debt in the history of the United States. \nThink about this. We cannot pay our bills, we are running record \ndeficits, we are piling up debt at a record rate, and the President \nsays let's cut revenues some more. Now, as a short-term matter, that \nmight make some sense, to give lift to the economy. We know it \nstimulates the economy to cut taxes and to spend the money. Those two \nthings stimulate the economy.\n  In the short-term, that would make sense to me. In fact, very little \nof the\n\n[[Page S5745]]\n\nPresident's so-called stimulus package is effective this year. It is a \nvery odd thing. Only 5 percent of the President's so-called growth \npackage is effective this year at a time of economic weakness. Ninety-\nfive percent of the cost is in future years which, of course, adds to \nthe deficit, adds to the debt, at the very time the President says the \neconomy will be growing stronger.\n  So there is an incredible disconnect between what the President says \nis the problem--economic weakness now--and his plan, which is to \nprovide tax cuts that have very little impact now and have most of \ntheir cost later on, 5 years from now, 6 years from now, 10 years from \nnow--at the very time we know the cost of the Federal Government will \nbe going up as a result of the retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  Is anybody watching? Is anybody listening? Is anybody thinking about \nwhat happens to this country right over the horizon? I am not talking \nabout next year. I am not talking about the year after that. I am \ntalking about 5 and 6 years from now when the President's plan explodes \nin cost, at the very time the cost to the Federal Government explodes \nas a result of the retirement of the baby boom generation, doubling the \nnumber of people eligible for Social Security and Medicare. This is \nclearly a plan that does not add up. It doesn't connect with the \nreality that we all know is going to occur. As a result, Republicans \nare asking for the biggest increase in the debt in the history of the \ncountry. They have just asked for nearly a trillion-dollar increase in \nthe debt. The biggest previous increase was $915 billion in the \nPresident's father's administration.\n  I must say I find this circumstance alarming for the future economic \nstrength of the country. Now, this is a chart that I did not prepare. \nThis is a chart that is right out of the President's own budget. It is \nfrom page 43 of his analytical perspectives. It is the long-term view, \naccording to the President's own analysis, of what happens to the \nbudget deficits if his plan is passed--his spending plan, his revenue \nplan. Here is what he says will happen. You can see we never get out of \ndeficit and that once we get past this 10-year period, when the trust \nfunds are throwing off big surpluses, the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds are now producing big surpluses--once we get past that \npoint, the baby boomers start to retire, the cost of the President's \ntax cut explodes, and the deficits explode into large, unsustainable \namounts that will fundamentally threaten the economic security of this \ncountry.\n\n  Again, this is not my chart, this is the President's chart showing \nwhat happens, in his view, if his policies are passed--his spending \nplan, his tax plan. The deficits explode. Remember, what is most \nsobering is that we already have record deficits. Where you see the \nrelatively small amount of red ink, that represents record budget \ndeficits--the biggest we have ever had in the history of the country. \nWhat the President is saying is it is going to get worse with his \nplan--much worse.\n  A fundamental reason for that is shown on this chart. On this chart, \nthe blue bar is the Medicare trust fund. The green bar is the Social \nSecurity trust fund. The red bar is the tax cuts that have passed \nCongress in the budget. What this shows us is the trust funds right now \nfor Social Security and Medicare are running big surpluses. This year \nalone, Social Security is going to run a surplus of over $160 billion. \nBut we are not taking that money and paying down the debt or prepaying \nfor the liability that is to come. Instead, that money is being taken \nto pay for tax cuts and to pay for other expenses of Government. You \ncan see that this is the level of the tax cuts that have been enacted \nso far and that are proposed. Look what happens. As the trust funds \nstart to move from big surpluses in this decade and start to be reduced \nas the baby boomers retire--and you can see that, ultimately, in the \nnext decade they go negative, cash negative--then the trust funds are \nlosing money. That is at the very time the cost of the President's tax \ncuts explode, leading us deeper and deeper into deficits, deeper and \ndeeper into debt, when we are already experiencing record deficits. \nThis is a disconnect from reality that is very hard to understand.\n  Mr. President, some are now saying, well, deficits don't really \nmatter; you can run budget deficits like this as long as the people \nwill continue to loan you money. It is OK and it doesn't have an \nadverse effect on the economy. I don't believe that. What is amazing to \nme is most of my Republican colleagues didn't used to believe that. \nThey believed deficits matter. I always have. But I am certainly not \nalone in that judgment.\n  This quote is from Chairman Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve, \nthe man who has the dominant responsibility in this country for \nmanaging the economy--at least from the monetary point of view. That is \nthe obligation of the Federal Reserve. What does he say? He said:\n\n       There is no question that as deficits go up, contrary to \n     what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates. \n     It does have a negative impact on the economy, unless \n     attended.\n\n  Of course, that is right. How does it affect long-term interest \nrates? I think if you just think about it in commonsense terms, to the \nextent the Federal Government is going to be borrowing money, it is \ncompeting with everybody else who is trying to borrow money--people \ntrying to borrow money to buy a home, people who are trying to borrow \nmoney to buy a car, people who are borrowing money to run a small \nbusiness, or even a large business; and to the extent there is more \ncompetition for those dollars that are available, the higher cost of \nborrowing money; the higher cost of borrowing money, interest rates go \nup. When the Government runs big deficits, that is reducing the pool of \nmoney available for investment.\n  It reduces the pool of societal savings when the Federal Government \nis running deficits. If you reduce the pool of money available for \ninvestment, you reduce investment. Without investment, you cannot grow. \nThat is why many of us believe the President's so-called growth plan is \nan antigrowth plan. It is not going to help growth; in the long-term, \nit is going to hurt growth because it is all financed with borrowed \nmoney. It is all financed by putting it on the credit card. It is all \nfinanced not by cutting spending or raising other revenue, it is \nfinanced by borrowed money.\n  Chairman Greenspan just came before the House Financial Services \nCommittee. As noted in the New York Times, he said:\n\n       Tax cuts without spending reductions could be damaging.\n\n  He said very clearly:\n\n       The economy was poised to grow without further large tax \n     cuts, and the budget deficits, resulting from lower taxes \n     without offsetting reductions in spending, could be damaging \n     to the economy.\n\n  We are not talking about a growth package here. We are talking about \na package that is going to undermine growth. That is not just my view. \nIt is not just the view of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. The \ndistinguished economist Mark Zandi did an analysis of the competing \nplans before us to boost economic growth.\n  He found that the Democratic plan would provide about twice as much \njob growth in 2003 and 2004 as the President's plan but not have the \nnegative consequences of the President's plan over the next decade. He \nfound the President's plan actually hurts economic growth because it is \nall financed with borrowed money. It increases deficits, reduces the \npool of societal savings, reduces the pool of money available for \ninvestment, and hurts the economy long term.\n  It is not just Chairman Greenspan, it is not just me, it is not just \ndistinguished economists like Mr. Zandi. In fact, we have now had 10 \nNobel laureates in economics come out and say the Bush tax plan will \nnot help the economy, it will hurt the economy; that long term, it will \nreduce economic growth, not increase it.\n  Interestingly enough, that is also the conclusion of Macroeconomic \nAdvisers, who have been hired by the White House and the Congressional \nBudget Office to do this kind of economic analysis.\n  Do you know what they found? The President's plan will give a boost \nin the short term, but it is worse than doing nothing after 2004. After \n2004, it will actually hurt economic growth, will hurt job opportunity, \nwill hurt the strength of the American economy. Why? Because, once \nagain, it is financed with\n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\nborrowed money. It runs up the deficit. It runs up the debt. It reduces \nthe money available for investment, and that hurts economic growth, not \nhelp it.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has just done what is called dynamic \nscoring. You will recall that some have said, and the President has \nsaid if we cut taxes, it will actually increase revenue. We will get a \nbig boost from cutting taxes in the economy, and that will raise \nrevenue.\n  The President's own economists do not believe that. They say if you \ncut taxes, as the President has proposed, you will reduce revenue and \nreduce it dramatically.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is now headed by a man who was \npreviously on the President's Council of Economic Advisers. He was \nappointed by our Republican friends. They control the Senate and the \nHouse. They had the ability to choose the new head of the Congressional \nBudget Office. He came from the President's Council of Economic \nAdvisers. He did an analysis of what our Republican colleagues and what \nthe President are telling America.\n  The President is saying: If you go out there and cut taxes, you get \nmore revenue. That is not what the head of the Congressional Budget \nOffice found. He found you get increased deficits. Guess what? If you \ncut the revenue when you already have massive budget deficits, the \ndeficits get bigger. That is his conclusion.\n\n  Our Republican friends have said: If you just use dynamic scoring, if \nyou just take into account the effect of the tax cuts, you will see \nthat you get more revenue.\n  Their own appointee did just that. He used dynamic scoring. He took \ninto account the effect of the tax cuts, and here is what he found:\n\n       The net effect of the proposals in the President's budget \n     on economic output could be either positive or negative . . . \n     Importantly, regardless of its direction, the net effect \n     through long-term changes to the supply side of the economy . \n     . . would probably be small.\n\n  He did not stop there. He did seven different ten-year analyses of \nthe President's budget proposal. Using the old method called static \nscoring, CBO projects the President's budget has a $2.7 trillion impact \non the deficit--negative impact. In other words, it is going to take \n$900 billion of forecasted surplus. It takes that first and then goes \n$1.8 trillion in the hole. So it is a negative total impact of $2.7 \ntrillion.\n  The new head of CBO, who just came from the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers, did an analysis using the dynamic scoring our \nRepublican colleagues wanted him to do. Do you know what he found? In \nfour of the seven ten-year models, the deficits would be even larger \nthan under the old method of analyzing deficits. Why? Because the \ndeficits are increasing. It is increasing the debt, and the dead weight \nof those deficits and debt hurt the economy. They hurt the economy \nbecause they reduce societal savings. They reduce the money available \nfor investment, and without investment, you cannot grow.\n  Is anybody paying attention to these linkages? Is anybody paying \nattention to the long-term implications of what is being proposed?\n  They did dynamic scoring. In four of the seven long-term models, they \nfound deficits even larger than what occurred using the old method of \nanalysis because the effect of these tax cuts is not positive. Over \ntime it is negative because they are not offset by spending reductions. \nThey are all financed by borrowed money. You cannot borrow your way to \nprosperity. Nobody ever has. No country certainly ever has.\n  When they did this analysis, they found three models that showed \nsomewhat smaller deficits than would occur using static scoring. Using \ndynamic scoring in three of the seven long-term models, they had \nsomewhat smaller deficits, although not much smaller; instead of $2.6 \ntrillion, $2.5 trillion, and $2.3 trillion. Do you know what their \nassumption was here? That over the next decade--this is using dynamic \nscoring--over the next decade, people would work harder in anticipation \nof the large tax increases to come as a result of the President's \npolicy now; that the President's policy now will require huge tax \nincreases in the future to balance the books and, as a result, people \nwill know that and work harder over the decade; meaning, they will make \nmore money, there will be more tax revenue, and, as a result, the \ndeficits will be somewhat smaller.\n  Let's do a reality check on this question of if we just put these tax \ncuts into effect, we will get more revenue.\n  I remember very well 2 years ago. I came to this floor on many \noccasions. In the Budget Committee, I showed this chart on many \noccasions. This was CBO's analysis of where the deficit was headed, the \nrange of possibilities from the best-case scenario, in terms of the \nsurplus, to the worst-case scenario.\n  This is what they told us 2 years ago was the range of possibilities, \nand they adopted the midrange of this possible series of outcomes as \ntheir $5.6 trillion ten-year surplus projection.\n  I had so many of my Republican colleagues come to me and say: But, \nKent, you are being way too conservative. You are saying that we might \nnot get this midrange of outcomes, that it might be worse, and so we \nought to be cautious about what we do. Do you not understand that when \nwe put in place these big tax cuts, there will be more revenue, not \nless revenue; that there will be more revenue and so there will not be \n$5.6 trillion of surpluses, there will be $7 trillion of surpluses or \n$7.5 trillion of surpluses? It will be much higher than the midrange of \nthe forecast.\n  What has happened? Here is reality. That is the red line on this \nchart. This is what is projected based on what has actually happened in \nthe real world and what the President has proposed. This is where \nthings come in, not at the midpoint of the range, not at the bottom end \nof the range of CBO's forecast of possible outcomes for the surplus and \nthe deficit, but below the bottom end of the range.\n  So much for dynamic scoring saving the day. We did the big tax cuts \nthat the President said would produce more revenue. It did not work. It \ndid not come close to working. We are going down a blind alley. We are \ngoing down a path that will inexorably lead to massive budget deficits, \na massive buildup of debt, and fundamentally threaten the economic \nsecurity and strength of this country. That is where we are headed, and \nit is just as clear as it can be.\n  Newspapers all across the country are questioning the wisdom of what \nthe President is proposing. The Cleveland Plain Dealer from April 24:\n\n       Although the dividends tax cut Bush seeks might some day be \n     a reasonable step, that day is not now. Not amid talk of a \n     Federal deficit approaching $500 billion next year. Not when \n     Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman Bush just \n     reappointed, sees no economic stimulus in a plan he said, if \n     enacted, should be paid for by offsets elsewhere to avoid the \n     danger of deeper deficits. Not when there is no end in sight \n     to the costs of recreating Iraq as a democracy.\n\n  It is not only the Cleveland Plain Dealer. It is others as well. The \nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch:\n\n       The national debt isn't free. We'll pay interest on it for \n     decades. Every dollar of interest is a dollar that can't be \n     used for education, law enforcement, defense, or help for the \n     poor and elderly. The public senses this, and that is why it \n     is not eager for a new tax cut. . . . In fact, Mr. Bush is \n     steering the economy toward an iceberg. Massive deficits year \n     after year contribute to higher interest rates. Higher rates \n     can choke off prosperity.\n\n  They have it right.\n  Here is what has happened to jobs during the current administration. \nWe have lost 2.7 million jobs since January 2001. Let me be clear, the \nPresident's economic policy is not responsible for all of this. This is \na combined effect of the bubble bursting, of a runup in investments \nthat was unprecedented. It is, in part, the effect of the attack on \nthis country which, without question, hurt this country's economy. It \nis also, I believe, in part a result of an economic policy that does \nnot generate confidence going forward. We cannot run record budget \ndeficits and go out and propose increasing the spending and cutting the \nrevenue dramatically, but that is what the President is proposing.\n\n  We have record budget deficits now. He is not talking about cutting \nspending. He is increasing the spending by over $600 billion above the \nbaseline. He is cutting the revenue. Think about this. If one were at \nhome and they couldn't pay their monthly bills--their bills were more \nthan their income--would their answer be to go out and increase \nspending and reduce their income? Is that what one does? That is\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\nwhat the President is proposing we do as a nation.\n  We are going to have the biggest budget deficits in the history of \nAmerica this year. The President's answer is, increase spending and cut \nthe revenue. That might make sense as a short-term measure. That might \nmake sense for the moment to give a lift to the economy. The President \nis not proposing this as a short-term measure. He is proposing \nincreasing spending and cutting revenue over the entire next decade and \nbeyond, driving us deeper into deficit, deeper into debt, right at the \ntime we know the baby boomers are about to retire.\n  This is the record on job growth of this administration compared to \nprevious administrations. We can see in every previous administration \nwe have had positive records of job growth. In this administration, we \nhave had negative job growth. This plan is not working.\n  I said at the beginning I would talk about the latest numbers we have \nseen on revenue, and they are truly alarming. We have just received the \nresults of the first 7 months of this year in terms of the revenue. \nWhat we are finding is that revenue is running $100 billion below the \nforecast for the first 7 months of the year. We already have a \nprojection of record budget deficits, the biggest in the history of the \ncountry. Now we learn that in the first 7 months the revenue is running \n$100 billion below the forecast. That means, obviously, the deficits \nwill be $100 billion higher if those trends continue. All of us hope \nthey do not, all of us hope they are reversed, but if they do continue, \nhere is what we see: Revenues, as a percentage of our national income, \nas a percentage of our gross domestic product, are headed toward the \nlowest level since 1959.\n  Remember, 3 years ago revenue was at the highest level we have had \nsince 1969. In fact, the President used that as a reason to have a big \ntax cut. Remember? He said revenue is coming in at a higher rate as a \npercentage of our national income, as a percentage of our gross \ndomestic product, as it has been since 1969--I think he used since 1970 \nat the time in making the argument. And so he said: We have to cut \ntaxes.\n  Guess what. Now the revenue is going to be the lowest it has been \nsince 1959, and his answer is cut taxes some more, increasing spending \nand cutting taxes. This is a prescription for deficits that are deep \nand abiding and that will fundamentally hurt this economy. That is what \nChairman Greenspan is telling us. That is what 10 Nobel laureates are \ntelling us. That is what over 500 economists are telling us. That is \nwhat the Committee for Economic Development, made up of 250 of this \ncountry's leading corporations and academics, is telling us. They are \nsaying this is a policy that is unwise. That is what former Secretary \nof the Treasury Bob Rubin, former head of the Federal Reserve Paul \nVolcker, and former Republican Senator Warren Rudman who served on the \nBudget Committee with great distinction are all warning us about. When \nyou run record budget deficits, you cannot add on top of that record \ntax cuts and increase spending and wind up with anything more than even \ndeeper deficits and deeper debt. That is especially unwise given the \nfact the baby boomers are about to retire.\n\n  The Washington Post said this morning in an editorial labeled ``Tax \nCut Trickery: Part II'':\n\n       The House Ways and Means committee plans to take up a tax \n     plan that makes President Bush's look like a model of budget \n     honesty, fiscal probity, and distributional fairness. The \n     plan concocted by Chairman Bill Thomas junks the president's \n     proposal to end taxes on dividends in favor of a proposal to \n     cut the top rate on both dividends and capital gains to 15 \n     percent. The Thomas plan is more straightforward than the \n     administration's complicated proposal but has not much else \n     to recommend it. First, it is tilted even more heavily to the \n     very wealthy. An analysis by the Urban Institute-Brookings \n     Tax Policy Center shows that households with annual incomes \n     of more than $1 million would see their taxes drop an average \n     of $42,800 under the Thomas capital gains-dividend cut, \n     compared with $26,800 under the Bush dividend plan. Taking \n     the two plans as a whole, those households would receive an \n     average tax cut in 2003 of $105,600 under the Thomas plan and \n     $89,500 under the Bush plan.\n\n  Let me repeat that. The Washington Post is reporting that under the \nThomas plan, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, taxes \non those earnings over $1 million a year would be cut by over $100,000 \nfor 2003 alone. Taxes under the President's plan for people earning \nover $1 million would be cut by almost $90,000. This is at a time when \nwe are in record budget deficits, at a time we are on the eve of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation that will double the number of \npeople eligible for Social Security and Medicare. This is going to \ndramatically increase the cost to the Federal Government. This is \ndisconnect from reality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business is closed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5747-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5747-S5753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 14, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 14) to enhance the energy security of the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \nsubject matter before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill S. 14 is the pending business.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, S. 14 is the comprehensive energy bill \nproduced by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It is \naccompanied by a report as contemplated by the rules of the Senate.\n  For those who are interested in the bill, there is a report and it \nwill be available tomorrow. The 1-day delay is because of printing \nproblems. Under the rule, there would be no amendments that can be \noffered today, in any event. It will be a day for discussion. Those who \nare looking toward the text in terms of what they might want to do to \nthe bill and for the bill, the report will be in their hands before \namendments are allowed.\n  I will start with some opening remarks and then yield to my friend, \nSenator Bingaman, for remarks on his side, and any other Senators on \neither side who desire to comment.\n  I might ask again a parliamentary inquiry: How much time has been set \naside for this bill today pursuant to previous order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, our citizens need to know that they can, \nwith some reasonable level of assurance, budget what their annual \nheating and cooling costs will be. This is not an area in which we can \nhave much tolerance for those who propound politically correct \npolicies.\n  Let me be blunt. I am a strong supporter of solar and renewable \nenergy, and as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy \nand Water Development, which appropriates the money for the research \nand development in those areas, I have supported millions, indeed \nbillions, of dollars for research to develop less expensive solar and \nrenewable energy technologies. However, they only represent a niche \nmarket, and they are not capable of providing a baseload power to our \ncities, our hospitals, and our factories.\n  The bill before the Senate today is comprehensive. It encourages the \nconservation of energy through efficiency programs. But it also takes \nsteps to ensure reliable and cleaner production of electricity from \ncoal, and provides adequate--in fact extremely significant--research \nand development programs to make coal burning cleaner; it ensures \nnuclear power and gas, and decreases our reliance on imported energy \nsources by increasing production of energy here at home.\n\n  The bill, in my opinion, is pragmatic. I am a strong supporter of \nopening ANWR. I believe oil and gas can be produced from ANWR with a \nminimal impact on the environment and a substantial positive impact on \nthe U.S. energy security and ultimately on prices since it would cause \na very substantial amount of new oil to be put into the\n\n[[Page S5748]]\n\npool from which the world purchases its oil.\n  Those who say we should do without ANWR production, in my humble \nopinion, are cavalier about our energy needs. ANWR holds estimated \nreserves equal to three times as much oil as in the entire State of \nTexas, and I know of no one who proposes we close all the production in \nTexas on behalf of the environment, nor do I know anyone who thinks the \nproduction of oil in Texas is insignificant to the energy needs of \nAmerica.\n  The impact on our economy is too easy to predict, but somehow they \nget away with arguing against ANWR--and they have in this body to date. \nHowever, I have not included ANWR in this bill, even though I \nunderstand there were votes to do so on the Energy Committee the \ncommittee I chair, because I know the 60 votes are not here on the \nfloor to break a filibuster. I think that is a shame. But I also am not \nabout to sacrifice a broader energy policy over that single, though \nimportant, issue.\n  In this committee, we have deferred to the floor in debate over \nclimate change. I know the debate is coming. I saw no reason for \nconsuming the time of the committee on a matter sure to be considered \non the floor and a matter which is technically not within the \njurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources which \nproduced this bill.\n  Recognizing that we agreed to defer some controversial issues to the \nfloor, it is important that the Senate recognize the bill before it is \nthe product of several years of work by the Energy Committee. It is \nvery much, in that context, a bipartisan measure.\n  Earlier this year, I instructed the staff of the committee to \ncirculate a staff draft of legislation that would incorporate the \nprovisions and ideas that had been considered by the Senate and the \nconference held last year on H.R. 4. We then worked with our minority \nand all members of the committee to refine that text. Members on both \nsides of the aisle had constructive comments and recommendations. While \nwe could not always agree, I do not think there is any Member of the \nbody who can say that I and the committee staff were not open to \nsuggestions or willing to work to clear potential amendments that might \nhave been appropriate for this committee.\n  The end result of the process I have just described was a series of \nchairman's marks on the various titles of the legislation before us. \nWhile the media only comments on the matters where we could not reach \nagreement, I think it is accurate to say that every member of the \ncommittee had provisions that are very important to them included in \nthe chairman's mark and cleared on a bipartisan basis. An enormous \namount of work and careful perfecting of language was done on a \nbipartisan basis before the chairman's mark was circulated.\n  I also think my colleagues will agree that we followed an open \nprocess. While we moved things along at a rapid pace, I insisted that \nthe chairman's mark of each title be circulated at least 48 hours in \nadvance. That was followed, to the best of my knowledge, uniformly.\n\n  The most contentious issue clearly was electricity, and in that case \nI circulated a chairman's mark a full week in advance. Achieving a \nconsensus on that title proved more than elusive. In the end, \nRepublican members of the committee reached an agreement on an \nelectricity title that is included in the legislation before the \nSenate. I sincerely hope this important legislation does not become \nwrapped up in partisan delaying tactics.\n  I know there has been speculation in the media that some want to deny \nPresident Bush his energy bill. This is not President Bush's energy \nbill. This is not Pete Domenici's energy bill. At the moment, what you \nhave before you is a recommendation of your Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, and I am proud to bring it before you. Yes, many of \nthe provisions and suggestions come from the President's task force, \nwhich took many days and many weeks to put together their \nrecommendations. Yes, many of the suggestions come from past energy \nbills put together by this committee when it was controlled by the \nother side of the aisle.\n  This bill contains numerous provisions that had bipartisan support. \nMany were initiatives offered by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle that I was happy to support. Senator Akaka, for example, made \nmajor contributions to the hydrogen title, as did Senator Dorgan and \nothers. While the President has provided important support for the \nhydrogen section, for which I congratulate him, I want to make it clear \nthat the Senate has before it a comprehensive hydrogen title crafted \nover many weeks on a bipartisan basis by your committee.\n  The same can be said for all of the titles. Not one title is the same \nas the original staff discussion draft. In every case, I included \namendments in the chairman's mark that were suggested by my colleagues, \nboth Democrat and Republican. The extent of that bipartisan consensus \nwas not evident in our business meetings where attention obviously was \non provisions where we could not come together. But, in fact, this \nlegislation is bipartisan in its substance. I expect to fully support \nother amendments here in the Chamber that will have bipartisan support, \nsuch as a carbon sequestration provision that Senators Wyden and Craig \nhave been working on for a long time.\n  Let me summarize the 12 titles of this bill.\n  The oil and gas title: This permanently reauthorizes the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve and provides production incentives for marginal wells \nso that those sources will continue to be produced. It provides royalty \nrelief for production in extremely deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico \nand for natural gas production in those areas of the gulf that are \nbeyond 15,000 feet deep.\n  It creates a pilot program in five regional Bureau of Land Management \noffices to coordinate all the Federal permitting necessary to produce \noil or gas on Federal lands.\n  It authorizes the construction of the Alaskan natural gas pipeline. \nThis will bring gas to the United States in large quantities--not next \nweek or next month, but without this provision it may never come to \nthis part of the United States from Alaska. With the provisions in this \nbill, which essentially are indemnification provisions for those who \nwill construct this pipeline, which is extremely fragile--fragile both \nin construction nature and fragile as to financing, we have provided \nunderpinning for it to become a reality.\n\n  The coal title is a major part of this bill because coal is a major \nresource of the United States as we look to our future with reference \nto energy. The coal title authorizes approximately $2 billion for clean \ncoal technology. The program is a major one. It is not the result of \nany one Senator's thinking. A number of Senators on the committee and a \nnumber of Senators not on the committee with general interest in the \nsubject of coal and coal development are interested in this section. My \nthanks go out to all of them.\n  There isn't any separate section on Indian energy. The Indian people \nof the United States are the proprietors of large amounts of property. \nOn this property and in this property lie various assets and resources. \nThis section authorizes the Indian tribes of this country to enter into \nagreements with the Secretary of the Interior to develop their energy \nresources. Once agreements between the Indian people and the Secretary \nof the Interior are entered into, the tribe can then enter into leases \nor production on their tribal lands with the same rights as if they \nwere private landowners. This last section of the Indian lands title \nwill be the subject matter of significant debate, and I welcome and \nlook forward to that debate.\n  In the end, however, the purpose of this bill will be to say to our \nIndian people, if you want to develop resources in the field of energy \nthat lie within your lands, we are giving you the authority to do so \nand hopefully in a streamlined manner so that it will not be forever \nbogged down in the redtape and bureaucracy of Indian lands being \nsubject to the Federal Government's fiduciary relationships.\n  There is a title on nuclear energy. We call it the nuclear energy \ntitle. This permanently reauthorizes the Price-Anderson law of the \nland. Price-Anderson has taken on a name and a meaning all of its own. \nIt stands for the proposition that a law adopted by Representative \nPrice and Senator Anderson which makes it possible for nuclear power to \nexist will remain the law of the land indefinitely.\n\n[[Page S5749]]\n\n  Second, we authorize funds for an advanced fuel cycle initiative to \ndevelop ways to reduce the volume and the toxicity of spent nuclear \nfuel. It authorizes the Secretary of Energy, subject to appropriations, \nto enter into loan guarantees to assist in the construction of 8,400 \nmegawatts of new nuclear power if the Secretary determines that the \nplants are necessary for energy diversity, security, or clean air \nattainment.\n  Last, it directs that an advanced reactor will be built in Idaho to \ndemonstrate new safety, efficiency, and proliferation resistance to \nproduce hydrogen and prove to the world that a new generation of \nnuclear powerplants substantially different--if not completely \ndifferent--from the plants we have today can be built.\n  This entire nuclear section is of great concern for some. For others, \nit is an exciting challenge for a new future for the United States and \nthe world, and indeed for more energy for more people with less air \npollution.\n  The next title is called renewable energy. This mandates that the \nFederal Government purchase 7 \\1/5\\ percent of its energy requirements \nfrom renewable resources by 2011, thus saying that the U.S. Government \nhas a weighted portion--that 7 \\1/5\\ percent of the energy that it \nneeds will be from renewable resource acquisition. It will become the \nmarket, so to speak, the driving force for the purchase of renewable \nenergy.\n  Under renewable energy, a second provision will authorize renewable \nenergy production incentives. These will be discussed in more detail, \nand obviously from this Senator's standpoint they are exciting and \nnecessary. Perhaps for others, they are insufficient and unnecessary. \nWe will see which view prevails.\n  We streamline the licensing of hydroelectric facilities. This issue \nis long overdue. Hydroelectric facilities clearly must be relicensed. \nIt is contended that currently the process is far too difficult, \ncumbersome, onerous, and in many respects unnecessary. We have \nstreamlined it. That will be debated, and one way or another we will \nstreamline the processes for hydroelectric facility licensing.\n  We encourage the exploration and development of geothermal resources, \nand we provide grants for turning forest materials from the areas of \nhigh-risk fire or disease into biomass energy--something that is long \noverdue and something that may, indeed, accomplish at least two goals \nat one time. It may, indeed, produce energy which will be clean, and at \nthe same time it may clean up our forests, which many of us from the \nWest have been anxiously wondering and waiting patiently to see happen.\n  In addition, there is an energy efficiency title in this bill. It \nrequires a 20-percent improvement in the Federal Government's \nefficiency over the next 10 years. It authorizes grants for energy \nefficiency projects in low-income and rural areas. It sets several new \nstandards for items such as transformers, compact fluorescent lamps, \nceiling fans, and commercial refrigerators and freezers.\n  The transportation title is another section of this bill which stands \nout. It encourages the use of alternative fuel vehicles, and it \nrequires Federal agencies to increase the fuel efficiency of their \nfleets by 3 miles per gallon by 2005. It improves the efficiency of \nlocomotives and expands the authority of the National Highway \nTransportation Safety Administration to set fuel economy standards for \ncars and light trucks, taking into account passenger safety and the \nimpact on U.S. employment.\n  Incidentally, that provision is similar to a provision adopted in the \nSenate last year by a bipartisan vote of two Senators who said that is \nthe way they want it, to direct further modification of CAFE standards \nfor the United States.\n\n  We then have a new and exciting title, driven, to some extent, by a \nrather late pronouncement of our President regarding hydrogen and the \nAmerican automobile engine. This hydrogen title authorizes $1.8 billion \nfor the President's hydrogen fuel cell initiative to develop clean, \nrenewable hydrogen cars.\n  It reauthorizes and increases funding for existing hydrogen research \nprograms. It amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to require agencies \nto purchase 5 percent of new vehicles as hydrogen-powered vehicles in \n2005 and 2007, increasing to 20 percent in subsequent years.\n  The research and development title addresses research and development \nneeds to energy efficiency, distributed energy and electric energy \nsystems, renewable energy, nuclear energy, fossil energy, science and \nenergy and environment and management.\n  There is funding for research in many areas, such as nanotechnology, \nhigh-temperature superconductivity, and Genomes to Life.\n  A new Under Secretary position for energy and science is provided. \nTwo new Assistant Secretary positions--one for science and one for \nnuclear energy--are provided.\n  The personnel and training title contains a number of programs to \nensure that we have an adequate energy workforce in the decades to \ncome.\n  Then we have, last but not least, a very difficult title, the \nelectricity title. This title remands proposed rulemaking on Standard \nMarketing Design, SMD, and prohibits FERC from issuing a final order \nuntil July 1, 2005.\n  Second, it provides a sense of the Congress that membership in \nregional transmission organizations is voluntary. It amends the Federal \nPower Act to protect access to transmission lines, repeals PURPA's \nmandatory purchase requirement, repeals the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act, makes the electricity market more transparent and \nresistant to manipulation, and increases the penalty for violations of \nthe Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act.\n  Mr. President, I understand there is an agreement that no amendments \nwill be offered until Thursday. On Thursday, I expect an ethanol \namendment to be offered, and I understand there are discussions \nunderway as to who will offer that amendment and when.\n  For my part, I support the agreement reached last year on ethanol \nthat was reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee \nlast month. The reason I raise this subject is, this is another \nprovision that is really not within the jurisdiction of this committee, \nas are three or four others that will become contentious and will be \nvery deliberate and take much time. But there is no question, we cannot \nleave the floor without the subject matter of ethanol being considered, \ndebated, and voted upon. That is why I have just stated what I believe \nthe protocol will be.\n  Again, for my part, I do not do this in an effort to usurp the \njurisdiction of the Public Works Committee but to face up to the \nreality and to urge that they consider this and offer to work with them \nin an effort to get what they have passed incorporated in this bill or \nat least put before the Senate as their effort with an opportunity for \nit to be passed and then, if necessary, amended.\n  I know there are some who oppose that proposal, and there will be \namendments offered. Clearly, if history is revealing, there will be \nsuch occurring once that amendment is before the Senate.\n  I look forward to the debate and encourage my colleagues who support \nthe ethanol proposal to offer their amendments as early as possible on \nThursday.\n  My staff and Senator Bingaman's staff is on the floor and available, \nas I gather, now to begin the process of reviewing and clearing \namendments where possible. I hope Members will take advantage of that \nand bring their amendments to the floor as soon as possible.\n  The leader has indicated he will give us sufficient time, with some \nintervening work obviously, to complete this bill as soon as the Senate \ndeems practicable.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague, Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his statement \nand for yielding the floor.\n  Mr. President, today we are beginning a second attempt on the Senate \nfloor--in the last Congress and this Congress--to craft a comprehensive \nnational energy policy. Last year, as colleagues will remember, we \npassed an energy bill with an 81-to-11 vote. It was bipartisan. It was, \nin my view, a balanced approach to energy supply, energy efficiency, \nand many other important issues centrally related to energy, such as \nclimate change.\n\n[[Page S5750]]\n\n  This year, I first begin by congratulating Senator Domenici on the \nprocess he has followed and his success in getting an energy bill to \nthe floor. We have had disagreements, and continue to have \ndisagreements, on particular issues dealt with in the bill, but I \nappreciate very much the courtesy he has afforded to me and to my staff \nin the process he has followed in developing the bill.\n  In spite of the process that has been followed, I fear we are \nbeginning with a bill that does not, at this point at least, command \nthe same broad level of support perhaps that we were able to finally \narrive at last year.\n  I voted against the bill as it came out of committee because I did \nnot think it was a sufficiently balanced and comprehensive package. I \nhope by the time we are finished with floor consideration of the bill, \nthe reservations that I and nearly every other Democratic member of the \ncommittee had can be addressed and that we can support the final \nproduct.\n  There can be no doubt that America needs a comprehensive and balanced \nenergy policy for the 21st century. President Bush, when he ran for \noffice in 2000, spoke of the need for such a comprehensive energy \npolicy. Within 3 weeks of taking office in 2001, he had commissioned \nVice President Cheney to lead a task force to develop and improve \nnational energy policy.\n  The President was right in stating the need for such a policy. During \nthe 1990s, energy prices had remained relatively stable due to at least \nthree factors.\n  First, there was increased productivity which we benefited from \nsubstantially in the 1990s. Second, there was lower energy use per \ndollar of gross domestic product. Third, there was the introduction of \nmarket competition in sectors such as electricity.\n\n  All of these factors acted to hold down prices in spite of the very \nrobust economic growth and increased demand for energy we saw in the \n1990s.\n  Before the introduction of competition into energy markets in the \n1980s and 1990s, we had national policies that required large excess \ncapacity margins. Consumers paid a great deal for this excess capacity, \nbut they also benefited from the buffer that capacity provided. It kept \nthe system functioning as markets restructured. As the economic growth \nof the past decade has used up that excess capacity in the fuels and \nthe power and the natural gas sectors, the frictions and imperfections \nin those markets became more apparent.\n  One obvious illustration of that development was the California \nelectricity crisis. When electricity was in plentiful supply in the \nWest, the flaws in the design of the California electricity system--\nspecifically the discouragement of long-term contracts and the near \ntotal reliance on the spot market to set electricity prices--were not \nso apparent. But when electricity suddenly became more scarce in 2000, \ndue to unusually dry weather and increased demand in other Western \nStates, those market flaws came to the fore. The result was very high \nprices for electricity and extraordinary financial stress on both \nCalifornia's regulated utilities and their consumers.\n  These market flaws were exacerbated by the unscrupulous behavior of a \nnumber of energy marketers and the inadequate initial responses by \nregulators. Even so, we should not lose sight of the overall lesson to \nbe derived from that California electricity crisis. That is, the loss \nof our energy infrastructure cushion means future events will more \neasily highlight whatever energy market or regulatory flaws do exist. \nThat makes it more important than ever for us to have a comprehensive \nnational energy policy that proactively deals with market flaws before \nthey result in a crisis.\n  In the energy policy plan issued by President Bush in May of 2001, \nhis administration laid out a series of goals and objectives that \ngenerally made sense in terms of a proactive energy policy. Some of the \nthemes he had were very similar to conclusions reached by a number of \nindividual States that have formulated and adopted their own energy \npolicies over the past several years. The President's proposal, though, \ncame to Congress in a very generic fashion, without any legislative \nspecifics. At no time during the last Congress or during this Congress \nso far have we ever received an actual legislative proposal on energy \nfrom the administration.\n  The task of taking the President's general statements and fashioning \nthem into specifics has fallen to both the House of Representatives and \nthe Senate. Of course, the two bodies of the Congress have interpreted \nthose general principles in some very different ways. That proved to be \na decisive factor in our inability to come to closure on energy \nlegislation last Congress.\n  The approach I pursued in crafting an energy bill in the last \nCongress, and which was supported in the end by a substantial majority \nof Senators, was based on a number of basic principles. I believe these \nbasic principles are crucial to any energy legislation we might \nconsider, and the bill now before us deals with those principles only \nin part. Let me elaborate what those are.\n  First, and perhaps most important, we need an energy policy and an \nenergy bill that strike a balance between measures to increase energy \nsupplies and measures to encourage additional energy efficiency. To say \nwe only need to increase energy production or we only need to increase \nconservation is to propose a fairly false choice. The reality is the \ncountry needs both kinds of measures.\n  On the supply side, perhaps one of the most important national goals \nis to meet our ever-growing demand for natural gas. Natural gas is the \nfuel of choice for most electric generation that is now being planned. \nIt will play an important role in any new distributed generation that \nis planned in the future. It is favored by alternative fueled vehicle \nprograms in both the Government and in the private sector. It is the \nmost likely feedstock to produce hydrogen when and if we come to use \nhydrogen as a major fuel source. And apart from its energy uses, \nnatural gas is also a critical feedstock in the petrochemical industry \nand in the fertilizer industry.\n  Because natural gas consumption is outstripping the amounts produced \nin the lower 48 States, we are in the early stages, as a Nation, of \ndeveloping a national dependence on imported natural gas, particularly \nliquefied natural gas from countries with unstable politics. So just as \nwe have for several decades now become more and more dependent upon \nimported oil to meet our energy needs, we now face the prospect of \nperhaps a growing dependence on imported natural gas as well.\n  At the same time this dependence on imported natural gas is growing, \nwe have at least 33 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that is stranded \non the North Slope of Alaska at Prudhoe Bay. That gas has been \nproduced, along with the oil we are now producing from that location. \nBut the gas is currently being pumped back into the ground because \nthere is no way to transport it to the lower 48 States where it is \nneeded. We need to provide effective incentives to the private sector \nto build a pipeline that can bring this gas to the lower 48 States. \nSuch a project would be a boon not only to our national energy security \nbut also to our domestic steel and construction industries.\n  On this topic, the bill now before us does a fairly good job. It has \nretained from last year's bill many of the regulatory streamlining \nmeasures on which I worked with Senator Frank Murkowski and that were \nincluded in last year's bill. There is a critical part of the problem \nwe have not yet solved. That is to provide effective fiscal incentives \nfor the pipeline to accompany what is now in the bill on the regulatory \nside. I hope we can add those effective fiscal incentives as we \nconsider this bill in the Senate.\n  Along with providing more robust domestic supplies of natural gas, we \nobviously need to look for ways to diversify our energy generation away \nfrom such a strong reliance on gas in the coming years. Here I fear we \nhave been less successful in the bill.\n  One important arena in which we can diversify our energy generation \naway from overreliance on gas is in electricity generation. Part of \nwhat must be done is to find new technology for existing sources of \nelectricity supply. This means research and development on ultra clean \nways to burn coal and research and development on new generation from \nsafe nuclear powerplants. This bill, similar to last year's bill, does \nhave very strong R programs on both topics, and Chairman Domenici \ndeserves credit for those provisions.\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n\n  Another key piece of the solution would be to tap into opportunities \nfor distributed generation such as combined heat and power at \nindustrial facilities. Here the bill begins to fall short, as it does \nnot really address the barriers that have been erected to uniform \ninterconnection of distributed generation to the grid.\n  It is not enough to have the technology. We need to rid ourselves of \nthe redtape that is keeping this technology from being used, and this \nbill does not do that.\n  Along with these steps, though, we need to make a greater push to \nintroduce renewable energy technologies for electricity generation. \nSome of these technologies--wind power in particular--are already cost \ncompetitive. But in order to see widespread exploitation of these \nopportunities, both financial and regulatory incentives will be needed. \nThat means both a meaningful production tax credit for renewable \nenergy, which I hope will be added as part of the package of tax \nprovisions coming out of the Finance Committee, and also a flexible \nrenewable portfolio standard for electric utilities. Both measures are \nessential, in my view, in order to give enough certainty to the \nfledgling market to allow economies of scale to drive down costs and \nimprove the manufacturing capacity for renewable energy equipment in \nthe United States.\n  The lack of an effective renewable portfolio as this bill comes to \nthe floor is a major flaw. There are those who may argue that we should \nleave everything to the hypothetical free market. My problem with that \nis that electricity markets are not free markets, and renewable energy \nwill not get a fair shake unless there is some pressure from us for \nthat to happen. If the Senate does nothing in this bill to push forward \non increasing the use of renewables in our electric system, then we \nwill be making a choice in favor of the existing trends toward an \noverreliance on natural gas for future electricity generation. That \nchoice will leave our citizens with future natural gas and electricity \nbills that are more volatile, resulting in more frequent price spikes.\n  Renewable energy technologies can help with another energy supply \nissue that we face, and that relates to transportation fuels. We \nalready use renewable fuels, such as ethanol, to some extent as \noxygenates in the winter formula for gasoline. But ethanol can make a \ngreater contribution than this. A phased introduction of up to 5 \nbillion gallons per year into our gasoline supply by 2012 is not, in my \nview, unreasonable. What we need to do, though, as we attempt such a \ntransition, is to ensure that we do not wind up with a highly \nbalkanized and inflexible system of fuel specifications around the \ncountry.\n  We already have a problem with so-called boutique fuel specifications \nin several parts of the country. These mandates for boutique fuels \ncause local price spikes to consumers when the specific formula for a \nspecific area suddenly is in short supply. That can easily happen, for \nexample, due to unexpected demand or shutdown problems at a refinery or \nat a pipeline.\n  Our national energy policy should be to use the transition to greater \nuse of renewable fuels as a means of making sure we have a more \nrational national fuels system. This issue was not dealt with during \nthe consideration of the bill in the Energy Committee and, as the \nchairman has indicated, we expect to be dealing with that on the floor \nperhaps as early as this week.\n  Even with the greater use of renewable fuels in cars, we will still \nbe very dependent upon oil in the transportation sector. It is in our \nnational interest to support the domestic production of oil. Many of \nour oil resources are not as economical to produce as those in the \nMiddle East and elsewhere. This is largely because the U.S. has been \nproducing oil longer than other places around the world. We have \nexhausted the easiest geologic formations.\n  When oil prices fall, our domestic producers lose their shirts faster \nthan do their overseas competitors. Accordingly, our producers, in many \ncases, are forced to stop production. When prices start back up, \nthough, their wells are not able to be restarted as easily as foreign \nwells.\n\n  An important policy to put in place, at both the Federal and State \nlevels, would be to reduce taxes on oil production during times of low \nworld prices, and restore those taxes when prices rebound. That sort of \na countercyclical measure would help us to retain a significant amount \nof our domestic production that otherwise would be at risk.\n  In the Finance Committee, such incentives are part of the bipartisan \npackage of tax provisions that we adopted which I expect will be added \nto this bill later in the Senate's consideration of the overall bill.\n  We also need to look to increase oil production in areas where it is \ngenerally agreed to move ahead. There are places, such as the Alaska \nNational Wildlife Refuge, that are seen as having special environmental \nvalues that make oil production very controversial. Last year and this \nyear, a solid bipartisan majority voted against opening the Arctic \nRefuge to oil development. I hope we do not spend a great deal of time \non the Senate floor debating and reopening this issue. We spent a \ntremendous amount of time on it in the bill last year.\n  The proposal to open the Arctic Refuge is a dead end precisely \nbecause there are many areas with significant amounts of oil and gas \nthat are not considered environmentally exceptional. We need to look to \nthose areas.\n  For example, Alaska is also home to a Federal Reserve called the \nNational Petroleum Reserve Alaska, NPRA. No less an environmentalist \nthan Bruce Babbitt, a former Secretary of the Interior, strongly pushed \nfor leasing of the NPRA for oil production when he was the Secretary of \nthe Interior. He found strong industry interest, and there have been \nsignificant finds in that region. We should continue to support further \nleasing of NPRA as part of our national energy policy.\n  As another example, energy resources on Indian land in the U.S. have \nnot been as extensively developed as they might be. According to the \nBureau of Indian Affairs, over 90 Indian reservations have significant \nuntapped energy resource potential. That includes oil and gas, coal, \ncoalbed methane, wind, and geothermal resources. In last year's energy \nbill, I worked to see that we assisted these tribes in developing those \nresources.\n  Early this year I reintroduced many of those same provisions in a new \nbill, parts of which are incorporated into the bill that is now on the \nSenate floor. Unfortunately, in my view, the provisions have been \nmarred by a proposal to make energy leasing on Indian lands both exempt \nfrom environmental analysis under NEPA, and exempt from the normal \ntrust protections afforded Indian tribes. I fear this is a substantial \nflaw that needs to be addressed if the bill is to keep its balance \namong energy, environment, and the public interest.\n  Even with strong efforts to support domestic oil production, we are \nin a losing race with rising domestic oil consumption. We have gone \nfrom less than 25-percent dependence upon foreign oil at the time of \nthe Arab oil embargo to over 50 percent today, with projections of well \nover 60-percent dependence a decade from now.\n  That brings us to the other important part of a national energy \npolicy, and that is energy efficiency. If we are serious about reducing \nour dependence upon foreign oil, we have to address our ever-increasing \nnational consumption of oil in the transportation sector. Greater \nvehicle fuel efficiency is clearly in the national interest.\n  According to a study Congress commissioned from the National Academy \nof Sciences, we now have the technology to realize significant gains in \nfuel efficiency without sacrificing either safety or passenger comfort. \nAll we lack is the national will to make this a priority. That will was \nnot on display in the last Congress when the Senate and House took only \nminimal steps to set higher standards for fuel efficiency. Similarly, \nit has not been on display in the bill that has now come before us. In \nfact, this bill contains a provision that will increase gasoline demand \nover current law by 11 billion gallons by 2020. I don't know how we can \njustify passing a bill that takes us in the wrong direction relative to \nwhat our national energy security requires.\n  Greater fuel efficiency is an answer to another energy problem that \nis\n\n[[Page S5752]]\n\nbrewing. We are pretty close to the capacity limits of our present \nsystem of refineries and gasoline pipelines.\n  Refineries and pipelines are notoriously hard to site. We have not \nbuilt a new petroleum refinery in this country in decades, and there \nare real limits to how much further we can add to the existing \nrefineries. Unless we want to greatly add to the siting pressures we \nalready have related to energy infrastructure, or unless we want to \nstart importing much more refined gasoline than we now import, we need \nto push for more efficient use of the gasoline we already consume.\n  Energy efficiency is also a key element in maintaining a reliable and \naffordable system of electricity generation and transmission. New \nelectricity infrastructure is also very difficult to site. President \nBush's call for Federal eminent domain authority for new electricity \ntransmission has not found many supporters in Congress.\n  We can reduce the pressure on our electric power grid and natural gas \ninfrastructure by taking commonsense steps to improve the efficiency of \nend use of energy in buildings and appliances, and industry. Energy-\nefficient lighting, energy-efficient appliances, and energy-efficient \nbuildings also generate benefits in terms of emission reductions and \nhuman health improvements, making them even more attractive as part of \na comprehensive energy policy.\n  One of the unheralded success stories of last year's energy bill was \na set of new standards and programs for energy efficiency that was \ndeveloped cooperatively with the affected industries. These provisions \nsurvived intact. They have been expanded somewhat in this bill, and \nthey have been reported as part of the bill now before us.\n  Last year's energy bill also reauthorized important Federal grant \nprograms that helped low-income families pay their energy bills and \nreduce their energy costs, including LIHEAP, the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, and State weatherization grants. Those programs \ncontinue to be a high priority in any new energy legislation. I hope we \ncan add an effective measure along these lines early in our \ndeliberations on this bill.\n  Our national commitment to increasing energy supply and increasing \nenergy efficiency must involve a long-term commitment to the \ndevelopment of new energy technologies. Last year's energy bill \nestablished a framework for a comprehensive research and development \nprogram that would have addressed a variety of challenges on both the \nsupply and demand sides of the energy equation. A robust commitment to \na coordinated, comprehensive research and development program is \nessential if we are to meet the challenges that lie before us.\n  One of the biggest disappointments of the Bush administration to date \nis its lack of attention to the importance of science and technology in \ngeneral and of energy research and development in particular. With the \nexception of the President's recent enthusiasm for hydrogen and fuel \ncells, an enthusiasm on which I certainly compliment him, the Bush \nadministration has consistently proposed underfunding Department of \nEnergy energy technology programs relative to their importance to our \nnational security.\n  Federal energy technology R today is equivalent, in constant \ndollars, to what it was in 1966. Yet our economy is three times larger \ntoday than it was in 1966. It is hard to see how we can build a 21st \ncentury energy system on 1960s level-of-effort research and development \nbudgets.\n  Fortunately, Congress has seen things somewhat differently than the \nadministration. Last year and this year, energy bills in both the House \nand the Senate have attempted to rebuild energy R budgets in a \nrational way to levels that, by 2007 or 2008, would give us a robust \nenergy R effort to support our national energy policy.\n\n  A final imperative for national energy policy and legislation has \nbeen to recognize the ways in which energy use and energy policy are \nintertwined with the topic of climate change.\n  Climate change is so closely related to energy policy because the two \nmost prominent greenhouse gases--that is, carbon dioxide and methane--\nare largely released due to energy production and use. In the United \nStates, 98 percent of the CO2 emissions are energy related. Every study \nof how to mitigate the possibility of global change, climate change \ncomes up with a list of policy measures that relies heavily on \nincreased energy efficiency and new energy production technologies with \nlower greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Because of this intimate connection between energy and climate \nchange, much of energy policy and much of climate change policy have to \nbe discussed together. To do one, by implication, is to do the other; \nto ignore one while doing the other is to risk unfortunate and \nunintended consequences.\n  For this reason, last year the Senate was able to pass a bill with \nnumerous provisions to ensure we integrate climate change strategy with \nenergy policy, that we develop better climate change science, that we \nfocus on breakthrough technologies with better environmental \nperformance, and that the United States take the lead in exporting the \nclean energy technologies we develop.\n  These provisions were not propounded by fringe elements in the \nSenate. The bulk of them came from a bill that was introduced by \nSenator Byrd of West Virginia and Senator Stevens of Alaska. That bill \nwas reported unanimously by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. \nUnfortunately, these provisions were resisted by the administration and \nwere opposed by the Republican leadership in the House, which did not \npropose to address climate change in any way in the House energy bill. \nThese provisions were also opposed in the Energy Committee by certain \nof the Senators. I regret that their views carried the day and that we \nwere not able to move ahead at that time. But the opportunity still is \nahead of us. I think leaving climate change out of an energy bill by \nthe time we complete action on an energy bill would be a very \nshortsighted approach, both in terms of energy policy and in terms of \nour overall relations with others in the world.\n  Climate change proposals that I plan to propose and advance on the \nSenate floor will focus on programs which will protect the environment \nwhile being highly beneficial to U.S. industry. We need to make sure \nthat our energy choices do not lead to inefficient or wasted energy \ninvestments that have to be written off prematurely because we did not \nconsider their climate consequences. Industry needs to have certainty \nabout rules of the road linking energy and climate.\n  In terms of our long-term economic prosperity, there are jobs to be \ncreated, worldwide markets to be captured in climate-friendly energy \ntechnologies of the future. So far, the energy bill we are considering \ndoes not measure up in this regard. I believe many in this body will \nshare my view that addressing global warming is a major element \nrequired for any balanced energy policy.\n  Before I close, let me discuss what the chairman referred to as the \nmost difficult and contentious issue we tried to deal with and have \ndealt with as we have worked on this bill; that is, the problem of how \nto regulate electricity markets in the future.\n  Our system for generating and transmitting electricity has been \nundergoing a profound transformation over the last decade as \nelectricity markets become increasingly regional. That increases the \ndegree to which consumers are affected by interstate commerce in \nelectricity and, thereby, by factors that may be beyond the effective \nreach of State regulatory utility commissions.\n  During the California electricity crisis, we saw how decisions made \nin or for California affected consumers across the entire West. Well-\nfunctioning and well-regulated markets are in everyone's interests, \nalthough the way to get there was a matter of intense debate during \nconsideration of the energy bill and is being strongly debated now in \nthe context of FERC's so-called standard market design rulemaking, or \nSMD.\n  During last year's energy bill, I favored attempts to update the \nstatutes governing electricity markets, including the repeal of the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act, PUHCA. I did so only if those \nprovisions were accompanied by provisions to ensure that any resulting \nmergers or acquisitions would be overseen to be sure they were in the \npublic interest and that the ability of State public utility \ncommissions\n\n[[Page S5753]]\n\nto protect consumers against cross-subsidization and other abuses would \nbe ensured.\n  There were others in the debate who wanted to remove all fetters from \nthe merger and acquisition process, particularly any oversight that \nmight be exercised by FERC or State commissions. That latter view of \nuntrammeled mergers is what is now in the bill before us. I think that \nis a bad deal for consumers in the future, and I hope we can address \nthat as we consider the bill on the Senate floor.\n  The bill also overreaches, in my view, in its response to the \nStandard Market Design rulemaking. There are a lot of important issues \nthat need to be examined carefully before that rulemaking moves \nforward, and like many of my colleagues in the Senate, I am carefully \nexamining the extent to which FERC is responding to the many comments \nand criticisms leveled at its proposed rule.\n  But amid the furor over SMD, I think it is important not to be \ndistracted from the big picture of whether consumers are going to be \nadequately protected in the electricity markets of the future. How the \ngrid is operated, how new transmission is paid for and by whom, how we \nwill ensure that there is a reasonable mix of short-term spot markets \nand long-term contracts; all these factors require careful \nconsideration and regulatory clarity, if consumers are to be protected \nand if utilities and other entities are to make sound decisions that \ncan be sustained over the long term.\n  It is unfortunate, in my view, that the electricity provision in the \nbill we considered and adopted in the committee had not been adequately \nreviewed by all Senators. I do not think that was a good way of \nproceeding on a topic as important, controversial, and complex as this \none. As a result, the electricity title contains numerous flaws that I \nthink will result in increased divisions in the Senate, instead of \npointing the way toward bringing us together.\n  Energy does not need to be a partisan issue. As was demonstrated by \nthe strong bipartisan vote we had on the Senate energy bill in the last \nCongress, it is clear that Democrats and Republicans can agree on the \nbroad aspects of an energy policy and move ahead.\n  I do not believe we have reached that point of bipartisan agreement \nyet in this bill. We will have an opportunity to do better now that the \nbill is on the floor. I look forward to the amendment process to see if \nsome of the flaws in this bill can be remedied. I hope that the result \nwill be a strong and balanced package for the Nation that I and other \nMembers of my caucus can support.\n  There will be many other opportunities for us to talk about \nparticular provisions of the bill as amendments are proposed, but for \nan opening statement I will stop with that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for \nhis remarks and do hope some of the matters he has raised wherein we \ndisagree can be worked out. As to others, we will remain in a state of \ndisagreement and hopefully the Senate will be the referee and we will \nsee where we end up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5753-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, during our spring recess, I had the \nopportunity to travel throughout my home State and visit with South \nDakotans.\n  These are proud days for South Dakota. Citizens are eager to welcome \nhome hundreds of their sons and daughters, husbands and wives, who \nserved so magnificently in Iraq.\n  South Dakota boasts one of the highest proportions of service men and \nwomen in the country. We are proud of the job South Dakotans are doing \nto bring freedom to Iraq and security and stability to the Persian \nGulf.\n  But these are anxious days for South Dakota, as well. Jobs are hard \nto come by. The State's budget is under pressure.\n  Meanwhile, the planting season has begun and farmers and the \ncommunities depending upon the land are hoping for some relief to the \n5-year drought that continues to cause devastation.\n  But amid all the concerns on the minds of South Dakota families, the \nmost common and deeply felt, is the financial strain of skyrocketing \nhealth care costs and the fear that they may one day lose their health \ncoverage altogether.\n  Day after day, people know that they are one layoff, one bad crop, \none accident, or one illness away from being totally unprotected.\n  I met with veterans who are picking up a greater share of their \nhealth care costs, because cuts to their health benefits are causing \nlonger waits and worse care.\n  I met with self-employed people, small business owners and farmers, \nwho buy their own insurance and as a result face premium costs as high \nas $20,000.\n  I met with the families of National Guard members who just a few \nweeks ago were afraid that their loved ones might get hurt in the line \nof duty in Iraq. Today, they are worried that their husbands or wives \nwill lose their health coverage when they return home.\n  This is not a new problem. Health care costs were soaring during our \nlast recession 10 years ago. But new financing structures and a good \neconomy helped bring costs under control. People were working, business \nwas booming, and employers were adding new and better benefits as they \ncompeted for the best workers.\n\n  Today, the economy continues to struggle, jobs are scarce, and \nprofits even scarcer. Businesses are trimming back benefits for their \nemployees and pensioners. And each month brings a fresh round of \nlayoffs, and with them, thousands more Americans without dependable \nhealth insurance.\n  We have about 75,000 South Dakotans who are uninsured today. Of the \nuninsured South Dakotans, 60 percent have been uninsured for 2 years. \nTwenty-seven percent have been uninsured for 10 years or more.\n  Some work for businesses that don't offer benefits. Some are self-\nemployed family farmers who can't afford health insurance premiums even \nthough they work in one of the most physically demanding and dangerous \njobs there is.\n  Health care is the most private of issues. But individuals' lack of \ncoverage has broad and several public consequences.\n  Because the uninsured are less likely to get preventative coverage, \nthey are more likely to fall victim to more serious and more costly \nillnesses down the road. Communities lose good neighbors and productive \nworkers. Sometime, the cost of care drives families into bankruptcy. \nAnd the cost of their coverage then gets passed on to the rest of us.\n  This crisis is driving millions of Americans into poverty and poor \nhealth. And ever-higher numbers of uninsured people are driving the \nhealth care costs of every American higher and higher. This is a \nvicious cycle, destined to put good health care out of reach of \neveryone but the wealthy, and we need to stop it.\n  I recently heard from Eugene and Karen Berg, who farm 500 acres of \ncorn and soybeans in Emery, SD.\n  Even though the Bergs pay more than $7,000 per year for health \ninsurance, that only buys them catastrophic coverage--nothing for \nordinary health expenses. They have a $10,000 deductible and they are \nresponsible for one-fifth of all costs above that. Their insurance \ndoesn't cover prescription drugs, and so the Bergs pay another $5,000 \nper year to cover the cost of medicine. They don't have dental \ninsurance, and they cannot afford to visit the dentist.\n  Eugene's doctor just told Eugene that an operation could fix his \nhearing. But because he cannot afford the cost and his insurance won't \nhelp him, he's resigned to living with only half his hearing.\n  The Bergs decided to look for better, less expensive health coverage. \nThey found a plan that looked promising, but when they applied, Eugene \nwas rejected because he has diabetes and high blood pressure.\n  The insurance company said it would accept his wife, but it wouldn't \nprovide any coverage for her thyroid problem. Insurance companies, they \nlearned, don't make money by covering the sick.\n  Eugene is trying to appeal the insurance company's decision, but he \nis not hopeful. One way or the other, Eugene is thinking about dropping \nhis current coverage because he can no longer afford the premiums.\n  I recently heard from another family, Roger and Carrie Fischer, who \nare musicians living in Custer, SD.\n  Their insurance company recently raised their premiums from $6,000 to \n$9,000 per year. They let their insurance lapse because they couldn't \nafford it.\n  They, too, tried to find a different plan, but because Carrie had her \nleg amputated, no company would even give them a quote.\n  Carrie's amputation requires a prosthesis to be fitted to her leg so \nshe can walk, but she was told that a new one would cost $30,000. So \nshe is making do with her old one as long as she can.\n  Roger recently wrote me a letter. He said:\n\n       If we were able, we'd surely like to be insured, but it's a \n     choice between having light and heat and being insured. . . . \n     Let's change things now. I cannot afford to wait any longer.\n\n  Millions of Americans face the same challenges. They work hard, they \ntake care of themselves, and they contribute to their communities. They \ntry to put money aside for bad times. But they can't control when \nillness strikes. Nor can they control the finances of the insurers, who \ntoo often pass on the cost of their own financial mistakes to their \ncustomers.\n  Last year, health insurance premiums increased by an average of 13 \npercent, three times faster than wages. The year before, premiums \nincreased by 11 percent.\n  Businesses trying to keep afloat during tough economic times are \nforcing their employees to shoulder more of the costs. But at this \npace, the costs will double every 7 years.\n  As the price of insurance increases, and as people lose their jobs in \nthe current economy, more and more families are thrown onto the rolls \nof the insured. Over the past two years, 75 million Americans, nearly \none in three,\n\n[[Page S5755]]\n\nspent at least some time without insurance. Forty-one million lacked \ncoverage for the entire year. Among them are 8.5 million children who \nare indeed being left behind.\n  We can do better.\n  This is a national problem and it demands national leadership to fix \nit. Medical research is producing miracles. And yet, Washington's \nneglect has allowed a crisis to emerge.\n  Doctors and nurses are dedicating their lives to the care of their \npatients. And yet Washington cannot seem to dedicate any of its \nattention or its resources to helping Americans who are suffering.\n  This is a critical moment in our Nation's history. As our attention \nturns back toward the troubles of our economy and the Americans who are \nstruggling to work and raise families, I intend to do everything I can \nto keep the Senate's attention focused on the crisis in health care.\n  Our citizens are asking for our leadership, and we have an obligation \nto answer their call.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Democratic leader leaves the \nfloor--if I could just engage in a colloquy with him--the leader is so \non point. We need to do something about health care. In my office today \nwas a 13-year-old girl from Reno, NV. Her best friend's mother has \nlupus. This little girl didn't know what to do. As you know, we are way \nbehind the ball on trying to determine what causes lupus and how to \ncure it. It is a very serious disease, and mostly a disease of women. \nThis little girl on her own painted little lady bugs and sold them for \n$2 each and made $2,000 for research into lupus. She got a national \naward.\n  With all that has been going on--Iraq and Afghanistan are terribly \nimportant issues--and as we focus on this tax cut, which is a very \nimportant issue, I hope this Congress can devote some time to the 44 or \n45 million Americans who have no health insurance and the millions of \nothers who are underinsured. The State of Nevada, I am not proud to \nsay, leads the Nation in uninsured. It has created tremendous problems \nfor the State of Nevada because those people who are uninsured drive up \nhealth care costs for everybody. Indigent care and hospital and doctor \nbills have increased. And, of course, insurance costs more for those \npeople who are fortunate to have it.\n  I hope the country has heard the message delivered by the Democratic \nleader--that we need to do something about health care.\n  This little girl is so desperate in helping her best friend's mother \nthat she painted lady bugs. Her heart is bigger than her body, I am \nsure. But we need to make sure the National Institutes of Health has \nall the money they need to do all they can.\n  In addition, people should have basic health insurance. All the \nresearch in the world is important, but it is not the answer for people \nto have the ability to go to the doctor when they need it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the assistant Democratic leader \nfor his excellent comments. He is absolutely right. Of all the \npriorities our country faces--as we look to the well-being of our \nyouth, and as we look to the extraordinary challenges we face to remain \ncompetitive--our country cannot remain competitive if our youth do not \nhave good health and access to health care in rural areas as well as in \nthe inner cities. We can't stay competitive with businesses that have \nto expand costs by double or triple every 2 or 3 years. We have a \nfinancial crisis in health care today. It is a crisis that is being \nfelt by thousands and thousands of people who were not affected the \nlast time we addressed this issue. They had health insurance. But we \ncan no longer afford to ignore it. We can no longer afford to postpone \nit. We can no longer afford to minimize the extraordinary impact this \nproblem is having on society and our economy today.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator's comments. I know he feels as \ndeeply as I do and as our caucus does about the importance of putting \nthis high on the priority list as we consider the legislative agenda \nfor the remainder of this Congress.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nTexas, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be \ndispensed with.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5755-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ALTONAGA, OF FLORIDA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n          DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination of \nCecilia M. Altonaga, of Florida, to be United States District Court \nJudge, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Cecilia M. \nAltonaga, of Florida, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes evenly divided for debate on the nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nCecilia Altonaga to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District \nof Florida. Judge Altonaga has enjoyed a stellar legal career on both \nsides of the bench.\n  Upon graduating from Yale Law School, Judge Altonaga clerked for the \nHonorable Edward B. Davis of the United States District Court for the \nSouthern District of Florida--the very court she will join upon her \nconfirmation.\n  Judge Altonage then spent 10 years as an assistance county attorney \nfor the Miami-Dade County Attorney's Office. During her tenure, she \nspecialized in construction litigation, reviewing and drafting \nconstruction contracts, and advising the Couty Commission in the \nawarding of government contracts, including bid disputes handled in \nadministrative quasi-judicial hearings. She also handled tort suits, \ndefending the County ordinances and actions taken by County \nCommissioners in State and Federal courts.\n  From 1996 to 1999, Judge Altonaga served as a County Court Judge of \nthe Eleventh Judicial Circuit of the State of Florida. While on the \nCounty Court, Judge Altonaga served in the Domestic Violence, Civil, \nand Criminal Divisions. Since 1999, she has served as a Judge for the \nCircuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of the State of Florida, \nwhere she has been assigned to the Court's Juvenile, Criminal, and \nAppellate Divisions.\n  Notably, Judge Altonaga will be the first Cuban-American woman to \nserve as a Federal judge. I have every confidence that she will serve \nwith distinction, and I am pleased to join with my colleagues from \nFlorida in supporting her nomination.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we will soon be voting on the nomination of \nJudge Cecilia Altonaga to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of Florida. I believe that Judge Altonaga will be the \nfirst Cuban-American woman to sit on the Federal bench.\n  Judge Altonaga comes to us with bipartisan support after being \nunanimously approved by Florida's bipartisan Judicial Advisory \nCommittee. I commend Senators Graham and Nelson for insisting that a \nbipartisan selection commission be implemented in Florida. This shows \nhow well it works.\n  We are moving down judicial vacancies. As we can see, starting in \n1994, judicial vacancies increased actually\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\nunder Republican control of the Senate. It went from 63 up to 110. When \nDemocrats took control and I became chairman, we cut that almost \nimmediately from 110 to 60, with nominees of President Bush, \nnotwithstanding all of President Clinton's nominees who had been \nblocked.\n  Circuit court nominees went from 16 vacancies under Republican Senate \nleadership up to 33. When I became chairman, we cut it immediately to \n25. I note that because we did move to cut those vacancies--even \nthough, in this case, it is Cuban-American women--there were many \nHispanics and women nominated by President Clinton who were blocked or \ndelayed by the Republican majority. We were told that unless every \nsingle Republican agreed, even if one disagreed, they would not get a \nhearing or a vote.\n  We had nominees such as Christine Arguello, Jorge Rangel, Enrique \nMoreno, and Ricardo Morado who were never given hearings, including \nJudge Richard Paez, Judge Sonia Sotomayor, and Judge Hilda Tagle who \nwere stalled for no good reason. Even though President Clinton's \nnominees had been blocked, we, the Democrats, when we took over, moved \nPresident Bush's nominees for the same spots.\n  I urge the White House to work with more Senators in forming \nselection commissions to ensure that we have nominees who are supported \nin their communities and come to the Senate with true, bipartisan \nsupport. Under this administration, we have seen the recommendations of \nsuch bipartisan panels rejected or stalled. Instead, the \nrecommendations of these important bipartisan commissions should be \nhonored and encouraged by expedited consideration before the committee \nand on the floor of the Senate.\n  Judge Altonaga is active in her community. She is a member of the \nFlorida International University Law School Advisory Board, and belongs \nto the Dade County Bar Association, the Cuban American Bar Association, \nand the Florida Association of Women Lawyers. She has served as a \nmember of the National Advisory Committee for Cultural Considerations \nin Domestic Violence Cases, the Select Task Force on Election \nProcedures, Standards and Technology, and the First Family Law American \nInns of Court.\n  During the 17 months I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \nworked hard to ensure that women and minorities were considered for the \nfederal bench, and I am proud of that record. Many Hispanics and women \nnominated by President Clinton were blocked or delayed by the \nRepublican majority, and I did not want to see that repeated. Fine \nnominees such as Christine Arguello, Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno and \nRicardo Morado were never given hearings. Others, including Judge \nRichard Paez, Judge Sonia Sotomayor, and Judge Hilda Tagle, were \nstalled for no good reason. I am proud that did not happen on my watch. \nI am glad to say that we quickly considered and confirmed nominees such \nas Christina Armijo to the District Court in New Mexico, Philip \nMartinez, to the District Court in Texas, Jose Martinez to the District \nCourt in Florida, Alia Ludlum to the District Court in Texas, and Jose \nLinares to the District Court in New Jersey.\n  Also during the 17 months I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nthree judicial nominees were confirmed to the District Courts of \nFlorida. Timothy J. Corrigan was confirmed to the Middle District of \nFlorida, and Jose E. Martinez and Kenneth A. Marra, were both confirmed \nto the Southern District of Florida.\n\n  I congratulate Judge Altonaga and her family on her confirmation.\n  Today the Senate is reducing the number of Federal judicial vacancies \nto the lowest level it has been in 13 years. The 110 vacancies I \ninherited in the summer of 2001 have been more than cut in half. In the \n17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee we not only kept up with \nattrition but reduced those 110 vacancies to 60 with Judge Altonaga's \nconfirmation and that of Patricia Minaldi we will have 47 vacancies for \nthe entire federal judiciary. I thank all Senators for working with us. \nI thank the Democratic leadership for pressing for this vote on Judge \nAltonaga. I have spoken about her and urged this vote since she was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee almost 1 month ago.\n  Since July 2001 a number of Senators have worked very hard to repair \nthe damage done during the years 1995 through the early part of 2001. \nWe made significant progress. Unfortunately, our efforts have received \nlittle acknowledgement and the current administration continues down \nthe strident path of confrontation and court packing rather than \nworking with Senators of both parties to identify and nominate \nconsensus, mainstream nominees.\n  While the Nation's unemployment rate rose last month to 6 percent, \nthe vacancy rate on the federal judiciary has been lowered to 5.6 \npercent. While the number of private sector jobs lost since the \nbeginning of the Bush administration is 2.7 million, almost 9 million \nAmericans are now out of work, and unemployment has risen by more than \n45 percent, Democrats in the Senate have cooperated in moving forward \nto confirm 123 of this President's judicial nominees, reduce judicial \nvacancies to the lowest level in years, and reduce federal judicial \nvacancies by almost 60 percent. Yet the Republican-led Senate remains \nobsessed with seeking to force through the most divisive of this \nPresident's controversial, ideologically-chosen nominees.\n  In just the last 2 years, 123 of the President's judicial nominees \nwill have been confirmed. One hundred of those confirmations came \nduring the 17 months of Democratic leadership of the Senate. No fair-\nminded observer could term that obstructionism. By contrast, during the \nsix and one-half years during which Republicans controlled the Senate \nand President Clinton's nominations were being considered, they \naveraged only 38 confirmations a year. During the last two years of the \nClinton administration, the Senate confirmed only 73 Federal judges. \nCombining the 1996 and 1997 sessions, Republicans in the Senate allowed \nonly 53 judges to be confirmed in two years, including only seven new \njudges to the circuit courts. One entire congressional session, the \nRepublican-led Senate confirmed only 17 judges all year and none at all \nto the circuit courts. The Senate confirmed 72 judges nominated by \nPresident Bush last year alone under Democratic leadership.\n  The fact is that when Democrats became the Senate majority in the \nsummer of 2001, we inherited 110 judicial vacancies. These are the \nfacts. Over the next 17 months, despite constant criticism from the \nadministration, the Senate proceeded to confirm 100 of President Bush's \nnominees, including several who were divisive an controversial, several \nwho had mixed peer review ratings from the ABA and at least one who had \nbeen rated not qualified. Despite the additional 40 vacancies that \narose, we reduced judicial vacancies to 60, a level below that termed \n``full employment'' on the federal judiciary by Senator Hatch.\n  Since the beginning of this year, in spite of the fixation of the \nRepublican majority on the President's most controversial nominations, \nwe have worked hard to reduce judicial vacancies even further. As of \ntoday, the number of judicial vacancies is at 47. That is the lowest it \nhas been in several years. That is lower than it ever was allowed to go \nat any time during the entire eight years of the Clinton \nadministration. We have already reduced judicial vacancies from 110 to \n47, in less than two years. We have reduced the vacancy rate from 12.8 \npercent to 5.6 percent, the lowest it has been since 1990. With some \ncooperation from the administration think of the additional progress we \ncould be making.\n  The President promised to be a uniter not a divider, but he has \ncontinued to send us judicial nominees that divide our Nation and, in \nthe case of Miguel Estrada, he has even managed to divide Hispanics \nacross the country. The nomination and confirmation process begins with \nthe President, and I urge him to work with us to find a way forward to \nunite, instead of divide, the Nation on these issues.\n  Republican talking points will likely focus on the impasse on two of \nthe most extreme of the President's nominations rather than 123 \nconfirmations and the lowest judicial vacancy rate in 13 years. They \nwill ignore their own recent filibusters against President Clinton's \nexecutive and judicial nominees in so doing.\n  What is unprecedented about the Estrada matter is that the \nadministration and Republican leadership have\n\n[[Page S5757]]\n\nshown no willingness to be reasonable and accommodate Democratic \nSenators' request for information traditionally shared with the Senate \nby past administrations. That we have endured numerous cloture votes is \nan indictment of Republican intransigence on this matter, nothing more. \nWhat is unprecedented is that there has been no effort on the \nRepublican side to work this matter out, as these matters have always \nbeen worked out in the past. What is unprecedented is that the \nRepublican insistence to schedule cloture vote after cloture vote \nwithout first resolving the underlying problem caused by the \nadministration's inflexibility.\n  What is unprecedented about the Owen nomination is that it was made \nat all. Judge Owen had a fair hearing and was given fair consideration \nfor the Judicial Committee last year. We proceeded is spite of the fact \nthat the Republican majority had refused to proceed with any \nof President Clinton's Fifth Circuit nominees during his last 4-year \nterm. Never before in our history has a President renominated for the \nsame vacancy someone voted down by the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  From 1995 through the summer of 2001, the Republican majority \naveraged only 38 confirmations a year with only seven to the Courts of \nAppeals. That explains why Federal judicial vacancies rose from 63 to \n110 on the Republican watch and circuit vacancies more than doubled \nfrom 16 to 33. Of course, during those years there were no Republican-\nled hearings calling for prompt action or fair consideration of \nPresident Clinton's moderate judicial nominees. To the contrary, \nSenator Ashcroft held hearings designed to justify the slowdown. \nSenator Ashcroft and others perfected the practice of using anonymous \nholds both in committee and on the floor so that judicial nominees were \nstalled for months and years without consideration. Scores of nominees \nnever received hearings, at least 10 who received hearings never \nreceived committee consideration and those who were ultimately \nconsidered often were delayed months and years.\n  Beginning in July 2001, Democrats started bringing accountability and \nopenness to the process. In the 17 months of the Democratic Senate \nmajority we held more hearings on more judicial nominees, held more \nCommittee votes and more Senate votes than before. We were able \nvirtually to double the pace and productivity of the process. We did \naway with the secrecy of the ``blue slip'' and the anonymous hold. We \nconsidered President Bush's nominees fairly, responsibly and in those \n17 months confirmed 100 of this President's nominees. We reversed the \ndestructive trends with respect to the number of vacancies and length \nof time that nominees had to wait to be considered. While we could not \nconsider all nominations simultaneously, we considered more, more \nquickly than in the preceding years. The Democratic majority inherited \n110 judicial vacancies including a record 33 to the circuit courts. By \nDecember 2002, we were able through hard work to outpace the 40 \nadditional vacancies that had arisen and reduce the remaining vacancies \nto 60, including 25 to the circuit courts. We have continued to \ncooperate and today the remaining vacancies number 47, including 20 on \nthe circuit courts. This is the lowest vacancy number and lowest \nvacancy rate in 13 years.\n  Senator Hatch used to say, when President Clinton was nominating \nmoderates to more than 100 vacancies, that there was no vacancies \ncrisis. He used to say that he considered 67 vacancies to be ``full \nemployment'' on the Federal judiciary. Today we are well short of 100 \nvacancies and well beyond what he used to term ``full employment'' with \n47 vacancies. Today I expect the Senate to consider and confirm both \nJudge Cecilia Altonaga, who will be the first Cuban-American woman to \nserve on the Federal judiciary, and Patricia Minaldi, and thereby bring \nthe remaining vacancies down to 47. The Committee continues to report \nnominations to fill additional vacancies, as well as, with another \nhearing scheduled for tomorrow.\n  This is not to say that our work is done. Last week, with the help \nand hard work of the Senate Leadership we were able to make additional \nprogress. Last Wednesday, Majority Leader Frist  used that word \n``progress'' to describe how we have been able to resolve complications \ncaused by the manner in which these nominations were forced through the \nJudiciary Committee. Last Thursday, I thanked the majority leader and \nthe Democratic leader and others for their efforts in this regard and \nfor working with us to bring the nomination of Judge Edward Prado to a \nvote without further, unnecessary delay.\n\n  Yesterday, the Senate debated and voted on the nomination of Deborah \nCook to the Sixth Circuit. She is the fourth nominee of President Bush \nto be confirmed to the Sixth Circuit in less than 2 years. During the \nentire second term of President Clinton, the Republican majority would \nnot hold hearings or consider a single one of President Clinton's \nnominees to the Sixth Circuit--not Judge Helene White, not Kathleen \nMcCree Lewis, not Professor Kent Markus. Nonetheless, while I was chair \nof the Judiciary Committee we proceeded to consider and confirm two \nconservative nominees of President Bush to the Sixth Circuit and this \nyear the Senate has proceeded to confirm two more.\n  The work of the Senate would be more productive if this \nadministration were more interested in filling vacancies with \nqualified, consensus nominees rather than packing the federal courts \nwith activist judges. The nominations and confirmation process begins \nwith the President. Far from being someone who has sought consensus and \nto unite us on judicial nominees, this President has used judicial \nnominees as a partisan weapon and sought sharply to tilt the courts \nideologically. That is unfortunate. Some of us have urged another \ncourse, a course of cooperation and conciliation, but that is not the \npath this administration has chosen. Yet, in spite of the historically \nlow level of cooperation from the White House, the Senate has already \nconfirmed 123 of President Bush's judicial nominees, including some of \nthe most divisive and controversial sent by any President.\n  Last week, the Senate proceeded to a vote on the nomination of \nJeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit. He received the fewest number of \nfavorable votes of any nominee in almost 20 years with 52. He is the \nthird controversial judicial nominee of this President against whom \nmore than 40 negative votes were cast, yet those three nominees were \nnot stalled and not subjected to a filibuster.\n  Our Senate leadership, both Republican and Democratic, have worked to \ncorrect some of the problems that arose from some of the earlier \nhearings and actions of this committee. Last week, we were able to hold \na hearing on the nomination of John Roberts to the District of Columbia \nCircuit. We are all working hard to complete committee consideration of \nthat nomination at the earliest opportunity. Thus, a number of \nadditional, controversial nominations are in the process of being \nconsidered and will be considered by the Senate in due course.\n  My point is to underscore that we have made and are making real \nprogress from the thoroughgoing obstruction from 1996 until 2001. While \n``the glass is not full,'' it is more full than empty and more has been \nachieved than some want to acknowledge. One hundred and twenty-three \nlifetime confirmations in less than 2 years is better than any 2-year \nperiod from 1995 through 2000. We have reduced judicial vacancies to \n47, which is the lowest number and lowest vacancy percentage in 13 \nyears. During the entire eight-year term of President Clinton it was \nnever allowed by Republicans to get that low. We have made tremendous \nprogress. These achievements have not been easy.\n\n  The administration has chosen confrontation with the Congress, with \nthe Senate and with this Committee. We are now proceeding at three to \nfour times the pace Republicans maintained in reviewing President \nClinton's judicial nominees. We have reached the point where this \nCommittee and the Senate are often moving too fast on some nominations \nand we risk becoming a racing conveyor belt that rubber stamps rather \nthan examines these lifetime appointments. Democrats have worked hard \nto repair the damage to the confirmation process and achieved \nsignificant results. Republicans seem merely results oriented and \ninterested in ideological domination of the federal courts.\n  As Republicans turn their guns on the propriety of the filibuster in \nconnection with judicial nominations, I\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\ntrust the Republican majority will not overlook the precedent on this \nquestion. Republicans not only joined in the filibuster of Abe Fortas \nto be Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, they joined in \nthe filibuster of Stephen Breyer to the First Circuit, Judge Rosemary \nBarkett to the Eleventh Circuit, Judge H. Lee Sarokin to the Third \nCircuit, and Judge Richard Paez and Judge Marsha Berzon to the Ninth \nCircuit. The truth is that filibusters on nominations and legislative \nmatters and extended debate on judicial nominations, including circuit \ncourt nominations, have become more and more common on the initiative \nof Republicans working against Democratic nominees. Now that a \nRepublican President, intent on packing the courts with ideologues, has \nseen two nominees delayed by filibusters, and even though the other 123 \njudges he nominated have been confirmed, partisans want to change the \nrules to make it easier for this President to get his way.\n  Of course, when they are in the majority Republicans have more \nsuccessfully defeated nominees by refusing to proceed on them and have \nnot publicly explained their actions, preferring to act in secret under \nthe cloak of anonymity. From 1995 through 2001, when Republicans \npreviously controlled the Senate majority, Republican efforts to defeat \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees most often took place through \ninaction and anonymous holds for which no Republican Senator could be \nheld accountable. Republicans held up almost 80 judicial nominees who \nwere not acted upon during the Congress in which President Clinton \nfirst nominated them and eventually defeated more than 50 judicial \nnominees without a recorded Senate vote of any kind, just by refusing \nto proceed with hearings and Committee votes. These are just the sorts \nof stealth tactics Democrats have rejected.\n  Beyond judicial nominees, Republicans also filibustered the \nnomination of Executive Branch nominees. They successfully filibustered \nthe nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to become Surgeon General of the \nUnited States in spite of two cloture votes in 1995. Dr. David \nSatcher's subsequent nomination to be Surgeon General also required \ncloture, but he was successfully confirmed.\n  Other Executive Branch nominees who were filibustered by Republicans \nincluded Walter Dellinger's nomination to be Assistant Attorney \nGeneral. Two cloture petitions were required to be filed on that \nnomination and both were rejected by Republicans. We were able finally \nto obtain a confirmation vote for Professor Walter Dellinger after \nsignificant efforts and he was confirmed to be Assistant Attorney \nGeneral with 34 votes against him. He was never confirmed to his \nposition as Solicitor General because Republicans had made clear their \nopposition to him. In addition, in 1993, Republicans objected to a \nnumber of State Department nominations and even the nomination of Janet \nNapolitano to serve as the U.S. Attorney for Arizona, resulting in more \ncloture petitions. In 1994, Republicans successfully filibustered the \nnomination of Sam Brown to be an Ambassador. After three cloture \nmotions were filed, his nomination was returned to President Clinton \nwithout Senate action. Also in 1994, two cloture motions were required \nto get a vote on the nomination of Derek Shearer to be an ambassador. \nAnd it likewise took two cloture motions to get a vote on the \nnomination of Ricki Tigert to chair the FDIC. So when Republican \nSenators now talk about the Senate Executive Calendar and Presidential \nnominees, they must be reminded that they recently filibustered many, \nmany qualified nominees.\n  Filibusters should be and are rare. That there are two this year is a \ndirect result of the strategy of confrontation sought by the White \nHouse and Senate Republicans. The administration holds the key to \nending the Estrada impasse, as it has for the last year. It should \ncooperate with the Senate and provide access to his work papers, \nfollowing the example set by all previous Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. The renomination of Judge Owen was most ill-advised \nand unprecedented. Her nomination had already been rejected after fair \nhearings and thorough debate and a Committee vote last year. Some \napparently want to rewrite the rules so that this President can have \nevery nominee confirmed, no matter how divisive and controversial, by \nthe Republican Senate majority.\n  Recently, I heard a respected Republican and senior advisor to the \nmajority leader describe cloture as ``the fulcrum on which you balance \nthe rights of the individual and the rights of the institution.'' He \nexplained how important the rights of the minority party are in the \nSenate and how Senate rules are deliberately constructed to reflect \nthat and protect the minority. That Republicans are now intent on \nrewriting longstanding Senate rules shows just how partisan and ends-\noriented they have become.\n  The President promised to be a uniter not a divider, but he has \ncontinued to send us judicial nominees that divide our Nation. He has \neven managed to divide Hispanics across the country with the nomination \nof Mr. Estrada. He has managed to outrage disabled individuals by his \nnomination of Jeffery Sutton. The nomination and confirmation process \nbegins with the President. I, again, urge him to work with us to \nidentify and nominate qualified, consensus, mainstream nominees who all \nAmericans can be confident will be fair and impartial and to abandon \nhis ideological court-packing scheme.\n  Mr. President, am I correct that at 2:30 p.m. the vote is to take \nplace?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we back on the energy bill? Is that \nthe order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know my colleagues have made \npresentations on the energy bill. The chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, Senator Domenici, and the ranking Member, \nSenator Bingaman, have made presentations on the energy bill. I wanted \nto come to the floor to speak about this piece of legislation.\n  There are some provisions in this legislation that I think are \nparticularly worthy and some that are not. There are some provisions \nthat should be in the bill and, as of yet, are not in the bill. My hope \nis that as we debate and discuss the energy issue on the floor of the \nSenate, we will be able to construct a bipartisan energy bill that \nadvances this country's energy interests. That ought to be our goal.\n\n  It is a fact that our country, for well over a century, has been \nwedded to the use of oil, particularly for the purpose of moving our \ntransportation fleet. Because we are so chained to the use of oil--and \nespecially now chained to the use of foreign oil, with 55 percent of \nwhat we use coming from places outside of our country--most believe \nthat our economy is at risk.\n  What do I mean by ``at risk''? I mean that if, God forbid, some \nmorning we wake up and discover that the supply of oil coming from \nareas of the world that are deeply troubled is somehow shut off, our \neconomy will be flat on its back. I do not think there is any dispute \nabout that.\n  The 55 percent of oil that now comes from outside of our borders is \nexpected to increase to nearly 65, 66 percent in the coming years. Is \nthat advancing this country's economic and energy security? No, not at \nall. In fact, it injures our country's opportunities in both the \nintermediate and long term.\n  So the question for us with respect to energy policy is, How do we \nbecome less dependent on energy that comes from outside of our country? \nHow do we produce more, over which we have control? How do we conserve \nmore? After all, conservation is another form of producing. How do we \nincrease the efficiency of appliances and other items that we use \nenergy for in our daily lives? And how do we increase the role of \nlimitless and renewable supplies of energy? Those are the key questions \nfor all of us, it seems to me, in trying to write a better energy bill.\n  As we see more and more States begin to experiment with restructuring \nand deregulation, we also need to address in this bill the question, \n``How do we prevent from happening once again what happened on the west \ncoast, particularly in California, where there was grand theft \ncommitted by some companies now under criminal investigation?''\n  Enron, of course, was one company that was subject to these \nallegations. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is now taking \naction against a number of companies. But there is no question about \nwhat happened with respect to electricity restructuring in California: \nthat some companies engaged in basic criminal wrongdoing, and that the \nconsumers on the west coast were bilked to the tune of not millions or \nhundreds of millions of dollars but billions of dollars. That is why I \ncall it grand theft.\n  How do we prevent that from happening in the future? I will talk \nabout that in just a couple moments.\n  But let me put up a chart that shows from where we have received the \nimports of crude oil, by country of origin, in a recent year. No. 1 was \nSaudi Arabia, 588 million barrels of crude oil in 2001 from Saudi \nArabia; and then you have Mexico, Canada, Venezuela, Nigeria, and Iraq \nas No. 6.\n  You can see, if you look at this list, we are importing oil from very \ntroubled parts of the world. The future opportunity of growth and \neconomic opportunity in this country is to be able to continue this \nsupply. Our economy depends on it. So should we become less dependent \non that? The answer is yes. Will we in this bill? I hope the answer \nwill be yes.\n  One of the points I have made is about our dependence on foreign oil. \nWe import 55 percent of that which we consume. Fifty-five percent comes \nfrom off of our shores. That is expected to go to 66, 68 percent by the \nyear 2025.\n  Nearly all of our cars and trucks in the United States run on \ngasoline. They are the main reason America imports so much oil. Two-\nthirds of the 20 million barrels of oil that we use each day is used \nfor transportation, and it is the fastest growing part of our energy \nconsumption.\n\n  I have mentioned many times on the floor--and I will not bore you \nwith the whole story--that my first car, when I was a young teenager, \nwas a 1924 Model T Ford that I restored. It took me a couple years to \nrestore this old Model T. When I did, I finally sold it. But the fact \nis, you put gasoline in a 1924 Model T Ford the same way you put it in \na 2003 Ford. Nothing has changed. You pull up to the pumps, and you \njust pump gas in the tank. That is the way it is; that is the way it \nhas been; it is the way it is going to be, unless we change.\n  So can we, after three-quarters of a century, or a century, decide to \ntake a look at what is consumed in transportation, especially for our \nvehicle fleet, and decide that we do not have to run gasoline through \nour carburetors in order to propel our vehicles? Can we do that? I hope \nthe answer is yes.\n  Someone who trains elephants once told me a story about why elephants \nstand with a cuff on their leg that has a small chain attached to a \nlittle stake in the ground. I saw it first when a small circus came to \nour town. It was a really small circus because my town had a population \nof only 350, 400 people, so they only had 1 elephant.\n  But they put a cuff around the elephant's back leg, with a small \nchain attached to a little stake that was stuck in the ground, and the \nelephant never moved. I always wondered, how could they have an \nelephant stand there, when clearly that little stake in the ground was \nnot going to hold the elephant, but the elephant never tried to pull \nit.\n  Well, that is because when they capture elephants in Thailand, what \nthey do is put a cuff around the elephant's leg attached to a big \nchain, and they tie it to a banyan tree. And for a week, week and a \nhalf, 2 weeks, the elephant does nothing but pull and tug and, with all \nof his might, try to pull away from that banyan tree. But it is not to \nbe. That elephant is chained to that banyan tree, and pretty soon the \nelephant stops because the elephant understands it cannot get loose. So \nit never again tries. They take the chain off the banyan tree and put a \nlittle stake in the ground, and the elephant never moves; it just stays \nthere, understanding it cannot move from that stake.\n  That is kind of the way we are. We are kind of like the elephant and \nthe banyan tree with respect to our dependence on foreign oil. We never \nthink that what we can do is pole-vault over this to new technologies.\n  At the end of this debate, if what the Senate will have exhibited to \nthe American people is that our debate is really only about two \nthings--the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and CAFE standards--shame \non us, because that is the same old debate we have every 10, 15, and 25 \nyears when we talk about energy. Are both of these issues important? \nSure, they are. But it is more important to evaluate how, in 5, 10, 15, \n25, and 50 years from now, our children and grandchildren will be \ndriving vehicles that are not running gasoline through the carburetors.\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\n  How we can move to a hydrogen economy using fuel cells? The President \nsaid: Let's do that. Good for him. He put his administration on the \nside of moving in the right direction. His proposal was timid and did \nnot propose much new money, but proposed to use funds from other \nimportant accounts on renewables and conservation in order to finance \nit. The fact is, even though it was a timid, not bold, proposal, the \ndirection was an important direction for our country.\n  If this country decides that, in the next 10 and 25 years, we are \ngoing to set timetables and goals to develop fuel cells for our \nvehicles, then we can become much less dependent on foreign oil.\n  That does not mean we shall not and will not always need fossil \nfuels. We will use oil, natural gas, and coal. There is no question \nabout that. And we have incentives in this bill to find more and use \nmore. For coal, for example, we have clean coal technology in this \nbill, which I support. We are always going to do that.\n  But if our policy is only to dig and drill--if that is our energy \npolicy--then it is a ``yesterday forever'' policy. To be forward \nlooking is to understand there are actions we can take that are \nrevolutionary, that can give us a different kind of energy future--one \nthat provides more economic and energy security for our country. That \nis why moving towards a hydrogen economy by developing fuel cells makes \nsuch good sense. Fuel cells are twice as efficient as the internal \ncombustion engine.\n  The supply of hydrogen is inexhaustible. Hydrogen is in water. You \ncan take the energy from the wind, and use the electricity in the \nprocess of electrolysis, separate the hydrogen from the oxygen, and \nstore the hydrogen and use it in vehicles. The fact is, hydrogen is \nubiquitous. It is everywhere. What do we do to get there? We have to \ndecide as a country that is where we want to go. That is what Europe is \ndoing. That is what Japan is doing. We do have to solve some issues: \nthe production, storage, and transportation of hydrogen, as well as the \ncontinued development of fuel cell vehicles.\n  I have ridden in a fuel cell vehicle. We have had fuel cells propel a \nvehicle from Los Angeles to New York. It is not as if they don't exist. \nThe question is, ``Does this country want to move forward with that \ntype of future?'' The President says yes. I say yes. It makes sense to \ndo that.\n  First and foremost, we should talk seriously about the range of \nissues dealing with fossil fuels. I agree with all of that--incentives \nfor the production of coal, oil, natural gas. I will not support \ndrilling in ANWR. There are a few areas that are precious and unusual. \nWe ought to put them aside. I do support the construction of a natural \ngas pipeline to access the 32 trillion cubic feet of natural gas from \nAlaska. I support drilling in the Gulf of Mexico where there are \nimportant and exciting areas for oil and natural gas development. I \nbelieve that with clean coal technology, we can make substantial use of \nour coal resources. That makes sense to me. With respect to fossil \nfuels, yes, we can produce more. We have incentives in the bill to do \nthat.\n  With respect to conservation, it is very important for us to \nunderstand that conserving a barrel of oil is similar to producing a \nbarrel of oil. Conservation provides some of our least expensive \nopportunities. We don't conserve nearly enough. Incentives for \nconservation make sense, as well.\n  We have had many debates about the efficiency of the appliances, from \nlight bulbs to refrigerators, that we use every single day. Many of \nthese appliances that we use have become much more efficient. We had a \ndebate about the SEER standard for air-conditioners. We can, should, \nand will make appliances much more efficient, both by pushing those who \nproduce them and those who purchase them.\n  In addition, let me talk about limitless sources of energy and \nrenewable sources of energy. Senators Talent, Daschle, Johnson, and \nothers, including myself, will offer an amendment dealing with the \nRenewable Fuels Standard to nearly double the current production of \nethanol to 5 billion gallons by 2012. We will ban MTBE across the \ncountry. MTBE is a gasoline additive that can find its way into water \nsupplies. It is harmful to human health. As MTBE is phased out of \ngasoline, there is going to be a significant, demonstrable, new market \nfor ethanol and renewable fuels--ethanol, biodiesel, and others.\n  Especially with respect to ethanol, it makes sense to take a kernel \nof corn, extract the alcohol content, and still have protein feedstock \nleft. What you have done is produce a new market for America's family \nfarmers, extended America's energy supply, and you still have the \nprotein feedstock left for cattle and livestock. We are going to nearly \ndouble, with this Renewable Fuels Standard, the amount of ethanol that \nwill be produced and used.\n  We will also offer a Renewable Portfolio Standard that would help \nincrease the use of renewable energy, such as wind energy and other \nsources of renewable and limitless energy, as part of the energy mix \nfor electricity. I believe both the Renewable Fuel Standard and the \nRenewable Portfolio Standard will become part of this bill.\n  Going back to the hydrogen fuel cell issue, this bill certainly \nimproves on the President's proposal, but it is still short of what can \nand should be done. We ought to establish timetables and set goals. I \noffered that amendment in the Energy Committee and lost by two votes. I \nintend to offer it on the floor once again. It is the right direction. \nThe President thinks it is the right direction. But we ought to try to \nstimulate timetables and goals in order to strive to reach something we \nestablish.\n\n  Finally, let me talk about the electricity title for a moment. We do \nneed to address issues such as transmission. We have serious \ntransmission problems. In my home State of North Dakota, we have the \ncapability of producing more energy, but we have a transmission \nproblem, because we don't have the transmission capacity to move the \nenergy that we can produce.\n  We have to try to find a way to solve this transmission problem. FERC \nis working on it. There are various plans, such as Standard Market \nDesign and so on. We need to do that in a constructive way. There is a \nlot of disagreement about how you price the transmission and the \nmovement of electricity along various lines, as well as disagreement \nabout the establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations. All of \nthis is part of what is being discussed both in the executive branch, \nthe FERC, and also here in Congress with respect to this bill.\n  This point is important. I chaired a series of hearings a year and a \nhalf ago with respect to the behavior of Enron in California. It was \nnot just Enron, but Enron is the only company I will name at this \npoint. The FERC has since done an evaluation on the west coast--\nCalifornia and other States.\n  What happened there was, in my judgment and the judgment of the FERC, \ncriminal. There is a criminal investigation ongoing. Companies have \nbeen and will be charged. What they did was manipulate the supply and \nprice of energy. In fact, they took plants offline. We now have \ntestimony that this is what happened. They did it deliberately to \nmanipulate the load. What was the result? Cheating the consumer--\nwholesale cheating. This isn't petty thievery; this is grand theft to \nthe tune of billions of dollars.\n  We happen to know what their strategies were because we dug them out. \nGet Shorty; does anybody know what that is? How about Fat Boy? Death \nStar? Yes, Get Shorty, Fat Boy, and Death Star are the names of \nstrategies by which a company decided to steal from consumers. Yes, I \nused the word ``steal.'' They did, a massive quantity of money.\n  The question is, How much is going to be paid back? That is the \nquestion. The question for us in the energy bill is, How do we prevent \nthis from happening again? How do we make sure this never happens \nagain? This bill has the prohibition on round trip trading and a series \nof issues such as that, but the bill does not have enough protection in \nit for the consumers, so that in a marketplace where some have the \nopportunity to cheat, we have the protections to prevent that from \nhappening.\n  There is a purpose for regulators. I know a lot of people don't like \ngovernment, but there is a purpose for regulators. Regulators are the \nreferees because there are some--a minority--who will cheat. Most \nbusinesses are wonderful, run by great people; they want to\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\ndo the right thing. But there are some who are willing to cheat. We saw \nthat on the west coast in the electricity markets. I don't want to see \nthat again. I want this bill and the electricity title to have \nsufficient safeguards so we are not ever again talking about Fat Boy, \nGet Shorty, or Death Star.\n  We have a lot to talk about with respect to energy. There is not much \nmore in the policy area that is as important as energy. But we will \ntalk about fiscal policy and, I believe starting next week, the \nPresident's tax cut proposal and other issues. Our economy, our country \ncannot proceed without energy. Every single day when we awaken and we \nbegin to open the doors to our factories and to produce, we drive to \nwork, do all that we do during the day as Americans, we do that because \nwe have ample supplies of energy. When we have an economy that is now \ndependent, to the tune of 55 percent, on oil that comes from other \nparts of the world, our economic security and our other security is \nthreatened.\n  Can we ever become truly independent? Maybe not. But should we have \nover one-half of our oil coming from outside the country? The answer is \nno.\n  Yes, we ought to do some digging and drilling, produce more fossil \nfuels--natural gas, oil, and coal. But if that is our only strategy, \nthat is a yesterday forever strategy, not a strategy that advances this \ncountry's interests. Let's be bolder and do more. Let's move toward a \nhydrogen economy. Let's produce hydrogen and fuel cells. Let's decide \nto become less dependent on oil from other parts of the world.\n  Let's do it in a bold way. Yes, let's produce additional energy from \nrenewable and limitless sources of energy. Let's take the energy from \nthe wind, with the new, efficient turbines. Let's do all of these \nthings. Let's produce ethanol and let's have an energy bill that does \nall of that which should be done to make this country more energy \nindependent and make this country understand that it has the energy to \nprovide long-term economic growth without being held hostage by others \noutside of our borders.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CRAPO). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia, \nwho is currently on the floor, for being willing to yield for a few \nmoments while I discuss the bill that is currently before the Senate. I \nthank him for that.\n  This morning Senator Domenici, chairman of our Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, introduced S. 14. You can tell by the size of this \nlegislation that it is, in fact, no ordinary bill. Since the spring of \n2001 when the President issued his plan for a national energy policy, I \nand a good number of my colleagues, including the Presiding Officer at \nthis moment, began to work on legislation to implement the \nrecommendations of our President's energy policy. But as important as \nthat is, we tried to bring together in a bipartisan way all of the \nissues that we have been looking at for a good number of years that \nreflect the absence of a comprehensive national energy policy for our \ncountry.\n  Democrats and Republicans alike had begun to recognize--as the \nnumbers moved to greater dependency on foreign oil, as our economy \nbegan to grow and our overall surpluses that were built into our \nelectrical system in the decades of the sixties and the seventies were \nbeing used up--that something had to be done.\n  While conservation was important, while new technologies were \nimportant, we simply were not producing more energy, but we were \nconsuming large amounts of energy.\n  Along comes the high-tech revolution. That was to be a revolution in \nwhich less energy would be used, and quite the opposite happened. The \nlarge computer farms that fed the networks of the new electronic \nrevolution, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence used a lot \nof energy, used high-quality energy.\n  Do I have to enumerate what happened in California a few years ago, \nthe painful problems it went through with brownouts and blackouts, not \nbecause somebody was gaming the system, but because there was simply no \nway to produce the energy necessary to feed the demand system of that \nsupply?\n  Major California utilities were moving toward bankruptcy under a new \nderegulated energy policy, and our western energy markets that the \nPresiding Officer and I are in, such as the State of Idaho and the \ngreater Pacific Northwest, recognized that California was draining us \nof energy, our energy costs were beginning to move up at an \nunprecedented rate, and the supply within the greater system simply was \nnot there, or the system did not have the capacity to handle it if, in \nfact, the supply was there.\n  The anxiety of choking the rest of our Nation off from energy caused \nshock waves and panic across the country in a way we had not seen \nbefore. I recall Senators who normally shun even the thought of price \ncaps in a market system coming to the floor and advocating such \nmisguided measures. We saw the Governor of California, Gray Davis, in \nsomewhat of a panic entering into long-term contracts for power at \nrates that he was proud of at the time, only to now come begging the \nfederal government to break those contracts as unfair when the market \nchanged.\n  A truer description of those contracts might suggest that it was \nunwise to enter into them, but it was not unfair at that moment. That \nwas the market. The market was reacting to the demand, or the lack \nthereof. This was just a little bit over 2 years ago, not 30 years ago, \nnot a decade ago, just a little over 2 years ago.\n\n  It was not just a fluke. Yes, the Enron episode saw the potential of \npeople gaming a system that was badly broken, that was not feeding the \nmarket in a way the market wanted to be fed and taking an opportunity \nthat existed. But to suggest it was a manufactured energy crisis is \nabsolute nonsense. The marketplace being what it is, if the market is \nstarved for the resource it demands, then the price moves up until \nsomeone cannot afford to buy and only those who can afford to buy will \nbuy. That is the nature of the marketplace.\n  All of those facts were true, and then along came September 11, and \nour country went through another shock, and we began to look at \nourselves and our abilities as a country.\n  Today we have before us a comprehensive piece of legislation that has \nbeen literally a year or two in the making and several iterations and \nwith several debates on the floor, but it is a bill that was written in \nthe traditional way that good public policy is crafted, not in the back \nroom of the office of the majority leader of the day when he denied the \ncommittee its ability to function a year or two ago, but it was crafted \nin the open light of day, in a full markup session of an authorizing \ncommittee with Democrats and Republicans agreeing and disagreeing in \nthe structuring of this legislation.\n  What we have before us is what I believe to be a comprehensive bill \nto address a crisis that is real and true in our country, and we are \nonly getting a slight reprieve in a recessionary economy because demand \nfor the resource is down, and we are all hoping we can return to the \ngrowth years of the mid-nineties. If we do, there is the distinct \npossibility that the brownouts, the blackouts, and the high prices will \nreturn.\n  Even in their absence, we are already beginning to see shock waves in \nthe marketplace because we have denied the market the right to produce \nat a time when we are demanding even more.\n  Energy Secretary Abraham stated a year and a half ago that America \nfaced a major energy supply crisis. What he said is a reflection of the \nmarket. I say that because natural gas prices, interestingly enough, \nthat reached almost $100 per million cubic feet during the period of \nthe California crisis eventually dropped to more acceptable levels only \nto start creeping up again to the price of $19 per million cubic feet \nin February of this year.\n  We have seen phenomenal fluctuation in the market, but yet we are \nseeing peaks now in that gas market because of a limited supply. The \nClinton\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\nAdministration encouraged everybody to burn gas; not only to use it for \nspace heating but also to use it for electrical generation, even when \nthe experts in the market said that ought not to be done. Really, a \npoor use for natural gas is to put it in a turbine to create new energy \nwhen it ought to be used exclusively for space heat and other forms of \nheat creation. But because we had denied other forms of energy the \nability to generate, that was the one available and everybody rushed to \nit, and we saw these phenomenal peaks in the market.\n  While we were doing that, we were denying the right to explore and \ndevelop gas reserves. In so doing, we created the ups and downs in that \nmarket. The natural gas market is volatile and will continue to be into \nthe future. That is the reality of not only bad policy but bad \ndirection of a use of a natural resource and denying the marketplace \nthe right to adjust accordingly.\n  I will now talk about gas and electric transmission and \ninfrastructure. If we were to meet the gas demand to produce \nelectricity through gas turbine generation, we would have to construct \nover 38,000 miles of gas transmission pipeline to get the gas to \nmarket. This bill recognizes the need for that and the need to \nincentivize that kind of major construction across our country; not \nonly that, but be able to gain access to the lands on which the pipes \nmust be laid. Of course, that has remained an issue, as we have seen \ngovernment policy deny the right to do that.\n  Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, for example, produces about 8 billion cubic \nfeet of natural gas a day, and that is approximately 13 percent of \nAmerica's daily consumption demand. But that gas is not even available \nin the market today. Why? Well, it is up in Alaska. There is no easy \neconomic way to deliver it down to the lower 48 so it is simply pumped \nback into the ground. This bill recognizes it. This bill incentivizes \nthe building of a major gas line across Alaska down through Canada to \npick up the Canadian supply and to bring it into the lower 48, to meet \nthe reality of demand, to meet the reality of the potential of a new \nhydrogen market for transportation that this President and others are \ntalking about, but most importantly to recognize this Nation has \nphenomenal capacity to produce and to supply if we will simply provide \nthe right incentives, instead of deny and restrict, for whatever \nreason, as we have over the last several decades access to the land for \nthe purpose of production or access to the land for the purpose of \nlaying the necessary pipelines to supply.\n  Over the next 20 years, the Department of Energy estimates electrical \ndemand in the United States will increase 45 percent, based on current \ngrowth projections. One of the ways to meet that demand is to bring the \ngas from Canada to fuel the gas turbines to generate the electricity in \na clean and appropriate way, even though I have argued that may be one \nof the least effective ways to use natural gas for the purposes it was \nintended.\n  Consumers are already feeling the impact of a transmission system \nthat is being stressed by demand. Transmission bottlenecks contributed \ngreatly to the blackouts in California, to price spikes in New York, in \nwhich the cost to consumers was estimated to be $100 million, simply \nbecause somebody denied the right to build a transmission line to \naccess the appropriate systems.\n  The Department of Energy has estimated it will need to construct over \nthe next several years an additional 255,000 miles of distribution line \nat an estimated cost of $120 billion to $150 billion to ensure our \nelectrical system remains the most reliable in the world. It is a huge \ninvestment, but the marketplace is ready to do it. All we have to do is \nguide it and direct it, and the marketplace will adjust. The consumer \nis willing to pay and the provider is willing to produce, supply, and \nbuild the necessary lines. What we have done is say, no, it cannot be \ndone here, and it will not be done there, and it should not be done \nover there.\n\n  We are putting at risk the most reliable electrical system in the \nworld. How many of us have traveled to Third World countries where you \ncan stay in a beautiful hotel and you think you are in a four-star \nhotel, but the power goes out consistently, or the lights dim \nconsistently, or there is no e-mail or there is no Internet, tools we \nhave come to depend and rely on. When we walk to the wall today and \nflip the switch, the light comes on, and it consistently comes on. That \nis not always true in Third World nations, and the reason is they do \nnot have the transmission or the generation system to ensure \nreliability.\n  They are striving to build them today and they know they have to have \nthem if they are going to compete as an economy in this world and be \ncompetitive with us. The supply and availability of energy to our \neconomy and to our working men and women has made us the great Nation \nwe are, and it will continue to allow us to be if we will not deny the \nmarketplace the right to produce and the consumer the right of access. \nThis legislation understands that and this legislation is working to \nresolve that.\n  The State of my colleague, West Virginia, is a great producer of \ncoal. Coal has historically been America's number one source of \naffordable electricity. It currently powers half of America's \ngenerators, and at today's recovery rates our Nation has enough coal to \nkeep those plants running for 250 years. With rising demand, tight gas \nand oil supply, and an aging power infrastructure, it would be foolish \nto abandon our abundant coal resources.\n  So what do we need to meet our clean air standards? We need cleaner \nburning efficiencies from our coal. We need the technology that assures \nthe clean bed of the coal-fired facility so we can use this abundant \nresource and supply the system that is already there and assure that as \nwe grow other areas for producing electricity, that coal can grow right \nalong with it.\n  The men and women who work in the coal fields and who live in the \nStates that make their economy from coal production continue to \nrecognize that. This bill recognizes it.\n  We do not have coal in Idaho, but we have something else that is just \nas valuable to the electric grid, and that is hydropower. It is one of \nIdaho's greatest energy resources. It is one of the Pacific Northwest's \ngreatest energy resources. It makes up about 10 percent of the total \nsupply of electricity in this country. Yet, over the last decade we \nhave made it nearly impossible to relicense a hydro facility on a \nriver. For all of the environmental reasons that almost anyone can \nimagine, the argument is that particular impoundment should not have \nbeen put there in the first place, or it ought to be dramatically \nmodified to fit the environmental desires and needs of today, even at \nthe cost of bringing its production capability down.\n  I recognize there are very real environmental needs and that we are \nworking hard to return our rivers to a more natural state. At the same \ntime, we can't just walk away from an abundant, clean form of energy \nthat is renewable. No, we cannot. Nor should we.\n  The relicensing process we are dealing with needs to be fixed. \nCertainly, the hydro energy of today is clean. It is emission free. It \nis renewable. It meets all of those standards and, as a result of that, \nI and others have worked hard over the last 5 years to make sense out \nof a process that has become irrational. It can take as much as 2, 3 \nand 5 years' worth of bureaucratic red tape and tens of millions of \ndollars just to relicense, let alone retrofit and change the character \nof the generating facility for the purpose of making it more \nenvironmentally benign.\n  During the next 15 years, over half of all of the non-Federal hydro \ncapacity, over 30,000 megawatts of power, enough to serve 15 million \nhomes, must undergo the relicensing process. That includes about 296 \ndams in over 39 States. It is not just an Idaho or Oregon or Washington \nor California or Montana problem. It is an issue for the country. It is \nan issue for the Greater Colorado River system. It is an issue for the \ncountry. These great facilities ought to be relicensed and, where \nnecessary, retrofitting them to make them more environmentally benign.\n\n  But the process ought to be flexible. Clearly the operation of these \nfacilities ought to be flexible to allow optimum power production and \nto bring that into conformity with the necessary environmental needs of \nthat particular ecosystem and that particular river.\n  We have grown to enjoy our water impoundments in the arid West. While \nwe may call them reservoirs, some\n\n[[Page S5763]]\n\nview them as high-quality recreation areas and high-quality fisheries, \nmost assuredly, abundant power producing facilities.\n  As was true over 80 years ago when Congress passed Part 1 of the \nFederal Power Act, what we are striving for in this bill is to create \nthe balance necessary to assure that all of those 296 projects, where \nnecessary, and where they fit, can continue to operate and operate in a \nproductive fashion for the sake of our country.\n  Let me talk about a couple of other items that are important. One is \nnuclear. For 20 years someone has said to this country that electrical \ngeneration by nuclear energy or nuclear fission was wrong, that it was \ndangerous. Yet the nuclear facilities we have, have gone on operating \nuninterruptedly. They have been retrofitted and modernized. They have \ncontinued to produce. They make up nearly 20 percent of the total \nelectrical base of our country.\n  During the last period of high electrical prices, they became the \nleast cost economic producers. They were the base load that fueled the \ncountry, that assured that we would have the high-quality power we \nhave. All of a sudden there is a new respect for electrical energy \nproduced by nuclear power facilities.\n  We had a problem with the waste stream, the fuel rods that came out \nof the reactors, how they got handled, how they were stored, and did \nthey get reused. We debated for nearly a decade and we assessed, by a \ntax, the ratepayers of those utilities that were producing with \nnuclear, a tax to fund a waste system, a waste management system.\n  Just a year ago, in the Senate we finally confirmed part of the \nprocess of licensing a facility out in Nevada known as Yucca Mountain \nfor the storage of high-level waste. The Daschle-Bingaman bill we \ndebated this last year was a bill that called for much investment in \nresearch and development in our Nation's energy solutions but dealt \nvery little in this area. So much of the research done over the last \nseveral years to get us to a point where we could begin to consider as \na nation bringing more nuclear energy back into production has been at \nwork, and it has been at work in a laboratory in Idaho, the Idaho \nNational Engineering and Environmental Laboratory.\n  In this bill, for the first time, we speak about a new generation of \nnuclear generation--we call it generation 4--passive reactor systems, \nmuch safer, even than those that have been extraordinarily safe through \nthe decades. And at a time when we agree, and I hope collectively as a \nnation, that we are handling the waste stream and managing it in the \nappropriate fashion, if we really want abundant clean air in the growth \nrate of that, 45 percent over decades to come, an ever increasing \nportion of our electrical production needs to come from nuclear \ngeneration.\n  We think it is now time for this country to explore the new research \nand development, the new reactor designs that are safer, cleaner, in \nthe sense of their engineering, in the sense of their capacity to deal \nwith problems that might occur, although our history with nuclear \nreactors in this country has been one of safeness, but one of expert \nmanagement. Why? Because this Government, this Senate, years ago, \ncreated a Nuclear Regulatory Commission and managed it in a \ncomprehensive and sensible way.\n\n  There are a good many other issues about which I can talk. My \ncolleague from West Virginia and I teamed up some years ago, along with \nour colleague from Nebraska, to say that if there was going to be \nclimate change legislation that dealt with the emission of greenhouse \ngases, that we and the rest of the world must come together to do it. \nOur country should not penalize its economy or its industries by \nattempting to march down that road alone. We could accomplish it and \nnot destroy our economy if we would work innovatively to bring on the \nnew technologies to the marketplace of power in a way that made sense.\n  That is what this bill, S. 14, is all about. It is all about new \ntechnologies. It is all about producing an abundance of energy for our \nNation that is clean and ever increasingly cleaner than the past. It is \nabout clean air. It is about a recognition that if there is a change in \nour climate, that is a product of ever-increasing greenhouse gases in \nthe world, we want to do our part. But we are not going to deny \nourselves and our economy and our workforce the ability to produce by \nsimply shutting down; that we are smart enough through our technology \nand utilization of other forms of resources that we can generate an \nabundance of power and still be pragmatic and work through our problems \nwith climate change.\n  Our country needs a national energy policy. It needs to get back into \nthe business of producing energy. It needs to fill the market basket of \nenergy, full of all types of energy. Wind? Yes. In this bill and its \ncompanion tax bill we incentivize wind farmers and the use of the new \nturbines in the production of electrical power through wind. What about \nphotovoltaics or the sun? We incentivize that.\n  We have not, through this legislation, denied any element of the \nmarketplace or any area of technology access to the production of \nelectrical energy or the supply of energy for our country. Our country \nand our economy runs on energy. Every moment of the day we use more \nenergy on a per capita basis than any other nation in the world. It is \nnot by accident that we are the richest nation in the world. I say that \nwith great pride. We have worked hard over the years. We have relied on \nthe free market system. We have relied on a government that has been \nreasonable and moderate in its regulations and balanced in how it \napplies those regulations to all forms of the producing entities of our \neconomy. And we have always based that on an adequate and abundant and \na relatively inexpensive supply of energy.\n  When the gas prices go up 10 or 12 cents a gallon at the pump, that \nis several dollars, for every time the car is filled up, that is spent \non energy and denied to the breakfast table of the family or to the \ndisposable income of the family or to the college trust fund of the \nfamily or any of the things for which the American family wants to use \ntheir collective resources.\n  We ought to work constantly as a government and as a Senate to make \nsure those kinds of spikes or run-ups in price do not happen, whether \nit is at the pump or at the electrical meter or anywhere else in our \nsociety. We can do that with the passage of this legislation by the \nrecognition that government can play a role in the assistance of the \nproduction of an abundant supply of energy to our country. S. 14 just \nhas not happened. S. 14 is a demand of the marketplace of our country \nsaying: Supply us with an abundant supply of energy, and we will \nproduce for you and for generations to come untold wealth and the \nAmerican dream.\n  I am proud of that. I am proud of our history. I trust this Senate, \nover the course of the next several weeks in debating this legislation, \nwill in the end have one important goal in mind: That is to pass a \nnational energy policy for our country that recognizes now and in the \nfuture that the basis of this great country's strength and its wealth \nis the ability to consume clean, high-quality energy at reasonable \nprices.\n  That is what S. 14 is all about. That is why we have worked as hard \nas we have, and I applaud Senator Domenici for his effort in the \nproduction of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5763-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5763-S5764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A TROUBLING SPEECH\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in my 50 years as a Member of Congress, I \nhave had the privilege to witness the defining rhetorical moments of a \nnumber of American Presidents. I have listened spellbound to the \nsoaring oratory of John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. I have listened \ngrimly to the painful soul-searching of Lyndon Johnson and Richard \nNixon.\n  Presidential speeches are an important marker of any President's \nlegacy. These are the tangible moments that history seizes upon and \nrecords for posterity. For this reason, I was deeply troubled by both \nthe content and the context of President Bush's remarks to the American \npeople last week marking the end of the combat phase of the war in \nIraq. As I watched the President's fighter jet swoop down onto the deck \nof the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, I could not help but contrast \nthe reported simple dignity of President Lincoln at Gettysburg with the\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\nflamboyant showmanship of President Bush aboard the USS Abraham \nLincoln.\n  President Bush's address to the American people announcing combat \nvictory in Iraq deserved to be marked with solemnity, not extravagance; \nwith gratitude to God, not self-congratulatory gestures. American blood \nhas been shed on foreign soil in defense of the President's policies. \nThis is not some made-for-TV backdrop for a campaign commercial. This \nis real life, and real lives have been lost. To me, it is an affront to \nthe Americans killed or injured in Iraq for the President to exploit \nthe trappings of war for the momentary spectacle of a speech. I do not \nbegrudge his salute to America's warriors aboard the carrier Lincoln, \nfor they have performed bravely and skillfully, as have their \ncountrymen still in Iraq, but I do question the motives of a deskbound \nPresident who assumes the garb of a warrior for the purposes of a \nspeech.\n  As I watched the President's speech before the great banner \nproclaiming ``Mission Accomplished,'' I could not help but be reminded \nof the tobacco barns of my youth, which served as country road \nadvertising backdrops for the slogans of chewing tobacco purveyors. I \nam loath to think of an aircraft carrier being used as an advertising \nbackdrop for a Presidential political slogan, and yet that is what I \nsaw.\n  What I heard the President say also disturbed me. It may make for \ngrand theater to describe Saddam Hussein as an ally of al-Qaida or to \ncharacterize the fall of Baghdad as a victory in the war on terror, but \nstirring rhetoric does not necessarily reflect sobering reality. Not \none of the 19 September 11th hijackers was an Iraqi. In fact, there is \nnot a shred of evidence to link the September 11 attack--at least as of \nthis date--on the United States to Iraq. There is no doubt in my mind \nthat Saddam Hussein was an evil despot who brought great suffering to \nthe Iraqi people, and there is no doubt in my mind that he encouraged \nand rewarded acts of terrorism against Israel. But his crimes are not \nthose of Osama bin Laden, and bringing Saddam Hussein to justice will \nnot bring justice to the victims of 9/11. The United States has made \ngreat progress in its efforts to disrupt and destroy the al-Qaida \nterror network. We can take solace and satisfaction in that fact. We \nshould not risk tarnishing those very real accomplishments by \ntrumpeting victory in Iraq as a victory over Osama bin Laden.\n  We are reminded in the gospel of Saint Luke, ``For unto whomsoever \nmuch is given, of him shall be much required.'' Surely the same can be \nsaid of any American President. We expect--nay, demand--that our \nleaders be scrupulous in the truth and faithful to the facts. We do not \nseek theatrics or hyperbole. We do not require the stage management of \nour victories. The men and women of the United States military are to \nbe saluted for their valor and sacrifice in Iraq. Their heroics and \nquiet resolve speak for themselves. The prowess and professionalism of \nAmerica's military forces do not need to be embellished by the gaudy \nexcesses of a political campaign.\n  War is not theater, and victory is not a campaign slogan. I join with \nthe President and all Americans in expressing heartfelt thanks and \ngratitude to our men and women in uniform for their service to our \ncountry, and for the sacrifices that they have made on our behalf. But \non this point I differ with the President: I believe that our military \nforces deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and not used as \nstage props to embellish a Presidential speech.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5764-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5764-S5765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Today the Senate continues a process that began almost \n2 years ago. At that time, the Senate Energy Committee held and \ncompleted the first of several planned mark-up dates with the goal of \nputting together a comprehensive energy bill. After a number of \npostponements due to circumstances beyond our control, we engaged in 2 \nmonths of debate on the Senate floor last spring and produced a bill by \na vote of 88 to 11.\n  Unfortunately, the House and Senate were unable to resolve their \ndifferences in a conference so we find ourselves once again tasked with \nthe formidable challenge of developing an energy policy for the Nation.\n  I am pleased to report that after 2 weeks of mark-ups under the \nleadership of Chairman Domenici and the ranking member, Senator \nBingaman, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has lived \nup to its duty by reporting a comprehensive energy bill to the Senate \nfor consideration.\n  So, the challenge of completing a comprehensive energy bill is once \nagain before the Senate. There are likely to be additional obstacles \nbefore us along the way. The question is can we overcome them to \ncomplete our duty? It was Woodrow Wilson who once said:\n\n       The only use of an obstacle is to be overcome. All that an \n     obstacle does with brave men is, not to frighten them, but to \n     challenge them.\n\n  So the challenge is now before us.\n  This legislation does an excellent job of utilizing the variety of \nenergy options available to the country particularly from a production \nstandpoint. It is up to the full Senate to balance this with some \nmeaningful conservation measures.\n  We had a number of hearings in the Energy Committee earlier this year \nto address the volatility we face in the price and supply of both oil \nand gas. Since we import 60 percent of the oil we consume, the price of \noil is often at the mercy of world events such as the political turmoil \nin other countries--Venezuela and Nigeria--that we rely on for imports. \nWe can and should produce more at home but must simply acknowledge that \nreducing the amount of oil we consume has to be part of the equation.\n\n  On the other hand, the natural gas market is quite a different \npicture.\n  Our country currently produces 84 percent of the natural gas we \nconsume. However, there is a gap looming on the horizon. The energy \ninformation forecasts that the demand for natural gas will increase by \n30 percent in the United States over the next 15 years, with supplies \navailable to meet 70 percent of this need.\n  The facts are clear: our natural gas market is in a state of \ntransition. Industries across the country that rely on natural gas as \nfeedstock such as the chemical and fertilizer industries are confronted \nwith high pries which is translating into the loss of jobs. We need to \nact now.\n  Most of the natural gas supply sources that have been offered as \nsolutions, such as the natural gas pipeline from Alaska, are medium to \nlong term options. However, in the bill before us today there is a \nprovision which is one of the few, if only, short term options, we \nreally have to affect the market. This provision builds on a recent \nrule proposed by the department of Interior providing incentives for \ndeep gas production from wells in shallow water areas that have already \nbeen leased. Given the projections for potential supply in these areas, \nthe opportunity to deliver significant new natural gas production to \nthe market in order to stabilize prices is simply too good an \nopportunity to pass up.\n  Another significant program authorized in the oil and gas title of \nthis bill would take the step of recognizing, for the first time, the \nimpacts to oil-and gas-producing states such as Alaska, Texas, \nLouisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, from the development that takes \nplace on the outer continental shelf off of their respective \ncoastlines.\n  With less and less areas available for production, and the deepwaters \nof the gulf of Mexico still a hotspot for the foreseeable future, it is \ntime for Congress and the Federal Government to recognize the \nimportance of the development that has been occurring and continues to \ntake place off the shores of Louisiana and Texas and compensate those \nStates for their role in providing the Nation's energy supply.\n\n  If our policy in this country is going to continue to defer to a \nState's wishes\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\nas to whether oil and gas development takes place off its coast, then \nthe least we should do is compensate those few States--Alaska, Texas, \nLouisiana, Mississippi and Alabama--for the duty they preform in \nsupplying this Nation with a significant amount of the oil and gas it \nneeds to function. After all, the OCS is now the largest producing area \nin the United States as more than 25 percent of both the Nation's oil \nand natural gas is expected to be produced from the OCS in 2003. In \nfact, the OCS is the largest single source of oil for the entire U.S., \nsurpassing even Saudi Arabia.\n  Nuclear energy now provides approximately one-fifth of all electric \npower used in this country, but does so without compromising our air \nquality. It is the largest clear air source of electricity in the \nNation today, generating two-thirds of all emission-free electricity. \nNuclear power is perhaps unique among our supply options, as there is a \nlarge potential for expansion in the relative near term with little \ndownside in terms of environmental quality or increased reliance on \nforeign fuel sources.\n  For future generations of Americans whose reliance on electricity \nwill increase--and who rightfully want a cleaner environment--nuclear \nenergy is an essential partner in our energy and environmental policy. \nThe provisions contained in this title of the bill--renewal of Price-\nAnderson, incentives for the construction of new base-load nuclear \nplants, and the emphasis on encouraging hydrogen co-generation from \nnuclear power--recognize that nuclear energy is a vital component of \nour energy portfolio.\n  One of the most contentious debates we will engage in over the next \nseveral weeks involves the issue of electricity. We are confronting an \nindustry that is facing difficult times from the dysfunction of \nCalifornia's market to a loss of market capitalization.\n\n  Amid this turmoil, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has \nproposed sweeping, untested changes to the business of providing basic \nand essential electric service to our constituents. Instead, we need to \nlegislate with a caution not reflected by FERC's standard market \ndesign, SMD. While the bill before us took the important step of \ndelaying any further action on SMD until January of 2005, there are a \nnumber of areas where I believe the electricity provisions before us \ncome up short in addressing the shortcomings of SMD.\n  First, the State-Federal jurisdictional divide, which has worked \nexceedingly well in Louisiana to provide low-cost and reliable electric \nservice, is jeopardized by the SMD proposal.\n  Second, I am concerned about the potential for increased rates for my \nretail customers as a result of the costs of accommodating the \n``merchant generation'' that, over the past several years, has been \nseeking to connect to the electric grid in the southeast. While it has \nadded to the competition, it is also straining the grid, and under FERC \npolicy may end up straining the pocketbooks of regular homeowners who \nwould be forced to subsidize the interconnection and transmission \ncosts.\n  Lastly, I remain concerned that we need more investment in \ntransmission facilities, but do not have sufficient policies to \nencourage it. Transmission is critical to sustaining wholesale markets. \nI had hoped that the electricity title of this bill would have been \nreported out of committee with much-needed participant funding language \nin order to significantly increase transmission investment.\n  When we turn to electricity during this debate, I intend to offer \nseveral amendments to address these concerns.\n  We now realize that perhaps the best alternative to oil and gas \nproduction in this country is conservation. As our economy continues to \ngrow so does our demand for energy. While we have made some noteworthy \nstrides on the conversation front there are miles to go. When we talk \nabout our dependence on oil in this country we have to acknowledge that \nthere is no alternative that matches oil for cheapness and convenience. \nWhile we should continue to produce oil in this country where we can \nthat alone cannot be the answer. With over 60 percent of our daily oil \nconsumption coming from the transportation sector, we have to start \nthere. The challenge to this body is how to strike a sensible balance \nby establishing a reasonable increase in fuel economy standards that \nwill not compromise vehicle safety, unduly increase cost and \nsignificantly limit consumer's choices.\n  I think every member probably realizes the importance of ultimately \nchanging the ``coinage'' of energy in the transportation sector from \noil to something else.\n\n  This bill addresses that something else by authorizing about $3.6 \nbillion for an increase in hydrogen fuel research and development, \ndemonstration projects, federal purchase requirements, and specific \ngoals to move hydrogen vehicles out of laboratories and onto the \nnation's roads. A hydrogen economy that lessens our dependence on \nforeign oil is within our grasp.\n  During markup before the committee, I supported what amounts to a \nreasonable renewable portfolio standard. I continue to believe that it \nis a commonsense approach to ensure that renewable sources of energy--\nwind and solar--be a part of our electricity supply. Renewable energy \nis homegrown and does not need to be bought from foreign markets. The \nadvantages of our ability to domestically produce renewables are \nobvious: protection for consumers from the prospect of supply \ninterruptions outside the region or country which we cannot control.\n  It frustrates me to hear people talk about climate change as \nsomething that we can simply adapt to--no big deal. I can assure \neveryone here, changing climate is a big deal for Louisiana. My state \ncontinues to lose its coastline and critical wetlands every year. We \nalready feel the human impact and economic loss from hurricanes every \nyear. There are some that think these storms could get worse with \nglobal warming, although the scientific jury is still out. We owe it to \nour constituents and to our colleagues in the Senate to give our best \nefforts, in this bill, to come up with a commonsense and effective \npolicies to deal with this threat.\n  For conclusion, the challenge before us now is to acknowledge how \nmuch we depend on these traditional fossil fuels--our Nation still \nrelies on oil and gas for 65 percent of the energy it consumes. That is \nnot going to change overnight. At the same time, we must continue to \nmake significant strides toward using the impressive diversity of \nenergy sources we have at our disposal including nuclear and renewable \nenergy. Also, if we continue to ignore the importance of conservation \nwe do so at our own peril.\n  With a little balance and common sense, we can make the diversity of \nsupply available in this country go a long way. All of the supply \noptions available to our country have a substantial role to play in our \nfuture energy mix. However, none by themselves is the answer.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina).

Mr. President, in 1953, Congress first proclaimed May 6 \nas National Teacher Day. Our Nation has changed in many ways over the \npast 50 years; however some things have remained the same. Teachers \nhave always been mentors and role models to students and have made \nlasting contributions to so many students' lives.\n  Today teachers face greater demands and more diverse student bodies. \nToo often, they also face inadequate pay and unacceptable teaching \nenvironments. In a time of fiscal uncertainty, when budgets are \nshrinking and teachers have to rely on fewer resources, they still do \nthe best they can to help their students succeed.\n  Little relief is in sight. Communities across the country will need \nto hire an additional two million teachers over the next 10 years to \ndeal with rising student enrollments and teacher retirements. Congress \nmust do more to help communities recruit promising teacher candidates. \nWe can provide new teachers with trained mentors who will help them not \nonly to survive but to thrive in the classroom. We can do more to see \nthat all teachers and principals have the on-going training they need \nin order to keep up with modern technology and modern research.\n  In addition, we must find better ways to increase their pay and \nimprove their working environments. It is imperative that we treat all \nteachers with the respect that they deserve. Teachers have one of the \nmost important jobs of all, and we must support them every step of the \nway.\n  On this special day, we thank the 3 million public school teachers \nacross the country who work so hard each and every day to do their job. \nThey truly are our community heroes and our national heroes. They have \none of the most difficult jobs of all educating the young men and woman \nwho are our Nation's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5766-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5766-S5768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, now that President Bush has declared an end \nto combat operations in Iraq, it is important that we take a moment to \npay tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. \nAs we celebrate the swift and stunning victory in Iraq achieved by our \nmen and women in uniform, we must be careful not to forget the pain and \nloss of those families whose loved ones fell on the field of battle.\n  In my home State of Indiana, seven families have suffered the \ndevastating loss of a loved one during this relatively brief military \ncampaign. Seven truly fine young men will not be coming home to victory \nparades and joyful reunions. This Nation takes rightful pride in the \nextraordinary accomplishments of our Armed Forces, and we rejoice that \nthe war has come to such a quick end. But we must always temper these \nfeelings with the knowledge that this victory did not come cheaply.\n  Today, I would like to pay tribute to those from Indiana who made the \nultimate sacrifice in this war.\n  Indiana National Guard Specialist Brian Clemens of Kokomo, was the \nState's first casualty of this war. Specialist Clemens, who was 19, \ndied in Kuwait on February 6--six weeks before the ground attack into \nKuwait got under way. He was riding in a Humvee which overturned. He \nwas serving with the 1st Battalion, 293d Infantry, one of two Indiana \nNational Guard units mobilized to provide a robust force protection \npresence in the Persian Gulf. The units' 1,320 soldiers are guarding \nU.S. military installations and supply lines in Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar.\n  Specialist Clemens was an Eagle Scout and a graduate of Maconaquah \nHigh School, where he was a dedicated member of the wrestling team. \nBefore being called to active duty, he was working at Wal-Mart and \nsaving money to enroll in college. He is survived by his mother and \nstepfather, Cathy and Terry McCreay of Kokomo, and his father, Robert \nClemens of Dayton, OH. Many of Brian's friends are still in the Persian \nGulf region, and they have memorialized his death by wearing black \nwristbands.\n  Brian Clemens will be missed.\n  Marine Lance Corporal David Fribley, who grew up in Warsaw, IN, was \nkilled on March 23. He was riding in an armored vehicle that \nencountered\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\na group of Iraqi soldiers waiving a white flag. The Iraqis moved close \nand then suddenly opened fire. A rocket-propelled grenade exploded \nagainst his vehicle and he was killed. Eight other Marines in his unit \nwere also killed in that encounter.\n  Lance Corporal Fribley was 26 years old when he died. He had been a \nMarine for not quite a year. The middle child of Gary and Linda \nFribley, he decided to enlist after 9/11 because he wanted to do \nsomething for his country. He didn't have to go. His decision came just \nmonths after he graduated from Indiana State University, and he had a \ngood job as a recreation director in a retirement home complex.\n  But Lance Corporal Fribley felt he had a duty to serve his country. \nIn high school, he had lettered in football and track all four years. \nOne of his football coaches describes him as the poster boy for Marine \nCorps commercials--tall, strong and unrelenting in his work ethic.\n  Warsaw, IN, is a small and tightly-knit community of tree-lined \nstreets and well-kept homes. Lance Corporal Fribley's funeral was held \nin the high school gym because a large crowd was expected. Every seat \nwas filled. Many of the town's military veterans put on their old \nuniforms and medals and lined the streets to render a salute to David's \nflag-draped coffin as it passed by.\n  David Fribley will be missed.\n  Army Specialist Gregory Sanders, of Hobart, IN, was killed by a \nsniper's bullet on March 24. He was a tank crewman assigned to the \nThird Infantry Division. Greg was 19 when he died. Specialist Sanders \njoined the Army shortly after graduating from Hobart High School, where \nhe had been captain of the cross-country team. He had always wanted to \nbe in the military, just like his dad, Richard, who died of a heart \nattack when Specialist Sanders was 15.\n  His mother, Leslie Sanders, told the local newspaper her earliest \nmemory of her son was watching him play in a backyard sandbox with \nplastic toy soldiers. Dig a little and you can still find some of his \nsoldiers. It was only 12 years ago. When residents of the town of \nHobart learned of his death, they conducted a special candlelight \nservice in his memory in front of the Doughboy Statue in the center of \ntown. They laid flowers, candles, ribbons and wreaths all around the \nstatue, creating an impromptu monument to the town's fallen soldier.\n  Specialist Sanders leaves behind a wife, Ruthann, and a 14-month-old \ndaughter, Gwendolyn. He was buried in Calumet Park Cemetery near \nMerrillville next to his father.\n  Greg Sanders will be missed.\n  Specialist William A. Jeffries of the Indiana National Guard died \nMarch 31 after falling ill in Kuwait, where his unit was guarding U.S. \nmilitary bases. He was 39 years old. Doctors told his family he died in \na Navy hospital in Spain of a pulmonary embolism and acute \npancreatitis.\n  Specialist Jeffries lived in Evansville, IN, with his wife, B.J. \nUnusually tall at 6-foot-5, he was known for his gentle nature. He had \ngraduated from Reitz High School in 1982 and then served 10 years on \nactive duty in the Air Force. Many of Indiana's National Guard members \nhave prior service. Not only do they continue serving their country in \nuniform, but they find a camaraderie that just does not exist in \ncivilian life.\n  Indiana is very proud of the contribution its National Guard units \nare making to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Specialist Jeffries' unit was \none of two Indiana National Guard infantry battalions mobilized to \nprovide a robust force protection presence in the Persian Gulf. The \nunits' 1,320 soldiers are guarding U.S. military installations and \nsupply lines in Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar.\n  Just before his battalion departed for Kuwait, Specialist Jeffries \nwas given emergency leave to attend the funeral of his father, Kenneth. \nAlthough it was a sad occasion, it brought him together with his \nmother, Marie, and five older brothers for the first time in many \nyears.\n  William Jeffries will be missed.\n  Marine Sergeant Duane Rios of Griffith, IN, was killed on April 4 \nduring a firefight on the outskirts of Baghdad. He was 25 years old and \nthe leader of a squad of combat engineers trained to do such things as \nbuild roads and bridges, clear minefields and handle explosives.\n  Sergeant Rios joined the Marines after graduating from Griffith High \nSchool in 1996, and he thrived on the experience. He and his wife, \nErica, who had been his high school sweetheart, were making a good life \ntogether in San Clemente, CA, close to Camp Pendleton where he was \nstationed.\n  During his high school years in Griffith, Sergeant Rios lived with \nhis late grandmother. He was a popular student remembered by his \nteachers as having an infectious smile. He last spoke to Erica by \ntelephone the day after Valentine's Day. He told her he loved her and \nmissed her and that the only other thing he needed was a hot shower.\n  On the day of his funeral in Griffith, some 500 mourners gathered at \nSt. Mary Roman Catholic Church. Many had to stand outside. The Griffith \nand Highland fire departments unfurled a giant American Flag across \nBroad Street, and police from departments all across northwest Indiana \ntook part in the funeral procession.\n  Duane Rios will be missed.\n  Army Private First Class Jason M. Meyer, whose father, Loren Meyer, \nlives in South Bend, died on April 8 from wounds suffered during the \nfighting at Baghdad International Airport. Army investigators believe \nhe was struck by an errant round fired from an Abrams tank. The round \nstruck a building and ricocheted into his vehicle.\n  PFC Meyer, 23, died one week after he and his wife, Melissa, had \nmarked their first wedding anniversary. He was a combat engineer with \nBravo Company, 11th Engineers, 3rd Infantry Division, and drove an \narmored personnel carrier during the division's now famous lightning \ndrive from Kuwait to Baghdad.\n  In 1999, PFC Meyer graduated from high school in Howell, MI, where he \nlived with his mother, Kathleen Worthington, and joined the Army two \nyears later. He met his wife at a Halloween corn maze three years ago. \nShe told a local newspaper that she will remember her husband for his \never-present sense of humor, which always kept her laughing. The last \ntime she talked to him was by telephone was in late February while his \nunit was in Kuwait. He reported that he and his buddies had adopted a \nthree-foot lizard as their pet, and that they were feeding it Meals \nReady to Eat.\n  Jason was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military \nhonors. During the ceremony Melissa was presented with her husband's \nPurple Heart and Bronze Star medals.\n  Jason Meyer will be missed.\n  Army Reserve Specialist Roy Buckley of Portage died on April 22 from \ninjuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident in Baghdad. A fuel truck \ndriver, he was less than a month away from his 25th birthday when he \ndied.\n  He was a member of the 685th Transportation Company of Hobart, IN, \nwhose 170 members, mostly heavy truck drivers, were mobilized to \nprovide support for the 3rd Infantry Division. In civilian life, he \nworked at Midwest Steel, and his goal was to become a police officer.\n  Specialist Buckley was engaged to another member of his Army Reserve \nunit, Jenina Bellina, and they planned to marry soon after they \nreturned from the Persian Gulf.\n  He had called his mother, Janie Espinoza, on Easter Sunday and \nspeculated that he might even be home to see her by Mother's Day. In \naddition to his mother, he is survived by two brothers, a sister and a \n6-year-old daughter.\n  Roy Buckley will be missed.\n  Our hearts go out to all of these families. We shall all mourn for \nthe loss of these seven fine young men. It is my hope that these \nfamilies will take comfort in knowing that their young men gave their \nlives to a noble and worthy cause--freeing the Iraqi people from a \nbrutal dictator and making the world a safer place for all Americans.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to express our nation's \nthanks and gratitude to a young man and his family from Rock Springs, \nWY. On April 14, Private First Class Joseph Mayek was killed while \nserving in Iraq. PFC Mayek was critically wounded by an armor piercing \nround that appears to have been discharged from an M2 Bradley fighting \nvehicle. While the circumstances of this incident are still\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\nunder investigation, I hope the final report will provide information \nthat can help us understand how this happened.\n  PFC Mayek was a vibrant young man who loved being outdoors and \nenjoyed sports. During his senior year at Rock Springs High School, \nJoseph played split end and cornerback for high school football team. \nSoon after graduating in 2001, he joined the United States Army. Upon \ncompletion of basic training he was assigned to C Company, 2nd \nBattalion, 6th Infantry Regiment in Germany.\n  President Bush recently addressed the Nation to declare victory in \nthe Battle for Iraq. This was a monumental task accomplished by the \ndedicated people and their families who serve in our Armed Forces. \nAmerica's men and women who answer the call of service and wear our \nNation's uniform deserve respect and recognition for the load that they \nalone must bear. Our people put everything on the line everyday, and \nbecause of these folks, our nation is more secure and remains strong in \nthe face of danger.\n  We say goodbye to a son, a soldier and an American. Our Nation pays \nits deepest respect to Private First Class Mayek for his courage, his \nlove of country and his sacrifice, so that we may remain free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5768-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN BURMA\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the gross \nviolations of human and religious rights in Burma. Dr. Salai Tun Than, \na University of Wisconsin alumni, who was released over the weekend in \nBurma, initiated a hunger strike protesting the human and religious \nrights violations at the prison where he was held. Dr. Tun Than had \nbeen serving a 7-year prison sentence in Burma for handing out copies \nof a petition demanding political reforms.\n  Dr. Tun Than, 75, has severe health problems that required medical \ntreatment, which he was not granted. The conditions that he and other \nprisoners endured were violations of international human rights laws. \nRestrictions on communications between prisoners, unsanitary prison \nconditions and forced ``hooding'' as prisoners were transported outside \nare examples of the violations. As a Christian, Dr. Tun Than also was \nprotesting violations in religious freedom which included not being \nallowed a Bible or to receive Communion.\n  During my Senate career I have been an advocate for human rights and \nreligious freedoms for every individual across the globe. I am saddened \nby the conditions in which Dr. Tun Than and other prisoners in Burma \nhave had to live. It is my hope that the Burmese Government will \nrecognize religious and human rights, not only to their prisoners, but \nto their general populace as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5768-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred October 27, \n1992, in Sasebo, Japan. Terry M. Helvey, an airman apprentice in the \nU.S. Navy, and Amn Charles E. Vins beat PO Allen Schindler to death in \na public restroom. After spotting Schindler, who was known to be gay, \noutside a bar, Helvey and Vins followed him into a public restroom so \nthat they could ``beat him up,'' according to Vins. The two brutally \nkicked and punched Schindler to death on the restroom floor. Helvey and \nVins beat Schindler so badly that a Navy pathologist described his \ninjuries as ``more consistent with a high-speed automobile accident or \nlow-speed airplane crash.''\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5768-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEVELOPMENTS IN BURUNDI\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to the situation in the Central African country of Burundi, \nwhere a remarkable step has been taken to end that country's brutal \ncivil war. Last week, President Pierre Buyoya voluntarily ceded power \nto Domitien Ndayizeye, who will now lead the country through the second \nhalf of a 3-year transitional power-sharing government. This orderly \ntransfer of power, conducted in compliance with the Arusha Accords \nsigned in 2000, is an important symbol of ethnic reconciliation, as a \nTutsi President with a Hutu Vice President gives way to a Hutu head of \nstate with a Tutsi Vice President. An African Union force is slated to \nhelp provide stability during this transitional period. This is a \ndevelopment to be celebrated, and the United Nations Security Council \nwas right to praise this milestone achievement.\n  But much more needs to be done. Rather than being satisfied with \nPresident Ndayizeye's inauguration, the people of Burundi and the \ninternational community should seize on this moment as a catalyst for \nmore energetic and focused efforts to bring Burundi out of crisis. A \ncomprehensive cease-fire among all parties to the conflict is still not \nin place. Little progress has been made to date toward comprehensively \nreforming the security services to reflect a multiethnic society. \nBurundi's future will also depend upon increasing respect for basic \nhuman rights, ending the climate of impunity in which these rights have \nbeen violated, and establishing viable mechanisms for holding those \nresponsible for abuses accountable for their actions. The international \ncommunity must maintain an engaged policy that both supports these \nreforms and pressures those who resist them.\n  Most importantly, the international community and the Burundian \nleadership must take this opportunity to establish a firm relationship \nbetween positive developments in the political sphere and the \nconditions of the Burundian people, who languish, sometimes in grave \nand consistent insecurity, and often in desperate humanitarian crisis. \nAbject poverty, a dramatic decline in primary school enrollment, \nsoaring infant mortality rates, and displacement on a massive scale \ncharacterize the situation of Burundian society. If we allow paper \nagreements and political milestones to remain disconnected from \nconcrete improvements for the people of Burundi, we are only empowering \nthe spoilers in this process, and only encouraging the kind of hideous \nviolence that has become all too common in Central Africa.\n  Nine years ago Burundi's neighbor erupted in genocide. Ongoing \nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has cost the lives of \nmillions. Crises spill across borders, poisoning the prospects for \nprogress throughout the region, and creating lucrative opportunities \nfor international criminals. Burundi may be small, but its suffering is \ngreat, and its capacity to help or hinder efforts to stabilize a vast \nswathe of Africa should not be underestimated. We know what the \nconsequences of indifference are; we have seen them in the millions \ndead, displaced, mourning and grieving. For a brief moment, Burundi has \ncaptured global attention. We should not look away again; the stakes \nare too high.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5768-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5768-S5769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PROTECT ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this child-abduction legislation is \nimportant and needed. According to the Justice Department, 2,200 \nchildren are reported missing each day. There are approximately 114,600 \nattempted abductions by strangers every year, and between 3,000 and \n5,000 of these attempts are successful.\n  Each child abduction is a tragedy. Last year, I met with two of my \nconstituents, John and Magi Bish. On June 27, 2000, their daughter \nMolly Ann Bish, a 16-year-old lifeguard, disappeared from her life-\nguarding post at Comins Pond in Walden, MA. Molly's family and friends \ncontinue to search for her. The Bish family is also working to raise \nawareness about this important issue. They started the first Missing \nChildren's Day in Massachusetts. They\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\nalso established the Molly Bish Foundation to provide services to \nchildren and families across our State and the New England area. John \nand Magi Bish have shown extraordinary courage and perseverance in the \nface of an overwhelming loss.\n  The legislation addresses the problem of child abductions in several \nways, and I supported it. It establishes a national AMBER Alert system \nto help locate abducted children, and it gives prosecutors major new \ntools to address these terrifying crimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5769-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5769-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5769-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 1298.

A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to ensure an adequate level of commodity purchases under the school \nlunch program; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators \nCraig, Stabenow, and Leahy, to introduce the ``Commodity Distribution \nAct of 2003.'' Senator Craig and I have introduced similar legislation \nin the past, and while it is unfortunate that this legislation is \nnecessary, we are pleased to meet the need that currently exists.\n  In 1999, Congress enacted the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives \nImprovement Act, which amended the School Lunch Act to require the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture to count the value of bonus \ncommodities when it determines the total amount of commodity assistance \nprovided to schools. This change meant a $500 million budget cut to the \nschool lunch program over a 9-year period.\n  Senator Craig and I have been successful since the passage of the \nTicket to Work Act in preventing this cut from affecting the School \nLunch Program for the past 4 years. However, a provision included in \nthe 2002 Farm Bill will expire the end of this fiscal year, leaving the \nschool lunch program vulnerable to cut of over $50 million per year \nover the next 5 years.\n  Our legislation, the Commodity Distribution Act of 2003, would \nprevent this devastating cut to the school lunch program. While not \nlarge in overall budget terms, $50 million in commodities for school \nlunch programs across the country means a great deal in delivering \nquality meals to our children every day. It also means a great deal to \nthe agricultural producers who benefit from having these commodities \ntaken out of the marketplace, and used for a valuable purpose.\n  Our Nation faces a unique situation when it comes to feeding our \nNation's children. We live in a country where both hunger and obesity \nco-exist among the children served by our important nutrition programs. \nWe can and must form policy that addresses both of these problems.\n  The legislation that Senators Craig, Stabenow, and Leahy, and I are \nintroducing today takes an important first step in addressing this \nunique situation by maintaining the level of commodity support our \nschool districts receive to run their school lunch programs. There \ncould be no worse time to take away these valuable assets to their \nprograms.\n  The Commodity Distribution Act continues the dual purpose of our \nschool lunch program--supporting American agriculture, while delivering \nnutritious food to our Nation's children.\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 996\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commodity Distribution Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. COMMODITY PURCHASES UNDER SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 6(e) of the Richard B. Russell National School \n     Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1755(e)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) by striking ``in the form of'' and all that follows \n     through ``(A) commodity assistance'' and inserting ``in the \n     form of commodity assistance'';\n       (B) by striking ``; or'' and inserting a period; and\n       (C) by striking subparagraph (B); and\n       (2) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) by striking ``the Secretary shall, to the extent \n     necessary,'' and inserting ``the Secretary--\n       ``(A) shall, to the extent necessary,'';\n       (B) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; \n     and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) shall not use commodities provided under the \n     authority of any other Act to meet the requirement for the \n     school year.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act take effect on \n     October 1, 2003.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator \nJohnson in introducing the Commodity Distribution Act of 2003.\n  Children are our future. I strongly believe each child deserves at \nleast one warm, nutritious meal every day. I stand before you today \nwith a new bill that will restore $500 million to the School Lunch \nProgram. The positive impacts of this program are endless. Children \nshould not have to pay the price of not having enough money for food.\n  Originally enacted in 1946, the school launch program set goals to \nimprove children's nutrition, increase low-income children's access to \nnutritious meals, and to help support the agricultural industry. A \nfamily of four has to have an income at or below 130 percent of the \nFederal poverty level to qualify for a free lunch. The income for these \nfamilies is tragically low. Congress has a role in providing these \nchildren with assistance their families cannot provide.\n  In 1999, Congress enacted the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives \nImprovement Act. This legislation amended the School Lunch Act to \nrequire the United States Department of Agriculture to count the value \nof bonus commodities when it determines the total amount of commodity \nassistance provided to schools. This change continues to provide a $500 \nmillion budget cut for the school lunch program over its 9-year \nprojection.\n  In 2001, the school lunch program comprised over 90 percent of \nschools, with some 99,000 public and private schools enrolling \napproximately 50 million children. Today over 28 million children \nreceive free or low-cost lunches every school day. Each State and \nmillions of children are affected. This program provides a basic \nrequirement of food for needy children.\n  The 2002 Farm Bill passed almost a full year ago included language \nthat extended this authorization language until the end of this fiscal \nyear. Without Congressional action, $50 million will be cut from the \nfood budget for school districts. This legislation would further extend \nthis support through 2007, when the Richard B. Russell National School \nLunch act is scheduled for reauthorization.\n  It is my belief that no child should be without food. The Commodity \nDistribution Act of 2003 would ensure that schools receive the full \nvalue of entitlement commodity assistance, and allow the School Lunch \nProgram to continue to meet its dual purpose of supporting American \nagriculture when it needs it most while providing nutritious food to \nschools across the country. I urge members to support this bill, \nsupport children, and support our future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            By Mr. DOMENICI:\n\n  S. 997. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out \ncritical restoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, those of us privileged to represent our \nfellow citizens on this hallowed floor get far too few opportunities to \nhelp usher in visionary projects that can potentially transform \ncommunities, both of man and of nature. I rise today to tell you about \na project that has been discussed before on this floor; I bring it to \nyour attention again because I believe it's a project worth doing and \nworth doing well. It concerns one of New Mexico's unique natural \ntreasures: the Middle Rio Grande Bosque.\n  According to an old Chinese Proverb, ``if you are thinking 1 year \nahead, sow seed. If you are thinking 10 years ahead, plant a tree. If \nyou are thinking 100 years ahead, educate the people.'' The bill I am \nintroducing today encompasses the wisdom of this proverb.\n  Two years ago, I joined the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District \nand the Army Corps of Engineers in unveiling a vision for the Bosque \nthat would rehabilitate and restore this long neglected treasure of the \nSouthwest. I return here today to begin implementing that vision.\n  The Albuquerque metropolitan area is the largest concentration of \npeople in New Mexico. It is also the home to the irreplaceable riparian \nforest which runs through the heart of the city and surrounding towns \nthat is the Bosque. It is the largest continuous cottonwood forest in \nthe Southwest, and one of the last of its kind in the world.\n  Unfortunately, mismanagement, neglect, and the effects of upstream \ndevelopment have severely degraded the Bosque. The list of its woes is \nlong: it has been overrun by non-native vegetation; graffiti and trash \nmar locations along its length; the drought and build up of hazardous \nfuel have contributed to an increased susceptibility to fire. As a \nresult, public access is problematical and crucial habitat for scores \nof species is threatened. And yet, it remains one of the most \nbiologically diverse ecosystems in the Southwest. My goal is to restore \nthe Bosque and create a space that is open and attractive to the \npublic.\n  This is a grand undertaking to be sure; but I want to ensure that \nthis extraordinary corridor of the Southwestern desert is preserved for \ngenerations to come: not only for generations of humans, but for the \ndiverse plant and animal species that reside in it as well.\n  Situated in the heart of the State's largest city, its potential to \nbe a special attraction for residents is exciting. Equally exciting are \nthe potential benefits to the ecosystem as a whole. The rehabilitation \nof this ecosystem leads to greater protection for threatened and \nendangered species; it means more migratory birds, healthier habitat \nfor fish, and greater numbers of towering cottonwood trees.\n  This project could be one of the far too rare opportunities to both \nincrease the quality of life for a city while assuring the health and \nstability of an entire ecosystem. We would be increasing the \nattractiveness of Albuquerque to businesses while improving the home of \nthe Silvery Minnow. Where trash is now strewn, walking paths and horse \ntrails will run. Where jetty jacks and discarded rubble lie, cottonwood \nwill grow. The dead trees and underbrush that threaten devastating fire \nwill be replaced by healthy groves of trees. School children will be \nable to study and maybe catch sight of a bald eagle. The chance to help \nbuild a dynamic public space like this does not come around often, and \nI would like to see Congress embrace that chance.\n  Having grown up in along the Rio Grande in Albuquerque, the Bosque is \nsomething I treasure; and I lament the degradation that has occurred. \nBecause of this, I have been involved in Bosque restoration since 1991 \nand I commend the efforts of groups like the Bosque Coalition for the \nwork they have done, and will continue to do, along the river. I \npropose to build on that rehabilitation. The effort I put in front of \nyou today is a logical complement to these previous efforts as well as \ntowards Bosque revitalization, restoration, and recovery for the entire \nRio Grande.\n  Already work is underway. Over the past two years, the Army Corps of \nEngineers has undertaken the task of conducting a study so that we \nmight gain a better understanding of how best to rehabilitate and \nrestore this beautiful Albuquerque greenbelt.\n  I remain grateful to each of the parties who have been involved with \nthis\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\nidea since its inception. Each one contributes a very critical \ncomponent. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District owns this vital \npart of the Bosque which runs from the National Hispanic Cultural \nCenter north to the Paseo Del Norte Bridge. The MRGCD has proven to be \na valuable local partner in identifying areas for non-native species \nand other environmental restoration work. Additionally, MRGCD continues \nto work on the development and implementation of an educational \ncampaign for local public schools on the importance of the Bosque. \nFinally, MRGCD has continually worked with all parties to provide \noptions on how the Bosque can be preserved, protected and enjoyed by \neveryone.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers is developing a preliminary restoration \nplan for the Bosque along the Albuquerque corridor. The plan is well \nunderway and is moving towards the development of a feasibility study.\n  Specifically, this bill authorizes $10 million dollars in fiscal year \n2004 and such sums as are necessary for the following nine years to \ncomplete projects, activities, substantial ecosystem restoration, \npreservation, protection, and recreation facilities along the Middle \nRio Grande. I urge my fellow members to help preserve this rare and \ndiverse ecosystem and to aid the city of Albuquerque and the State of \nNew Mexico in building a place to treasure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 997\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Highlands Stewardship Area in the \nStates of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today along with Senators Lautenberg, \nSpecter, Schumer, Dodd, Clinton and Lieberman, I am introducing the \nHighlands Stewardship Act. I am proud to be joining Congressman Rodney \nFrelinghuysen and other colleagues from the New Jersey, New York, and \nConnecticut congressional delegations, who are introducing identical \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  This legislation would help to preserve one of the last open space \ntreasures in this country, the Highlands forest region that stretches \nfrom northwestern Connecticut, across the lower Hudson River valley in \nNew York, through my State of New Jersey and into east-central \nPennsylvania. This region encompasses more than 2 million acres of \nforests, farms, streams, wetlands, lakes and reservoirs and historic \nsites. It includes the Green, Taconic and Notre Dame Mountains. It also \nincludes such historic sites as Morristown National Historic Park and \nWest Point.\n  The value of the ecological, recreational and scenic resources of the \nHighlands cannot be overstated. One hundred seventy million gallons are \ndrawn from the Highlands aquifers daily, providing quality drinking \nwater for over 11 million people. Two hundred forty seven threatened or \nendangered species live in the Highlands including the timber \nrattlesnake, wood turtle, red-shouldered hawk, barred owl, great blue \nheron and eastern wood rat. There also are many fishing, hiking and \nboating recreation opportunities in the Highlands that are used by many \nof the 1 in 12 Americans who live within 2 hours of travel of the \nHighlands.\n  Unfortunately, much of Highlands is quickly vanishing. According to \nthe most recent study issued by the United States Department of \nAgriculture, we have lost over 3,000 acres of forest and 1,600 acres of \nfarmland in New York and New Jersey sections of the Highlands annually \nto development between 1995 and 2000.\n  This legislation would designate a Stewardship Area amongst the four \nStates in order to protect the most important Highlands projects. It \nwould create a source of funding for conservation and preservation \nprojects in the Highlands to preserve and protect the open space that \nremains. Two million dollars a year for 10 years would be provided for \nconservation assistance projects in the four Highlands States. This \nfunding could be used for items such as smart growth initiatives and \ncultural preservation projects. Twenty-five million dollars a year over \n10 years\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\nalso would be provided for open space preservation projects in the four \nHighlands states. The source of this funding would be the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation to ensure that we protect \nthis resource, which is so critical to our quality of life, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 999\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Highlands Stewardship Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Highlands region is a geographic area that \n     encompasses more than 2,000,000 acres extending from eastern \n     Pennsylvania through the States of New Jersey and New York to \n     northwestern Connecticut;\n       (2) the Highlands region is an environmentally unique area \n     that--\n       (A) provides clean drinking water to over 15,000,000 people \n     in metropolitan areas in the States of Connecticut, New \n     Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania;\n       (B) provides critical wildlife habitat, including habitat \n     for 247 threatened and endangered species;\n       (C) maintains an important historic connection to early \n     Native American culture, colonial settlement, the American \n     Revolution, and the Civil War;\n       (D) contains recreational resources for 14,000,000 visitors \n     annually;

and\n       (E) result in the loss of recreational opportunities and \n     scenic, historic, and cultural resources;\n       (7) the natural, agricultural, and cultural resources of \n     the Highlands region, in combination with the proximity of \n     the Highlands region to the largest metropolitan areas in the \n     United States, make the Highlands region nationally \n     significant;\n       (8) the national significance of the Highlands region has \n     been documented in--\n       (A) the New York-New Jersey Highlands Regional Study \n     conducted by the Forest Service in 1990;\n       (B) the New York-New Jersey Highlands Regional Study: 2002 \n     Update conducted by the Forest Service;\n       (C) the bi-State Skylands Greenway Task Force Report;\n       (D) the New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment \n     Plan;\n       (E) the New York State Open Space Conservation Plan;\n       (F) the Connecticut Green Plan: Open Space Acquisition FY \n     2001-2006;\n       (G) the open space plans of the State of Pennsylvania; and\n       (H) other open space conservation plans for States in the \n     Highlands region;\n       (9) the Highlands region includes or is adjacent to \n     numerous parcels of land owned by the Federal Government or \n     federally designated areas that protect, conserve, restore, \n     promote, or interpret resources of the Highlands region, \n     including--\n       (A) the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge;\n       (B) the Shawanagunk Grasslands Wildlife Refuge;\n       (C) the Morristown National Historical Park;\n       (D) the Delaware and Lehigh Canal Corridors;\n       (E) the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area;\n       (F) the Delaware River Basin;\n       (G) the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area;\n       (H) the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River;\n       (I) the Appalachian National Scenic Trail;\n       (J) the United States Military Academy at West Point, New \n     York;\n       (K) the Highlands National Millennium Trail;\n       (L) the Picatinny Arsenal in the State of New Jersey;\n       (M) the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge;\n       (N) the proposed Crossroads of the Revolution National \n     Heritage Area;\n       (O) the proposed Musconetcong National Scenic and \n     Recreational River in the State of New Jersey; and\n       (P) the Farmington River Wild and Scenic Area in the State \n     of Connecticut;\n       (10) it is in the interest of the United States to protect, \n     conserve, restore, promote, and interpret the resources of \n     the Highlands region for the residents of, and visitors to, \n     the Highlands region;\n       (11) the States of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and \n     Pennsylvania, regional entities, and units of local \n     government in the Highlands region have the primary \n     responsibility for protecting, conserving, preserving, and \n     promoting the resources of the Highlands region; and\n       (12) because of the longstanding Federal practice of \n     assisting States in creating, protecting, conserving, \n     preserving, restoring, and interpreting areas of significant \n     natural and cultural importance, and the national \n     significance of the Highlands region, the Federal Government \n     should, in partnership with the Highlands States and units of \n     local government in the Highlands region, protect, restore, \n     promote, preserve, and interpret the natural, agricultural, \n     historical, and cultural resources of the Highlands region.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to make the protection of women and children who are \naffected by a complex humanitarian emergency a priority of the United \nStates Government, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, along with \nSenators McCain, Feinstein, Dodd, and Kerry, to make women and children \na priority of our assistance of programs, women and children who are \nsuffering the ravages of war and natural disasters, suffering from food \nshortages and a lack of basic necessities, suffering from the \ndegradation of complex humanitarian emergencies. War has been the major \ncause.\n  Over the past fifty years the nature of war has changed dramatically. \nIncreasingly, sadly, women and children seem to bear the brunt of it. \nAccording to the United Nations Children's Fund, since 1990, more than \n2 million children have been killed and 6 million maimed or injured as \na result of war. Today, 90 percent of the casualities in any war are \ncivilians. They are mostly women and children.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that rape has been used as a weapon of \nwar all over the world from Burma to Bosnia to Sierra Leone. It is \nequally incomprehensible that forced displacement of civilians, rather \nthan being one of the unfortunate results of war, has actually become a \ndeliberate tactic.\n  Under these circumstances, what choice do people have but to leave \ntheir homes? They leave out of fear for their lives and their \nchildren's lives. Some find their way into camps where instead of \nsafety, they suffer extraordinary violence and abuse. Allegations of \nsexual exploitation by camp residents and humanitarian workers in \nrefugee camps in west Africa and Nepal are all-too-real examples of the \nsad fact that women and children remain vulnerable even in the very \nplaces they flee to find safety.\n  This bill seeks to do something about this. It seeks to enhance the \nU.S. Government's ability to ensure that women and children's \nprotection needs are addressed before, during, and after a complex \nhumanitarian emergency.\n  It does this in several ways. First, it directs the Secretary of \nState to designate a special coordinator for protection issues. That \nperson will be changed with making sure that our embassies and consular \nposts are made aware of the earliest warning signs that a complex \nhumanitarian emergency is imminent. The Coordinator is to compile a \nwatch list of such countries and regions so that our aid missions can \nplan to meet potential need.\n  Second, the bill specifies basic measures that will improve our \nability to help these women and children, help the refugees, help \ninternally displaced people cope during an actual complex humanitarian \ncrisis.\n  It requires that relief organizations funded by the United States \nGovernment review their procedures to ensure adequate measures have \nbeen taken to provide adequate physical security for refugees and \ninternationally displaced people, especially the women and children.\n  The legislation prohibits U.S. funding for relief agencies that do \nnot sign a code of conduct that prohibits improper relationships \nbetween humanitarian aid workers and aid recipients, and encourages the \nSecretary to pressure the U.N. refugee agency to implement a ``whistle-\nblower'' system under which aid workers, refugees and internally \ndisplaced persons can report instances of gender-based violence and \nexploitation.\n  Because women have unique health needs that are often unmet when they \nare forced to flee their homes, the bill includes a provision mandating \nhealth services for women within 30 days of the onset of a complex \nhumanitarian emergency.\n  Additionally, the bill amends the Micro-Enterprise Development Act to \nexpand the availability of micro-loans to refugees and internally \ndisplaced women. When women are given access to income generating \nactivities, they are less vulnerable to coercion from those who would \ndemand sexual favors in return for food or other basic necessities.\n  Finally, the bill deals with rehabilitation and recovery.\n  The bill requires the Secretary of State and the Administrator for \nthe Agency for International Development to develop and implement \neconomic development programs to assist female heads of households, to \nhelp women increase access to ownership of land and other productive \nassets, to ensure that education and training programs are integrated \nwith economic development programs to encourage reintegration of women \nwho were displaced during war, and programs to politically empower \nwomen.\n  It calls upon the United States Executive Director of the \nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development to work on \nensuring that World Bank demobilization, disarmament and reintegration \nprograms extend the same benefits that ex-combatants receive to women \nand children who were formally or informally associated with them.\n  As it now stands, women and children who were used as cooks, porters, \nand so called ``wives''--a euphemism for women who were kidnaped to \nserve as sexual slaves--are given nothing with which to rebuild their \nlives, despite the fact that they rarely served with armed groups by \nchoice. And yet the very people who forced them into such conditions \nare assisted with no qualms or reservations.\n  Finally, the bill calls upon the Secretary of State to report to \nCongress all the programs that they are funding\n\n[[Page S5780]]\n\nthat are aimed at improving the awareness of foreign law enforcement \nofficials of women's human rights and the ability of foreign law \nenforcement officials to investigate and prosecute crimes of rape and \nsexual violence.\n  This bill is not a panacea. It does not cure all the ills that war \nand displacement create for women and children. It seeks to provide \nsome relief for those who are entirely reliant--through no fault of \ntheir own--on the largess of the international community.\n  I believe this legislation will improve the way we respond to the \nneeds facing women and children trying to survive in the most dire of \ncircumstances, and I hope my colleagues will join me by supporting it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1001\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The nature of war has changed dramatically in recent \n     decades, putting women and children at greater risk of death, \n     disease, displacement, and exploitation.\n       (2) Civilians, particularly women and children, account for \n     the vast majority of those adversely affected by complex \n     humanitarian emergencies, including as refugees and \n     internally displaced persons, and increasingly are targeted \n     by combatants and armed elements for murder, abduction, \n     forced military conscription, involuntary servitude, \n     displacement, sexual abuse and slavery, mutilation, and loss \n     of freedom.\n       (3) Traditionally, humanitarian response has focused on \n     providing food, medical care, and shelter needs, while \n     placing less emphasis on the safety and security of those \n     affected by a complex humanitarian emergency.\n       (4) Few well-coordinated efforts exist to prevent and \n     respond to violence against women and children when they are \n     refugees or internally displaced persons.\n       (5) While the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n     and the Department of State are charged with protecting \n     refugees, there is no United States Government agency or \n     international body with a clear mandate to protect internally \n     displaced persons and those at risk of displacement as a \n     result of a complex humanitarian emergency.\n       (6) There is a substantial need for the protection of women \n     and children to be given a high priority during all complex \n     humanitarian emergencies.\n\n     SEC. 102. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that the United States Government has \n     adequate capabilities to support programs that provide for \n     the protection of women and children who are affected by a \n     complex humanitarian emergency;\n       (2) to build the capacities of United States Government \n     agencies, multilateral institutions, international \n     nongovernmental organizations, local nongovernmental \n     organizations, and local communities to prevent and respond \n     effectively to gender-based violence and exploitation of \n     children that occur during a complex humanitarian emergency; \n     and\n       (3) to provide increased funding for the protection of \n     women and children affected by a complex humanitarian \n     emergency.\n\n     SEC. 103. REQUIREMENT TO DEVELOP INTEGRATED STRATEGY.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--The Secretary shall, in consultation with \n     the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development, develop an integrated strategy for \n     the protection of women and children who are internally \n     displaced, made refugees, or otherwise affected by a complex \n     humanitarian emergency.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report outlining the \n     strategy described in subsection (a).\n       (c) Content.--The report required by subsection (b) shall \n     include--\n\n[[Page S5781]]\n\n       (1) an assessment of the specific needs of, and particular \n     threats to, women and children at the various stages of a \n     complex humanitarian emergency, especially at the onset of \n     such emergency;\n       (2) a description of which agencies and offices of the \n     United States Government are responsible for addressing each \n     aspect of such needs and threats;\n       (3) an evaluation of the needs and threats that are being \n     adequately addressed and funded, and those which require \n     additional attention or resources;\n       (4) a set of guidelines and recommendations for improving \n     United States and international systems for the protection of \n     women and children during a complex humanitarian emergency; \n     and\n       (5) a mechanism for coordinating and overseeing United \n     States efforts to prevent and respond to gender-based \n     violence and exploitation of children that occurs during a \n     complex humanitarian emergency.\n\n     SEC. 104. DESIGNATION OF COORDINATOR.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall designate one or \n     more senior-level officials of the Department of State or the \n     United States Agency for International Development as a \n     coordinator or coordinators, as the case may be, to be \n     responsible for the oversight and coordination of United \n     States Government efforts to provide protection to women and \n     children who are affected by a complex humanitarian \n     emergency.\n       (b) Duties.--A coordinator designated under subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (1) coordinate the actions taken to carry out the purposes \n     of this Act, as described in section 102;\n       (2) be responsible for the oversight and coordination of \n     United States Government efforts to protect women and \n     children who are affected by a complex humanitarian \n     emergency; and\n       (3) provide United States embassies and consular posts with \n     mechanisms to warn relief agencies of an impending complex \n     humanitarian emergency.\n       (c) Notification.--Not later than 5 days after designating \n     an official as a coordinator under subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall submit the name of such official to the \n     appropriate congressional committees.\n\n                 TITLE II--PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The percentage of civilians killed and wounded as a \n     result of hostilities has risen from 5 percent of all \n     casualties at the turn of the 19th century to 65 percent \n     during World War II and to 90 percent in more recent \n     hostilities. Women and children comprise the majority of \n     civilian deaths and the majority of all refugees from \n     hostilities.\n       (2) In the last decade alone, more than 2,000,000 children \n     have been killed during wars, while more than 4,000,000 have \n     survived physical mutilation, and more than 1,000,000 have \n     been orphaned or separated from their families as a result of \n     war.\n       (3) In many armed conflicts, soldiers have destroyed food \n     supplies and productive capacities, stolen donated food \n     intended for women and children, and blocked the distribution \n     of humanitarian aid.\n       (4) During 2003, an estimated 300,000 children have been \n     compulsorily recruited into military operations around the \n     world, including a large number of girls who have been forced \n     to work as combatants, cooks, messengers, spies, or sexual \n     slaves for soldiers.\n       (5) The use of rape, particularly against women and girls, \n     is an increasingly common tactic in modern war.\n       (6) The international community has a responsibility \n     pursuant to the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees \n     done at New York October 4, 1967 (19 UST 6223), the \n     Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva \n     July 28, 1951, and the Convention Relative to the Protection \n     of Civilian Persons in Time of War done at Geneva August 12, \n     1949 (6 UST 3516), to take preventive action that would \n     improve preparedness and reduce the vulnerability of women \n     and children to violence and exploitation.\n\n     SEC. 202. EARLY WARNING AND EARLY ACTION SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Preventive Actions.--Each coordinator shall--\n       (1) maintain a data base of information related to \n     occurrences of gender-based violence or exploitation of \n     children during a complex humanitarian emergency;\n       (2) develop, based on the information contained in the \n     database required by paragraph (1) and other research--\n       (A) a list of early warning signs that indicate there is a \n     likelihood that gender-based violence or exploitation of \n     children will occur during a complex humanitarian emergency; \n     and\n       (B) a list, that is updated regularly, of countries or \n     regions where there is an increased risk of gender-based \n     violence or exploitation of children due to a complex \n     humanitarian emergency to enhance the preparedness of the \n     United States Government or organizations funded by the \n     United States Government to respond to such an emergency;\n       (3) disseminate to United States embassies and consular \n     posts the lists described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of \n     paragraph (2);\n       (4) assist embassies and consular posts in responding to an \n     increased risk of gender-based violence or exploitation of \n     children that may occur during a complex humanitarian \n     emergency;\n       (5) develop a procedure for nongovernmental organizations \n     to report evidence of gender-based violence and exploitation \n     of children, during a complex humanitarian emergency to \n     ensure appropriate response by United States officials; and\n       (6) establish a reporting and monitoring system for United \n     States diplomatic missions and consular posts and missions of \n     the United States Agency for International Development to \n     collect and submit to the coordinator standardized data on \n     evidence that women and children are being targeted for or \n     are at increased risk of violence or exploitation in complex \n     humanitarian emergencies.\n       (b) Reporting and Monitoring.--Not later than 30 days after \n     a country or region is placed on a list maintained under \n     subsection (a)(1), each United States diplomatic mission and \n     consular post located in such country or region shall submit \n     to the appropriate coordinator a description of the measures \n     undertaken by such mission or post for the protection of \n     women and children in the event of a complex humanitarian \n     emergency.\n       (c) Dissemination of Information.--A coordinator shall make \n     available to the public, including to nongovernmental \n     organizations located in areas where there is an increased \n     risk of gender-based violence or exploitation of children, \n     the information, procedures, systems, and measures described \n     in subsections (a) and (b).\n\n  TITLE III--SECURITY FOR REFUGEE AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED WOMEN AND \n                                CHILDREN\n\n     SEC. 301. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Almost one-half of the world's estimated 37,500,000 \n     refugees and internally displaced persons are children.\n       (2) Food rations in camps for refugees and internally \n     displaced persons are often limited and unpredictable, and \n     vulnerable women rarely have legitimate opportunities to \n     generate income or products to barter for additional food and \n     other supplies.\n       (3) Refugee women and girls face particular threats because \n     of power inequities, including being forced to exchange sex \n     for food and humanitarian supplies, and being at increased \n     risk of rape and gender-based violence due to poor security \n     in refugee camps.\n       (4) An investigation into sexual exploitation of refugees \n     by aid workers in West Africa, conducted by the United \n     Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services, found many \n     factors that contribute to the exploitation and abuse of \n     women and children in refugee situations, including--\n       (A) few women working in key positions in refugee relief \n     efforts;\n       (B) insufficient international staff presence in the camps;\n       (C) isolation and lack of separate and distinctly placed \n     sanitary facilities for men and women;\n       (D) incomplete rations and delayed delivery of supplies to \n     refugees; and\n       (E) lack of punishment for perpetrators, including adult \n     refugees, of sexual crimes against children in refugee \n     situations.\n       (5) Refugees and internally displaced persons living \n     outside of camps experience a range of serious problems \n     including vulnerability to harassment, abuse, and \n     exploitation by landlords and employers with little legal \n     recourse, and constant threat of detention, imprisonment, and \n     deportation.\n       (6) Existing nongovernmental organization and international \n     agency policies, procedures, training programs, monitoring, \n     and accountability mechanisms have not protected displaced \n     women and children from exploitation and abuse, provided \n     adequate assistance to survivors, or to disciplined offenders \n     and achieved justice.\n       (7) The limited presence of protection officers and other \n     trained managerial staff of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees in camps, especially at night, \n     exacerbates the vulnerability of women and children to abuse \n     by, in particular, fellow camp residents and nearby local \n     residents.\n       (8) In some circumstances, humanitarian agencies have \n     failed to make women and children aware of their rights to \n     protection and assistance, to give them access to effective \n     channels of redress, and to make humanitarian workers aware \n     of their duty to respect these rights and provide adequate \n     assistance.\n       (9) The Inter-Agency Standing Committee has identified \n     standards of behavior applicable to all of its personnel and \n     is implementing a plan of action related to protection from \n     sexual exploitation and abuse to strengthen mechanisms for \n     protecting those who depend on international aid.\n\n     SEC. 302. CODES OF CONDUCT.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Assistance.--None of the funds made \n     available by the Department of State through the Migration \n     and Refugee Assistance account or the Emergency Refugee and \n     Migration Assistance account or by any provision of law for \n     the purposes of the provision of assistance to refugees or \n     internally displaced persons may be provided to an \n     organization that has failed to adopt a code of conduct \n     regarding the protection of beneficiaries of humanitarian \n     assistance that incorporates the 6 core principles \n     recommended by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, as \n     described in subsection (b).\n       (b) Core Principles.--The 6 core principles for the \n     protection of beneficiaries are as follows:\n       (1) Sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers \n     constitute acts of gross\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\n     misconduct and are therefore grounds for termination of \n     employment.\n       (2) Sexual activity with persons under the age of 18 years \n     is prohibited regardless of the age of majority or age of \n     consent locally. Mistaken belief regarding the age of a child \n     is not a defense.\n       (3) Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for \n     sex, including sexual favors or other forms of humiliating, \n     degrading, or exploitative behavior, is prohibited. This \n     includes exchange of assistance that is due to beneficiaries.\n       (4) Sexual relationships between the providers and \n     beneficiaries of humanitarian assistance are strongly \n     discouraged since they are based on inherently unequal power \n     dynamics. Such relationships undermine the credibility and \n     integrity of humanitarian assistance work.\n       (5) Whenever a humanitarian assistance worker develops \n     concerns or suspicions regarding sexual abuse or exploitation \n     by a fellow worker, whether in the same agency or not, the \n     worker must report such concerns through established agency \n     reporting mechanisms.\n       (6) Humanitarian assistance agencies are obliged to create \n     and maintain an environment that prevents sexual exploitation \n     and abuse and promotes the implementation of their code of \n     conduct. Managers at all levels have particular \n     responsibilities to support and develop systems that maintain \n     this environment.\n\n     SEC. 303. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ADMINISTRATION \n                   PRACTICES IN CAMPS FOR REFUGEES AND DISPLACED \n                   PERSONS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that all agencies, including \n     multilateral and nongovernmental agencies, implementing \n     United States humanitarian assistance programs should conduct \n     a thorough review of their administrative, management, and \n     employment practices in refugee and displaced persons camps \n     for the purposes of--\n       (1) significantly increasing the number of women involved \n     in the distribution of food and humanitarian supplies;\n       (2) expanding opportunities for women to generate \n     legitimate income in the camps, including through employment \n     in the camps;\n       (3) educating providers and beneficiaries of humanitarian \n     assistance about the seriousness of gender-based violence and \n     exploitation of children;\n       (4) improving expatriate supervision and monitoring of \n     daily operations in the camps;\n       (5) improving the design and logistics of camps to create a \n     safer and more secure environment for women and children, \n     including through consultation with female camp residents;\n       (6) keeping formal and detailed records, including \n     photographs, of locally hired staff, and ensuring that they \n     are adequately paid and trained;\n       (7) providing training for humanitarian assistance workers \n     on their obligations and responsibilities under a code of \n     conduct;\n       (8) developing systems of accountability to deter and \n     punish gender-based violence, exploitation of children, and \n     other protection violations including through identification \n     of procedures for reporting and investigating allegations of \n     abuse that protect the safety and confidentiality of the \n     survivors; and\n       (9) ensuring that applicants for jobs in camps are screened \n     to prevent individuals who may have been involved in \n     protection violations from being hired by camp authorities.\n\n     SEC. 304. HEALTH SERVICES FOR REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Complex humanitarian emergencies result in particular \n     risks for women and girls.\n       (2) Refugee and displaced women face heightened risks of \n     developing complications during pregnancy, suffering a \n     miscarriage, dying, being injured during childbirth, becoming \n     infected with HIV or another sexually transmitted infection, \n     or suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder.\n       (3) Despite the heightened risks for women during a complex \n     humanitarian emergency, women's needs for specialized health \n     services have often been overlooked by donors and relief \n     organizations, which are focused on providing food, water, \n     and shelter.\n       (4) Priority activities and emergency supplies designed to \n     address life-threatening women's health problems during a \n     complex humanitarian emergency are often not implemented or \n     made available in the early days and weeks of an emergency, \n     the period when such activities and supplies are most needed \n     and may be most effective.\n       (b) Provision of Health Services.--\n       (1) Requirements.--Each coordinator shall--\n       (A) ensure that organizations funded by the United States \n     that respond to a complex humanitarian emergency have the \n     resources necessary to address the specific health needs of \n     women affected by the emergency; and\n       (B) identify an organization or individual to facilitate \n     the coordination and implementation of the activities needed \n     to respond to the health needs of women as soon as \n     practicable and not later than 30 days after the development \n     of a complex humanitarian emergency.\n       (2) Activities defined.--The activities referred to in \n     paragraph (1)(B) include activities to--\n       (A) prevent and manage the consequences of sexual violence;\n       (B) reduce transmission of HIV;\n       (C) provide obstetric care; and\n       (D) draft a plan to integrate women's health services into \n     the primary health care services provided during a complex \n     humanitarian emergency, including--\n       (i) collection of background data on maternal, infant and \n     child mortality, and the rate of HIV infection;\n       (ii) identification of suitable sites for future delivery \n     of women's health services by addressing security problems, \n     accessibility for all potential users, privacy and \n     confidentiality during visits, easy access to water and \n     sanitation, appropriate space for users' waiting time, and \n     aseptic conditions;\n       (iii) an assessment of the staff capacity to provide \n     women's health services; and\n       (iv) a plan for staff training.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, and \n     $14,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, to carry out subsection \n     (b). The amounts authorized to be appropriated in this \n     subsection are in addition to amounts appropriated for such \n     fiscal years to the Department of State for the Migration and \n     Refugee Assistance account, the Emergency Refugee and \n     Migration Assistance account, or the International Disaster \n     Assistance account.\n\n     SEC. 305. WHISTLEBLOWER SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Design of Model System.--The Secretary should urge the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to work with \n     nongovernmental organizations to design and implement a model \n     ``whistleblower'' system under which humanitarian workers, \n     refugees, and internally displaced persons can report \n     instances of gender-based violence or exploitation of \n     children. Such a system should ensure that--\n       (1) reports of instances of gender-based violence or \n     exploitation of children may be made confidentially and \n     without risk of retribution;\n       (2) such reports are swiftly and thoroughly investigated \n     and adjudicated; and\n       (3) appropriate disciplinary action is taken against a \n     person found to have committed an act of gender-based \n     violence or exploited a child.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to \n     the appropriate congressional committees on progress that has \n     been made toward designing and implementing the model \n     whistleblower system described in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 306. WOMEN'S ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is often difficult to determine when it is safe for \n     women and children to return to a community affected by a \n     complex humanitarian emergency, and in many instances the \n     affected women and children remain refugees or internally \n     displaced for considerable periods of time.\n       (2) To reduce vulnerability to exploitation and abuse, \n     women who are uprooted from their communities must be given \n     legitimate opportunities to generate income to support \n     themselves and their families.\n       (3) In situations of long-term displacement, humanitarian \n     and development agencies should provide legal assistance, \n     technical and vocational training, and access to credit for \n     women, so they can earn a safe and lawful livelihood.\n       (b) Work Permits.--The Department of State should work with \n     host governments, the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees, and other appropriate United Nations agencies to \n     ensure that, in situations of long-term displacement, \n     refugees and internally displaced persons are granted work \n     permits and other necessary documentation by the host \n     government and local authorities to enable them to generate \n     legitimate income.\n       (c) Amendments to Microenterprise Act of 2000.--Section 102 \n     of the Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2151f note) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) by redesignating subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) and \n     subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E), respectively; and\n       (B) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following:\n       ``(B) Women displaced by armed conflict are particularly at \n     risk, lacking access to traditional livelihoods and means for \n     generating income.''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (13)--\n       (A) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C); \n     and\n       (B) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following:\n       ``(B) Particular efforts should be made to expand the \n     availability of microcredit programs to internally displaced \n     persons, who historically have not had access to such \n     programs.''.\n       (d) Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act.--Chapter 1 of \n     part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 \n     et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) in section 108 (22 U.S.C. 2151f)--\n       (A) in subsection (b)(3), by inserting after \n     ``microentrepeneurs'' the following: ``, with an emphasis on \n     women microentrepeneurs,''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Reporting Requirement.--The Administrator of the \n     agency primarily responsible for administering this part, as \n     part of the annual congressional presentation documents of \n     the agency, shall submit to Congress a report that contains--\n\n[[Page S5783]]\n\n       ``(1) an estimate of the number of women living below the \n     national poverty line that have secured loans or received \n     training through the programs described in this Act;\n       ``(2) the percentage of women borrowers in programs funded \n     by the agency under this Act;\n       ``(3) the percentage of the total loan funds disbursed by \n     the agency under this Act that were made available to women \n     borrowers;

PROTECTION INITIATIVES.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary and the Administrator of the United \n     States Agency for International Development should continue \n     to develop protection initiatives that support \n     nongovernmental organizations and multilateral institutions \n     in identifying protection problems associated with complex \n     humanitarian emergencies and strategies for prevention of \n     gender-based violence and exploitation of children and \n     accountability during a complex humanitarian emergency, \n     including--\n       (A) training of field workers on identifying and responding \n     to gender-based violence and the exploitation of children;\n       (B) support for the rapid deployment of personnel trained \n     to identify protection needs to areas affected by complex \n     humanitarian emergencies;\n       (C) support for registration initiatives which document \n     refugees and internally displaced persons for purposes \n     including the provision of assistance to such persons and of \n     family reunification; and\n       (D) support for programs that provide assistance to women \n     who were displaced due to a complex humanitarian emergency, \n     including--\n       (i) psycho-social counseling;\n       (ii) training related to income generation and employment \n     skills; and\n       (iii) emergency health care required to respond to gender-\n     based violence; and\n       (2) the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n     should review--\n       (A) its placement practices to ensure that--\n       (i) senior protection officials are assigned to the posts \n     where women and children are in the most danger of gender-\n     based violence or exploitation;\n       (ii) experienced protection officers are present at border \n     crossings; and\n       (iii) more female staff are present in camps for refugees \n     or displaced persons; and\n       (B) its personnel system to facilitate the hiring of \n     successful junior professional officers on a permanent basis \n     following their initial tours of duty.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall report to the \n     appropriate congressional committees any steps taken to \n     develop the protection initiatives described in subsection \n     (a).\n\n     SEC. 309.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings and statements of \n     policy:\n       (1) The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 of \n     October 31, 2000, called on all actors involved in the \n     negotiation and implementation of peace agreements to address \n     the specific needs of women and girls during and after armed \n     conflicts.\n       (2) Women and children can play an important role in the \n     prevention and resolution of armed conflicts and in peace-\n     building.\n       (3) Despite positive roles of women in fostering peace, \n     they are excluded from most peace negotiations at the \n     diplomatic and operational level.\n       (4) Effective institutional arrangements designed to ensure \n     the protection and full participation of women and youth in \n     the peace process, including peacekeeping as well as peace-\n     building, can significantly contribute to the maintenance and \n     promotion of international peace and security.\n       (5) Rape should receive special attention by war crimes \n     tribunals, truth and reconciliation panels, and other organs \n     of justice.\n       (6) Assistance that is linked to peace processes should \n     support and strengthen women's roles as economic leaders and \n     assist women in accessing the global marketplace.\n       (7) Women must be afforded an equal role in decisionmaking \n     to ensure that their interests are represented at all levels \n     of government.\n\n     SEC. 402. SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITIES AND FORMER COMBATANTS.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Programs.--The Secretary, in \n     conjunction with the Administrator for the United States \n     Agency for International Development, shall develop and \n     implement specific programs to provide assistance to \n     communities that have been affected by a complex humanitarian \n     emergency and to former combatants, including:\n       (1) Economic development.--Multi-year economic development \n     programs that are intended to provide gender-balanced \n     benefits and to assist female heads of households.\n       (2) Productive assets.--Programs to increase access to or \n     ownership of productive assets such as land, agricultural \n     equipment, and credit by women.\n       (3) Education and training.--Education and training \n     programs that are integrated with economic development \n     programs to encourage the reintegration of former combatants \n     into society and to promote post-conflict stability in \n     affected communities.\n       (4) Extension of education and training.--Programs to \n     extend education and training, including training in business \n     development, to women and girls.\n       (5) Political empowerment.--Programs to politically empower \n     women, including training to assist women and women's \n     organizations in understanding legal systems, electoral \n     processes, legislation advocacy, and the role of the media, \n     public affairs and information technology in politics, and in \n     obtaining leadership positions.\n       (b) Programs of the International Bank for Reconstruction \n     and Development.--The United States Executive Director of the \n     International Bank for Reconstruction and Development shall \n     work to ensure that disarmament, demobilization, and \n     reintegration programs developed and funded by the \n     International Bank for Reconstruction and Development provide \n     benefits to former combatants that are comparable to the \n     benefits provided by such programs to other individuals.\n\n     SEC. 403. POLICE REFORM AND ACCOUNTABILITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In many developing and postconflict countries, police \n     and military forces continue to function as instruments of \n     repression, coercion, and centralized power, even after a \n     transition to democracy has begun.\n       (2) In order for a transitional, postconflict society to \n     become stable and democratic, it is necessary for the \n     government of such society to make a clear separation between \n     police and military functions, and clearly define the \n     military forces that are subject to civilian, democratic \n     control, and the point at which police forces become \n     accountable, representative service-providers to local \n     communities.\n\n[[Page S5784]]\n\n       (3) Police officers in developing and postconflict \n     countries are often paid minimal salaries and receive little \n     or improper training, resulting in widespread police \n     corruption and citizens viewing the police as an obstacle to \n     justice rather than the enforcer of justice.\n       (4) Successful professionalization and democratic reform of \n     police forces requires not only adequate financial resources, \n     but also concurrent strengthening of the rule of law and \n     system of justice, transparency, and cooperation with local \n     community and human rights organizations, removal of corrupt \n     and abusive personnel, and political will for meaningful \n     reform at the highest levels of government.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to \n     the appropriate congressional committees on all current \n     programs to assist nations to reconstitute civilian police \n     authority and capability following a complex humanitarian \n     emergency, including ensuring the enforcement of laws that \n     are designed to protect women and children and improve \n     accountability for gender-based violence.\n\n     SEC. 404. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPROVEMENT OF \n                   UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United Nations \n     Department of Peacekeeping Operations should--\n       (1) ensure that gender issues are mainstreamed into its \n     peacekeeping missions, including by establishing a senior \n     gender advisor post within the Department of Peacekeeping \n     Operations which reports directly to the Under Secretary \n     General for Peacekeeping Operations;\n       (2) provide military, police, and civilian personnel \n     deployed to areas where women and children are at risk of \n     gender-based violence or exploitation with training materials \n     that--\n       (A) assist such personnel with protecting and addressing \n     the particular needs of women and children; and\n       (B) were developed in consultation with women's \n     organizations; and\n       (3) ensure that the Special Representative of the Secretary \n     General of the peacekeeping mission has direct contact with \n     local women leaders or women's organizations in the area in \n     which the peacekeepers are deployed for the purpose of \n     obtaining information regarding gender-based violence or \n     exploitation of children.\n\n          TITLE V--WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S PROTECTION ASSISTANCE\n\n     SEC. 501. WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S PROTECTION ASSISTANCE.\n\n       Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 135.

A bill to direct the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology to establish a program to support research and training in \nmethods of detecting the use of performance-enhancing drugs by \nathletes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am joined by my colleagues \nSenators Brownback, Edwards and Graham in introducing the Amateur \nSports Integrity Act of 2003. This legislation would make it illegal to \ngamble on Olympic, college, or high school sports, and it would \nauthorize appropriations for the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology to fund research into methods of detection and prevention of \nthe use athletic performance-enhancing drugs. The bill is similar to \nlegislation that has been reported twice in previous Congresses.\n  The legislation is designed to respond to a number of troubling \nissues plaguing amateur athletics, including a gambling epidemic among \nhigh school and college students, and a significant increase among our \nyouth in the use of performance-enhancing drugs and supplements. This \nbill is essential to ensuring the integrity and legitimacy of amateur \nathletics--an important institution in the social fabric of this \ncountry.\n  This bill would codify a recommendation made by the congressionally-\ncreated National Gambling Impact Study Commission, NGISC, to ban \nbetting on collegiate and amateur athletic events. In the summary of \nits comprehensive report to Congress dated June 1999, the NGISC noted \ngrowing concern regarding increasing levels of sports wagering by high \nschool and college students. The NGISC cites a 1996 study sponsored by \nthe National Collegiate Athletic Association, which found that of the \nover\n\n[[Page S5785]]\n\n200 student athletes surveyed in Division I basketball and football \nprograms, more than one in four admitted to betting on college sports \nwhile in school.\n  More recently, a study conducted by the Psychology Department of \nCentral Connecticut State University contends that the problem of \ngambling among college students has been relatively overlooked when \nstudying student risk-taking behavior. The study links legal and \nillegal gambling by indicating that, ``it is reasonable to expect that \nthe growth of legalized gambling over the past decade would result in \nan increase in student gambling and gambling problems, including \nstudents who gamble at a pathological level.'' It is important to \nunderstand that gambling is not a problem that occurs in a vacuum. The \nConnecticut study found that one out of nine students at four \nConnecticut universities suffered from a gambling problem that was \n``significantly connected'' to substance and dietary problems, such as \nmarijuana use, cigarette smoking, and binge eating and drinking.\n  Just as the use of performance-enhancing drugs threatens the \nintegrity of amateur sports, so does gambling, as it invites public \nspeculation as to their legitimacy and transforms student athletes into \nmerely objects to be bet upon. Betting can also provide unnecessary \ntemptation to amateur athletes to agree to point-shaving and other \noutcome-fixing schemes at the expense of their teammates, their fans, \nand their futures. Many of the same pressures that lead college players \nto cheat also push these young people to use performance-enhancing \ndrugs. The combination of stresses placed on student athletes to \nperform athletically, handle newly-found notoriety, and pursue \nprofessional athletic careers drive many to seek an edge through the \nuse of such substances.\n  Although the Amateur Sports Integrity Act would ban legal gambling on \namateur athletics, it may also reduce a substantial amount of illegal \ngambling. The relationship between legal and illegal gambling was \naddressed by the NGISC, which observed that ``legal sports wagering--\nespecially the publication in the media of Las Vegas and offshore-\ngenerated point spreads fuels a much larger amount of illegal sports \nwagering.''\n  In 1992, Congress recognized the Federal interest in protecting \namateur sports from the harmful effects of gambling, and prohibited \nstate-sanctioned sports betting in the overwhelming majority of states. \nAlthough Congress ``grandfathered'' Nevada, Oregon, Montana, and \nDelaware, only Nevada has chosen to permit legal gambling on amateur \nsports. Recently, however, the gaming industry has lobbied aggressively \nin an effort to convince the Delaware State legislature to exploit the \nloophole by legalizing gambling on amateur and professional sports.\n  Congress must act quickly to close the loophole that currently allows \njust a handful of States to serve as national clearinghouses for \nbetting on our youth. By allowing betting in any state, we send a \nconfusing message to our youth as to whether gambling on amateur \nathletics is, in fact, legal or illegal. While I do not pretend that \nthis bill solves all problems associated with gambling and the use of \nperformance-enhancing drugs, I do believe that it will send a clear \nmessage that gambling on amateur athletics and the use of these \nsubstances is dangerous and wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to respond to the pleas of prominent college \npresidents and coaches, and join in supporting this important measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Amateur Sports Integrity \n     Act''.\n\n                  TITLE I--PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to clarify the intent of Congress with respect to the \ncontinued use of established commercial outfitter hunting camps on the \nSalmon River; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President I rise to introduce legislation that will \nremove any ambiguity as to the intent of the Central Idaho Wilderness \nAct of 1980 to provide for continuation of the historical use of \noutfitter hunting camps on the Salmon River. In short, these lodges \nwere established well before the river designation, have been managed \nas a part of the river designation for 23 years and allow users, in \nparticular the elderly and the physically challenged, to have access to \nand enjoy the spirit of this wild area. Their rustic nature upholds the \nideals envisioned by Congress, and they are used in accordance with all \nprovisions of the law.\n  I am mystified as to why someone would want to eliminate this \nhistorical use. However, that is what some extreme wilderness \norganizations would like to do. They want the Forest Service and the \nCourts to ignore the intent of Congress in establishing the Central \nIdaho Wilderness Act and re-establish a pristine area which blocks \naccess to many current users.\n  In the Findings Section of the Central Idaho Wilderness Act, it is \nclearly stated that ``protection can be provided--to the Salmon River--\nwithout conflicting with established uses.'' It is my understanding \nthat a great deal of time and effort was put into crafting this \ndesignation so that established and historic uses of the area would be \nmaintained while preserving one of our Nation's treasures--the River of \nNo Return.\n  In reading the voluminous hearing record and report language, I found \nreferences to ``lodges,'' ``hunting lodges,'' ``outfitters lodges,'' \nand ``commercial services may be performed'' throughout the record. It \nis clear to me that Senator Church, of Idaho, the main proponent of the \nlegislation, intended for these lodges to remain. The report language \nspecifically states, ``We favor administration of the main Salmon River \nunder the provisions of the Wild and Scenic River Act so as to permit \ncontinuation, as appropriate, of motorized travel on the river and \noutfitter and camping facilities.''\n  However, I believe the record shows Senator McClure of Idaho was more \nof a prophet when he stated, ``Whether it is this year, next year, or 5 \nyears from now, or 10 years from now, some forest administrator in the \narea is going to say it would be a lot more convenient for us to manage \nthat problem if we did not have to deal with that guy that is there. . \n. . We all know that it was intended for the wild and scenic river \nclassification as attached to that river, that the existing use was \ngoing to be permitted to continue; and then, all of a sudden, we find \nout that that is now unacceptable.''\n  Senator McClure is off by only 20 years and it is not a forest \nadministrator, but an extreme wilderness organization that is seeking \nthe elimination of these well established lodges.\n  This legislation clarifies that these three specific lodges are an \nestablished and historical use in the Central Idaho Wilderness Act and \nshould remain a part of the legacy of this great river.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1003\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n       Section 1.

A bill to ensure that children at highest risk for asthma, \nvision, hearing, and other health problems are identified and treated; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Healthy \nChildren Learn Act with my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins. I am \nalso pleased to have Senator Clinton as an original cosponsor of this \nmeasure. This legislation focuses on eliminating some bureaucratic \nbarriers that make it more difficult for schools to provide their \nstudents with health care services, if they so choose.\n  Many schools have found that the health of a child can significantly \naffect his or her ability to learn. To enhance children's learning \nability and to increase the well-being of their students, these schools \nsometimes choose to provide health care services including health care \nscreenings.\n  One example of a disease that significantly affects children's \neducation is asthma. Asthma is the single greatest reason for school \nabsenteeism today. Over five million children in America suffer from \nasthma. Forty-nine percent of children with asthma missed school in the \nlast year, and 48 percent of children with asthma are limited in sports \nand recreation. Lack of physical activity, in turn, can lead to \nchildhood obesity with its concomitant health care problems.\n  ``America is in the middle of an asthma epidemic--an epidemic that is \ngetting worse, not better.'' So says the PEW Environmental Health \nCommission in its most recent report on asthma. The prevalence of \nasthma continues to rise at astounding rates, in every region of the \ncountry and across all demographic groups, whether measured by age, \nrace or sex.\n  My home State of Illinois has some of the highest rates of childhood \nasthma in the country. Unfortunately, Chicago has the highest childhood \nasthma-related death rate in the Nation. Over 60 percent of childhood \nadmissions to the emergency room in Chicago are for asthma. This \ndisease exacts a very significant toll on children in my State.\n  For the next 15 minutes, imagine breathing through a tiny straw the \nsize of a coffee stirrer, never getting enough air. Now imagine \nsuffering through the process three to six times a day. This is asthma. \nCan a child really concentrate on learning when he or she is gasping \nfor air?\n  Due to the very high rates of asthma in Chicago and its effects on \nabsenteeism and children's ability to learn\n\n[[Page S5787]]\n\nwhen at school, the Chicago Public Schools, CPS, instituted an asthma \nscreening program. The school system developed an asthma manual to \nprovide a standard plan of care for all students with asthma. They \nprovided citywide nurse training to develop a uniform, high standard \nfor approaching students with asthma and their parents and high-quality \neducation about the environmental triggers for asthma and how to lessen \nthem, together with education on how to use asthma inhalers. In 1999, \nthey identified 12,374 cases of asthma. CPS continues to monitor and \nevaluate this program, and they have also partnered with other \norganizations such as the American Red Cross Asthma Program, the \nUniversity of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health \nAsthma Programs. CPS has also developed parent tutoring programs and \nhas linked asthmatic children with primary health care providers for \nappropriate follow-up.\n  All of these efforts are extremely important, but they are resource \nintensive. This legislation addresses a barrier to children receiving \nvital health screenings in schools. It provides for a $10 million grant \nprogram for school districts such as CPS to apply for funds for asthma \nscreening for those children who are not eligible for either S-CHIP or \nMedicaid. The grants would be targeted to those districts that have the \nhighest prevalence or deaths associated with asthma.\n  CPS has also found that a child's ability to learn is affected by \nimpaired vision and hearing, and as a result, children with vision \ndeficits are far more likely to fail academically. In 1998, CPS found \nthat children who were retained failed their school-based vision \nscreening at a rate 50 percent higher than children who were not \nfailing. Likewise, children who have difficulty hearing often struggle \nwith language development, social processes and communication. This can \nseriously impair all aspects of the educational process. Through these \nprograms, CPS has provided more than 5,000 free eye exams, and 4,000 \nfree pairs of glasses have been dispensed. They currently are \nreimbursed less than 40 percent of the cost of the vision and hearing \nscreenings. To address some of these funding shortfalls, this \nlegislation creates a $10 million grant program for vision and hearing \nscreening.\n  This legislation would also remove barriers that prevent school \nsystems from receiving reimbursement for health screenings are \nservices. Schools that make the extra effort to provide their students \nhealth care services should be adequately reimbursed. For an example, \nwhen they provide Medicaid-eligible children with Medicaid-covered \nservices, they should receive appropriate reimbursement for those \nservices. Likewise, reimbursement for the S-CHIP program should be \navailable for covered services for children enrolled or eligible for \nthe program. and clarifies Medicaid payment rules so that schools can \nbe reimbursed when they provide a Medicaid covered service to a \nMedicaid child.\n  No child should have his or her education threatened by the lack of \neffective screening to diagnose these health problems. The treatments \nor corrective devices are available and we should see to it that the \nchildren receive them when necessary. The Healthy Children Learn Act \nwill help children receive the health care services they need so that \nthey can seize the educational opportunities available to them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dodd, and \n        Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 1007. A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to promote \nbetter nutrition among school children participating in the school \nbreakfast and lunch programs; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today with my \nrespected colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar, a bill designed to \nimprove the health of our Nation's schoolchildren. I am also pleased to \nhave the support of Senators Bingaman, Dodd and Jeffords, who have \nworked with me in past Congresses on this bill. I am hopeful that in \nthe coming weeks many more Senators will join us in this important \neffort.\n  We have an obesity crisis in America. Too many children are gaining \ntoo much weight. Advertisements for soda and candy bombard them from \ntelevision, vending machines, and grocery store aisles. Schools, \nhowever, should be a healthy refuge from the outside world, where kids \ncan learn to make the right choices when it comes to their diets. \nNutrition education needs to be a critical component of every child's \nschool day. But with all of the funds that Congress rightly \nappropriates each year for nutrition education and healthy school \nlunches and meals, our Nation's efforts are severely undermined when \nchildren have to walk through a gauntlet of vending machines offering \nunhealthy choices on the way to the cafeteria.\n  Under current regulations, schools may not offer soda, hard candies \nor other foods of minimal nutritional value in the cafeteria during \nlunch or breakfast. Unfortunately, some private companies have offered \nschools signing bonuses to openly flout this restriction, at times \nlining the halls to the cafeterias with foods that provide absolutely \nno nutritional value. In February 2001, the Washington Post reported \nthat a school in Maryland had signed a contract with a soda company \nthat contained a clause forbidding the school from enforcing the \nFederal ban on soda machines in schools. The clause read ``If the Board \nof Education actively enforces the policy in which vending machines are \nturned off during the school day, the commission guarantee will be \nsuspended.'' In other words, the schools could only get commissions \nfrom the vending machines if they broke the law.\n  We can not sell our children's health to the highest bidder on a \nsodas contract. That is why our bill would give the Secretary of \nAgriculture authority to more effectively restrict the sale of soft \ndrinks and other foods of minimal nutritional value in schools that \nparticipate in the Federal school lunch program. We would give the \nSecretary authority to regulate these foods throughout the school \ngrounds, until the end of the school lunch period. Our bill also \nmandates that the Secretary use the best science available to determine \nwhich foods provide no nutritional value. My bill will ensure that \nstudents are not substituting empty calorie sodas and snacks for their \nnutritious federally subsidized school meals.\n  According to a report issued by the Center for Science and the Public \nInterest, 20 years ago boys consumed more than twice as much milk as \nsoda; now boys and girls drink twice as much soda as milk. This is a \nhuge problem, particularly for girls--the teenage years are critical \nfor building up a woman's lifetime supply of calcium. Girls who \nsubstitute soda for milk are at a greater risk for developing \nosteoporosis later in life. We must provide our kids with better \noptions. I have no problem with vending machines themselves, but let's \nget vending machines that sell fresh milk, fruits and vegetables into \nour schools.\n  Senator Lugar and I have successfully worked together on many \nimportant issues relating to child nutrition and agriculture in the \npast. I am extremely pleased that we can work together again to create \nhealthier schools and healthier children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Better Nutrition for \nSchoolchildren Act of 2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1007\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Better Nutrition for School \n     Children Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FOODS OF MINIMAL NUTRITIONAL VALUE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 10 of the Child Nutrition Act of \n     1966 (42 U.S.C. 1779) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``(throughout the \n     entire school, including the school grounds, until the end of \n     the time of service of food under the school lunch program \n     under the Richard B.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Patrick Leahy in introducing the Better Nutrition \nfor School Children Act of 2003. This bill takes a common sense, \nflexible approach to the sales of food that competes with federally \nsupported school meals, and represents one component of addressing the \noverall health of our Nation's children.\n  This year Congress will address a number of the Federal nutrition \nprograms, including those administered through local school systems. \nOur Nation's schools provide our children with over 28 million \nfederally subsidized meals each day. For some of these children, these \nmeals provide the bulk of their nutrition needs. As a result, the meals \nserved by schools should meet balanced nutrition standards in order to \npromote overall health.\n  Unfortunately, an increasing number of our Nation's children are \nbecoming overweight and obese. Children who are overweight and obese \nare much more likely to have difficulty controlling their weight in the \nfuture, which increases their risk of medical problems such as diabetes \nand heart disease. In order to address this issue, Congress has a duty \nto analyze variables at school that affect a child's health, including \nfoods of minimal nutritional value.\n  In addition to the federally subsidized foods served in our schools, \nmany children have access to and choose to purchase competitive foods \nfrom other sources, such as vending machines. This bill asks the \nSecretary of Agriculture to investigate the sales of foods that are \noutside the Federal meal programs and issue a regulation that balances \nthe schools' interests with that of overall childhood health. In \nparticular, the regulation must take into consideration the financial \nbenefits a school receives from competitive food sales, how likely a \nchild is to make this choice instead of nutritious foods, and the \nnutritional needs of children according to their school grade level. \nThis bill does not require the Secretary to implement any further \nrestrictions than what currently exist.\n  I believe this bill provides a rational approach to one facet of \nimproving the health and fitness of our Nation's children. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in supporting The Better Nutrition for School \nChildren Act of 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5788-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 132--COMMENDING JOHN W.

Res. 133\n\n       Whereas all Americans are united in supporting American men \n     and women who protect our Nation abroad and at home;\n       Whereas thousands of Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh \n     Americans, and South-Asian Americans serve in the military \n     and in law enforcement, working to protect all Americans;\n       Whereas the Arab-American, Muslim-American, Sikh-American, \n     and South-Asian-American communities are vibrant, peaceful, \n     and law-abiding, and have greatly contributed to American \n     society;\n       Whereas Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, \n     and South-Asian Americans, as do all Americans, condemn acts \n     of violence and prejudice;\n       Whereas the United States Senate is concerned by the number \n     of bias-motivated crimes against Arab Americans, Muslim \n     Americans, Sikh Americans, and South-Asian Americans, and \n     other Americans in recent months: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) declares that the civil rights and civil liberties of \n     all Americans, including Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, \n     Sikh Americans, and South-Asian Americans, should be \n     protected;\n       (2) condemns bigotry and acts of violence against any \n     Americans, including Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh \n     Americans, and South-Asian Americans;\n       (3) calls upon local, State, and Federal law enforcement \n     authorities to work to prevent bias-motivated crimes against \n     all Americans, including Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, \n     Sikh Americans, and South-Asian Americans; and\n       (4) calls upon local, State, and Federal law enforcement \n     authorities to investigate and prosecute vigorously all such \n     crimes committed against Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, \n     Sikh Americans, and South-Asian Americans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh \nAmericans, and South-Asian Americans are an important part of America. \nLike other ethnic and religious groups, they and their ancestors came \nto this country seeking political freedom and economic opportunity. \nThey have flourished, making great contributions to our society every \nday. They are\n\n[[Page S5789]]\n\narmed service-members, law enforcement officers, teachers, doctors, \nlawyers, and businesspeople. They are leaders in American society, \nincluding members of Congress and Cabinet members.\n  Tragically, in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, \nsome misguided bigots turned against Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, \nSikh Americans, and South-Asian Americans, singling them out as targets \nfor violence and threats of violence. Hate crimes against these \ncommunities, including violent physical assaults, sharply increased. \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that the number of anti-\nMuslim incidents rose 1600 percent from 2000 to 2001, largely due to \nthis post-9/11 backlash.\n  In response, countless Americans came to the support of Arab \nAmericans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, and South-Asian Americans, \ncondemning the attacks and embracing the affected communities. At that \ntime, I submitted a resolution, which was unanimously approved, \ncondemning bigotry and violence against Sikh Americans.\n  Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, and South-Asian \nAmericans are suffering again, and it is again time to express our \nsupport for them. Since the beginning of the war in Iraq, hate crimes \nagainst these communities have spiked. For example, a man who law \nenforcement believe was motivated by anti-Arab sentiment allegedly shot \nfour people to death in New York City during February and March. \nPresident Bush has declared that major combat operations in Iraq have \nended, but hate crimes against Arab Americans, Muslims, South-Asian \nAmericans, and Sikhs continue. For example, at the University of \nCalifornia Los Angeles, someone recently poured pig's blood on Muslim \nprayer rugs in an interdenominational chapel. The FBI is investigating \nthe incident as a bias-motivated crime.\n  Hate crimes against these communities are wrong and un-American. We \nmust condemn them in the strongest terms, and law enforcement must \ninvestigate and prosecute vigorously the perpetrators.\n  Sadly, Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, and South-\nAsian Americans are also increasingly concerned that the Federal \nGovernment views them with suspicion, and that they are being subjected \nto heightened government scrutiny as a result of their national origin \nor religion. Our counterterrorism efforts must not discriminate on the \nbasis of national origin or religion or violate the civil liberties of \ninnocent Americans. The government's efforts to combat terrorism must \nfocus on criminal or terrorist behavior, not ethnicity or creed.\n  I believe that discriminatory counterterrorism tactics, or those that \nviolate civil liberties, are not only wrong, but they do not make our \ncountry any safer. Our country's history demonstrates that respect for \nindividual rights enhances our stability and security. Singling out a \nlarge group of mostly innocent Arabs, Muslims and South Asians \nsquanders precious law enforcement resources and alienates communities \nwhose cooperation we need. It runs counter to basic principles of \ncommunity policing, which reject the use of racial and ethnic profiles \nand focus on building trust and respect by working cooperatively with \ncommunity members.\n  The resolution I submit today recognizes that Arab Americans, Muslim \nAmericans, Sikh Americans, and South Asian Americans, greatly \ncontribute to American society and serve honorably in the military or \nlaw enforcement, urges respect for civil rights and civil liberties, \ncondemns bias-motivated crimes against members of these communities, \nand calls upon Federal and local law enforcement to prosecute such \ncrimes vigorously. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5789-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 42--WELCOMING THE PRIME MINISTER OF \n SINGAPORE, HIS EXCELLENCY GOH CHOK TONG, ON THE OCCASION OF HIS VISIT \n    TO THE UNITED STATES.

I further ask consent that the only \namendments, other than the committee amendment, be the following: a \nGregg-Kennedy substitute, and a Byrd amendment regarding mandatory \nspending. I further ask consent that there be 2 hours for general \ndebate and 1 hour on each amendment to be equally divided in the usual \nform. I further ask consent that following the disposition of the above \namendments and the use or yielding back of debate time, the bill be \nread a third time, and the Senate then proceed to a vote on passage of \nthe bill, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will object \nto this in just a minute, but I do want to spread across the record of \nthe Senate that Senator Byrd and other Members of the Senate of the \nmajority believe this sets up an entitlement.\n  Senator Byrd believes there should be an annual appropriation for \nthis matter, this should not be an entitlement. As I have indicated, \nthere are people on the other side of the aisle who also acknowledge \nthis is the way things should be done.\n  We hope there can be some agreement. In the interim, until something \nis worked out, I object on behalf of Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I must say, Mr. President, on this side of the aisle \nwe have cleared this request, so there are no longer any problems over \nhere. I know the senior Senator from West Virginia was hoping to work \nout some language on the mandatory spending provision. The chairman and \nthe ranking member, I believe, are prepared to allow a vote on Senator \nByrd's amendment, and that vote has been incorporated into this \nrequest. Therefore, I hope we can get this consent request worked out \nin the next day or so.\n  This bill is absolutely vital in that it provides for biomedical \ncountermeasure research and development. We need to move forward on \nthis bill. We really encourage the other side to understand the \nseriousness of this legislation, the importance of moving it forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5791-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5791-S5792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WELCOMING PRIME MINISTER GOH CHOK TONG\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy that this judge is being \napproved. We are certainly willing to cooperate when we can. I just \nwanted to briefly respond to the comment of the distinguished majority \nwhip that the system is broken and we have had to have cloture votes on \ntwo judges. My math may be off either way, but I think this is the \n123rd judge who will have been approved in a matter of a few seconds: \n123 during this administration; 2 have been, in effect, turned down--\nthere is still debate going on on those two--123 to 2.\n  Statistics show this is the lowest number of vacancies since, I \nbelieve, 1959. I could be wrong. But there are a significant number of \njudges we have approved--as I said, 123.\n  I understand the seriousness of the feelings of people regarding \nMiguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen. But looking at the other side of the \npicture, 123 to 2 is not bad.\n  I withdraw any objection I might have laid on the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have had this debate many times. \nWhat is new is that the filibuster is being used to defeat judicial \nnominations for the first time in history. Cloture has been used \noccasionally for the purpose of advancing a nomination, not for \ndefeating it. We do have two nominees who were found unanimously well \nqualified by the ABA and they are, in effect, being denied an up-or-\ndown vote. If that is what is different, then that is what is producing \nalarm on our side of the aisle. Of course, we have had that debate many \ntimes. Tonight is probably not the time to have it again.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I simply say that having been in the \nmajority and the minority on a number of occasions, what comes around \ngoes around. We have to appreciate the fact that sometimes we control \nthe Senate. Hopefully, not too long from now--but one never knows--we \nwill be back in control. Someday, there will, again, be a Democratic \nPresident. Everybody should understand that what we do here is not for \nthe moment but also for the future.\n  As I have said, we try to be as cooperative as we can. Sometimes we \nare not as cooperative as some wish we would be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/06/senate-section/article/S5792-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
